In the last few years, we&#39;ve had many cases of anti-depression medicines causing suicides and being recalled after a few years of field use.\n \nIn ayurveda, there are three predominant types of people - kapha, pitta and vaata. Various health problems manifest differently in these three types and are treated differently. For example, take depression. A depressed kapha person (predominant elements - earth and water) has dullness and lethargy lurking under the depression. A depressed pitta person (predominant elements - fire and water) has anger and frustration lurking under the depression. A depressed vaata person (predominant elements - air and ether) has anxiety and nervousness lurking under the depression. They are not the same!\n \nIf a clinical study is conducted with mostly vaata people or kapha people, an anti-depressant that aggravates pitta may seem to work. But, when it is used later by pitta people who already have accumulated anger and frustration under the depression, it may aggravate pitta, increase the aggressive streak and make them suicidal. Sadly, modern medicine does not recognize ayurvedic types and does not take them into account when performing controlled experiments, drawing conclusions or dispensing medicines in the field.\n \nScience defines narrow (and solvable!) problems and solves them. Once a solvable problem is set narrowly, science shows a perfect path from the problem to the solution. However, the issue is that real life problems are not like that. So those who apply science have to approximate the problems using a lot of unspoken assumptions, in order to make them solvable and narrow. In the end, the solution may or may not be correct.\n \nIt is my firm conviction that teachings of rishis and Indian yogis (e.g. ayurveda) are far more holistic than the piecemeal offerings of modern science, in the areas of physical, mental and spiritual wellness.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a forum for spirituality and not for modern science. Scientific points may be mentioned on the sidelines, but cannot be beaten to death.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, please remember that science addresses well-defined problems that have a very narrow focus. Unfortunately, complex problems of life can often not be defined in such a narrow manner. As a result, what happens is that scientists honestly and accurately state their narrow conclusions and those who apply that knowledge end up extrapolating a bit. That is why one scientific research may conclude that so and so medicine helps depression and another research may later conclude that the same medicine may make depressed people commit suicide and the medicine may be recalled!\n&gt;\n&gt; Absorption of proteins, as indicated by BV that was discussed here, for example, is just one factor. Absorption of various nutrients, their interplay, their distribution in the system, their impact on metabolism, anabolism and catabolism etc, are not fully understood by modern science. Modern science could only capture a data point here and a data point there, but not the full holistic picture.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition is concerned, because human\n&gt; &gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal products\n&gt; &gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products.\n&gt;\n&gt; The issue is not the ease of digestion. I did not say &quot;foods that are tougher to digest&quot;, but instead used the expression &quot;foods that light up a higher digestive agni&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, cooked carrots with black pepper powder and green chillies light up higher agni than cooked carrots with just some coriander powder (and no other heavier spice) and are easier to digest. The latter is consider more saattwik, because it lights up less agni for its digestion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some other food like softly cooked onions, for example, may be very easy to digest and light up very little agni in stomach, but when nutrients in it are ditributed in the body, they light up a strong agni elsewhere in the body. Agni (fire) is transformative energy and so many transformations of matter are occurring everywhere in the body. For example, production of various enzymes and hormones in the body involves different kinds of agni. Ayurveda enumerates tens of different kinds of agni at the physical level alone. There are all kinds of connections between these agnis and the food we eat.\n&gt;\n&gt; When it comes to food that is just sufficient for survival, conserves internal agni and facilitates faster spiritual development, ayurveda and Indian yogic tradition offer far more holistic theories than modern science can. As I said, modern science captures a data point here and a data point there and not a holistic picture. Of course, people like you may want to study modern science critically in order to prepare themselves for possible debates of future. But it is not a good idea to let it control your thinking. Modern science is not worthy enough.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; .. vegan websites etc .. they merely cherrry pick from researches\n&gt; &gt; That is politics and not science!\n&gt;\n&gt; Science provides data points and people construct a big picture based on those data points based on their agenda. This applies to all.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, in several areas of study, unfortunately science itself is today governed by various political and capitalistic agendas.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the NPR interview I mentioned, I only heard the interview with the researcher on radio. I did not read about it and hence do not know about their publications. The research took gorillas (or perhaps chimpanzees) that were comparable in various ways and did a controlled experiment over a period of time. The explanation in terms of brain development was only a speculation. The only real scientific conclusion of theirs was that eating vegetarian diet over a period of time made them smarter.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body structures have concluded that meat\n&gt; &gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4\n&gt; &gt; million years.\n&gt;\n&gt; I respect fundamental sciences. But, I have limited respect for other speculative and extrapolatory sciences. They seem to take a few points and extrapolate them to create a picture. That is why they are always evolving and changing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Modern scientific understanding of how human life evolved may or may not be perfect. I am not convinced by any of their conclusions.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I say that there were great civilizations 7 million years ago, great kings who ruled earth and people lived orderly lives of happiness and bliss, modern science will disagree. Mainly because they do not have evidence. But I see no evidence to the contrary either.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This cannot be done consciously, but only by the work of natural forces.\n&gt; &gt; What is your take on this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Natural forces facilitate both suric and asuric (divine and demonic) forces that are constantly pulling the universe in different directions. Nature favors demonic forces at times and divine forces at times, but divine forces in the long run. Great demons ruled earth for thousands of years in the past. When demonic thoughts were prevalent, no rishi or god who came to earth said, &quot;this is the work of natural forces and so it must be good&quot;. Instead, they fought it and changed things. The predominant thinking of this age that vegetarianism is &quot;unnatural&quot; and inefficient, to me, indicates a temporary domination of asuric thought. It needs to be defeated by hook or crook.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned. Let me clarify. (I am only dealing with\n&gt; &gt; the science part of these discussions, as I had already maintained right at the\n&gt; &gt; beginning).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several\n&gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was\n&gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several\n&gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones\n&gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you have any references for this, in terms of whether they published any\n&gt; &gt; paper on the same, I am interested to know and analyse that in details. I am\n&gt; &gt; open to learning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine evidence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with\n&gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of brain.\n&gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a\n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition is concerned, because human\n&gt; &gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal products\n&gt; &gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products. In my other mail, I have\n&gt; &gt; qoted from a couple of research papers and books on clinical nutrition and\n&gt; &gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may take a few days since I\n&gt; &gt; have to get them from people who deal with these topics professionally, but time\n&gt; &gt; is not a problem. All the papers are from the most accepted and reputed\n&gt; &gt; scientific journals. There is no confusion. Which is why I said, it is myth\n&gt; &gt; that vegeterian foods are easier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Further, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any more\n&gt; &gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs.\n&gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor\n&gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; An animal has a specific physical structure and needs to maintain the same. But\n&gt; &gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen people feeding\n&gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body\n&gt; &gt; structure is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of\n&gt; &gt; survival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to disease and\n&gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness that may result\n&gt; &gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances\n&gt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one\n&gt; &gt; susceptible to cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my personal\n&gt; &gt; opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best\n&gt; &gt; way possible, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _______________\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A question for you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body structures have concluded that meat\n&gt; &gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4\n&gt; &gt; million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, the structure of the\n&gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a developed caecum), and the threefold increase in brain\n&gt; &gt; size (from archeological evidences) could never have been what it is today.\n&gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has been a natural process, so ingrained that it\n&gt; &gt; has changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be done\n&gt; &gt; consciously, but only by the work of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will\n&gt; &gt; provide relevent research papers to prove my claim).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What is your take on this?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Food we eat\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There has been a lot of discussion on food. A few quick comments.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our body and their\n&gt; &gt; interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound\n&gt; &gt; impact on us.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (2) Much has been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that\n&gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with the\n&gt; &gt; physical body entails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their physical\n&gt; &gt; body is much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much\n&gt; &gt; smaller.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Especially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by\n&gt; &gt; corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their\n&gt; &gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several\n&gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was\n&gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several\n&gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones\n&gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with\n&gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of brain.\n&gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a\n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well\n&gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestive process\n&gt; &gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much\n&gt; &gt; agni available for other activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that\n&gt; &gt; happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also\n&gt; &gt; requires agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after\n&gt; &gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before\n&gt; &gt; eating.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food\n&gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more\n&gt; &gt; frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni\n&gt; &gt; available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If\n&gt; &gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple\n&gt; &gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits),\n&gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is available for\n&gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may\n&gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough\n&gt; &gt; to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent\n&gt; &gt; vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed\n&gt; &gt; in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all\n&gt; &gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting\n&gt; &gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik\n&gt; &gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle\n&gt; &gt; to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ignore\n&gt; &gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that\n&gt; &gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs.\n&gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor\n&gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough\n&gt; &gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material\n&gt; &gt; world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is\n&gt; &gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is\n&gt; &gt; better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more important for\n&gt; &gt; transformation and success, than occasional practices.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food\n&gt; &gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how\n&gt; &gt; deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally\n&gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
