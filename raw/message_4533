(composed by\n=\r\nBhagavan,employing the ideas of two verses found in the Prabhulinga Leela,\n=\r\nv. 45, 46, Kannada)\n\n21. When Rama asked, =E2=80=98Which is the great mirro=\r\nr in which we see these images\nof things? What is it that is called the Hea=\r\nrt of all the beings in the\nworld?=E2=80=99 Vasishta answered, =E2=80=98Whe=\r\nn we reflect we see that all the beings in\nthe world have two different hea=\r\nrts.=E2=80=99 (Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 78 - v. 32, 33)\n\n22. One of these is wort=\r\nh acceptance, the other worth rejection. Listen how\nthey differ. The organ =\r\ncalled the heart placed somewhere in the chest of the\nphysical body is wort=\r\nh rejection. The Heart which is of the form of Pure\nAwareness is worth acce=\r\nptance; it is both within and without =E2=80=94 it has no\ninside or out. (Y=\r\noga Vasishta, 5 - 78 - v. 34, 35)\n\n23. That indeed is the essential Heart a=\r\nnd in it all this world abides. It\nis the mirror in which all things are se=\r\nen. It is the source of all wealth.\nHence Awareness may be termed the Heart=\r\n of all beings. The Heart is not a\npart of the perishable body inert like a=\r\n stone. (Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 78 - 36,\n37)\n\n24. Therefore by the practice of =\r\nmerging the ego in the pure Heart which is\nall-Awareness, the tendencies of=\r\n the mind as well as the breath will be\nsubdued. (Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 78 - v=\r\n. 38)\n\n25. By constantly meditating in the Heart, =E2=80=98That pure uncond=\r\nitioned\nAwareness that is Siva, That am I,=E2=80=99 remove all attachment o=\r\nf the ego.\n(Devikalottara, v. 47)\n\n26. Having investigated the various stat=\r\nes of being, and seizing firmly by\nthe mind that State of Supreme Reality, =\r\nplay your part, O hero, ever in the\nworld. You have known the Truth which i=\r\ns at the Heart of all kinds of\nappearances. Without ever turning away from =\r\nthat Reality, play in the world,\nO hero,as if in love with it. (Yoga Vasish=\r\nta, 5 - 18 - v. 20 to 23)\n\n27. Seeming to have enthusiasm and delight, seem=\r\ning to have excitement and\naversion, seeming to exercise initiative and per=\r\nseverance, and yet without\nattachment, play, O hero,in the world. Released =\r\nfrom all bonds of attachment\nand with equanimity of mind, acting outwardly =\r\nin all situations in\naccordance with the part you have assumed, play as you=\r\n please,O hero, in the\nworld. (Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 18 - v. 24 to 26)\n\n28. He=\r\n who by Knowledge of the Atman is established in the Truth, he who has\nvanq=\r\nuished the five senses =E2=80=94 call him the fire of knowledge, the wielde=\r\nr of\nthe thunderbolt of Knowledge, the Conqueror of Time and the Hero who h=\r\nas\nslain death. (a verse from the Yoga Vasishta)\n\n29. Just as on the earth =\r\nwith the coming of spring the tree shines in fresh\nbeauty of foliage, even =\r\nso he who has seen the Truth will shine with growing\nlustre, intelligence a=\r\nnd power.(Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 76 - v. 20)\n\n30. Like one to whom a tale is to=\r\nld while his thoughts are wandering far\naway, the mind which is free from a=\r\nttachment is inactive while it acts. But\nthe mind immersed in attachments i=\r\ns active, though it does not act, like the\nsleeper lying motionless\nhere, w=\r\nho in his dream climbs a hill and tumbles down. (Yoga Vasishta, 5 -\n56 - v.=\r\n 13, 14)\n\n31. As the movement of the cart, its standing still and its being=\r\n unyoked\nare to the passenger asleep in the cart, even so are action, conte=\r\nmplation\nand sleep to the Sage asleep in the cart of his body.\n\n32. For one=\r\n who seeks waking, dreaming or sleep there is a state beyond\nthese three, a=\r\n wakeful sleep, a fourth state called the turiya. But because\nthis turiya s=\r\ntate alone is real and the three apparent states are illusory,\nthe =E2=80=\r\n=98fourth=E2=80=99 state is indeed the transcendental state.\n\n33. The state=\r\nment that the jnani retains prarabdha while free from sanchita\nand agami is=\r\n only a formal answer to the questions of the ignorant. Of\nseveral wives no=\r\nne escapes widowhood when the husband dies; even so, when\nthe doer goes, al=\r\nl three karmas vanish.\n\n34. For unlearned folk there is only one family con=\r\nsisting of wife, children\nand dependants. But in the mind of those with muc=\r\nh learning there are many\nfamilies of books, theories and opinions as obsta=\r\ncles to yoga. (Subhashita\nRatna Bhandagara, Prakarana VI, Shanta Rasa Nirde=\r\nsha, v. 13)\n\n35. What is the use of letters to those lettered folk who do n=\r\not seek to\nwipe out the letters of fate by inquiring, =E2=80=98Whence are w=\r\ne born?=E2=80=99 What else\nare they but gramaphones, O Lord of Arunachala? =\r\nThey learn and repeat words\nwithout realizing\ntheir meaning.\n\n36. The unlet=\r\ntered are easier saved than those who are learned but\nunsubdued. The unlett=\r\nered are free from the clutches of the demon Pride,\nthey are free from the =\r\nmalady of many whirling thoughts and words; they are\nfree from the mad purs=\r\nuit of wealth; they are free from many, many ills.\n\n37. Though a man looks =\r\non the world as a wisp of straw and holds all sacred\nlore in his hand, it i=\r\ns hard for him to escape from thralldom if he has\nyielded to vile Flattery,=\r\nthe harlot. (from Sadhaka Avasta, by Sri Sadasiva\nBrahmendra)\n\n38. Without =\r\nthinking of oneself as apart from others,without swerving from\none=E2=80=99=\r\ns true state, if one abides always in one=E2=80=99s Self, who is there alie=\r\nn to\none? What matters it\nwhat people say of one? What matters it if one pr=\r\naises or blames oneself?\n\n39. Keep advaita within the Heart. Do not ever ca=\r\nrry it into action. Even if\nyou apply it to all the three worlds, O Son, it=\r\n is not to be applied to the\nGuru. (Tattvopadesa, v. 87,by Shankaracharya)\n=\r\n\n40. I shall declare truly the essence of the final doctrine of the\nVedanta=\r\n: when\nthe ego dies and becomes That, the Self of Pure Awareness, That alon=\r\ne\nabides.\n\n(Translated by Prof. K.
