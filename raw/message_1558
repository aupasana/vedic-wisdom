But, after wards the question was lingering:\n1. While doing this, I hav=\r\ne invariably moved the siva lingam in to which I have invited Siva. Is this=\r\n a sin (this is like asking some one to sit in a sofa and then dragging the=\r\n sofa around while the person is sitting in it)\n\n2. I used the water used f=\r\nor abhishekam again for abhishekam. Is this okay?\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n\n\n"}}
