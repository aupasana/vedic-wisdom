It was said of me in=\r\n America that I was a man who came out of a land that had been dead and bur=\r\nied for five thousand years, and talked of renunciation. So says perhaps th=\r\ne English philosopher. Yet it is true that that is the only path to religio=\r\nn. Renounce and give up. What did Christ say? &#39;He that loseth his life for =\r\nmy sake shall find it.&#39; Again and again did he preach renunciation as the o=\r\nnly way to perfection.\n\n\n"}}
