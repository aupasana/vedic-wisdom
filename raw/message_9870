Everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; I just thought of adding some clarifications.\n&gt;\n&gt; First of all, when I mentioned about the utility of techniques of\n&gt; &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; for handling the problem of\n&gt; spirit attachments as well as many other problems for which we do not have\n&gt; reasonable explanation, my assertions were limited to the utility part only\n&gt; and not beyond that. I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or\n&gt; not, in fact I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I\n&gt; believe, any knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The\n&gt; Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the\n&gt; term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still continue with\n&gt; life irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. Though\n&gt; we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but it is\n&gt; the other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises in the east&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;Sun sets in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with\n&gt; activities which helps in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I&#39;d\n&gt; mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; One should not comment about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at\n&gt; the shore. Life is full of infinite possibilities. When we say that the God\n&gt; is infinite, we just can not say that the universe can behave in any\n&gt; particular limited ways. Before anyone comments about the utility of any\n&gt; branch of knowledge one must first take a sincere dip into the same. By\n&gt; saying so, I do not mean to say that if one really takes a sincere dip into\n&gt; any subject one would definitely be convinced about the same. By saying\n&gt; that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean\n&gt; to say that by doing so one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic,\n&gt; narrow. Not only blind belief in religion and religious practices can be\n&gt; termed as dogmatic but also in science if one loses the scientific temper.\n&gt;\n&gt; Proof of pudding is in eating it, all that I can say to the persons\n&gt; willing to address any of their problems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life\n&gt; Regression&quot; have immense utility for those who are desirous of addressing\n&gt; their problems with an open mind. Those who are interested can read &quot; Many\n&gt; Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss&quot; to start with.\n&gt;\n&gt; To respected Narasimha sir, I would like to inform that these are not &quot;new\n&gt; age ideas&quot;. These were there much before in India. to cite concept of\n&gt; &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; of Jainism is one among them. Jainas used this technique of\n&gt; &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; to reinforce renunciation in the followers.\n&gt;\n&gt; To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that so far as my knowledge goes\n&gt; Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over phone, but however, there\n&gt; are so many problems which can be handled even over phone. To cite one\n&gt; example - One girl was having one recurrent bad horrifying dream for past\n&gt; 4/5 years and she approached me for the treatment. But due to my official\n&gt; engagements I was camping at a far off place for around 2 months. Her\n&gt; problem was getting worsened as it had  started affecting her professional\n&gt; career adversely. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a\n&gt; session over phone. The phone session continued for around one and half an\n&gt; hour and she got relieved from her that recurrent dream and also started\n&gt; improving her professional life. Since that day the dream has not yet\n&gt; visited her again.\n&gt;\n&gt; It all depends on the openness of the mind, the strength of the desire to\n&gt; overcome etc. The universe is much more than what we see,what we can see\n&gt; and what we can believe to see.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   On Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;\n&gt; rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; To add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understanding of\n&gt; the reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems.\n&gt; Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific\n&gt; moments from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external\n&gt; consciousness. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was\n&gt; any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it\n&gt; cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all\n&gt; get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in\n&gt; Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah. Therefore their idea of\n&gt; reincarnation is very different. It is like an energy stream made up of\n&gt; mind, body that coalesces together to give the impression of an individual\n&gt; being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the greater\n&gt; flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation at\n&gt; a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a different point\n&gt; can coalesce into a different part.   Hence it is possible for a Lama, in\n&gt; their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy\n&gt; reincarnate into one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into\n&gt; another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech\n&gt; incarnating in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another\n&gt; person, or his energy of body incarnating in another person and all these\n&gt; happening simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked\n&gt; at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a\n&gt; supreme law of debts/balances - rna. Hence rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are\n&gt; replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the\n&gt; illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There\n&gt; is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards\n&gt; strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.\n&gt;\n&gt; But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not\n&gt; dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life\n&gt; to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop\n&gt; this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human\n&gt; mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual\n&gt; and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth\n&gt; finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle\n&gt; and enjoy a Divine Life.  A Supreme Negation of life is not the ultimate\n&gt; aim, it is only one among many possibilities.  If  moving into a state of\n&gt; complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then\n&gt; there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex\n&gt; life-actions. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to\n&gt; only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of\n&gt; rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the soul\n&gt; to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes the\n&gt; karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and\n&gt; real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed\n&gt; hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not\n&gt; have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of\n&gt; those he had killed]. Whereas those aspects of life where the soul has no\n&gt; play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by the law of rnabandhanas -\n&gt; a mechanical give and take of energy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now since the soul is what remembers and everything else being perishable,\n&gt; the only indestructible link between past life and present life, it is only\n&gt; the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete cinematic\n&gt; biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there have been lives\n&gt; when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all, then those are\n&gt; dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. For Nature, those\n&gt; lives serve no purpose at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Moreover all these are possible ONLY if and when an individual starts\n&gt; living in and through the soul in a very very strong manner. That is not\n&gt; easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; **\n&gt; *I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit\n&gt; ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a\n&gt; hunter through them all. -Sri Aurobindo*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   On Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;\n&gt; pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; I know those who are excited by these new age ideas like &quot;past life\n&gt; regression&quot; will be badly upset with honest views, but let me state my view.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is possible to remember past life. However, if such memory does not\n&gt; come at a very young age due to some deep desires from past life or an\n&gt; unnatural death before, it is not easy to get it later. Even for a great\n&gt; yogi with tremendous self-control, calming the mind down to suppress\n&gt; current conditioning sufficiently to remember past life is not easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, at least 3 saints/yogis of a high spiritual caliber claimed\n&gt; to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. If such saints cannot\n&gt; accurately know their own past life, anybody thinking that someone else can\n&gt; make one aware of one&#39;s past life is just kidding oneself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Remembering past life or making someone else do so, is not at all easy. In\n&gt; comparison, hallucinating that one remembered past life or making someone\n&gt; else hallucinate that one remembered past life, is certainly very easy! In\n&gt; fact, I suspect that is what happens in most past life regressions..\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a deep reason why Nature has built this mechanism of forgetting a\n&gt; life when another life starts. Otherwise, this game will end very\n&gt; quickly. This forgetfulness prolongs the game very much and makes it far\n&gt; more interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt; --------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    *From:* Phil Stinnet &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Friday, October 25, 2013 9:16 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: RE: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from\n&gt; spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Did you get your PLR (Past Life Regression)?

I found a very mature and realistic\n&gt; treatment of ghosts, paranormal beings and black magic.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.veda.harekrsna.cz/encyclopedia/ghosts_FAQ.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; The summary of the FAQ is:\n&gt;\n&gt;   - There are number of mantra&#39;s suggested. One of them is the Nursimha\n&gt; beeja mantra\n&gt;       om hrim kshraum ugram viram Maha-Vishnum jvalantam sarvatho mukham\n&gt;       Nrisimham bhishanam bhadram mrityu-mrityum namamy aham\n&gt;   - Playing Bhagvatgita in Sanskrit, keeping a Bhagvat Gita book in room\n&gt; helps\n&gt;   - Doing some punya karya - e.g. chant Bhagvat Gita and donate the result\n&gt; to the ghost, so that it has enough punya to move on. This should be\n&gt; preferably done by the immediate family members.\n&gt;\n&gt; It also suggests contacting the following for help. The extract from the\n&gt; FAQ is: &quot;There&#39;re many types of exorcism. It&#39;s officially performed e.g.\n&gt; by Roman-Catholic Church. It&#39;s also done in Orthodox Church. The simplest\n&gt; Catholic exorcism is a so-called release/liberation prayer which helps in\n&gt; easier cases. Every priest knows it. When it fails, a professional exorcist\n&gt; has to be approached. Catholic exorcists are experienced and provide their\n&gt; services free of charge. Every diocese has one and a local priest should be\n&gt; able to provide contact.&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; On a personal note, my maternal grandmother was very attached to my mom\n&gt; and me. After death she used to possess my mother regularly and\n&gt; occasionally me. She finally moved on after my parents, me and my younger\n&gt; brother did Pitrudosha & Kalasarpa Dosha removal poojas at Trimbakeshwar.\n&gt;\n&gt; Srinivas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ---In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasmha Rao ji,\n&gt; I dis send a.private email to u about this.

But they may or may\n&gt; not work. If Tendulkar or Dhoni tells you how you can play a good shot on a\n&gt; particular kind of ball, you may not be able to play that shot right away.\n&gt; Even if it is an easy shot, it may take a lot of practice for you to get it\n&gt; right.

Hanuman, Bhairava,\n&gt; Chandi, Narasimha - so many deities can be worshipped for this purpose.\n&gt; However, fixing it after it reaches a crisis point requires someone who has\n&gt; enough shakti and knows how to direct it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some replies referred to saints/swamis who are very pure/elevated etc.\n&gt; Even if one is pure or elevated, one may not necessarily be able to help.\n&gt; This really requires some shakti and the ability to direct it for this\n&gt; specific task.\n&gt;\n&gt; Though I live in the area, I am not capable of doing anything personally.\n&gt; However, if anybody in troubles like this is interested and visits me, I\n&gt; can give some ash from my daily homam of divine Mother. They can apply it\n&gt; on the forehead of the person everyday. Of course, I don&#39;t know if it will\n&gt; help in any way.\n&gt;\n&gt; If interested, please send a private email to pvr108@....\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt; --------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    *From:* &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Sent:* Saturday, August 10, 2013 5:51 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at\n&gt; nighttime)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thank you very much Rajarshi.

I am sure there too one can find\n&gt; good exorcists, maybe not of our religion.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have very little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact\n&gt; unfortunately have never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered\n&gt; to be of excellent potency for these kind of problems. This form of\n&gt; Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures\n&gt; He is also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika.\n&gt; References to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some\n&gt; versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been invoked for\n&gt; centuries by followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against\n&gt; spirits, and specially during rituals of cremation ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this mantra too, all\n&gt; are good):\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting.\n&gt; And this should be continued daily till such time that there is some\n&gt; visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine\n&gt; instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite\n&gt; impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days\n&gt; almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession\n&gt; from a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the\n&gt; one trying to help. So close family members, who live with the girl will\n&gt; have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by\n&gt; Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I\n&gt; guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if\n&gt; possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka\n&gt; Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating\n&gt; the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of\n&gt; Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence.\n&gt; They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and\n&gt; the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside\n&gt; the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually\n&gt; benefited. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I\n&gt; just wrote what came to my mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; **\n&gt; *I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit\n&gt; ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a\n&gt; hunter through them all. -Sri Aurobindo*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;    *From:* &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Sent:* Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at\n&gt; nighttime)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Namaste.

The diagnosis of 2 independent remote healers in India who came to\n&gt; the same conclusion,using that this was a case of possession.  But none of\n&gt; the two have been able to do anything about it so far. They both say that\n&gt; this is an entity that keeps revisiting the little girl.\n&gt;\n&gt; The doctors themselves are treating this as psychiatric case. Don&#39;t know\n&gt; what is true and what is not as no one has been able to help including the\n&gt; doctors.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you know of any particular Kali, Bhairav or Panchmukhi Hanuman mantra\n&gt; which they could recite?

For there are various classes and kinds and types of entities which\n&gt; can possess an individual and some of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Upayas are many. As so many different people have advised, these all\n&gt; sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of them will\n&gt; actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors.\n&gt; Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind\n&gt; of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link for\n&gt; the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of\n&gt; exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can\n&gt; be something as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside),\n&gt; or causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to such\n&gt; possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where\n&gt; such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC\n&gt; ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of\n&gt; removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the\n&gt; spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to\n&gt; generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent\n&gt; and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it\n&gt; is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;\n&gt; These things like removing possession are specializations. These do not\n&gt; fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is\n&gt; getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to\n&gt; stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to\n&gt; handle the same too. Again if a spirit is removed by force before the time\n&gt; till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of\n&gt; the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve\n&gt; some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the\n&gt; spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some years ago who was an\n&gt; expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask his\n&gt; Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame for which the\n&gt; spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmic link between the\n&gt; spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the\n&gt; spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promising good deeds for the\n&gt; spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would\n&gt; work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to\n&gt; be applied.]\n&gt;\n&gt; Best thing to do is a) find someone who knows exactly how to deal with\n&gt; spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not\n&gt; possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity -\n&gt; preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC\n&gt; (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force\n&gt; and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may\n&gt; not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend\n&gt; 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental\n&gt; belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. While\n&gt; doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either\n&gt; make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her.\n&gt; And pray as hard as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best of luck and may God help the family.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; **\n&gt; *I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit\n&gt; ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a\n&gt; hunter through them all. -Sri Aurobindo*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;    *From:* Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at\n&gt; nighttime)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.

I had trouble\n&gt; falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises - creaking and\n&gt; something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different energies - I\n&gt; don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rather evil is\n&gt; present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I would make up because\n&gt; of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but once I\n&gt; started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a\n&gt; terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some\n&gt; steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fully\n&gt; aware and I can move my body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There\n&gt; were a few more people staying at that place and everybody had severe\n&gt; problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before going to\n&gt; sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep properly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at home,\n&gt; feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in\n&gt; height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of the\n&gt; strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral\n&gt; beings at night? Something that I can chant before going to sleep. This has\n&gt; been bothering me for some time now and it interferes with my life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--001a11c264a498a1a004e9d1118d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt;=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;Most of the past life=\r\n regression therapies ... are just gimmics and/or hallucinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Doesn&#39;t all sadhana belong in the same bucket?

I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or not, in fact=\r\n I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, any k=\r\nnowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half knowle=\r\ndge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in our this e=\r\nmpirical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of the fact =\r\nof having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that the Sun d=\r\noes not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, still we u=\r\nse sentences like &quot;Sun rises=A0in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun=A0sets=A0i=\r\nn the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with activi=\r\nties which helps in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I&#39;d m=\r\nentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot=\r\n;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;One should not comme=\r\nnt about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is ful=\r\nl of infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just =\r\ncan not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited ways. Be=\r\nfore anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=A0mus=\r\nt first take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to sa=\r\ny that if=A0one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one would defin=\r\nitely be convinced about the same.=A0By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make =\r\ncomments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=A0by doing so=\r\n one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=A0blind be=\r\nlief in religion and religious practices=A0can be termed as dogmatic but al=\r\nso in\n science if one loses the scientific temper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proof of pudding is in eating it, all that I can =\r\nsay to the persons willing to address any of their problems. &quot;Hypnothe=\r\nrapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for=A0=\r\nthose who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind.

To cite one example - One girl =\r\nwas having=A0one recurrent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she=\r\n=A0approached me for the treatment.=A0But due to my=A0official engagements =\r\nI was camping at a far off place for around 2 months.=A0Her problem was get=\r\nting worsened as it=A0had=A0 started affecting her professional career adve=\r\nrsely. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over p=\r\nhone. The phone session continued for around one and half an hour and she g=\r\not relieved from her that recurrent dream\n and also started improving her\n =\r\nprofessional life. Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;It all depends on the ope=\r\nnness of the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. The universe=\r\n is much more than what we see,what we can see and what we can believe to s=\r\nee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt; &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt; &lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;font-family:HelveticaNeue,&#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;,Helvetica,A=\r\nrial,&#39;Lucida Grande&#39;,sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;\n\n &lt;div style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-family:HelveticaNeue,&#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;,Helvetica,Arial,&#39;Lucid=\r\na Grande&#39;,sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font=\r\n face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; On Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;=\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@yaho=\r\no.co.in&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;,&#39;new york&#39=\r\n;,times,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste,&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;To =\r\nadd to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understanding of the re=\r\nincarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems. Reincarnation=\r\n is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments from past =\r\nlives when the soul had a role to play on the external consciousness. Which=\r\n means if one has lived a life where there never was any opportunity for th=\r\ne soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For d=\r\neath is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set =\r\nis generated based on need.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The Budd=\r\nhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - w=\r\nhich is similar to our idea of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnati=\r\non\n is very different. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body th=\r\nat coalesces together\n to give the impression of an individual being, which=\r\n upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the greater flow of energ=\r\ny. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation at a later date=\r\n, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a different point can coalesc=\r\ne into a different part. =A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doct=\r\nrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate int=\r\no one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into another body *=\r\nsimultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in o=\r\nne person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his e=\r\nnergy of body incarnating in another person and all these happening simulta=\r\nneously! It fits with their philosophy.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;no=\r\nne&quot;&gt;Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looke=\r\nd at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supr=\r\neme law of\n debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are r=\r\neplete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illus=\r\nion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is not=\r\nhing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards stric=\r\nt and formal renunciation of life and its processes.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul =\r\n- that is not dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward=\r\n from one life to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assis=\r\nt and develop this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and=\r\n uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that t=\r\nhis individual and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in som=\r\ne birth finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual human ve=\r\nhicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A Supreme Negation of =\r\nlife is \nnot the ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.=A0 =\r\nIf=A0 moving into a state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the f=\r\ninal and inevitable aim,\n then there was just no need for Avataras to desce=\r\nnd and perform complex\n life-actions. &lt;/span&gt;The law of Karma is here too, =\r\nbut it is not restricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in t=\r\nhe case of the idea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an actio=\r\nn is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, =\r\nthen it changes the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, comp=\r\nlex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit w=\r\nho must have killed hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi V=\r\nalmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed=\r\n in the hands of those he had killed]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whereas those aspects o=\r\nf life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed=\r\n by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. &lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:16px;background-color:tran=\r\nsparent;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;,&#39;new york&#39;,times,seri=\r\nf&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;=\r\nfont-size:16px;background-color:transparent;font-family:&#39;times new roma=\r\nn&#39;,&#39;new york&#39;,times,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now since the soul is what rem=\r\nembers and everything else being perishable, the only indestructible link b=\r\netween past life and present life, it is only the soul-moments which will b=\r\ne recalled, and never a complete cinematic biography recollection. That is =\r\nfantasizing. Now if there have been lives when the soul had little or no fr=\r\nontal role to play at all, then those are dead and gone and buried six feet=\r\n under with no trace.\n For Nature, those lives\n serve no purpose at all. &lt;b=\r\nr clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:16p=\r\nx;background-color:transparent;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;,&#39;n=\r\new york&#39;,times,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:16px;background-color:transparent;font-fam=\r\nily:&#39;times new roman&#39;,&#39;new york&#39;,times,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moreove=\r\nr all these are possible ONLY if and when an individual starts living in an=\r\nd through the soul in a very very strong manner.
