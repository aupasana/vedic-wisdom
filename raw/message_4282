I finished one point in=\r\n this version.\n------------------------------------\nNamaste friends,\n \nNice=\r\n writeup. As long as one remains in duality, there is always a chance of be=\r\ning deluded. However, with due respect, I wish to make a *critical* note wi=\r\nth my 2 cents on various realted and unrelated issues. Please allow me.\n \n&gt;=\r\n  Because of the ignorance of the mind experiencing a sense of difference\n&gt;=\r\n [bheda-buddhi] in Self, [even] great devas are disturbed by fear.\n&gt; [There=\r\nfore] it is wise to remain without fear in the supreme state of\n&gt; non-duali=\r\nty, having attained the reality, one=E2=80=99s own Self, through negation\n&gt;=\r\n [of the non-Self].\n \nIt is certainly wise to &quot;remain without fear in the s=\r\nupreme state of non-duality&quot;. However, as you pointed out, &quot;[even] great de=\r\nvas are disturbed by fear&quot;. Then how easy can it be for other beings, inclu=\r\nding members of this list, to &quot;remain without fear in the supreme state of =\r\nnon-duality&quot;?\n \nPlease don&#39;t get me wrong. I am not against adwaita or non-=\r\nduality at all, as those familiar with my writings should know by now. But =\r\nI accept the fact that a huge majority of spiritual seekers are meant to re=\r\nmain in duality for many many more lives. A message other than &quot;attain the =\r\nsupreme state of non-duality&quot; may be more useful to them at their current s=\r\ntage!\n \n*        *        *\n \nA great cricket batsman may not make the grea=\r\ntest coach. Hitting the ball may seem so easy to him and he may simply say,=\r\n &quot;look at the ball and hit it.&quot; That much instruction is certainly not enou=\r\ngh for a budding player to start playing like that great player.\n \nAnother =\r\ngifted coach may observe faults in the technique of the budding player and =\r\ngive some tips. That may turn out to be more useful than the inspiring word=\r\ns from the great player! Of course, no matter how good instructions one get=\r\ns, the budding player may not play like that great player anytime soon! Nev=\r\nertheless, his goal should be to keep improving!\n \n*        *        *\n \nSo=\r\nme great teachers, especially of the Adwaita philosophy, are like the great=\r\n cricket batsman in the above analogy. They tell you what is obvious and na=\r\ntural to *them*. Their words are very inspiring.\n \nSome other teachers fine=\r\n-tune their message for an audience. They show a real path (instead of a lo=\r\nfty target) using which one can start making progress. One may or may not r=\r\neach a supreme state anytime soon, but one will start making progress.\n \n* =\r\n       *        *\n \nDifferent spiritual teachers come for different purpose=\r\ns. The role played by each one is important in its own right. Ramana mahars=\r\nhi was undoubtedly a great master. However, when it comes to the second cat=\r\negory of teachers I mentioned above, one name that strikes to me instantly =\r\nis that of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He was a master at fine-tuning his mess=\r\nage for the individual. While most great masters were adepts in one path (j=\r\nnaana yoga or bhakti yoga or karma yoga or raja yoga), he was unique in tha=\r\nt he experienced the supreme through each path and was equally comfortable =\r\nguiding people in jnaana, vedanta, Raama bhakti, Krishna bhakti, Kaali bhak=\r\nti, Shiva bhakti, karma yoga, service, hatha yoga, tantra etc, having exper=\r\nienced all. He even did smashana sadhanas, Islamic sadhanas and experienced=\r\n Jesus Christ. He is a unique teacher in the last few millennia. Many other=\r\n masters take disciples on the path they walked. Having walked all paths to=\r\n the summit, Ramakrishna guided disciples on different paths based on their=\r\n aptitude.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThough upanishads and Bhagavad Gita are =\r\nteaching Adwaita clearly, some great masters came in the last few millennia=\r\n who taught variations in the Upanishadic philosophy veering towards dualit=\r\ny to various degrees. I think this happened for a purpose. As true Adwaita =\r\nas taught by Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita becomes more and more inappropria=\r\nte and difficult for the masses, a simpler message that they can understand=\r\n and that can guide their spiritual lives is needed. I think the coming of =\r\nvarious masters who taught different philosophies is for that reason.\n \n*  =\r\n      *        *\n \nThe title of the mail was &quot;Fearlessness Comes In The Sup=\r\nreme State Of Non-duality&quot;. However, the question is: Does non-duality brin=\r\ng fearlessness or vice versa?\n \nA realization of non-dual Self may suddenly=\r\n happen oneday for some rare persons. For most, it happens as a result of s=\r\nadhana done over many years/lives. Thus, qualities like dispassion, fearles=\r\nsness (which are associated with the supreme state) need to be cultivated a=\r\nctively. As they become more and more perfected, one gets closer and closer=\r\n to Self-realization.\n \nSuppose one sees a beautiful/ugly object (or a desi=\r\nrable/undesirable object). When one feels attraction/aversion, one should r=\r\nemind oneself &quot;all is god (Self). There is no need for feeling attraction/a=\r\nversion towards anything.&quot; When one feels fear, one should remind oneself &quot;=\r\nall is god (Self). There is no need for be afraid of *anything*&quot;. As one pr=\r\nactices this, one&#39;s dispassion and fearlessness increase. Incidents of delu=\r\nsion becomes smaller and less frequent. Eventually, one overcomes.\n \nBut th=\r\ne tricky part is that one needs to perform the actions one is meant to perf=\r\norm and work out the kaarmik debts, before one realizes Self. It is very di=\r\nfficult to perform actions without feeling even small amounts of attachment=\r\n, attraction, aversion, passion, fear etc.\n \nA simple formula is: Give all =\r\nyou can and expect nothing (and accept whatever you get) in return. In the =\r\nbeginning, any attraction/aversion/anxiety/fear you feel should be with reg=\r\nard to what are giving to others and not with regard to what you are expect=\r\ning from others.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIt is all easy to write and read t=\r\nheory. The problem comes when one is tested in real life. For example, I ch=\r\noked when eating something once when I was alone and could not breathe. I b=\r\necame anxious and it made it worse. Suddenly, the thought came to me &quot;what =\r\nare you afraid of? Death? This will mostly result in a little suffering for=\r\n a couple of minutes and no more. EVEN IF it results in death, what is the =\r\nbig deal? Jaatasya dhruvam mrityuh (each being who is born is sure of deatt=\r\nh). Is there anything I wanted to do and could not do? Well, there may be, =\r\nbut someone else can do it. Why should only Narasimha do it? World will run=\r\n perfectly fine even if I am not here. If I indeed die now, why don&#39;t I med=\r\nitate and focus my mind on god, instead of focusing on my life and getting =\r\nanxious?&quot; I relaxed and meditated for a few minutes with Gayatri mantra. My=\r\n anxiety went away and I felt nice after a while.\n \nAs one detects and acti=\r\nvely suppresses undesirable thoughts more and more, such thoughts will beco=\r\nme less and less frequent and eventually be suppressed by the mind even in =\r\nthe seed/formatory state. Later, causes of those seeds themselves will be w=\r\niped out from the sub-conscious mind. This is how conditioning of the mind =\r\nis slowly overcome. It is certainly a long process for most of us, but one =\r\nloses nothing by starting and trying to make progress. Sadhanas like homam =\r\nand japam aid one in this.\n \nPlease note that even Ramana maharshi and Rama=\r\nkrishna Paramahamsa did intense sadhana for many years, before they could r=\r\neach the supreme state. No matter who you are, some sadhana is needed.\n \n* =\r\n       *        *\n \nWhile on the topic of Adwaita, I want to make one more =\r\npoint. It poses two dangers. While the Ultimate Reality is indeed non-dual,=\r\n *half-baked* understanding of Adwaita philosophy can make one *trivialize*=\r\n duality on one extreme or *glorify* ignorance on the other extreme. Let me=\r\n explain.\n \nReading that the ultimate reality behind all that we see is the=\r\n non-dual Self can make some people trivialize the duality that we normally=\r\n experience. If duality is &quot;mithya&quot; (an illusion), how does it matter and h=\r\now do our actions within it matter? It is all, after all, an illusion.\n \nOf=\r\n course, a true student of vedanta will know that the layer of illusion is =\r\nquite important and cannot be ignored simply because it is an &quot;illusion&quot;. I=\r\nf one&#39;s consciousness is veiled by the layer of illusion, actions within th=\r\nat layer of illusion are required for removing it. It will not magically di=\r\nsappear. After all, yoga vaasishtham emphasizes &quot;actions&quot; in the dual world=\r\n for realizing non-dual Self. Action and knowledge as the two wings with wh=\r\nich the bird of individualized consciousness rises from the ground of duali=\r\nty to reach the sky of true Self.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOn the other extr=\r\neme, some people take &quot;all is god/Self&quot; to justify anything they do. Their =\r\ndesires, passions, attractions, aversions etc are all stamped as &quot;Self&quot;. Th=\r\ney think &quot;I am Self/god and whatever I think and do is Self/God&quot;.\n \nAs any =\r\ntruly learned person will know, that is true at one level and misleading at=\r\n another. Everything is Self, in the sense that good and bad things, desira=\r\nble and undesirable things are all Self in reality. However, if one sees (w=\r\nithin one&#39;s mind) different aspects of Self with a different vision, then b=\r\nheda-bhava (perception of difference) is not gone yet and that creates karm=\r\na. One reaps what one sows.\n \nIrrespective of what one says and pretends, w=\r\nhat one has in the mind matters. If one pursued something thinking it to be=\r\n desirable and if one avoided something thinking it to be undesirable, one =\r\nwill get the fruits for it. Of course, the fruits are also Self only, but o=\r\nne will invariably see them as tasty and bitter fruits when one actually re=\r\nceives them. Thus, pretending that all if Self is useless.\n \nBottomline: As=\r\n long as your consciousness perceives duality, neither trivialize it nor pr=\r\netend that all is Self. Instead, engage in the right actions to wade the oc=\r\nean of duality. \n \n*        *        *\n \nEnough for now. I have not gone an=\r\nywhere and still reading the list regularly. But I did not have motivation =\r\nto reply to any recent mails. Basically, if I have no useful or meaningful =\r\ncomment/reply, I keep quiet.\n \nIntellectual exchanges are interesting, but =\r\nthe thing that matters at the end of the day is whether we are doing sincer=\r\ne sadhana or not and whether we are progressing or not. It seems to me like=\r\n several people are sincerely doing homam/japam and sincerely trying to mak=\r\ne progress. Several more people are about to do the same. THAT is what real=\r\nly matters. What we think or say about the world, duality and non-duality i=\r\ns irrelevant really. What matters is whether our attitude is changing for t=\r\nhe better.\n \n*        *        *\n \nLet me give one more quick analogy befor=\r\ne I stop for now.\n \nSuppose one is sleeping and seeing an elaborate dream. =\r\nSuppose one is fully absorbed in the dream and weeping in pain when somethi=\r\nng bad happens in the dream and laughing in elation when something good hap=\r\npens in the dream. One can tell that it is bad.\n \nSuppose another person ha=\r\ns read *in the dream* that what one is experiencing is called a &quot;dream&quot; and=\r\n will end soon and what happens in the dream is irrelevant. Suppose one int=\r\nellectually understands all that and yet weeps in pain when something bad h=\r\nappens in the dream and laughs in elation when something good happens in th=\r\ne dream. Is that any better? Of course not.\n \nOn the other hand, if one is =\r\nslowly getting control over the mind and not weeping as often and not laugh=\r\ning as often, one is perhaps making progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDo wh=\r\natever your conscience tells you to do. But expect nothing in return and ac=\r\ncept whatever comes to you as a result. As your acceptance increases, the c=\r\nlarity with which your conscience shows you the path you should take (with =\r\nregard to your actions) will become better and better. If your actions were=\r\n bad in the past (due to unclear guidelines from conscience or not followin=\r\ng your conscience) and you are receiving bad fruits, you can still overcome=\r\n it by learning to accept what comes. As your acceptance is perfected, your=\r\n conscience and will power will become pure and your actions will become pu=\r\nre. As actions become pure, newer fruits will be pure. Eventually, you star=\r\nt making progress.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish=\r\n Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam=\r\n and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     F=\r\nilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n \n---- Prasanth Jalasutram &lt;jvrsprasanth@...=\r\nm&gt; wrote: \n&gt;  Because of the ignorance of the mind experiencing a sense of =\r\ndifference\n&gt; [bheda-buddhi] in Self, [even] great devas are disturbed by fe=\r\nar.\n&gt; [Therefore] it is wise to remain without fear in the supreme state of=\r\n\n&gt; non-duality, having attained the reality, one=E2=80=99s own Self, throug=\r\nh negation\n&gt; [of the non-Self].\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadhu Om: The nature of jiva is to thi=\r\nnk that fear will be removed only when\n&gt; there is some other person with hi=\r\nm. But this idea is foolish. How can there\n&gt; be cause for fear in the state=\r\n of Self, where no other thing exists?\n&gt; \n&gt; Only in a state where there exi=\r\nsts something other than oneself is it\n&gt; possible for one either to have de=\r\nsire for that thing or to have fear of it.\n&gt; Therefore, true fearlessness c=\r\nan be attained only in the non-dual state of\n&gt; Self, where no other thing e=\r\nxists.\n&gt; \n&gt; To illustrate how fearlessness can be attained only when one at=\r\ntains the\n&gt; state of Self, Sri Bhagavan used to narrate the following story=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; After Lord Vishnu had killed Hiranya, Hiranya=E2=80=99s son Prahlada=\r\n was happily\n&gt; ruling the kingdom.\n&gt; \n&gt; But after some time, a fear arose i=\r\nn Prahlada. =E2=80=9CBecause Lord Vishnu is kind\n&gt; to me, I am living safel=\r\ny. But if one day He becomes angry with me, He will\n&gt; kill me just as He ki=\r\nlled my father,=E2=80=9D thought Prahlada.\n&gt; \n&gt; Being a great devotee of Lo=\r\nrd Vishnu, Prahlada had no one else to turn to,\n&gt; so he\n&gt; prayed to Him. Th=\r\ne Lord immediately appeared before Prahlada,who then\n&gt; explained his fear a=\r\nnd prayed for the state of fearlessness.\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said L=\r\nord Vishnu, =E2=80=9CYou are correct. By seeing me like this in name\n&gt; and =\r\nform, you cannot be free from fear.\n&gt; \n&gt; You must see me within yourself. O=\r\nnly when you thus realize me to be not\n&gt; different from yourself, will you =\r\nattain the state of fearlessness=E2=80=9D. Then\n&gt; the Lord taught him the p=\r\nath of Self-enquiry. When Prahlada followed the\n&gt; Lord=E2=80=99s instructio=\r\nns and realized Self, he attained the state of\n&gt; fearlessness.\n&gt; \n&gt; This st=\r\nory thus illustrates that even God cannot serve as permanent refuge\n&gt; from =\r\nfear so long as one retains the sense of difference [bheda-buddhi].\n&gt; Only =\r\nby attaining the non-dual Self can one become truly and permanently\n&gt; free =\r\nfrom fear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: GURU VACHAKA KOVAI The Light of Supreme Truth or TH=\r\nE COLLECTION OF\n&gt; GURU=E2=80=99S SAYINGS translated from original Tamil By =\r\nSadhu Om and Michael James\n&gt; \n&gt; Guru Vachaka Kovai is the biggest collectio=\r\nn of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s spoken teachings\n&gt; that was thoroughly checked and =\r\nrevised by him during his lifetime.
