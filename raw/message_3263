Tempted to ask him what really is the definition of\n&gt; God wh=\r\nich differentiates Rama from Krishna?\n&gt; *\n&gt; Some months back I had a very l=\r\nengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate\n&gt; with him on whether Sri Rama is=\r\n God or not. Mind you, these are all\n&gt; theoritical/theological debates - no=\r\nthing to do with actual spirituality.\n&gt; Finally he stopped the debate becau=\r\nse I was getting agitated and it would\n&gt; have affected our friendship.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nWhenever his opinion is asked on anything, he will only mention that what\n&gt;=\r\n he can support using logic. Therefore he never generally discusses\n&gt; spiri=\r\ntuality with anyone per se. He will discuss and debate scriptures using\n&gt; e=\r\nxact quotations etc, (theology) but not about mysticism or sadhana or\n&gt; any=\r\nthing which needs a belief system. That is why most people know him only\n&gt; =\r\nas a very rational, massively knowledgeable and uncorruptable human\n&gt; being=\r\n.  They have no clue about his meditations or anything. He never\n&gt; projects=\r\n himself as spiritual and generally would not discuss God in public.\n&gt;\n&gt; Th=\r\nerefore our discussion was also on those aspects which can be proved or\n&gt; d=\r\nisproved theologically - 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki Ramayana  2) Is it=\r\n\n&gt; wrong if people consider him as God .. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Ma=\r\nnas\n&gt; of Tulasidasji.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) To the first question, he believes the answer =\r\nis &quot;no&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) To the second question he says it cannot be debated from a =\r\nspiritual\n&gt; point if it is right or wrong - but his personal opinion is tha=\r\nt one should\n&gt; try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather than =\r\nworshipping him.\n&gt; He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He =\r\ncould have destroyed\n&gt; Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, righ=\r\nt from the place where\n&gt; he was located when he first heard the news of Sit=\r\na&#39;s abduction, but Rama\n&gt; did not do so and instead chose the hard way of d=\r\nestroying Ravana - the\n&gt; human way. So as per my friend, it is more importa=\r\nnt to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas\n&gt; than to worship Rama.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) He considers the =\r\nRamcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodgepodge of\n&gt; langauges and sty=\r\nles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s paradise\n&gt; (since many ru=\r\nles of composition has been flouted) but a critics nightmare.\n&gt; Also, there=\r\n is a line in there which equates women with animals or something\n&gt; similar=\r\n. He believes that was introduces in the text because Tulasidas had a\n&gt; pro=\r\nblem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up composing a\n&gt; sentenc=\r\ne derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is\n&gt; worshipped =\r\nas God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama\n&gt; was there=\r\n to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped\n&gt; because =\r\nKrishna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be\n&gt; more God=\r\n than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.\n&gt;\n&gt; The above are merely his=\r\n opinions, feel free to disagree.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt;\n&gt; *One request, if yo=\r\nu can speak to him about his thought on Food habits,\n&gt; it&#39;ll be great.*\n&gt; *=\r\n*\n&gt; I have been out of touch with him since August, been busy myself. But w=\r\nill\n&gt; ask him. However I don&#39;t know whether he will respond. Because as I\n&gt;=\r\n explained above, he rarely discusses/debates anything from a purely\n&gt; spir=\r\nitual angle.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was only by chance that I found out one day about his m=\r\neditations etc\n&gt; and then he confirmed them when asked.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have seen him=\r\n debating with Vegans - purely from a scientific point of\n&gt; view - about wh=\r\ny there is no harm in having regulated amounts of meat (not\n&gt; red meat).\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; But I say, as Narasimha said, this person should not be taken as an ideal=\r\n\n&gt; regarding food  habits. Sachin can bat and score century even with a sor=\r\ne\n&gt; back, we will not be able to do it.

Do you know him as a friend and is he a Indian? What =\r\nsort of\n&gt;&gt; path/sadhana is he following?? Is he a sannyasin or a householde=\r\nr ?Did\n&gt;&gt; specific changes happened in his life after  he had these samadhi=\r\n and\n&gt;&gt; visions.Any other special things about him.*\n&gt;&gt; **\n&gt;&gt; **\n&gt;&gt; Yes he =\r\nis a friend of mine.  I can only tell you very little about his\n&gt;&gt; spiritua=\r\nl life, because he hardly ever shares it with anyone. He is married,\n&gt;&gt; liv=\r\nes in Delhi and has a son as well.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Before I tell you anything more ab=\r\nout his spiritual life that I know, let\n&gt;&gt; me say line or two about the nat=\r\nure of this friend of mine. I met him about\n&gt;&gt; two years back. What first a=\r\nttracted me to  towards him was his impeccable\n&gt;&gt; honestly. I mean, he is a=\r\n maniac when it comes to honestly. If someone were\n&gt;&gt; to put a gun to his h=\r\nead and ask him to just say a simple, harmless lie,\n&gt;&gt; like sun rises in th=\r\ne west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes\n&gt;&gt; with anyone too! H=\r\ne has actually never ever spoken even a single lie in his\n&gt;&gt; whole life, bi=\r\ng or small. When he was in his school, once his teacher told\n&gt;&gt; him that In=\r\ndian languages are richer than English, he believed his teacher.\n&gt;&gt; Later s=\r\nomeone else told him English is more comprehensive language and the\n&gt;&gt; worl=\r\nd cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself\n&gt;&gt; =\r\ntwo thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten years every\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; day he spend one hour reading the English dictionary and one hour readin=\r\ng\n&gt;&gt; the Hindi dictionary apart from reading up volumes of Hindi and Englis=\r\nh\n&gt;&gt; literature. When I asked him why, he just said it is because he wanted=\r\n to\n&gt;&gt; be equally adept at both the languages so that one day he can take a=\r\n really\n&gt;&gt; detached view to judge the truth about which is more comprehensi=\r\nve language!\n&gt;&gt; As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it comes =\r\nto finding out\n&gt;&gt; the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is ma=\r\nthematics. He has\n&gt;&gt; worked in different fields, from banking to education =\r\nto journalism. He did\n&gt;&gt; not last for long in most places. He speaks and wr=\r\nites fluently, English,\n&gt;&gt; Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian,=\r\n French. Now he is learning\n&gt;&gt; Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above l=\r\nanguages. When he was in\n&gt;&gt; college, he considered himself an atheist. Whil=\r\ne applying for a job he had\n&gt;&gt; kept the place makered for religion as blank=\r\n. When the clerk who was\n&gt;&gt; supposed to take the forms saw that blank space=\r\n, he asked my friend&#39;s name.\n&gt;&gt; Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hind=\r\nu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend\n&gt;&gt; snatched the form from the clerk and tore it =\r\nup right there. Because, he\n&gt;&gt; considered himself an atheist and writing Hi=\r\nndu in the form would have been\n&gt;&gt; a lie.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So this gives a basic idea =\r\nof the man I am speaking of. All his friends,\n&gt;&gt; whoever knows him, calls h=\r\nim Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for s=\r\nome urgent meeting. His\n&gt;&gt; way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he =\r\nwas passing by in his\n&gt;&gt; scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go int=\r\no the temple. He says he\n&gt;&gt; still does not know why he went inside the temp=\r\nle, but he did. That was at 9\n&gt;&gt; o clock in the morning. Next when he sees =\r\nhis watch it is 4:30 in the\n&gt;&gt; evening! And he has no knowledge of how the =\r\ntime went. When he asked the\n&gt;&gt; priest, the priest said that he went into t=\r\nhe temple sat down and just\n&gt;&gt; stayed as he was for the whole time without =\r\nany movement. The priest somehow\n&gt;&gt; felt scared to disturb him. But my frie=\r\nnd had no idea why this happened. He\n&gt;&gt; remembered nothing, as if he was in=\r\n deep sleep.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Then he started meditating at home, and it was there tha=\r\nt he got visions\n&gt;&gt; etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infac=\r\nt most people who\n&gt;&gt; know him also do not know these things. But once he wa=\r\ns in samadhi for 72\n&gt;&gt; hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the e=\r\nxact same place and same\n&gt;&gt; position for 3 days continuously.  Only his wif=\r\ne and close relatives know\n&gt;&gt; about this incident. I believe nowadays when =\r\never he sits for meditation he\n&gt;&gt; often enters the state of Samadhi. When s=\r\nomeone asked him how he felt during\n&gt;&gt; samadhi, he just said it feels as if=\r\n the whole universe orginates from me. I\n&gt;&gt; am the sun, the moon, the stars=\r\n, the planets, the animals, men, women,\n&gt;&gt; children, the wind, the water, t=\r\nhe space, smaller than the atom and bigger\n&gt;&gt; than everything. It cannot be=\r\n accurately desribed. He considers Sri Krishna\n&gt;&gt; to be God and Lord Rama t=\r\no be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the\n&gt;&gt; Ramacharit Manas bec=\r\nause he thinks it elevated Sri Rama to the level of a\n&gt;&gt; God whereas the ai=\r\nm of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as\n&gt;&gt; an ideal *man,=\r\n *not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man is\n&gt;&gt; someone who =\r\ncan be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to become\n&gt;&gt; like the i=\r\ndeal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot\n&gt;&gt; become Kr=\r\nishna, but one can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued\n&gt;&gt; with hi=\r\nm over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have\n&gt;&gt; a G=\r\nuru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nthese days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Later he =\r\nhad once mentioned he knew the relation he had with all the\n&gt;&gt; people aroun=\r\nd him in his past lives. His mother he says, was his daughter in\n&gt;&gt; his pas=\r\nt life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on different internet\n&gt;&gt; forum=\r\ns interacting with people, specially with those in the age group of 18\n&gt;&gt; t=\r\no 30, discussing anything and everything with them, from Indian politics to=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Indian history, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledg=\r\ne to\n&gt;&gt; young people who will be the future of this country.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He is am=\r\n omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I sh=\r\nall refrain from mentioning his name because I had not asked his\n&gt;&gt; permiss=\r\nion before mentioning him.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Regards\n&gt;&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PS: I would no=\r\nt like this mail to be considered as a part of the debate.\n&gt;&gt; This mail is =\r\njust because Laxmi Narayan asked for information.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *\n&gt;&gt; The upsu=\r\nrge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt;&gt; *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On *Mon,=\r\n 14/12/09, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@ yahoo.co. uk&lt;http://in.mc85.mail.=\r\nyahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dshrijishrihari@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;* wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@ yahoo.co. uk&lt;http://in.mc85.mail.yaho=\r\no.com/mc/compose?to=3Dshrijishrihari@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs.

It is understandable if he says Rama is an i=\r\ndeal man but hard to believe that such a great person claims Rama is not Go=\r\nd. Tempted to ask him what really is the definition of God which differenti=\r\nates Rama from Krishna?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some months back I had a =\r\nvery lengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate with him on whether Sri Ram=\r\na is God or not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/theological debates - =\r\nnothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate becau=\r\nse I was getting agitated and it would have affected our friendship. &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Whenever his opinion is asked on anything, he will on=\r\nly mention that what he can support using logic. Therefore he never general=\r\nly discusses spirituality with anyone per se. He will discuss and debate sc=\r\nriptures using exact quotations etc, (theology)=A0but not about mysticism o=\r\nr sadhana or anything which=A0needs a belief system. That is why most peopl=\r\ne know him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and uncorruptab=\r\nle=A0human being.=A0=A0They have no clue about his meditations or anything.=\r\n He never projects himself as spiritual and generally would not discuss God=\r\n in public.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Therefore our discussion was also on=\r\n those aspects which can be proved or disproved theologically=A0- 1) Is Ram=\r\na a God as per Valmiki Ramayana=A0 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as=\r\n God=A0.. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;1) To the first question, he believes the answer is &quot;no=\r\n&quot;. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;2) To the second question he says it can=\r\nnot be debated from a spiritual point if it is right or wrong=A0- but his p=\r\nersonal opinion is that one should try to follow the way of life shown by S=\r\nri Rama rather than worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all d=\r\nivine weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink=\r\n of an eye, right from the place where he was=A0located when he first heard=\r\n the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose=\r\n the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend, it=\r\n is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Rama.&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary a=\r\nngle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa=\r\n. An author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been floute=\r\nd) but a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates wo=\r\nmen with animals or something similar. He believes that was introduces in t=\r\nhe text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore=\r\n, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues =\r\nthat if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood g=\r\noes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was ther=\r\ne to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this plane=\r\n. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The above are merely his opinions, feel free to dis=\r\nagree. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Dear Utpal,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;One request, if you can speak to him about=\r\n his thought on Food habits, it&#39;ll be great.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;=A0&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have been out of touch with him since August, been busy =\r\nmyself. But will ask him. However I don&#39;t know whether he will respond.=\r\n Because as I explained above, he rarely discusses/debates anything from a =\r\npurely spiritual angle. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;It was only by chance t=\r\nhat I found out one day about his meditations etc and then he confirmed the=\r\nm when asked.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I have seen him debating with Vegan=\r\ns - purely from a scientific point of view - about why there is no harm in =\r\nhaving regulated amounts of meat (not red meat). &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;But I say, as Narasimha said, this person should not be taken as an ideal =\r\nregarding food=A0 habits. Sachin can bat and score century even with a sore=\r\n back, we will not be able to do it. His strength is his control of mind an=\r\nd his dedication to truth. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n=A0Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: n=\r\navy; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Courier&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt; &lt;/font&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;--- On &lt;b=\r\n&gt;Tue, 15/12/09, Kishore Chitrapu &lt;i&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:chitrapu@...=\r\nm&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chitrapu@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockqu=\r\note style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: Kishore Ch=\r\nitrapu &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:chitrapu@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chitrapu=\r\n@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs.

Do yo=\r\nu know him as a friend and is he a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana is he =\r\nfollowing?? Is he a sannyasin or a householder ?Did specific changes happen=\r\ned in his life after=A0 he had these samadhi and visions.Any other special =\r\nthings about him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;Yes he is a friend of mine.=A0 I can only tell you very little about his=\r\n spiritual life, because he hardly ever shares it with anyone. He is marrie=\r\nd, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Before I=\r\n tell you anything more=A0about his spiritual life=A0that I know, let me sa=\r\ny=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him about tw=\r\no years back. What first attracted me to=A0 towards him was his impeccable =\r\nhonestly. I mean, he is a maniac=A0when it comes to=A0honestly.=A0If someon=\r\ne were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simple, harmless=\r\n=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he never=\r\n jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=A0spoken even a single l=\r\nie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his tea=\r\ncher told him that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed hi=\r\ns teacher. Later someone else told him English is more comprehensive langua=\r\nge and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bou=\r\nght himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten =\r\nyears every day he spend one\n hour reading the English dictionary and one h=\r\nour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=A0up volumes of Hindi a=\r\nnd English literature.=A0When I asked him why, he just said it is because h=\r\ne wanted to be=A0equally adept at both the languages so that one day he can=\r\n take a really detached view to judge the truth about=A0which is more compr=\r\nehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it com=\r\nes to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is ma=\r\nthematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to education to =\r\njournalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes f=\r\nluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. =\r\nNow he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. Wh=\r\nen he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for =\r\na job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk w=\r\nho was\n supposed to take the forms saw that blank space, he asked my friend=\r\n&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seein=\r\ng this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right the=\r\nre. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form=\r\n would have been a lie. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;So this gives a basic i=\r\ndea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, calls =\r\nhim Rama of Kaliyuga.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;One day, long back, he was =\r\ngoing to office for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Kris=\r\nhna temple. As he was passing by in=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a stran=\r\nge urge to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went i=\r\nnside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next wh=\r\nen he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of =\r\nhow the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went i=\r\nnto the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time withou=\r\nt any movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my frien=\r\nd had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in dee=\r\np sleep.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Then he started meditating at home, and=\r\n it was there=A0that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much ab=\r\nout these, infact most people who know him also do not know these things. B=\r\nut once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat=\r\n, in the exact same place and same position for 3 days continuously.=A0 Onl=\r\ny his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays=\r\n when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. Whe=\r\nn someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if=\r\n the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, t=\r\nhe planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the spa=\r\nce, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurate=\r\nly desribed.=A0He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=A0Lord Rama to be the=\r\n ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thi=\r\nnks it\n elevated Sri=A0Rama to the level of a God whereas the aim of the or=\r\nginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal &lt;i&gt;man,=A0&lt;/i&gt;not a=\r\n God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emu=\r\nlated, an ordinary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a G=\r\nod cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=\r\n=A0can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, bu=\r\nt I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru=\r\n at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless =\r\nto say, he is not an atheist any more.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Later he =\r\nhad once=A0mentioned he knew the relation he had with all the people around=\r\n him in his past lives. His mother he says, was his daughter in his past li=\r\nfe etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on different internet forums inter=\r\nacting with people, specially=A0with those in=A0the age group of 18 to 30, =\r\ndiscussing anything and everything with them, from Indian politics to India=\r\nn history, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to youn=\r\ng people who will be the future of this country.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;He is am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I=\r\n had not asked his permission before mentioning him.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;PS: I would =\r\nnot like this mail to be considered as a part of the debate.

It is so difficult to c=\r\nomprehend.=A0 Would they remain in the cycle of b/d=A0 till they learn abou=\r\nt kindness???&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Kind Regards&lt;br&gt;LaxmiNarayan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- O=\r\nn Sat, 12/12/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://co.=\r\nin/&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;co.in&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\nThe INTERNE=\r\nT now has a personality.
