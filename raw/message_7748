It does not specifically describe the form of &quot;Chandi&quot;.&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n (2) The real form of deities is energy, that can manifest within one&#39;s &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n own consciousness.&gt; &gt; (3) Lalita is a gentle form as the name implies.\n&gt; H=\r\nowever, some of her &gt; names describe a fierce form. Similarly, some of\n&gt; th=\r\ne names of a fierce &gt; deity may describe a gentle form. Bottomline is\n&gt; tha=\r\nt different deities &gt; describe different energy forms and several\n&gt; other e=\r\nnegy forms can be &gt; *derived* from that energy. Energy is\n&gt; convertible.&gt; &gt;=\r\n For example, you can generate electric energy or\n&gt; magnetic energy or &gt; me=\r\nchanical kinetic energy from nuclear energy from\n&gt; a big nuclear fusion. &gt; =\r\nIf 1000 names of the nuclear fusion describe it\n&gt; in one name as energy &gt; t=\r\nhat lights up a house or a town, don&#39;t think it\n&gt; is a gentle form. It &gt; ca=\r\nn support that gentle aspect too, but it is a\n&gt; very fierce form. If you &gt; =\r\nreally see that energy in its raw form, you\n&gt; will see that nuclear fusion =\r\n&gt; is certainly not gentle.&gt; &gt; One who\n&gt; experienced the energy of a suppose=\r\nd fierce deity as being &gt; gentle or\n&gt; vice versa hasn&#39;t experienced that de=\r\nity in the complete form &gt; and\n&gt; experienced only a small derived aspect of=\r\n that deity.&gt; &gt; (4) Though I\n&gt; say that the real form of deities is energy,=\r\n the &gt; iconography IS very\n&gt; important and holds keys. However, some keys o=\r\nf some &gt; particularly\n&gt; powerful siddha mantras are intentionally misplaced=\r\n by &gt; rishis.&gt; &gt; For\n&gt; example, I know someone who was doing sadhana of a h=\r\nigher deity. He &gt;\n&gt; was imagining her in a form using a popular dhyana shlo=\r\nka. This popular\n&gt; &gt; dhyana shloka for that mantra - which is known to be a=\r\n siddha mantra -\n&gt; &gt; matches the imagery created by some key words in the m=\r\nantra. He was &gt;\n&gt; doing the sadhana sincerely, but never formed a connectio=\r\nn to the mantra\n&gt; &gt; or experienced anything. After a few weeks, his guru/me=\r\nntor gave him a\n&gt; &gt; different dhyana shloka of the same deity composed by a=\r\n great yogi of\n&gt; &gt; past, which is not typically used with that particular m=\r\nantra, because\n&gt; &gt; some words in the mantra suggest a different imagery. Th=\r\nis sadhaka &gt;\n&gt; switched to it. He started visualizing the deity differently=\r\n. Though &gt;\n&gt; this visualization was contrary to the words in the mantra, th=\r\nis &gt;\n&gt; actually worked. It made a big difference. The person started to &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n experience some things internally and understood the essence of the &gt;\n&gt; ma=\r\nntra in a flash. Now, the true meaning of the mantra became crystal &gt;\n&gt; cle=\r\nar through an internal experience.&gt; &gt; The final understanding was\n&gt; interna=\r\nl, philosophical and based on subtle &gt; play of different cosmic\n&gt; energies.=\r\n But, that beautiful understanding was &gt; triggered ONLY AFTER a\n&gt; specific =\r\nphysical form was imagined by the mind.&gt; &gt; Some powerful\n&gt; mantras do have =\r\na specific physical form associated with &gt; them and you\n&gt; will be kind of l=\r\nost without knowing that form or &gt; corresponding\n&gt; dhyana.&gt; &gt; (5) BTW, havi=\r\nng said the above, I need to make one important\n&gt; point.&gt; &gt; It is foolish t=\r\no go around asking people and gurus to give you\n&gt; the right &gt; mantra or dhy=\r\nana of this or that mantra. Until you are pure\n&gt; enough and &gt; prepared, no =\r\nreal yogi will ever give you the keys to\n&gt; anything really &gt; siddha, i.e. p=\r\nowerful and potent enough to work\n&gt; quickly.

I seek your&lt;BR&gt;&gt; clarification on this point:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (1) The r=\r\nahasyas of Chandipath describes the Sarvasya Aadyaa (the &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Origi=\r\nnal Root of All) form of Mahalakshmi and also the 3 derived forms &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati (the two Mahalakshmi forms &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are different!). It does not specifically describe the form of =\r\n&quot;Chandi&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If this does not specifically describe the form of Chandi=\r\n, why then, in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the Chandi Homam manual - the section on Pranaa Prat=\r\nishthaapanaa\n of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Chandi, you had included the verses from the rahas=\r\nyas of Chandipath?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is there any other significance that I am missin=\r\ng in my understanding?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thank you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Warmest regards..&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao pvr@&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n friends,&gt; &gt; Based on my experience and understanding,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I will=\r\n share my 2 cents on the &gt; topics that came up recently.&gt; &gt; (1)&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; The rahasyas of Chandipath describes the Sarvasya Aadyaa (the &gt; Or=\r\niginal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Root of All) form of Mahalakshmi and also the 3 derived form=\r\ns &gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati (the two Mahalaks=\r\nhmi forms &gt; are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; different!). It does not specifically describe t=\r\nhe form of &quot;Chandi&quot;.&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) The real form of deities is energ=\r\ny, that can manifest within one&#39;s &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; own consciousness.&gt; &gt; =\r\n(3)\n Lalita is a gentle form as the name implies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, some of =\r\nher &gt; names describe a fierce form. Similarly, some of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the names=\r\n of a fierce &gt; deity may describe a gentle form. Bottomline is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhat different deities &gt; describe different energy forms and several&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; other enegy forms can be &gt; *derived* from that energy. Energy is&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; convertible.&gt; &gt; For example, you can generate electric energy or=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; magnetic energy or &gt; mechanical kinetic energy from nuclear ene=\r\nrgy from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a big nuclear fusion. &gt; If 1000 names of the nuclear fu=\r\nsion describe it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in one name as energy &gt; that lights up a house =\r\nor a town, don&#39;t think it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is a gentle form. It &gt; can support tha=\r\nt gentle aspect too, but it is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; very fierce form. If you &gt; real=\r\nly see that energy in its raw form, you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; will see that nuclear fusio=\r\nn &gt; is certainly not gentle.&gt; &gt; One who&lt;BR&gt;&gt; experienced the\n e=\r\nnergy of a supposed fierce deity as being &gt; gentle or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vice versa=\r\n hasn&#39;t experienced that deity in the complete form &gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; experi=\r\nenced only a small derived aspect of that deity.&gt; &gt; (4) Though I&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; say that the real form of deities is energy, the &gt; iconography IS ve=\r\nry&lt;BR&gt;&gt; important and holds keys. However, some keys of some &gt; partic=\r\nularly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; powerful siddha mantras are intentionally misplaced by &gt; =\r\nrishis.&gt; &gt; For&lt;BR&gt;&gt; example, I know someone who was doing sadhana =\r\nof a higher deity. He &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was imagining her in a form using a popu=\r\nlar dhyana shloka. This popular&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dhyana shloka for that mantra =\r\n- which is known to be a siddha mantra -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; matches the imagery c=\r\nreated by some key words in the mantra. He was &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; doing the sadha=\r\nna sincerely, but never formed a connection to the mantra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; or e=\r\nxperienced anything. After a few weeks, his guru/mentor gave him\n a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; different dhyana shloka of the same deity composed by a great yogi of=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; past, which is not typically used with that particular mantra=\r\n, because&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; some words in the mantra suggest a different imagery=\r\n. This sadhaka &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; switched to it. He started visualizing the deit=\r\ny differently. Though &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; this visualization was contrary to the w=\r\nords in the mantra, this &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; actually worked. It made a big differ=\r\nence. The person started to &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; experience some things internally =\r\nand understood the essence of the &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantra in a flash. Now, the =\r\ntrue meaning of the mantra became crystal &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; clear through an int=\r\nernal experience.&gt; &gt; The final understanding was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; internal, ph=\r\nilosophical and based on subtle &gt; play of different cosmic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; energ=\r\nies. But, that beautiful understanding was &gt; triggered ONLY AFTER a&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; specific physical form was imagined by the mind.&gt;\n &gt; Some powerfu=\r\nl&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantras do have a specific physical form associated with &gt; the=\r\nm and you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; will be kind of lost without knowing that form or &gt; co=\r\nrresponding&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dhyana.&gt; &gt; (5) BTW, having said the above, I need=\r\n to make one important&lt;BR&gt;&gt; point.&gt; &gt; It is foolish to go around a=\r\nsking people and gurus to give you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the right &gt; mantra or dhyana =\r\nof this or that mantra. Until you are pure&lt;BR&gt;&gt; enough and &gt; prepared=\r\n, no real yogi will ever give you the keys to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; anything really &gt; =\r\nsiddha, i.e. powerful and potent enough to work&lt;BR&gt;&gt; quickly. Instead ta=\r\nke &gt; something standard like Chandipath or Vishnu&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sahasranama st=\r\notram and &gt; keep chanting it or doing homam with it. First&lt;BR&gt;&gt; prepa=\r\nre yourself.
