It is not only what you did to others, but also what others did to you =\r\nthat matters.\n \nSuppose a dog served a family well. Suppose it saw its mast=\r\ner while dying and thought of being a human being at the last moment, it ma=\r\ny be born as a human being and that family may have to serve that dog in ne=\r\nw life as a human being.\n \nIf a cow being killed by butcher wept at the las=\r\nt moment at its helplessness and wished it was a strong human being instead=\r\n, it may be born as a human being (provided it has enough good karmas and/o=\r\nr karmik debts with humans - which is possible if several people enjoyed it=\r\ns milk for a long time and finally its flesh).\n \nIt is possible that many p=\r\neople in the world today are first time human beings.

But if you observe the world=\r\n past few years, very less people are doing the good karma(may be i don&#39;t t=\r\nhe what good or bad is but here what i thought good means which supports th=\r\ne dharma). So the people with good dharmic karma are being lessened. But if=\r\n you see the world population, It is getting increased day by day. These tw=\r\no are contradicting. So all respected gurus please clarify my doubt. Please=\r\n forgive me if something wrong in ideas and narration.\n\n\tThanks in advance,=\r\n\n\tRegards,\n\tRavi Kiran Jana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
