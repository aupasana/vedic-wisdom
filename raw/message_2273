But in sleep, when you do n=\r\not\n&gt; attend to any second or third person, you do not experience any misery=\r\n.\n&gt; Overlooking the peaceful happiness that you experienced while asleep, y=\r\nou\n&gt; search for happiness in the waking state by attending to innumerable\n&gt;=\r\n external objects. However, does not the fact that you experienced happines=\r\ns\n&gt; during sleep in the absence of those objects, indicate that happiness l=\r\nies\n&gt; not in the objects but in you, the first person or subject? Therefore=\r\n why\n&gt; not you try, even in the waking state, to attend not to second and t=\r\nhird\n&gt; persons but to the first person `I&#39; ?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; On hearing this, however=\r\n, some devotees wonder whether it is necessary then\n&gt; to withdraw from all =\r\nactivities in order to be able to practise\n&gt; Self-attention. &quot;If we are to =\r\nfollow this sadhana of Self--attention in all\n&gt; earnestness, will not work =\r\nprove to be an obstacle? But if we give up all\n&gt; work, how are we to provid=\r\ne the food, clothing and shelter required by the\n&gt; body?&quot; they ask. However=\r\n, whenever devotees asked Sri Bhagavan such\n&gt; questions, He used to reply t=\r\nhatwork need not be a hindrance to spiritual\n&gt; practice (sadhana). This doe=\r\ns not mean, of course, that an aspirant should\n&gt; work in the same spirit as=\r\n a wordly man or that he should work with the same\n&gt; aim in view. The spiri=\r\nt in which and the aim with which an aspirant should\n&gt; work in this world, =\r\ncan be illustrated by the following example:\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose a businessman ren=\r\nts a shop in the heart of a big city for Rs.\n&gt; 1,000/- a month. If from his=\r\n business he aims to make only sufficient money\n&gt; to pay the rent for the s=\r\nhop, will it not be a worthless business? Should\n&gt; not his aim in renting t=\r\nhe shop be to earn a profit of Rs. 10,000/- a month?\n&gt; On the other hand, i=\r\nf he does not make sufficient money even to pay the\n&gt; rent, will he be able=\r\n to remain in the shop to earn his profit?\n&gt; \n&gt; Our body is like the shop r=\r\nented by the businessman.The aim with which we\n&gt; rent this body is to reali=\r\nze Self, while the rent we have to pay for the\n&gt; body is food, clothing and=\r\n shelter. In order to pay this rent, it is\n&gt; necessary for us to work, usin=\r\ng the mind, speech and body as our\n&gt; instruments. If we do not pay the rent=\r\n, we cannot live in the body and earn\n&gt; the great profit of Self-knowledge.=\r\n However, we should not spend our whole\n&gt; life-all our time and effortin wo=\r\nrking to pay the rent. The mind, speech and\n&gt; body should work only for tha=\r\nt amount of time and with that amount of effort\n&gt; which is required for pay=\r\ning the rent =96 for providing the food, clothing and\n&gt; shelter necessary f=\r\nor the body. If instead we devote all our time and effort\n&gt; towards accumul=\r\nating comforts and conveniences for the body, as worldly\n&gt; people do, we wo=\r\nuld be just like the worthless businessman who works only to\n&gt; pay the rent=\r\n and who never tries to make a profit. Therefore, a sincere\n&gt; aspirant shou=\r\nld arrange his work in such a way that he will spend only a\n&gt; portion of hi=\r\ns time and energy for maintaining the body, so that he can\n&gt; utilize the re=\r\nmaining time and energy in striving to earn the great profit\n&gt; of Self-know=\r\nledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; For some aspirants prarabdha will be arranged by God or Guru in=\r\n such a way\n&gt; that they need to do little or no work to maintain their body=\r\n, whereas for\n&gt; other aspirants it may be arranged in such a way that they =\r\nhave to spend\n&gt; most of their time in working for the maintenance of the bo=\r\ndy. But in\n&gt; whatever way the prarabdha is arranged, it is arranged only fo=\r\nr the\n&gt; aspirant&#39;s own good, that is, for his ultimate attainment of\n&gt; Self=\r\n-knowledge. Moreover,\n&gt; since prarabdha determines only the outward activit=\r\nies of the body and mind,\n&gt; it can in no way obstruct the inward desire and=\r\n yearning for Self-knowledge.\n&gt; If one has an intense yearning for Self-kno=\r\nwledge, the Guru&#39;s Grace will\n&gt; certainly help one in all ways, both from w=\r\nithin and without, to enable one\n&gt; to attend to Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: The Path=\r\n of Sri Ramana Part 1 Book By Sri Sadhu Om\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Love And Love Alone\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\n&gt; Prasanth Jalasutram\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
