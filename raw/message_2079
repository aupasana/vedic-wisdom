It is either this or that.\n\nBoth are correct, =\r\nbut at different levels. I will elaborate. However, this is philosophically=\r\n complex and those who do not follow what I say should not worry at all.\n\n*=\r\n        *        *\n\nNon-dual self has no division of self into various obje=\r\ncts or space or time. There is no concept of time or space or space-time co=\r\nntinuum within non-dual self. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sense=\r\n of space or time or objectification.\n\nSupreme cosmic being is the link bet=\r\nween duality and non-duality. Supreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual=\r\n self captures the entire field of duality within Him. All beings, entire s=\r\npace and all space-time continua within the field of duality exist within H=\r\nim. From the perspective of supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual wo=\r\nrld are His parts and all their individual wills are parts of His cosmic wi=\r\nll. As all space-time continua are within Him, there is nothing that is unk=\r\nnown to Him. Past, present and future; here, there and everywhere; I, you a=\r\nnd others, this possibility, that possibility and yet another possibility -=\r\n all are accessible and fully &quot;known&quot; to His self-awareness.\n\nNow, let us c=\r\nome lower and into the field of duality. The field of duality consists of i=\r\nnfinite divisions of space, time and space-time continua. There are infinit=\r\ne possibilities within this field.\n\nNormally, people stuck deeply within du=\r\nality have a linear sense of time and perceive just a part of one space-tim=\r\ne continuum. However, field of duality also contains planes of consciousnes=\r\ns where different senses of time and different space-time continua (that ma=\r\ny intersect at various points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-t=\r\nime continuum in such a plane of consciousness may experience a point of ti=\r\nme that maps to a future time in a regular space-time continuum being exper=\r\nienced by you. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum may be 1 =\r\nyear in another space-time continuum. Time is not as straight-forward an en=\r\ntity as one may think. Basically, the field of duality contains infinite sp=\r\nace-time continua and what one experiences depends on the plane of consciou=\r\nsness that one&#39;s self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experien=\r\nce part of a specific space-time continuum and hence think that that is the=\r\n only reality. But relaity consists of infinite space-time continua that in=\r\ntersect each other. These are all different possibilities and you chart out=\r\n your course based on your actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.\n=\r\n\n*        *        *\n\nFrom the perspective of a yogi who is in a different =\r\nspace-time continuum, your state may be known at a time that is in &quot;future&quot;=\r\n as per the space-time continuum in which you exist. But, from the perspect=\r\nive of the space-time continuum that you are in, your state at that future =\r\ntime is not yet known and depends on your current action.\n\nIf a yogi in a d=\r\nifferent space-time continuum has seen your state in future, his observatio=\r\nn is merely an observation and from his reference frame. It has no causal r=\r\nelationship to your current action or your future state. He is merely an ob=\r\nserver and he does not cause anything to happen. His observation is specifi=\r\nc to some space-time pairs and does not cover all the space-time pairs that=\r\n you will traverse as you travel to reach the space-time pair where he obse=\r\nrved you (if at all you do!).\n\n*        *        *\n\nLet us go further. Is t=\r\nhere only one future possible for you? Or, does the path traversed by you i=\r\nn space-time continuum not fixed but variable based on your actions? Can yo=\r\nur actions at important cross-roads alter the course you traverse?\n\nIf so, =\r\nwhat is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time pair? Is his ob=\r\nservation only a possibility or a certainty? One may say &quot;how can one obser=\r\nve a possibility? Anything we observe must be a certainty.&quot; But is that cor=\r\nrect? Aren&#39;t the field of duality and the infinite space-time continua cont=\r\nained in it merely a set of infinite possibilities?\n\nSome great rishis can =\r\nsee not just a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at the same ti=\r\nme, i.e. they can see various possibilities based on various possible actio=\r\nns. However, visions seen by most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just one possibi=\r\nlity.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBottomline: At the level at which we exist, the=\r\nre is certainly something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within the limits imposed by t=\r\nhe reactions given by nature to your own previous actions, you do have a sc=\r\nope for engaging in different actions at this time. Depending on which acti=\r\non you engage in, the future can be slightly different. Some actions can ev=\r\nen make the future significantly different. A rishi may be able to chart ou=\r\nt a significant portion of the field of possibilities for future (e.g. like=\r\n a brilliant chess player figuring out most possibilities upto 20 moves fro=\r\nm now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a few possibilities for future =\r\n(e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a few moves or guessing a futur=\r\ne position). But the supreme cosmic being knows the entire field of possibi=\r\nlities, as they all exist within Him.\n\nHowever, your actions are what bring=\r\n to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of your consciousness!) some of th=\r\nose possibilities. One may know all the possibilities quite deeply and even=\r\n guess the possibility that will come to fruition, but it is your actions t=\r\nhat actually make some of those possibilities a reality.\n\nBest regards,\nNar=\r\nasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nD=\r\no a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tar=\r\npanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.o=\r\nrg\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n  -=\r\n---- Original Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] Freewill.\n\n        Namaste Narasimhaji\n\n        No doubt a wonderfu=\r\nl and inspiring mail for all of us, however, I could not help it that an in=\r\nevitable question popped up in my mind. One of the oft discussed and eterna=\r\nl questions.\n\n        If events have already been created like in a movie a=\r\nnd later as time unfolds, they happen in our plane of existence, then all t=\r\nalk of freewill must be humbug? Like a placebo that makes us &quot;happy&quot; but in=\r\n reality does not exist!\n\n        I am not questioning that what you wrote =\r\nin the mail about events having already happened, because same has been sai=\r\nd by other great spiritual people in the world. \n\n        But my question i=\r\ns because I cannot reconcile this with a freewill. Both cannot be correct. =\r\nIt is either this or that.\n\n        Theoritically speaking, say tomorrow su=\r\nddenly majority of the world reforms itself, does a self correction exercis=\r\ne and brings in peace, harmony etc etc, then why should the Kalki Avatar st=\r\nill incarnate? But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts=\r\n say - then such a self correcting option is already negated out.\n\n        =\r\nWell, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any choice in the=\r\n sense that finally everyone will end up merging with the divine.\n\n        =\r\nSo I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think.\n\n        -Re=\r\ngards\n         Rajarshi\n\n        The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava=\r\n - Shiva Sutra\n\n        --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter=\r\n.net&gt; wrote:\n\n          From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n         =\r\n Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestest homam, purity and over=\r\ncoming ego\n          To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Tuesd=\r\nay, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM\n\n\n          Namaste,\n\n          I mentioned an e=\r\npisode of a small boy who did a very short Chandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s te=\r\nn incarnations above the fire in the following mail:\n\n          http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761\n\n          This boy was bor=\r\nn and brought up in US and is not proficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. =\r\nHe did not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what =\r\nhe saw and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms=\r\n he saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dust=\r\ny road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n\n          * * *\n\n =\r\n         This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I w=\r\nas with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was a=\r\nbou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n\n          I aske=\r\nd what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come=\r\n has not already happened. It has already happened in reality, but it will =\r\nhappen later when the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he =\r\nwas getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n=\r\n\n          He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy =\r\nis not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristi=\r\nc is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relax=\r\ned. However, he was onto something today. But he could not express himself.=\r\n\n\n          I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happe=\r\nned at some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a m=\r\novie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people =\r\nmay have already seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will thi=\r\nnk it is happening in front of them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;\n\n=\r\n          He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is=\r\n going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody =\r\nmay be able to see it before future comes, because it has already happened.=\r\n&quot;\n\n          Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along=\r\n these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision over t=\r\nhe fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given h=\r\nis age and ability to think and understand things, this probably seemed lik=\r\ne an oddity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he =\r\nwas trying to think how it was possible and came to some important conclusi=\r\nons about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n\n          Time seems linear at the level =\r\nof regular consciousness. However, in many planes of conssciousness, the co=\r\nncept of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when one is establ=\r\nished in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n\n          * * *\n\n          Th=\r\ne same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantr=\r\na of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were medit=\r\nating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was =\r\nquite different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy made m=\r\ny mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expres=\r\nsed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to le=\r\nave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n\n          I had experienced the same k=\r\nind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energy=\r\n when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chand=\r\ni homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to m=\r\neditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet f=\r\nrom the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a gre=\r\nat saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occas=\r\nions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.\n\n          Interesti=\r\nngly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out=\r\n of all the different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I ask=\r\ned him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just felt awesome =\r\nand different.&quot;\n\n          * * *\n\n          This boy performed a really sim=\r\nple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed=\r\n like he was successful in making a powerful energy manifest there. The bot=\r\ntomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.\n\n          Rit=\r\nuals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more o=\r\nut of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it unt=\r\nil one breaks through.\n\n          Keep performing your chosen spiritual pra=\r\nctices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you engage in external p=\r\nractices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is h=\r\now smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attract=\r\nion to external things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust=\r\n, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking =\r\nthat this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all problems.\n\n =\r\n         * * *\n\n          Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively ch=\r\nallenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - i=\r\nncluding your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is g=\r\nod&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these proper=\r\nties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion &quot;=\r\nthis is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of his master&#39;s prop=\r\nerties, but without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.\n=\r\n\n          Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for t=\r\naking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best ca=\r\nre of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does n=\r\not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is master&#39;s p=\r\nroperty and can be taken away anytime.

He did not know \n       =\r\n   much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and \n =\r\n         I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms h=\r\ne \n          saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse =\r\non a \n          dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This boy is usually playful, easy-going and=\r\n smiling. But, \n          when I was with him one morning, I saw him lost i=\r\nn some serious \n          thought. This was abou a week after the episode m=\r\nentioned in the above \n          mail.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I asked what he was thinking.=\r\n He said, &quot;it is not that \n          the future that is to come has not alr=\r\neady happened. It has already \n          happened in reality, but it will h=\r\nappen later when the time comes. You \n          know what I mean?&quot; I guesse=\r\nd what he was getting at, but pretended not \n          to know. I said, &quot;no=\r\n. What do you mean?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know \n          how to say wh=\r\nat I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly \n          intelligen=\r\nt or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is \n          usually c=\r\nheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. \n          However, h=\r\ne was onto something today. But he could not express \n          himself.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has \n          already h=\r\nappened at some level, but will reveal itself to people \n          later? K=\r\nind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become \n          ready=\r\n in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people \n          s=\r\neeing it on the screen later will think it is happening in front of \n      =\r\n    them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He exclaimed, \n      =\r\n    &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to happen in =\r\n\n          future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be ab=\r\nle to \n          see it before future comes, because it has already \n      =\r\n    happened.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was \n    =\r\n      thinking along these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse =\r\n\n          in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he=\r\n was \n          probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and u=\r\nnderstand \n          things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him tha=\r\nt he should see \n          somebody who had not yet come. So he was trying =\r\nto think how it was \n          possible and came to some important conclusi=\r\nons about &quot;time&quot; in his \n          own way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Time seems linear at the=\r\n level of regular \n          consciousness. However, in many planes of cons=\r\nsciousness, the concept \n          of time becomes changed. It even loses i=\r\nts meaning when one is \n          established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman=\r\n or Self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The same boy once performed a very=\r\n short Kaali homam with a \n          small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali w=\r\nith beejaakshara added before \n          name. When we were meditating afte=\r\nr poornaahuti, I felt a very intense \n          and powerful energy. It was=\r\n quite different from the energy I feel \n          normally. This intense e=\r\nnergy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful \n          and a feeling tha=\r\nt can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done \n          here. I have n=\r\nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire \n          consciou=\r\nsnss.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I had experienced the same kind of intense energy \n          t=\r\nwice before that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was \n          =\r\nmeditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam \n   =\r\n       in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to \n =\r\n         meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing withi=\r\nn 3 \n          feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified an=\r\nd \n          worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was=\r\n the \n          same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I fee=\r\nl that \n          intense shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Interestingly, after we finished m=\r\neditation and \n          opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the di=\r\nfferent homas I did \n          so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked =\r\nhim why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t \n          know how to say it, but it just felt =\r\nawesome and different.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* \n          * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This boy performed a=\r\n really simple and short procedure, \n          shorter than what I give in =\r\nmanuals. But it seemed like he was \n          successful in making a powerf=\r\nul energy manifest there. The bottomline \n          is that internal purity=\r\n is the most important thing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rituals \n          help purify one and=\r\n purity helps one do a ritual better and get more \n          out of it. It =\r\nis an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing \n          it until=\r\n one breaks through.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Keep performing your chosen \n          spiritua=\r\nl practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you \n          enga=\r\nge in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual \n       =\r\n   progress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes \n   =\r\n       smaller, you can resist attraction to external things better and you=\r\n \n          can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc bette=\r\nr. You \n          can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I=\r\n&quot; and this is \n          &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all problems.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;* * \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively cha=\r\nllenging, \n          but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is arou=\r\nnd you - \n          including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and=\r\n your own body \n          - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary =\r\ncaretaker of all of \n          these properties of god. Do the best job you=\r\n can, but without \n          entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A fait=\r\nhful servant takes very \n          good care of his master&#39;s properties, bu=\r\nt without thinking of all \n          those things as his or her belongings.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Realize that thinking of \n          things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessa=\r\nry for taking good care of them. A \n          servant who loves one&#39;s maste=\r\nr takes the best care of things entrusted \n          to one. When a thing i=\r\ns taken away, a servant does not waste time \n          worrying and crying.=\r\n A servant will accept that is master&#39;s property \n          and can be take=\r\nn away anytime. This enables one to do the best job \n          with what on=\r\ne possesses and not worry about what one does not possess \n          or wha=\r\nt is out of one&#39;s control.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Developing the attitude of a \n          s=\r\nervant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the \n      =\r\n    ocean of worldly life without getting caught and overcome \n          eg=\r\no.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- \n          -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam \n          You=\r\nrself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank \n  =\r\n        rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pit=\r\nri \n          Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/=\r\ntarpana&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ \n          tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n         =\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; \n  =\r\n        target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. \n  =\r\n        net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath \n          Centre (SJC)=\r\n website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; \n          target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan \n          nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n          --------- - \n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML=\r\n&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_02BE_01C9FA9B.B35CAD40--\r\n\n"}}
