How can milk be considered pious? I understa=\r\nnd that Cow is a divinely being and is worshiped as `Kamadenu&#39;. But in actu=\r\nal sense we are extracting milk and preventing the calf from having its sha=\r\nre of milk...Is this not a sin to stop a young calf from having milk from i=\r\nts mother?\n\n2. How can silk cloth be considered sacred for worship? Silk is=\r\n obtained by killing thousand&#39;s of cocoon. Using a product which is obtaine=\r\nd by killing so many living beings and we being a cause for such an action.=\r\n..Are we not doing sin?\n\n3. I tell my daily prayers but I have not learnt S=\r\nanskrit and don&#39;t understand the meaning of many prayers that I say everyda=\r\ny. Why is it necessary to say the slokas in Sanskrit and not other language=\r\n??\nWill our Supreme Lord not understand other languages ?? or is it just bc=\r\nos Sanskrit has been used from the very early times it is still in practice=\r\n.\n\n~Ramya\n\n\n\n"}}
