Take a combined sankalpa to do the two homas, do one and move on to \nthe other without doing uttarangam and poorvaangam.\n\n2) When you are done with pradhana homam of one deity, offer naivedyam and \nneeraajanam and move on to invoke the next deity in fire. After finishing \nall deities, you can do uttaraangam once and finally one poornaahuti for all \nof them together.\n\nSome people offer a small poornaahuti to each deity (without doing \nuttaraangam) before moving on to the next deity. At the very end, after \nuttaraangam, they do a combined final poornaahuti. But that is not needed.\n\n3) The dry havan samagri powder is also good for Saturn. Saturn likes dry \npowdery things. Parasara maharshi recommends havischoornam.\n\nThe wood of Sami tree (Prosopis Cineraria), also known in Hindi as Jand \ntree, was particularly recommended by Maharshi Parasara for Sani. \nUnfortunately, it may not be easy to get in US and UK. So do with whatever \nwood or dry coconut pieces you normally use.\n\nThough this is not mentioned in any book I have read, my intuition tells me \n(and I have tried it with a positive experience) that ashwagandha (withania \nsomnifera root) powder can be offered to Saturn in moderation. Ashwagandha \nis a saattwik and rejuvenating herb that relieves one of vaata and weakness.\n\n4) Various auspicious materials like various sugandha dravyas can be used. \nVarious materials that are offered in homam, like sesame seeds, puffed rice, \nparched rice, juwar dhani (pelaalu in Telugu), jaggery, turmeric, sandalwood \npowder, pomegranate seeds, havan samagri powder, cashews, almonds, raisins, \ndates etc can placed along with a dry coconut (full or half) in a cloth, the \ncloth can be wrapped into one bundle and that can be offered as poornaahuti. \nDo whatever makes you feel good. But one dry coconut full/half is enough. \nInstead of a coconut, a fruit like an apple or a peach can also be offered \nas poornaahuti (symbol of head, i.e. ego). But it may need some wood and \nghee to burn fully and also create a lot of smoke. Dry coconut burns easily.\n\nThe most important thing is to imagine that you have surrendered your ego to \nthe Lord and nothing exists except the Lord. Focus your mind on the deity \nwith as few thoughts as you can and meditate for 10-20 minutes. I see a lot \nof learned priests getting up and leaving as soon as poornaahuti is done. \nThat is a mistake. Design your homam in such a way that you are able to \nspend 10-20 minutes meditating after poornaahuti. Sit in front of the \nburning poornaahuti, try to fotget everything including your body and \nmeditate as deeply as you can.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;gisundar&quot; &lt;gisundar@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, September 18, 2009 9:09 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Query on Homam\n\n\n&gt; Namaskaram Narasimha ji,\n&gt; I had a query in general about homam. Kindly answer them for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Can I perform mutiple homams in the same homam kund one after the other \n&gt; ?  I mean once lets say Ganapathi homam is done and after the completion \n&gt; can I perform Sani Homam in the same fire by following the steps from the \n&gt; beginning.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) If yes are there any separate procedure to be done before switching \n&gt; from one homam to another?\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) For Sani homam I know you have mentioned white snd black sesame seeds . \n&gt; But is there any other special items that can be offered in the homam \n&gt; spdecially for Sani.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) For poornahuti are there any additional special materials that can be \n&gt; used.\n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; Girish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
