Rituals understandably seem silly to them. I want to explain this ba=\r\nsic point with an analogy.\n \nWe teach some phrases and manners to small chi=\r\nldren. For example, we tell small children to say &quot;thank you&quot; when someone =\r\nhelps or say &quot;I am sorry&quot; when they do something wrong. A really small chil=\r\nd does not even understand what those words mean, but repeats them out of h=\r\nabit. As the child grows up, one starts to understand the true meaning of w=\r\nhat one has been saying. In fact, an understanding of what they truly mean =\r\ncomes to one slowly as one grows. Many words are actually understood from e=\r\nxperience. If a child has never seen a mango or the picture of a mango, you=\r\n cannot explain what a mango is by using hundred words. As a child accumula=\r\ntes more and more experiences (stored perceptions of the external world thr=\r\nough senses), the child&#39;s thinking expands and one gets more clarity on the=\r\n words and concepts one has been exposed to. When one says sorry, one then =\r\nclearly knows what exactly that means and may even feel a certain emotion (=\r\nsadness and compassion).\n \nSimilarly, one may be doing rituals like homam, =\r\npooja, meditation etc with various mantras, without fully understanding or =\r\nappreciating what one does. One doing a ritual for many years without fully=\r\n understanding its real meaning may slowly start to understand and even exp=\r\nerience some things that the rituals symbolize. Many mantras and spiritual =\r\ntruths are actually understood from experience alone. One can never fully u=\r\nnderstand what one has never experienced. As we accumulate more experiences=\r\n (stored perceptions of the external and internal world through external se=\r\nnses and the inward directed mind), one&#39;s thinking expands and one gets mor=\r\ne clarity on the concepts and spiritual truths one has been exposed to.\n \nR=\r\nituals in various religions are designed to symblize some truths that gives=\r\n bliss when experienced by one. A mere explanation of the symbolism is ofte=\r\nn useless to give one that state of bliss. Even if you explain to a one yea=\r\nr old child what the word &quot;sorry&quot; means in detail, the child will not under=\r\nstand. The best thing to do is to just get the child into the habit of sayi=\r\nng &quot;I am sorry&quot; in approapriate situations. Slowly, the meaning will become=\r\n clearer and clearer with experience and the correct emotions will come aut=\r\nomatically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra everyday - possibly with mista=\r\nkes and without the correct meaning and visualization in the mind - will sl=\r\nowly understand it and experience it.\n \nSome religions have done the mistak=\r\ne of de-emphasizing rituals and emphasizing philosophy and the final truths=\r\n. While the latter is undeniably the end goal, the former helps one in gett=\r\ning to the latter. Just as one needs to set foot at the base of hill before=\r\n reaching its top, one often needs to engage in some external practices in =\r\norder to realize internal truths. Of course, it is good to remind one that =\r\nreaching the top is the goal, lest one should get stuck at the base or in t=\r\nhe middle. But, one cannot completely eliminate the first steps. Just sayin=\r\ng &quot;you are That. Just realize that you are That&quot; is not an action plan. It =\r\ndoes not work for most. One has to take some baby steps.\n \nIf we don&#39;t teac=\r\nh a toddler to say various words because the toddler does not anyway unders=\r\ntand them, one will never learn anything. Correct knowledge evolves from ha=\r\nlf knowledge and habits that may be devoid of knowledge, as one experiments=\r\n and experiences more. Similarly, correct spiritual knowledge evolves from =\r\nhalf knowledge and ritualalistic practices that may be devoid of knowledge,=\r\n as one experiments and experiences more. Most of us, when it comes to spir=\r\nitual progress, are like toddlers. So it is useful to get into the habit of=\r\n doing things. Do the rituals sincerely.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.co=\r\nmcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nS=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------ \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0123_01C9C069.AE578480\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3527&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Some intelligent and rational people wonder why w=\r\ne \nneed to do rituals.
