You should m=\r\neditate all the time, even\nwhile you are working.&#39;\n\nIn the beginning, when =\r\nI first came to Bhagavan, I asked him for a mantra.\nIn response he told me =\r\nto repeat &#39;Siva Siva&#39; continuously. Later, Bhagavan\nadvised me to keep my a=\r\nttention in the Heart while I was working. I had read\nthat Bhagavan had spo=\r\nken of a place called the Heart-centre which he located\nin the right side o=\r\nf the chest. I had assumed that Bhagavan wanted me to\nconcentrate on this p=\r\narticular centre. However, when I started to practise\nin this way, Bhagavan=\r\n stopped me and corrected me.\n\n&#39;This right-side Heart-centre is not the tru=\r\ne Heart,&quot; he said. &#39;The real\nHeart is not located anywhere. It is all-perva=\r\nsive.&#39;\n\n&#39;Stop meditating on the Heart-centre,&#39; he continued. &#39;Find the sour=\r\nce. That\nis the true Heart.
