One of those young boys is inherently spiritual, \n&gt; philosophical and =\r\ninnocent. But he was not too quick to learn all those \n&gt; prayers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oned=\r\nay he was chided for his inability to remember all those prayers, \n&gt; while =\r\nanother younger kid remembered everything perfectly. He \n&gt; asked/declared s=\r\nomewhat nonchalantly, &quot;do I really need to learn all \n&gt; those prayers? All =\r\nValmiki had to do was to repeat the name of Raama!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When it was pointe=\r\nd out to him that he was not Valmiki, he laughed and \n&gt; went away.\n&gt; \n&gt; *  =\r\n      *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; IMHO, his simple and innocent point is spot on. If th=\r\nere is devotion, \n&gt; one 2-letter name is enough. If not, 900 verses are als=\r\no useless.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are so many prayers and mantras given in scriptures. =\r\nBut \n&gt; scriptures also declare that Om is the essence of all mantras. They =\r\n\n&gt; declare that supreme being is the source and essence of all mantras and =\r\n\n&gt; all deities. The same scriptues also declare &quot;Sarvam khalvidam Brahma&quot; \n=\r\n&gt; (all this verily is God).\n&gt; \n&gt; One conditioned to pursue various specific=\r\n results, mantras and forms \n&gt; may find affinity to various mantras and for=\r\nms and pursue them. As one&#39;s \n&gt; focus improves and conditioning drops, one =\r\nmay experience some mantras \n&gt; and forms. As one&#39;s consciousness becomes ev=\r\nen purer, one gets more \n&gt; drawn to the all-pervading essence and stops dif=\r\nferentiating. This is an \n&gt; evolution that every sadhaka has to go through.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; When tamas is pre-dominant, one does not do =\r\nmuch sadhana. When a lot of \n&gt; tamas and some rajas dominate, one finds aff=\r\ninity to some sadhana and \n&gt; does it, but with so much pride. One may also =\r\nfight with others and try \n&gt; to impose on others. As tamas reduces, some of=\r\n the fighting may reduce \n&gt; and one may put a lot of energy into sadhana it=\r\nself. As sattva starts \n&gt; affecting a raajasik mind, some clarity starts to=\r\n enter one&#39;s sadhana. \n&gt; As rajas reduces and sattva starts to dominate, fr=\r\niction within one&#39;s \n&gt; sadhana reduces and sadhana becomes more of a natura=\r\nl and pleasant \n&gt; activity than a challenge and achievement.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        =\r\n*        *\n&gt; \n&gt; To this specific thing, Rajarshi has given an appropriate r=\r\neply.\n&gt; \n&gt; Saptashati is well-established for millennia and many made progr=\r\ness with \n&gt; it. In order to pursue something else that one&#39;s mind is drawn =\r\ntowards, \n&gt; there is no need to dismiss Saptashati. Rash, shallow and silly=\r\n \n&gt; statements dismissing others and thinking too much of insights \n&gt; *reve=\r\naled* to one&#39;s own *intuition* are signs of delusion rather than \n&gt; wisdom.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Intuition as well as rational thinking are fallible, as they are \n&gt; a=\r\nffected by one&#39;s conditioning.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; People may use=\r\n whichever mantra/prayer they are attracted to. There are \n&gt; zillions of ma=\r\nntras one can use and scriptures give a small fraction of \n&gt; them. Maintain=\r\ning mental focus , having a deep sense of surrender to the \n&gt; supreme cosmi=\r\nc power, being able to accept the will of supreme cosmic \n&gt; power with ment=\r\nal equanimity and rooting out pride, anger, lust, \n&gt; jealosy, greed etc are=\r\n far important than which mantra one picks.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to clean a rea=\r\nlly dirty room with a lot of dirt on the \n&gt; floor, the shape, size and mate=\r\nrial of the broom used is not that \n&gt; important. Whichever broom one uses, =\r\none should ensure that it actually \n&gt; removes the dirt. If it becomes a sho=\r\nw off of one&#39;s beautiful broom, one \n&gt; will be thinking more of how beautif=\r\nul one&#39;s broom is and not wipe off \n&gt; the dirt hard enough. Instead, take w=\r\nhatever broom you have access to \n&gt; (and like) and wipe the dirt off hard w=\r\nith it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not that interested in fighting with someone trying to se=\r\nll another \n&gt; broom that he thinks is superior. I am happy with my broom. I=\r\n know that \n&gt; my room is dirty and I&#39;d rather spend my time cleaning my roo=\r\nm with the \n&gt; broom I picked, than fighting those salespeople or convince a=\r\nnybody that \n&gt; so and so broom is the best.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Dear PVR Narsimha Garu/Or other great sadhakas in the group,\n&gt; \n&gt; First, I=\r\n am NOT a &quot;great sadhaka&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, even a great sadhaka can hold wrong=\r\n views.\n&gt; \n&gt; Third, even a great sadhaka&#39;s wise views may be useless to som=\r\neone who \n&gt; cannot really grasp them (with all the subtleties) and digest t=\r\nhem well \n&gt; enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the bottomline is this: We all have views, shar=\r\ne them with others and \n&gt; try to get some benefit from the views of others.=\r\n But we should not be \n&gt; distracted into thinking that so and so person is =\r\na great sadhaka and \n&gt; hence his views are reliable, etc. Whoemever you rea=\r\nd and follow, there \n&gt; is NO substitute to individual sadhana that purifies=\r\n your thinking, \n&gt; attitude and instincts.\n&gt; \n&gt; The REAL answers that are r=\r\neally useful to you will only come from \n&gt; within you when you have digeste=\r\nd all relevant external inputs well.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if =\r\na child tells mother something in poor and broken grammar, \n&gt; mother will n=\r\not be disappointed. On the other hand, if a selfish child \n&gt; is playing opp=\r\nortunistic games with mother (e.g. being nice to extract \n&gt; some money from=\r\n her), she will notice it even if one is using perfect \n&gt; grammar and being=\r\n eloquent.
