I was actually thinking of picking some \nRigVedic hymn and sharing my interpretation with others this weekend. Now \nthat I got this mail from you, I will take up the Surya mantra.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThis mantra is a very popular mantra for worshipping Surya (Sun god). It is \nused in Navagraha homam and navagraha pooja as a part of Satya Narayana \nvratam. Parasara Maharshi (father of Veda Vyasa Maharshi) specified this \nmantra as a remedy for any problems related to Sun in the horoscope (see \n&quot;Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot;).\n\nMy interpretation may be different from what Sayana, Max Muller etc gave. \nEspecially when it comes to the second line, most scholars have interpreted \n&quot;ratha&quot; as chariot and alluded to Sun going around earth on a chariot. I \nhave a different Vedantic take on it. I know some Sanskrit, but it is the \ninner inspiration given by Mother Mahalakshmi that enables to interpret.\n\nMay erudite scholars ignore me if they find my interpretation faulty!\n\n*        *        *\n\nRigVeda 1.35.2\n\nAkR^iShNena rajasA vartamAno niveshayannamR^itaM martyaM ca |\nhiraNyayena savitA rathenAdevo yAti bhuvanAni pashyan ||\n\nvartamAnaH = existing (present)\nrajasA = with the light [though rajas is one of the three gunas, it also \nmeans light and energy]\nAkR^iShNa = extending till (including) darkness\nniveshayan = inhabiting/dwelling in/filling\namR^itaM = the imperishable [Brahman, the unmanifested potentiality]\nmartyaM ca = and the perishable too [all the manifestations of Brahman in \nthis universe perish]\nsavitA = the god Savita\nhiraNyayena = with the pure/golden essence of Brahman\nrathena = with desire/attachment [though ratha normally means a \nchariot/vehicle, it also means a desire. The word &quot;manoratha&quot; (manah+ratha) \ncomes from it. It means the desires and wishes of the heart. I prefer this \nmeaning here and not the normally taken &quot;chariot&quot;.]\nyAti = moves into\nAdevaH = all beings including gods\npashyan = experiencing [though pashyan basically means &quot;watching&quot;, it also \nmeans considering, perceiving and experiencing]\nbhuvanAni = all the worlds and the beings dwelling in it\n\nMeaning in Brief:\n\nExisting with all the light and the darkness, dwelling in the imperishable \nBrahman as well as the perishable creation, Savita, with the pure essence of \nBrahman and with the desire that causes movement in it (and results in \ncreation), moves into all beings including the gods and experiences through \nthem all the worlds and the beings of this diverse creation.\n\nDetailed Commentary:\n\nIf you study carefully, this verse gives the essence of Vedic philosophy. It \ncontains the essence of great scriptures such as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; and \n&quot;BhagavadGita&quot;, sooktas such as Purusha Sooktam and Narayana Sooktam and \nhymns such as Ganapathi Atharva Seersham. It is a very important hymn.\n\nSavita is the highest form of Surya. He is basically the supreme cosmic \nbeing. He is Atman, the pure spirit that fills the entire universe - the \ncreation as well as the uncreated. He is the pure light behind all the light \nand darkness that we see. Good and bad, gods and demons, pleasure and pain, \nall such dualities are but different manifestations of the same Brahman. The \nONE Brahman manifests as the duality and diverse beings.\n\nThe one Atman, which is but pure light, manifests as duality - as light and \ndarkness - and fills the entire universe. Savita dwells in Brahman as well \nas the entire perishable creation. Everything that has manifested has to \nperish. Savita dwells in all - in the imperishable Brahman as well as the \nperishable manifestations of Brahman (various worlds, gods, demons and other \nbeings).\n\nThe ONE pure light of Savita manifests as DIVERSE objects ranging all the \nway from pure light to darkness and fills all beings. With the pure and \nuntaintable essence of Brahman and the movement caused in Brahman due to \ndesire, Savita enters all the beings including gods. In other words, all the \nbeings are created from Brahman and the desire/movement in Brahman.\n\nVedanta teaches that Brahman is unmanifested pure consciousness. A part of \nBrahman causes movement in Brahman, which becomes a desire and gets \nfulfilled immediately. This results in the creation of various beings. The \nword &quot;ratha&quot; refers to this. The pure essence of Brahman (hiraNyaya) as well \nas the desire that caused a movement of thought in Brahman (ratha) enter all \nbeings. Savita enters all being as Shiva as well as Shakti!\n\nWhen all the desires come to a halt and the movement of mind stops, all \nbeings can experience the pure essence of Brahman that has entered them \n(i.e. sat-chid-ananda). When the desire is there, there are thoughts and \nmovement of mind and the beings do not experience the pure essence of \nBrahman that has entered them.\n\nThe hymn says that the pure essence of Brahman (Shiva) and the desire that \ncauses movement of thought (Shakti) are both aspects of ONE Savita only.\n\nSavita enters all the beings with the pure essence and the desire/thought \nand experiences the worlds and beings through them. If a person called \n&quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; exists, it is actually Savita who exists through him. If a \nperson called &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; experiences the entire world - various worlds \nand beings in those worlds - it is actually Savita who has entered him that \nexperiences the entire world through him!! All his thoughts, experiences and \nactions are actually those of Savita - the in-dwelling spirit.\n\nThis is the same as what Ganapathi Atharva Seersham means by &quot;tvameva \nkevalam kartAsi...&quot;. This is the same as what Krishna means when he tells \nArjuna in BhagavadGita that it is Krishna who acts through various beings \nand that the beings should not be deluded to think that they are doing \nthings.\n\nSavita in this hymn is represented as the same supreme cosmic being that is \nreferred in various other Vedic scriptures!\n\nMost authorities have interpreted the second line to mean that Sun goes on a \nchariot and watches the entire world. That is a gross interpretation and \nmisses the subtle and deeper meaning.\n\nIn fact, when Atman goes on the chariot (ratha) of desire (ratha), it moves \nand sees the diverse creation. When the chariot (ratha) stops, then the \ndesire (ratha) stops and there is no movement of thought. No longer a \ndiverse creation is perceived and there is only bliss of true being \n(sat-chid-ananda). Thus, even the gross chaiot interpretation is a metaphor \nfor the subtle interpretation given above!\n\nThis hymn is very important as it covers several important Vedantic \nconcepts:\n\n(1) The supreme cosmic being is one, but assumes duality.\n(2) The supreme cosmic being enters all the beings with the duality.\n(3) The supreme cosmic being experiences through all the beings.\n(4) The pure essence of supreme cosmic being enters all the beings and helps \nthem experience sat-chid-ananda.\n(5) The desire (movement of thought) in the supreme cosmic being enters all \nthe beings and results in movement of thought within them and diverse world \nexperiences.\n\n*        *        *\n\nYou asked about the counts, rules etc. Unfortunately, I am not an expert on \nthose. But I will say what I know.\n\nYou can chant this mantra as many times as you want. Parasara also mentions \noffering this mantra in fire (homam).\n\nImagine Sun god. Offer a mental obeisance to Hiranyasthoopa Angirasa \nMaharshi. Then, thinking of Sun god, whose effulgence fills the entire \nuniverse, read the mantra mentally with the correct intonation as many times \nas you can.\n\nThe goal of sadhana with any Vedic mantra is to become one with the mantra. \nThe goal is to lose one&#39;s self-consciousness so completely that the mantra \ncan fill one&#39;s entire existence. One can feel and &quot;experience&quot; the sound and \nmeaning of the mantra then.\n\nForget &quot;I&quot;, &quot;my body&quot;, &quot;my name&quot;, &quot;my senses&quot;, &quot;my experience&quot; completely \nand create a vacuum within, so that the mantra can fill the vacuum.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI now use the version from RigVeda. The audio on my website is quite old. It \nnot only has text errors, but pronunciation errors too. I will have to \nupdate all the planetary mantra mp3&#39;s on my website someday.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha (PVR)\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message -----\n&gt; Hi PVR,\n&gt; ...\n&gt; The information below is from a site that belongs to\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo followers. I went there to get the\n&gt; sandhya mantras. My question was about the surya\n&gt; mantra below, which I remember from your Vratham,\n&gt; about which I am having some keen interest recently.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.vedah.com/org2/literature/sandhya_mantras/conclusion.html\n&gt;\n&gt; From the site as well the Yajurveda Samhita(except\n&gt; that in the book with me, it is 3.4.11.6 or 7), the\n&gt; mantra is as follows:\n&gt; ***\n&gt; � satyena rajas� vartam�no niveshayannam�tam martyam\n&gt; cha\n&gt;\n&gt; hira�yayena savit� rathen�devo y�ti bhuvan� vipashyan\n&gt;\n&gt; [RV (1.35.2), KYV (3.4.11.2), SYV (33.43); (34.31)]\n&gt;\n&gt; Moving along the worlds of Truth duly establishing the\n&gt; immortal and the mortal,\n&gt;\n&gt; God Savitr comes in his golden car beholding the\n&gt; worlds.\n&gt; ***\n&gt;\n&gt; However, looking at the reference provided above of\n&gt; Rig Veda Samhita-1.35.2 the mantra has two\n&gt; differences.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. It was &#39;a krishnena&#39;(RV) for &#39;a satyena&#39;(KYV)\n&gt; 2. In line 2 it was &#39;bhunanani pashyan&#39;(RV) for\n&gt; &#39;bhuvana vipashyan&#39;(KYV)\n&gt; 3. Your site audio sounded -&#39;a satyena&#39;(as in\n&gt; KYV)...&#39;bhunanani pashyan&#39;(as in RV)\n&gt;\n&gt; Hence wanted to talk to you about this. I would be\n&gt; delighted to know the primary importance of this\n&gt; mantra also the rules and numbers?\n&gt;\n&gt; You can call me anytime. Talk to you later.\n&gt; Sreenu\n\n\n"}}
