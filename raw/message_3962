I was born on fix date..so\n&gt; as i am going to die on any fix =\r\ndate only.. it is all decided....\n&gt; Happiness, sorrows, success, praise, fa=\r\nilures everything about me\n&gt; is decided by god=A0 well in advance.. it is l=\r\nike a film.. my end\n&gt; is already decided.. but i amnot aware of this.. so D=\r\noing homam\n&gt; will help me changing my end?=A0 Whatever i am destined to get=\r\n.. i\n&gt; will get...\n\nOne can also say in the same vein: Do I have to go to w=\r\nork to everyday and earn money for my family? Happiness, sorrows, success, =\r\nfailure everything about me and my family is decided by god in advance. It =\r\nis like a film. Whether I work or not, whatever god has decided will happen=\r\n to my family. Whatever I and my family are destined to get, we will get. W=\r\nill my going to work or not going to work change things?\n\nOf course, one do=\r\nes not think that way. In fact, when one loses job, one tries hard to find =\r\na new job so that one&#39;s family does not suffer. What happened to the logic =\r\nthat &quot;everything about me is decided by god well in advance&quot;?\n\nWell, from o=\r\nne reference frame, everything may have been pre-decided. But you, I and mo=\r\nst people (including great yogis) do not have access to that reference fram=\r\ne. From where you stand, you have a free will using which you can engage in=\r\n actions. And you will later receive comparable reactions to those actions.=\r\n From where you stand, what actions you engage in is very important and dec=\r\nides your future. Of course, at the end, you may have performed an action o=\r\nr skipped an action only because god had already decided so. But you do try=\r\n to perform what you think is the best action for you, don&#39;t you? In the pr=\r\nevious example where one lost a job, won&#39;t one look for a new job?\n\nPerhaps=\r\n god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit at home and family w=\r\nill suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit a=\r\nt home and yet something will happen and family will do fine. Perhaps god h=\r\nas decided that one will look for a job, but not get a job and family will =\r\nsuffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job, get a job and=\r\n family will do fine.\n\nIt is absolutely true that whichever of the above go=\r\nd willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and suppose you have=\r\n a desired outcome (e.g. family not suffering) and want to maximize the cha=\r\nnce (calculated based on what you know in your reference frame) that your d=\r\nesired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical and intuitive minds to f=\r\nigure out the best action, in order to achieve the desired outcome. However=\r\n, given that you don&#39;t know what god willed and what will happen, you canno=\r\nt convince yourself that your desired outcome WILL happen. So do not cry la=\r\nter if it doesn&#39;t. Do the best you can and be prepared for any outcome as g=\r\nod decides the outcome.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nSuppose you a=\r\nre trying to sail your boat in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a really heavy =\r\nwind is blowing. You can leave it to the wind to take you there or you can =\r\nrow the boat actively. As wind changes your course, you constantly re-evalu=\r\nate how you should row and row the boat in such a way that you finally reac=\r\nh the bank. Because wind is so heavy and sometimes overcomes your rowing, y=\r\nou cannot say that your rowing is not needed. If you do not row well, wind =\r\nmay keep you going in circles within the ocean and you may not reach the ba=\r\nnk. You keep doing your best to row in the correct direction. If wind took =\r\nyou in a wrong direction, you do not stop rowing and start crying. Then win=\r\nd may push you further in a wrong direction! Irrespective of the outcome, t=\r\nhe best strategy is to keep re-evaluating how to row and keep rowing.\n\nIf y=\r\nou start rowing harder than before and yet wind is also blowing harder than=\r\n before and you are not making progress, do not stop rowing. If you do, you=\r\n may go back further. Keep rowing. Remember that wind does not blow the sam=\r\ne way always!!! If you keep rowing, your time will come when your rowing wi=\r\nll be productive. A time may also come when wind pushes you in the correct =\r\ndirection. So, just row row row your boat...\n\nPonder on this metaphor a lit=\r\ntle.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nThe same logic that applies to l=\r\nooking for a job above applies to doing homam and other spiritual sadhana. =\r\nDo they change your destiny? Yes, they do, in the same way looking for a jo=\r\nb actively when you are out of one does.\n\nPerhaps god has decided that one =\r\nwill not do sadhana and one will be stuck without any progress. Perhaps god=\r\n has decided that one will not do sadhana and yet something will happen and=\r\n one will make progress. Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana, =\r\nbut not make much progress in the next few years or lives. Perhaps god has =\r\ndecided that one will do sadhana and make good progress.\n\nIt is absolutely =\r\ntrue that whichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not=\r\n know it ahead and suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. spiritual progr=\r\ness) and want to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you know in =\r\nyour reference frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your=\r\n logical and intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in order to ach=\r\nieve the desired outcome. Do the best you can and be prepared for any outco=\r\nme as god decides the outcome.\n\nJust as searching for a job is a good strat=\r\negy in general for one without a job and wanting family not to suffer, doin=\r\ng spiritual sadhana such as homam and japam is a good strategy in general f=\r\nor one wanting to make spiritual progress.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 *\n\nI want to emphasize that spiritual progress does not mean giving up =\r\nfamily and their welfare. Spiritual progress means doing whatever dharma yo=\r\nu are doing now, but doing it better - doing it without attachment. Attachm=\r\nent to a result does not enable you to do better actions. Constant anxiety =\r\nregarding whether the desired result will happen or not will decrease one&#39;s=\r\n focus and stop one from operating at one&#39;s best. Decide your actions based=\r\n on a desired outcome, but with a complete realization that the outcome may=\r\n not be achieved even though your actions seem at this point of time to be =\r\nthe best possible actions to maximize the chance of that outcome.\n\nSuch a k=\r\narma yogi is always doing the best possible actions and wasting very little=\r\n time on worrying about things not in one&#39;s control. It is a very effective=\r\n strategy materially as well as spiritually!\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0=\r\n =A0 *\n\n&gt; I also would like to ask whether Spiritual progress requires\n&gt; sa=\r\ncrifice of material benefits & worldly pleasures ? Can&#39;t we have\n&gt; both?\n\nS=\r\npiritual progress and material success can co-exist. But spiritual progress=\r\n and attachment to (and worrying about) material success tend to pull one i=\r\nn different directions.\n\nDo not see world as a place where you seek pleasur=\r\nes or enjoyments, but see it mainly as a place where you *give* enjoyment t=\r\no others. Focus on giving. You may also *receive* pleasures in the bargain,=\r\n but do not strive for it or calculate it or focus your mind on it.\n\nWhat y=\r\nou give now is in your hands. What you get now is in god&#39;s hands and is dec=\r\nided based on what you gave earlier. What you give now decides what you wil=\r\nl receive later. Spiritual progress essentially means realizing this and fo=\r\ncusing the mind, its thoughts and actions on giving to the world, rather th=\r\nan receiving. Even as you focus your mind on giving, you will also receive =\r\nsome things. But exactly what they are is based on what you gave in the pas=\r\nt, which is water under the bridge, and hence you have no control over it n=\r\now. This is true irrespective of whether you are attached to what you recei=\r\nve or not.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nJust keep doing sadhana. M=\r\ny feeling is that you are one of the people who will make very good progres=\r\ns in coming years. Rome is not built in a day.\n\nMy intuition strongly tells=\r\n me that Vishnu homam is the best for you. If you want, you can keep doing =\r\noccasional Chandi homam like you are doing now. But why don&#39;t you consider =\r\nreplacing the daily Ganapathi homam with Vishnu homam? Learn Vishnu sahasra=\r\n naama stotra and do homam with it.

I was born on fix date..so&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; as i am going to die on any fix date only.. it is all decided....&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Happiness, sorrows, success, praise, failures everything about me&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; is decided by god&nbsp; well in advance.. it is like a film.. my end&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; is already decided.. but i amnot aware of this.. so Doing homam&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; will help me changing my end?&nbsp; Whatever i am destined to get.. i&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; will get...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One can also say in the same vein: Do I have to =\r\ngo to work to everyday and earn money for my family? Happiness, sorrows, su=\r\nccess, failure everything about me and my family is decided by god in advan=\r\nce. It is like a film. Whether I work or not, whatever god has decided will=\r\n happen to my family. Whatever I and my family are destined\n to get, we wil=\r\nl get. Will my going to work or not going to work change things?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of =\r\ncourse, one does not think that way. In fact, when one loses job, one tries=\r\n hard to find a new job so that one&#39;s family does not suffer. What happened=\r\n to the logic that &quot;everything about me is decided by god well in advance&quot;?=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, from one reference frame, everything may have been pre-decide=\r\nd. But you, I and most people (including great yogis) do not have access to=\r\n that reference frame. From where you stand, you have a free will using whi=\r\nch you can engage in actions. And you will later receive comparable reactio=\r\nns to those actions. From where you stand, what actions you engage in is ve=\r\nry important and decides your future. Of course, at the end, you may have p=\r\nerformed an action or skipped an action only because god had already decide=\r\nd so. But you do try to perform what you think is the best action for you, =\r\ndon&#39;t you? In the previous example where one lost a\n job, won&#39;t one look fo=\r\nr a new job?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perhaps god has decided that one will not look for a jo=\r\nb, sit at home and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one wil=\r\nl not look for a job, sit at home and yet something will happen and family =\r\nwill do fine. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job, but not=\r\n get a job and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will lo=\r\nok for a job, get a job and family will do fine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is absolutely tr=\r\nue that whichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not k=\r\nnow it ahead and suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. family not suffer=\r\ning) and want to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you know in =\r\nyour reference frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your=\r\n logical and intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in order to ach=\r\nieve the desired outcome. However, given that you don&#39;t know what god wille=\r\nd and what will happen, you cannot convince\n yourself that your desired out=\r\ncome WILL happen. So do not cry later if it doesn&#39;t. Do the best you can an=\r\nd be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outcome.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp; &n=\r\nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose you are tr=\r\nying to sail your boat in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a really heavy wind =\r\nis blowing. You can leave it to the wind to take you there or you can row t=\r\nhe boat actively. As wind changes your course, you constantly re-evaluate h=\r\now you should row and row the boat in such a way that you finally reach the=\r\n bank. Because wind is so heavy and sometimes overcomes your rowing, you ca=\r\nnnot say that your rowing is not needed. If you do not row well, wind may k=\r\neep you going in circles within the ocean and you may not reach the bank. Y=\r\nou keep doing your best to row in the correct direction. If wind took you i=\r\nn a wrong direction, you do not stop rowing and start crying. Then wind may=\r\n push you further in a wrong\n direction! Irrespective of the outcome, the b=\r\nest strategy is to keep re-evaluating how to row and keep rowing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If=\r\n you start rowing harder than before and yet wind is also blowing harder th=\r\nan before and you are not making progress, do not stop rowing. If you do, y=\r\nou may go back further. Keep rowing. Remember that wind does not blow the s=\r\name way always!!! If you keep rowing, your time will come when your rowing =\r\nwill be productive. A time may also come when wind pushes you in the correc=\r\nt direction. So, just row row row your boat...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ponder on this metaph=\r\nor a little.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbs=\r\np; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The same logic that applies to looking for a job above applies =\r\nto doing homam and other spiritual sadhana. Do they change your destiny? Ye=\r\ns, they do, in the same way looking for a job actively when you are out of =\r\none does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perhaps god has decided that one will not do sadhana and o=\r\nne will be stuck\n without any progress. Perhaps god has decided that one wi=\r\nll not do sadhana and yet something will happen and one will make progress.=\r\n Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana, but not make much progre=\r\nss in the next few years or lives. Perhaps god has decided that one will do=\r\n sadhana and make good progress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is absolutely true that whicheve=\r\nr of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and=\r\n suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. spiritual progress) and want to m=\r\naximize the chance (calculated based on what you know in your reference fra=\r\nme) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical and intui=\r\ntive minds to figure out the best action, in order to achieve the desired o=\r\nutcome. Do the best you can and be prepared for any outcome as god decides =\r\nthe outcome.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as searching for a job is a good strategy in gener=\r\nal for one without a job and wanting family not to suffer, doing spiritual =\r\nsadhana\n such as homam and japam is a good strategy in general for one want=\r\ning to make spiritual progress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;=\r\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I want to emphasize that spiritual progress =\r\ndoes not mean giving up family and their welfare. Spiritual progress means =\r\ndoing whatever dharma you are doing now, but doing it better - doing it wit=\r\nhout attachment. Attachment to a result does not enable you to do better ac=\r\ntions. Constant anxiety regarding whether the desired result will happen or=\r\n not will decrease one&#39;s focus and stop one from operating at one&#39;s best. D=\r\necide your actions based on a desired outcome, but with a complete realizat=\r\nion that the outcome may not be achieved even though your actions seem at t=\r\nhis point of time to be the best possible actions to maximize the chance of=\r\n that outcome.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Such a karma yogi is always doing the best possible a=\r\nctions and wasting very little time on worrying about things not in one&#39;s\n =\r\ncontrol. It is a very effective strategy materially as well as spiritually!=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; I also would like to ask whether Spiritual progress requires&lt;BR&gt;&gt; s=\r\nacrifice of material benefits &amp; worldly pleasures ? Can&#39;t we have&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; both?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spiritual progress and material success can co-exist. But s=\r\npiritual progress and attachment to (and worrying about) material success t=\r\nend to pull one in different directions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do not see world as a place=\r\n where you seek pleasures or enjoyments, but see it mainly as a place where=\r\n you *give* enjoyment to others. Focus on giving. You may also *receive* pl=\r\neasures in the bargain, but do not strive for it or calculate it or focus y=\r\nour mind on it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What you give now is in your hands. What you get now=\r\n is in god&#39;s hands and is decided based on what you gave earlier. What you =\r\ngive now decides what you will receive later. Spiritual progress\n essential=\r\nly means realizing this and focusing the mind, its thoughts and actions on =\r\ngiving to the world, rather than receiving. Even as you focus your mind on =\r\ngiving, you will also receive some things. But exactly what they are is bas=\r\ned on what you gave in the past, which is water under the bridge, and hence=\r\n you have no control over it now. This is true irrespective of whether you =\r\nare attached to what you receive or not.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp=\r\n; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just keep doing sadhana. My feeling=\r\n is that you are one of the people who will make very good progress in comi=\r\nng years. Rome is not built in a day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My intuition strongly tells me=\r\n that Vishnu homam is the best for you. If you want, you can keep doing occ=\r\nasional Chandi homam like you are doing now. But why don&#39;t you consider rep=\r\nlacing the daily Ganapathi homam with Vishnu homam? Learn Vishnu sahasra na=\r\nama stotra and do homam with it.
