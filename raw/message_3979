How ever, I have few observations reg=\r\narding the analogies.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. In all the anlogies, we know what it feels li=\r\nke when we reach the goal. We know what it is like to have a Job. We know w=\r\nhat it is like to reach the bank. We also know how made not reaching the go=\r\nal. No job, typically means no money and results normally in misery. No rea=\r\nching sea bank normally means death out of starvation. But, the same is not=\r\n the case with spiritual jouney.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most of us do not know what it is to =\r\nsee God. After all, if I finally realise and God and merge, there is no mor=\r\ne happyness/sadness. It is supposed to be a state of Nirguna. Also, we hear=\r\n so much that we should strive to treat happyness/saddness, praise/disgrace=\r\n equally. If one can react to sadness as one do to happyness, there is no f=\r\nurther problem. God or no God, such a state is definitely good to be in. Bu=\r\nt, this also means, I do not enjoy happyness. What is the difference betwee=\r\nn an non living being and me in such a case?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In sea, when you have =\r\nto row a long distance to reach a bank, you have limited energy left with y=\r\nou. So, the key is not to loose hope and courageand reevaluate the strategy=\r\n to reach the bank faster. At times, it may be best to sleep that row again=\r\nst wind. The key to to get maximum return for the energy you spend since yo=\r\nu have limited energy left with you. It depends how close you are from bank=\r\n. If I can see bank, then perhaps rowing with my full strength may be a goo=\r\nd idea, but, if I know for sure, I am very far from bank, I am bettere off =\r\nletting wind take me some where and concentrate on surving for longer - I m=\r\nay use my strength to find some food for me than rowing and weaking myself.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Vijay\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimh=\r\na PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Rajesh,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Let me change the=\r\n track from homam to material things, in order to address the &quot;god decides =\r\neverything&quot; notion.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What i am trying to ask you here is..

Whatever i am destined to get.. =\r\ni\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will get...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; One can also say in the same vein: Do I have =\r\nto go to work to everyday and earn money for my family? Happiness, sorrows,=\r\n success, failure everything about me and my family is decided by god in ad=\r\nvance. It is like a film. Whether I work or not, whatever god has decided w=\r\nill happen to my family. Whatever I and my family are destined to get, we w=\r\nill get. Will my going to work or not going to work change things?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Of course, one does not think that way. In fact, when one loses job, one =\r\ntries hard to find a new job so that one&#39;s family does not suffer. What hap=\r\npened to the logic that &quot;everything about me is decided by god well in adva=\r\nnce&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Well, from one reference frame, everything may have been pr=\r\ne-decided. But you, I and most people (including great yogis) do not have a=\r\nccess to that reference frame. From where you stand, you have a free will u=\r\nsing which you can engage in actions. And you will later receive comparable=\r\n reactions to those actions. From where you stand, what actions you engage =\r\nin is very important and decides your future. Of course, at the end, you ma=\r\ny have performed an action or skipped an action only because god had alread=\r\ny decided so. But you do try to perform what you think is the best action f=\r\nor you, don&#39;t you? In the previous example where one lost a job, won&#39;t one =\r\nlook for a new job?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps god has decided that one will not loo=\r\nk for a job, sit at home and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided th=\r\nat one will not look for a job, sit at home and yet something will happen a=\r\nnd family will do fine. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a jo=\r\nb, but not get a job and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that o=\r\nne will look for a job, get a job and family will do fine.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It is =\r\nabsolutely true that whichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose=\r\n you do not know it ahead and suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. fami=\r\nly not suffering) and want to maximize the chance (calculated based on what=\r\n you know in your reference frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then,=\r\n you use your logical and intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in=\r\n order to achieve the desired outcome. However, given that you don&#39;t know w=\r\nhat god willed and what will happen, you cannot convince yourself that your=\r\n desired outcome WILL happen. So do not cry later if it doesn&#39;t. Do the bes=\r\nt you can and be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Suppose you are trying to sail your boat=\r\n in the ocean to a bank. Suppose a really heavy wind is blowing. You can le=\r\nave it to the wind to take you there or you can row the boat actively. As w=\r\nind changes your course, you constantly re-evaluate how you should row and =\r\nrow the boat in such a way that you finally reach the bank. Because wind is=\r\n so heavy and sometimes overcomes your rowing, you cannot say that your row=\r\ning is not needed. If you do not row well, wind may keep you going in circl=\r\nes within the ocean and you may not reach the bank. You keep doing your bes=\r\nt to row in the correct direction. If wind took you in a wrong direction, y=\r\nou do not stop rowing and start crying. Then wind may push you further in a=\r\n wrong direction! Irrespective of the outcome, the best strategy is to keep=\r\n re-evaluating how to row and keep rowing.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If you start rowing ha=\r\nrder than before and yet wind is also blowing harder than before and you ar=\r\ne not making progress, do not stop rowing. If you do, you may go back furth=\r\ner. Keep rowing. Remember that wind does not blow the same way always!!! If=\r\n you keep rowing, your time will come when your rowing will be productive. =\r\nA time may also come when wind pushes you in the correct direction. So, jus=\r\nt row row row your boat...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ponder on this metaphor a little.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The same logic that applies to looking =\r\nfor a job above applies to doing homam and other spiritual sadhana. Do they=\r\n change your destiny? Yes, they do, in the same way looking for a job activ=\r\nely when you are out of one does.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps god has decided that on=\r\ne will not do sadhana and one will be stuck without any progress. Perhaps g=\r\nod has decided that one will not do sadhana and yet something will happen a=\r\nnd one will make progress. Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana=\r\n, but not make much progress in the next few years or lives. Perhaps god ha=\r\ns decided that one will do sadhana and make good progress.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It is =\r\nabsolutely true that whichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose=\r\n you do not know it ahead and suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. spir=\r\nitual progress) and want to maximize the chance (calculated based on what y=\r\nou know in your reference frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, y=\r\nou use your logical and intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in o=\r\nrder to achieve the desired outcome. Do the best you can and be prepared fo=\r\nr any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Just as searching for a=\r\n job is a good strategy in general for one without a job and wanting family=\r\n not to suffer, doing spiritual sadhana such as homam and japam is a good s=\r\ntrategy in general for one wanting to make spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I want to emphasize that spiritual progress doe=\r\ns not mean giving up family and their welfare. Spiritual progress means doi=\r\nng whatever dharma you are doing now, but doing it better - doing it withou=\r\nt attachment. Attachment to a result does not enable you to do better actio=\r\nns. Constant anxiety regarding whether the desired result will happen or no=\r\nt will decrease one&#39;s focus and stop one from operating at one&#39;s best. Deci=\r\nde your actions based on a desired outcome, but with a complete realization=\r\n that the outcome may not be achieved even though your actions seem at this=\r\n point of time to be the best possible actions to maximize the chance of th=\r\nat outcome.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Such a karma yogi is always doing the best possible a=\r\nctions and wasting very little time on worrying about things not in one&#39;s c=\r\nontrol. It is a very effective strategy materially as well as spiritually!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I also would like to ask whether =\r\nSpiritual progress requires\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sacrifice of material benefits & worldly =\r\npleasures ? Can&#39;t we have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; both?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual progress and mate=\r\nrial success can co-exist. But spiritual progress and attachment to (and wo=\r\nrrying about) material success tend to pull one in different directions.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Do not see world as a place where you seek pleasures or enjoyments,=\r\n but see it mainly as a place where you *give* enjoyment to others. Focus o=\r\nn giving. You may also *receive* pleasures in the bargain, but do not striv=\r\ne for it or calculate it or focus your mind on it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; What you give =\r\nnow is in your hands. What you get now is in god&#39;s hands and is decided bas=\r\ned on what you gave earlier. What you give now decides what you will receiv=\r\ne later. Spiritual progress essentially means realizing this and focusing t=\r\nhe mind, its thoughts and actions on giving to the world, rather than recei=\r\nving. Even as you focus your mind on giving, you will also receive some thi=\r\nngs. But exactly what they are is based on what you gave in the past, which=\r\n is water under the bridge, and hence you have no control over it now. This=\r\n is true irrespective of whether you are attached to what you receive or no=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Just keep doing sadhana. My feel=\r\ning is that you are one of the people who will make very good progress in c=\r\noming years. Rome is not built in a day.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; My intuition strongly te=\r\nlls me that Vishnu homam is the best for you. If you want, you can keep doi=\r\nng occasional Chandi homam like you are doing now. But why don&#39;t you consid=\r\ner replacing the daily Ganapathi homam with Vishnu homam? Learn Vishnu saha=\r\nsra naama stotra and do homam with it.

Eventually, when that=\r\n man has lost everything and everyone he knows has deserted him, he has no =\r\nalternative but to remember Krishna and get lost in His bewitching eyes.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The person immediately infomed about this and i tho=\r\nught of putting it on the list.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jay Shri Krishna\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
