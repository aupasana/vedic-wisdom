I have been trying hard to recite Durga s=\r\nuktam for the past 1 week or so and not been able to master the correct int=\r\nonation. Probably I will do it a few more attempts. As a child I was always=\r\n drawn to fire rituals (homams, yagnas) . We had the namboodiri regularly c=\r\nome to our home for Ganapathy homam and also Bhagavathy Seva which is a tra=\r\nditional kerala pooja conducted for Bhagavathy using elaborate=A0rangoli fo=\r\nr =A0durga padmam, Sri chakram =A0and using the deepam for devi pooja . Lal=\r\nitha Sahasranama would be used along with Trishati for performing the pooja=\r\n. I would join in for the recitation even as a child.\n\nI still remember pes=\r\ntering the Namboodiri to teach me the procedure for Ganapathy Homam and wha=\r\nt he said at that time makes lot of sense now, even though I got put off th=\r\nen. He said &quot;Kutty (Malayalam word for a small kid)=A0 when you are ready a=\r\nnd when the time is ripe you will know the method&quot;..=A0 I am=A0fortunate to=\r\n have found the right guidance in this group. I stay in Pune not very far f=\r\nrom Mumbai and Hope to meet Rajarshi some day so that I can learn a few thi=\r\nngs from him. \n\nAnother thought that has come to my mind quite often is per=\r\nforming group Homams in places where we have members from this group where =\r\nall the members can come toghether and each person can perform homam in the=\r\nir own Havan kunds at a common place.
