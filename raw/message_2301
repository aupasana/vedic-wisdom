A frog lived in a well. It had lived=\r\n there for a long time.\nIt was born there and brought up there, and yet was=\r\n a little, small frog. Of\ncourse the evolutionists were not there then to t=\r\nell us whether the frog\nlost its eyes or not, but, for our story&#39;s sake, we=\r\n must take it for granted\nthat it had its eyes, and that it every day clean=\r\nsed the water of all the\nworms and bacilli that lived in it with an energy =\r\nthat would do credit to\nour modern bacteriologists. In this way it went on =\r\nand became a little sleek\nand fat. Well, one day another frog that lived in=\r\n the sea came and fell into\nthe well.\n\n&quot;Where are you from?&quot;\n\n&quot;I am from th=\r\ne sea.&quot;\n\n&quot;The sea! How big is that? Is it as big as my well?&quot; and he took a=\r\n leap from\none side of the well to the other.\n\n&quot;My friend,&quot; said the frog o=\r\nf the sea, &quot;how do you compare the sea with your\nlittle well?=94\n\nThen the =\r\nfrog took another leap and asked, &quot;Is your sea so big?&quot;\n\n&quot;What nonsense you=\r\n speak, to compare the sea with your well!&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, then,&quot; said the frog of=\r\n the well, &quot;nothing can be bigger than my\nwell; there can be nothing bigger=\r\n than this; this fellow is a liar, so turn\nhim out.&quot;\n\nThat has been the dif=\r\nficulty all the while.\n\nI am a Hindu. I am sitting in my own little well an=\r\nd thinking that the whole\nworld is my little well. The Christian sits in hi=\r\ns little well and thinks\nthe whole world is his well. The Mohammedan sits i=\r\nn his little well and\nthinks that is the whole world.
