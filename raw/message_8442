The =\r\nthought of Vishnu turning on his watery resting place and glancing in this =\r\ndirection is rather sweet. You&#39;ve motivated me to do the mantra with even m=\r\nore enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for help with this.....=\r\n.Ramakrishna says you have to keep tugging at Her sari till she gives you s=\r\nomething vaguely worthwhile like devotion.\n\nVery interesting to hear of you=\r\nr experience in Delhi. I agree that the Name provides protection against do=\r\ndgy situations. I don&#39;t like to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I&#39;m emba=\r\nrrassed to say that have always been scared of the dark since childhood, sl=\r\nowly getting over it now. \n\nOnce at university, around 7 years ago, I was p=\r\nreparing for some exams. It was after term-time and I had stayed back to re=\r\nvise.  I was moved to a room that was different to the one I had been stayi=\r\nng in, as my usual room was being used for some conference guests. I used t=\r\no hang out with the Hare Krishnas then, and was really into chanting the Ha=\r\nre Rama mahamantra then (still love this mantra, but chant Om Namo Narayana=\r\nya more now)- used to do 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. \n\nI was ly=\r\ning on my back in this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in so=\r\nme sort of light sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty sensation th=\r\nat can only be described as something or someone trying really hard to stra=\r\nngle me! I felt very frightened, and couldn&#39;t move, speak or wake myself up=\r\n.\n\nIn this state, my mind started repeating &quot;Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, Hari&quot; v=\r\nery very fast in terror. I think I chose this name because it was short and=\r\n I could say it very fast with concentration! The frightening experience th=\r\nen passed and I felt the Name saved me.\n\nI woke up and turned on the light =\r\nfeeling absolutely petrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then did som=\r\nething I wouldn&#39;t normally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in London a=\r\nt that time of night (I knew they don&#39;t sleep till about midnight as I&#39;ve s=\r\ntayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who=\r\n initiated me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she ve=\r\nry kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it could have been some=\r\n real negative force or just something from my imagination. Either way, she=\r\n reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating th=\r\ne Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting before bedtime to avo=\r\nid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra before=\r\n going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light though on because=\r\n I&#39;m a coward ;).\n\nSince then, I keep up the practice of repeating the Name=\r\n before bedtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings positi=\r\nve Divine energy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAparna=\r\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0He=\r\nllo,\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Thanks for writing this m=\r\nail and the=C2=A0link to to the article.=C2=A0.=C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This is a =\r\nvery powerful and sacred mantra and I am sure regular japa=C2=A0brings peac=\r\ne and protection. Some years back I went to Delhi for few days and stayed a=\r\nt my friend&#39;s house which was on fifth floor. The building was new and he t=\r\nold me after he moved in with his family they had done big haven of this ma=\r\nntra.\n&gt; During night before I went to sleep I was trying to do=C2=A0a eye o=\r\npen meditation and was in a slight trance.Suddenly I noticed some spirits/e=\r\nntities were trying to come in the room through window but they could not c=\r\nome as there was a covering of white light there.

You are doing such a intense workout with your everyday nor=\r\nmal life and it is making Divine Lord take a turn on His Waterbed in Milk O=\r\ncean and take a look towards earth plane.

It is weird to =\r\nsee how the body loses all importance the moment it dies. It is also strang=\r\ne how a dead body looks just like an empty house...exactly like someone jus=\r\nt left. It certainly makes one think that there must be something more to u=\r\ns than this fleshy cage. This cage that becomes unattractive in old age, fi=\r\nlled with appalling miseries in serious illness, and hideous in death. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; It is interesting to think about what one can do to help the sick and dyi=\r\nng, when they reach a stage beyond all human aid. It is not pleasant to wat=\r\nch someone die while feeling utterly helpless to relieve suffering. \n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\nivananda used to have great faith in the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divine N=\r\namapathy&quot;. While modern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc all have their place,=\r\n he used to say that, Namapathy was an outstanding way to prevent disease a=\r\nnd heal us on all levels- physical, mental and spiritual. \n&gt; \n&gt; While he sa=\r\nid all names of God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often ment=\r\nioned the Mahamrityunjaya mantra specially for healing purposes. And especi=\r\nally for those who are very sick or dying.\n&gt; \n&gt; He says &quot;Maha Mrityunjaya M=\r\nantra will remove accidents, incurable diseases and bestow long life and im=\r\nmortality. It is a Moksha Mantra too.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I visited the Sivananda Charita=\r\nble hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu some years ago, and the doctors and =\r\nnurses who work there, start the day with chanting of mantras (including th=\r\ne Mahamrityunjaya) for their patients, each other and the whole world. I be=\r\nlieve it is the same with the little Ashram hospital in Rishikesh. What a w=\r\nonderful way to start the day.....repeating mantras with your colleagues. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to mention the power of this mantra for anyone who knows peop=\r\nle who are sick/seriously ill (or indeed, if you yourself are unfortunately=\r\n unwell). It is simply to invoke the blessing of God to ease suffering, or =\r\nto help bear suffering better. Basically saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because =\r\nYou know what is best. Of course it is NOT asking for a miracle cure (unles=\r\ns that happens to be the Will of God). \n&gt; \n&gt; At any point in time, there ar=\r\ne several human beings, animals and various creatures who are dying, and un=\r\nfortunately suffering greatly during the process of dying. I think it would=\r\n be nice to repeat this mantra a few times daily to reduce their misery. Ou=\r\nr sages say it works, and I believe them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a link for those wh=\r\no are interested in learning more about this great mantra. The article is w=\r\nritten by a disciple of Swami Satyananda, a saint of very recent times. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.shtml\n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt; \n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!

I felt very frightened, and couldn&#39;t =\r\nmove, speak or wake myself up.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn this state, my mind started repe=\r\nating &quot;Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, Hari&quot; very very fast in terror. I think I cho=\r\nse this name because it was short and I could say it very fast with concent=\r\nration! The frightening experience then passed and I felt the Name saved me=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI woke up and turned on the light feeling absolutely petrified a=\r\nnd unable to go back to sleep. I then did something I wouldn&#39;t normally do.=\r\n I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in London at that time of night (I knew t=\r\nhey don&#39;t sleep till about midnight as I&#39;ve stayed there) and had the nerve=\r\n to ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who initiated me into my chosen m=\r\nantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she very kindly came to the phone an=\r\nd reassured me saying it could have been some real negative force or just s=\r\nomething from my imagination. Either way, she reassured me saying I had don=\r\ne nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating the Name was the right approach.=\r\n She suggested chanting before bedtime to avoid similar experiences. I then=\r\n chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra before going to bed and slept fine (=\r\nhad to sleep with the light though on because I&#39;m a coward ;).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSin=\r\nce then, I keep up the practice of repeating the Name before bedtime. I fee=\r\nl it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings positive Divine energy to my=\r\n mind ensuring better sleep. :)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest wishes,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAparna&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Th=\r\nanks for writing this mail and the&nbsp;link to to the article.&nbsp;.&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This is a very powerful and sacred mantra and I =\r\nam sure regular japa&nbsp;brings peace and protection. Some years back I we=\r\nnt to Delhi for few days and stayed at my friend&#39;s house which was on fifth=\r\n floor. The building was new and he told me after he moved in with his fami=\r\nly they had done big haven of this mantra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; During night before I w=\r\nent to sleep I was trying to do&nbsp;a eye open meditation and was in a sli=\r\nght trance.Suddenly I noticed some spirits/entities were trying to come in =\r\nthe room through window but they could not come as there was a covering of =\r\nwhite light there. I knew immediately it is the effect of that haven in the=\r\n house. Now in the link article same thing is mentioned as a psychic shield=\r\n. Probably&nbsp;this shield &nbsp;was all round the&nbsp;.building but more=\r\n&nbsp;so on fifth floor.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In your previous mail you=\r\n have said how you are doing mantra japa to complete the required number. Y=\r\nou are doing such a intense workout with your everyday normal life and it i=\r\ns making Divine Lord take a turn on His Waterbed in Milk Ocean and take a l=\r\nook towards earth plane. Did you know this?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And what will happen w=\r\nhen you are holding phone and pretending and it actually rings. Your workma=\r\nte will know your secret.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; LaxmiNa=\r\nrayan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ______________________________=\r\n__&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, 25 June 2012, 19:37&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Mahamrityunjaya and Divine Namapathy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Greet=\r\nings,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hope you&#39;re all well, and that your sadhanas are g=\r\noing fantastically well (especially after we all told each other to get ver=\r\nrrry serious). &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve had a gruelling few shifts in hospi=\r\ntal the last few days, including witnessing some unfortunately inevitable d=\r\neaths in very sick people...something that has become part of my daily life=\r\n as a doctor. It is weird to see how the body loses all importance the mome=\r\nnt it dies. It is also strange how a dead body looks just like an empty hou=\r\nse...exactly like someone just left. It certainly makes one think that ther=\r\ne must be something more to us than this fleshy cage. This cage that become=\r\ns unattractive in old age, filled with appalling miseries in serious illnes=\r\ns, and hideous in death. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is interesting to think abo=\r\nut what one can do to help the sick and dying, when they reach a stage beyo=\r\nnd all human aid. It is not pleasant to watch someone die while feeling utt=\r\nerly helpless to relieve suffering. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sivananda used to h=\r\nave great faith in the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divine Namapathy&quot;. While m=\r\nodern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, he used to say th=\r\nat, Namapathy was an outstanding way to prevent disease and heal us on all =\r\nlevels- physical, mental and spiritual. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; While he said a=\r\nll names of God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentione=\r\nd the Mahamrityunjaya mantra specially for healing purposes. And especially=\r\n for those who are very sick or dying.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He says &quot;Maha Mri=\r\ntyunjaya Mantra will remove accidents, incurable diseases and bestow long l=\r\nife and immortality. It is a Moksha Mantra too.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I visit=\r\ned the Sivananda Charitable hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu some years a=\r\ngo, and the doctors and nurses who work there, start the day with chanting =\r\nof mantras (including the Mahamrityunjaya) for their patients, each other a=\r\nnd the whole world. I believe it is the same with the little Ashram hospita=\r\nl in Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to start the day.....repeating mantras=\r\n with your colleagues. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I wanted to mention the power of=\r\n this mantra for anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or ind=\r\need, if you yourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the =\r\nblessing of God to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Basica=\r\nlly saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because You know what is best. Of course it i=\r\ns NOT asking for a miracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will of God)=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; At any point in time, there are several human beings,=\r\n animals and various creatures who are dying, and unfortunately suffering g=\r\nreatly during the process of dying. I think it would be nice to repeat this=\r\n mantra a few times daily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it works, a=\r\nnd I believe them. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Here is a link for those who are int=\r\nerested in learning more about this great mantra. The article is written by=\r\n a disciple of Swami Satyananda, a saint of very recent times. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.yogamag.ne=\r\nt/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.shtml&quot;&gt;http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/aja=\r\nn07/mrit.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Aparn=\r\na&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
