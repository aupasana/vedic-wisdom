I will not be able to send too many mails from here. I will write some quick points on this topic.\n \nApart from the link given by Ravi, another relevant article is:\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/757\n \nIt talks about the best way to chant a mantra when doing japam vs when doing homam. Please read it.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSome people chant Gayatri mantra loud, while many traditional people do it silently.\n \nIf one has experienced something with a mantra and chants it loud and lets other people hear it, some of the shakti is transmitted to other people. It is for this reason that getting a mantra from a guru&#39;s mouth is considered useful (assuming that guru has accumulated some shakti with the mantra).\n \nIt is always a good idea to keep some mantras to yourself, as you do sadhana. In my case, Savitru Gayatri mantra gives me spiritual food and I am selfish with just that mantra.\n \nWhich mantras to say loud and share with all and which mantras to keep personal can be an individual decision. It depends on which mantras are giving you some results.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhen I chant Gayatri mantra in japam, I chant it without lips or vocal cords having ANY motion. Of course, still someone can &quot;listen&quot;. For example, when I met my guru in 2005, he made me do japam in front of him and made a correction at the end. Gross sound is heard using gross perception (ears) and subtle sound is heard using subtle perception.\n \nWhen I offer Gayatri mantra in fire, I chant it with a small movement of vocal cords. Some minimal vaikhari sound is produced. It is enough for the external fire to hear (at the gross level), but not enough for most people to hear with their ears. Though I am spending some energy in producing vaikhari sound (as opposed to using all the energy for producing subtler levels), it is not a wastage. This small vaikhari sound reaches fire and fire then magnifies it. The subtle sound generated by fire is higher than the subtle sound I can generate normally.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs Ajit correctly said, adding swaahaa to veda mantras may require some modification of intonation at the end. As he advised, seek advice from elders or gurus. If that is not possible, I suggest adding swaahaa after a small break. Say the mantra, then give a small break and then say &quot;swaahaa&quot;. In the case of Gayatri mantra, I can suggest the following:\n \n&quot;Om &lt;small break&gt; tatsavitur .... prachodayaat &lt;small break&gt; Om swaahaa&quot;\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \n---- Ravi Poruri &lt;rporuri@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Vijay,\n&gt;      Narasimha said it is generally recommended by many to read out mantra loud during Homa, but according to him, even if you are chanting the mantra almost mentally, there should be a minimum sound produced, atleast by way of the movement of lips.

I thought the entire homam can be done with out making sound if we can do it. Once you get the mantra, it is much easier when we pronounce it loud. It takes much more effort to pronounce it completely mentally while keeping the correct swara.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were times when many of the mantras were secret (one may recall the story of Ramanuja giving out Om Namoe Narayanaaya to all. It was kept a secret for a long time).\n&gt; \n&gt; All the mantras are making our conversation with the gods during the mantra. The communication with Gods is at thought level and physical plane is not required.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, if ones internal fire is very strong, then even physical fire may not be really required. How ever, the internal fire in most of us is perhaps very weak.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Vijay\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Vijay\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Ravi Poruri &lt;rporuri@... &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;       The general rule is that any mantra chanting during a homam should be\n&gt; &gt; loud, atleast there should be little sound. However, this rule\n&gt; &gt; does not apply to Gayatri Mantra.\n&gt; &gt;       You can chant Gayatri mantra while offerings are made in any Homam, Mahaganapathi, Chandi, Srikrishna etc, but in mind only. You can infact do a seperate homa for Savitru Gayatri consisting entirely of Gayatra Mantra. \n&gt; &gt;       When you offer naivedyam, when you do praanayama etc also, do it mentally. That&#39;s what I meant when I said to keep it to oneself at all times.\n&gt; &gt;       Hope it&#39;s clear now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Ravi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ____________ _________ _________ __\n&gt; &gt; From: suvarnatejas &lt;suvarnatejas@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, March 15, 2009 10:11:33 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Gayatri Mantra in Homam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Ravi:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However in the Mahaganapati homam audio, Shri PVR recommends\n&gt; &gt; offering  Gayatri mantra  to the fire.
