It represents ParaB=\r\nrahma. Other beejas like those in navarna mantra are saguna beejas and they=\r\n represent combinations of specific qualities. Adding Om at the beginning o=\r\nf a mantra is like thinking of ParaBrahma and then thinking of a specific d=\r\neity or form in relation to ParaBrahma. In tradition, Om is invariably adde=\r\nd at the beginning of every mantra, if it is not already there.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen you think of a specific form such as Mahakali or Sri Rama or Narasimha =\r\nor Saraswati or Tara or Dakshinamurthy etc, it is possible to see them as f=\r\norms representing certain qualities or as forms emanating from ParaBrahma a=\r\nnd representing certain qualities. Thinking of ParaBrahma will keep the not=\r\nion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot;, which is the corner stone of Self-knowledge, as =\r\na part of one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Some people actually consider it &quot;risky&quot;=\r\n to do mantras starting with other beejas and add Om. This is basically lik=\r\ne making Self-knowledge the fundamental goal of sadhana and remembering it =\r\nalways, so that you do not risk getting swayed by other goals (like specifi=\r\nc abilities, siddhis etc).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; As for navarna mantra, one can do it w=\r\nith or without Om. Both are fine. But do ponder on the above and do what yo=\r\nu find appropriate.
