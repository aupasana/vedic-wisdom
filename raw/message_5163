But, some may apply the word of Devi to just ch=\r\nanting the saptashati and maintain that chanting the navarna mantra contain=\r\ning beejas requires initiation. Thus, those who insist on initiation can st=\r\nill do, despite your quote.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one has a se=\r\nnse of surrender and does one&#39;s sadhana with humility, without expecting an=\r\ny specific results, one is then safe - initiation or no initiation. That is=\r\n the bottomline in my firm view.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The very understanding that spiritua=\r\nl sadhana is as a fundamental need as eating, drinking and breathing, that =\r\none should surrender to god and do sadhana with humility, and that one shou=\r\nld not expect specific results and leave things to god, is a good initiatio=\r\nn in any sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As one&#39;s sadhana progresses, some blocking karmas a=\r\nre burnt by the deity and some spillage during the process will have to be =\r\nexperienced by the sadhaka, initiation or no initiation. Do sadhana and acc=\r\nept what comes your way as the prasad from Him/Her. Eventually, you will pr=\r\nogress. Sometimes what seems like a bad thing can actually bring good. We h=\r\nave limited visibility, but God knows everything.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you want a slow =\r\npath with minimal spillage, pick a soumya devata. If you want a fast path w=\r\nith possibly more spillage, pick an ugra devata.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Narayan Iyer, one of the list members, was initiated into a Kaali man=\r\ntra by a learned priest in late 2005. After finishing the sadhana with it, =\r\nhe lost his job. Instead of worrying, he took it as a sign that that sadhan=\r\na was working! He did not even submit his resume anywhere, took a break and=\r\n went to India for a long pilgrimage. While on that trip, he joined Manish =\r\nand me for the Shata Chandi homam at Kalikambal temple in Chennai in March =\r\n2006. He happened to be the only person present when the Divine Mother appe=\r\nared before Manish and gave a command to spread simple homam procedures. He=\r\n had a crucial role in the creation of &quot;do it yourself&quot; homam manuals that =\r\nare now helping so many people do a homam by themselves everyday or every w=\r\neek!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Several hundred years ago, it would ha=\r\nve been unfathomable to find books openly giving navarna mantra, Siddha Kun=\r\njika stotra, Gayatri mantra, Lakshmi Narayana Hridayas etc. Nature is slowl=\r\ny opening up avenues for good sadhakas coming in future to find out things =\r\nby themselves. In future times, there will be people who have great potenti=\r\nal as sadhakas but having limited access to formal religious and spiritual =\r\ninstitutions, i.e. deeply desirous of worshipping god but not knowing how t=\r\no. On the other hand, there will be people who have easy access to knowledg=\r\ne, but not having interest or potential.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is actually happening alr=\r\neady to an extent. Many brahmanas who know how to do various rituals are di=\r\nsinterested in them and pursue money and fame. Some inquisitive and spirite=\r\nd young people who were thirsty for spiritual knowledge and spiritual progr=\r\ness, but not knowing how to do any sadhana, including how to even light a l=\r\namp, are now doing daily Chandi homam (or some other homam) by themselves.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons,=\r\n Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Film=\r\ns that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;=\r\n wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Satya Prakashji, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wonderful reply and the link. =\r\nSo essentially I am interpreting the verse in the following manner after al=\r\nl this discussion. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Better to do Chandi Path and Homa (or any o=\r\nther sadhana) than not doing at all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. If one is attracted to Cha=\r\nndi Path and/or Homa, instead of waiting for initiation and not doing anyth=\r\ning, it is better to get started and practise the same until you get initia=\r\ntion on Someday in some life, which is bound to happen due to boundless aff=\r\nection of Ma anyway. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. After getting started and practising for =\r\nany length of time, one should not get carried away by the feeling of doer-=\r\nship and keep doing with a feeling of surrender, which I think is the harde=\r\nst part. Even doing Ganapati homam regularly, sometimes gives me a superior=\r\nity feeling and holier-than-thou attitude, when I quickly remember of Shri =\r\nPVR Garu, to come back to my senses. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BTW, I came across a book on=\r\n Bhagavadgita by Shri Vidyaprakashanandagiri in Telugu. The book is called =\r\n&quot;geeta makarandamu&quot;. In this wonderful book he not only gave meanings and i=\r\nnterpretations of Geeta but he even gave specific ways practising several d=\r\neekshas with several slokas of Geeta and specific yantrams. Being a peethad=\r\nhipati and excellent pravachana kartha, this great man did not include any =\r\ncautionary statements about initiation or Upadesha on these practises. So, =\r\nI am thinking of practising the same when the appropriate time comes, assum=\r\ning that initiation is not needed. If any seniors in this forum have gone t=\r\nhrough this book or have more knowledge on the same, I will be happy if the=\r\ny share their knowledge/opinions on the same. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNagraj \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr Satya Prakash&quot; &lt;b=\r\nacktocosmicroots@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nagraj ji,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am wondering why people are not discussing about my question=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no. 1 in mail to Shri Satya Prakash Garu. Is something inherently &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nwrong with question itself? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; No sir. There is nothing w=\r\nrong with the question itself. In fact it is a very good question in view o=\r\nf the big picture.   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whilst the Devi is assuring us th=\r\nat She will fondly accept all acts of worship, sacrificial offerings and ho=\r\nmas whether they are done with appropriate knowledge or not, Her assurance =\r\nneed not be taken as *permission* to dispense with knowledge of the same. S=\r\nhe is proclaiming just as Lord Krishna too proclaims in the B. Gita,&quot;Aham h=\r\ni sarvayajnanam bhokta ca prabhur eva ca&quot; (9.24) and &quot;Patram puspam phalam =\r\ntoyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati...&quot; (9.28). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most of the verse=\r\ns in the Devi Mahatmyam have parallels in the B. Gita and Upanishads. Study=\r\ning the 9th chapter of the B. Gita will enable the sadhaka to comprehend th=\r\ne depth of this verse better. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Krishna further proclaims =\r\n(9.30), &quot;Even if the most sinful person worships me with unwavering devotio=\r\nn, he must be considered as righteous for he has made the right resolve&quot;. S=\r\no are we to understand that the sinful person straightaway attains the same=\r\n state as the righteous? No, certainly not. The Lord Himself unambigiously =\r\nclarifies this in the very next verse wherein He says that such a person &quot;B=\r\nECOMES&quot; righteous and attains everlasting peace. Here the EFFECT of the RIG=\r\nHT RESOLVE is declared and the devotees are assured that they will never pe=\r\nrish.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Likewise the Devi too is assuring us that She will fon=\r\ndly accept all acts of worship, sacrificial offerings and homas whether the=\r\ny are done with appropriate knowledge or not. Her devotees will never peris=\r\nh irrespective of whether they have the right knowledge of how to worship H=\r\ner or not. She will fondly accept the worship, offerings etc of both classe=\r\ns of devotees. In accordance with Lord Krishna&#39;s affirmation, here too thos=\r\ne who worship Her without appropriate knowledge of mantras, procedures etc,=\r\n by their very resolve to worship Her, will soon attain the knowledge of th=\r\ne same and thereby attain Her. This verse is also a reminder that one need =\r\nnot stay away from worshipping Her because they have no knowledge or only l=\r\nimited knowledge of how to worship Her. Every sadhaka has to perform the wo=\r\nrship to the best of his/her abilities sincerely and humbly after surrender=\r\ning to Her. Her grace will enable the rest to happen naturally be it the re=\r\nquired knowledge or initiation or something else. In conclusion through thi=\r\ns verse, the Devi is encouraging all of us to worship Her irrespective of o=\r\nur current level of knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Pra=\r\nkash\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
