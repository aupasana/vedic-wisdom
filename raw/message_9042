This has i=\r\nnvolved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is no=\r\nt of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms star=\r\nted and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anyt=\r\nhing physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this=\r\n is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe th=\r\nemselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini aw=\r\nakening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainst=\r\nream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by we=\r\nstern medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged kundalini, we str=\r\nuggle to help them.\n\nMany yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My exp=\r\nerience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be fo=\r\nrcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffe=\r\nring from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and=\r\n it is something she cannot escape from.\n\nI wondered what solution there co=\r\nuld be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, wh=\r\no manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and ei=\r\nther cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that th=\r\ne good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we =\r\nmay not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. \n\nAnd let us be caref=\r\nul in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps =\r\nthis is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;le=\r\nt me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini rising bit to God&#39;s will.\n=\r\n\nOm Dum Durgayai Namaha\n\nAparna \n\n\n"}}
