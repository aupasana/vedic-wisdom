Many of the Ved=\r\nic\nmantras were themselves &quot;seen&quot; by women. Check this website by the\nAurob=\r\nindo Institute \nhttp://www.vedah.com/org2/literature/essence/women_&_rishik=\r\nas.html\n\nSo, when women rishikas themselves are the origins of the mantras =\r\nis\nthere anything left to say!!\n\nPS: This site also has a lot of articles o=\r\nn Vedas for the interested.\n\nThanks\nVasudev\n     \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;rohinipurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; A warm namaste to=\r\n everyone!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have heard it said that women are not allowed to read/kno=\r\nw/recite the \n&gt; vedas. Can anyone tell me if this is true? If so, is there =\r\nany mantra \n&gt; (or evidence)in any of the Vedas which says this?\n&gt; \n&gt; I ask =\r\nthis not as a disrespectful argument but as a genuine desire to \n&gt; know wha=\r\nt the text actually says, if it does indeed say anything at all \n&gt; on the s=\r\nubject.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also I have heard that a Brahmin who does have the right to re=\r\ncite/use \n&gt; the mantras has to follow a certain (very strict) way of life. =\r\nIs this \n&gt; too mentioned in any of these &#39;books&#39; (for want of a better word=\r\n)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Rohini\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
