That is more appro=\r\npriate for the times we live in.\n \nPeople of old times had brightly burning=\r\n bhootaagni inside. Their performance of a daily fire ritual was just a res=\r\nponsibility towards the universe. They were doing fire ritual for maintaini=\r\nng dharma in the universe and not necessarily for saving their own bhootaag=\r\nni from being extinguished.\n \nMost people today - even those who are re-inc=\r\narnations of very good yogis from the last life - are initially lacking in =\r\ninternal purity and their bhootaagni is very very very weak and actually pr=\r\netty much extinguished in most people. The times are such, the culture is s=\r\nuch, our lifestyles are such, the influences on our minds are such and the =\r\nenergy filling the air we breath is such. Thus, one&#39;s reason for doing a ho=\r\nmam is different from the old times. When one does a fire ritual, one does =\r\none&#39;s dharma towards the universe and, at the same time, improves one&#39;s own=\r\n internal bhootaagni a little bit.\n \nFor doing any spiritual activity - jap=\r\nam or tarpana or just reading a scripture or contemplation - strong bhootaa=\r\ngni is very important for internalizing and digesting the experience spirit=\r\nually. If a person with a very weak or extinguished bhootaagni does such sp=\r\niritual activities, the impact is negligible. As a person&#39;s bhootaagni is m=\r\naximized immediately following a ritual with an external fire, it helps one=\r\n do a better job with other spiritual activities.\n \nThus, my recommendation=\r\n is the same as Narayan&#39;s. Do homam, meditate as the poornaahuti burns and =\r\nthen do tarpana. In fact, if you are only doing deva and rishi tarpanas, yo=\r\nu can even integrate it with homam. You can do deva and rishi tarpanas whil=\r\ne sitting in front of the fire, after the uttaraangam and before the poorna=\r\nahuti, and then go on to offer poornaahuti. However, if you also want to in=\r\nclude pitris (deceased ancestors) along with devas and rishis, I suggest do=\r\ning it separately after the homam.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI want to narrat=\r\ne an incident related to tarpana manuals.\n \nManish thinks very highly of ta=\r\nrpana and asked me to create a manual for it last year. In the case of homa=\r\nm, I studied and practiced several approaches and experienced some things i=\r\nnternally and knew what I was talking about, before the homam manuals were =\r\ncreated. In case of tarpana, my experience and internal understanding was l=\r\nimited when I created the manuals. Though I had Manish&#39;s blessings, I had s=\r\nome doubts on whether what I consolidated (as 3 options) was good enough or=\r\n not. On the day chosen for making the manuals available, I did my Chandi h=\r\nomam in the morning and prayed to the 18-handed Mahalakshmi/Durga idol I us=\r\ne for homam, &quot;O Mother, I was very comfortable with homam manuals, but my e=\r\nxperience in tarpana is limited. But Manish asked me to create and distribu=\r\nte tarpana manuals. Several important people may be using these manuals in =\r\nfuture. If what I consolidated is good and you approve it, please give me s=\r\nome signal today as I perform the procedure. I will understand. I will publ=\r\nish them only if you give your approval.&quot;\n \nThen I sat down to perform tarp=\r\nanas. The moment I invoked gods and rishis into the kalasha, there was such=\r\n a powerful wind outside (the windows were open). The sound of the wind was=\r\n really loud. I started deva tarpana and said &quot;brahmaa tripyataam&quot; and left=\r\n water. Then I took water into my palm again and said &quot;vishnuh tripyataam&quot;.=\r\n As soon as I left that water, I heard big thup-thup sounds from outside. W=\r\nhen I lifted my head to see through the window, I saw that heavy rain with =\r\nreally big drops had just started. It did not rain in the previous 10 days =\r\nand there were no noticeable clouds in the sky that morning. It was very su=\r\nnny and bright until then. But a heavy rain started as soon as tarpana star=\r\nted and the rain continued till the end of the day.\n \nI took the wind and t=\r\nhe rain as signals of approval from the Mother, thanked her at the end and =\r\nwent ahead to publish the manuals. As I performed the ritual more times lat=\r\ner, I slowly understood the real meaning and purpose of tarpana. For many p=\r\neople with weak minds that are afflicted by rinas to deceased ancestors wit=\r\nh mental weaknesses, tarpana is a very very useful ritual. I now fully unde=\r\nrstand why Manish, or Vimalananda for that matter, emphasized performing bo=\r\nth homam and tarpana and how they supplement each other. I am glad that mor=\r\ne people are considering performing a quick homam and a quick tarpana on a =\r\nregular basis. Even a combination of a 30-minute homam and a 5-minute tarpa=\r\nna performed daily will go a long way in freeing one.\n \nBest regards,\nNaras=\r\nimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpa=\r\nnas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org=\r\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n  ---=\r\n-- Original Message ----- \n  From: krishna Kanth \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, August 27, 2009 10:19 AM\n  Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Query regarding Homam / Tarpanam\n\n        Sri Narasimha Garu,\n\n       =\r\n Namaskaram.\n\n        If one has to do both Homam and Tarpanam daily, what =\r\nwould be your suggestion in terms of which would be the order one has to pe=\r\nrform both.. is it that first do homam and then Tarpanam or vice versa or i=\r\nt does  not matter?\n\n        I have downloaded the all tarpana manuals from=\r\n the website and thinking to start off with super short process from the co=\r\nming poornima day.

Even a combination of&nbsp=\r\n;a \n30-minute homam and a 5-minute tarpana performed daily will go a long w=\r\nay in \nfreeing one.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Best \nregards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Do \na=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do \nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \n=\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: \n&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \nJyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \nJyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \nhre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSri \nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.or=\r\ng&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------- \n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;PADD=\r\nING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2=\r\npx solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Origi=\r\nnal Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV \n  style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt=\r\n arial; font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n  &lt;A title=3Dkritels@... hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:kritels@...&quot;&gt;krishna Kanth&lt;/A&gt; \n  &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Dvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; =\r\n\n  &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, August 2=\r\n7, 2009 10:19 \n  AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt;=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Query regarding \n  Homam / Tarpanam&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!-- |**|end e=\r\ngp html banner|**| --&gt;\n  &lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;=\r\n\n    &lt;TBODY&gt;\n    &lt;TR&gt;\n      &lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;Sri Narasimha Ga=\r\nru,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;Namaskaram.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        =\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;If one has to do both Homam and Tarpanam dai=\r\nly, what would be your \n        suggestion in terms of which would be the o=\r\nrder one has to perform \n        both.. is it that first do homam and then =\r\nTarpanam or vice versa or it \n        does&nbsp; not matter?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        =\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;I have do=\r\nwnloaded the all tarpana manuals from the website and \n        thinking to =\r\nstart off with super short process from the coming poornima \n        day.
