We cannot trust that \nevery standard convention is based on sound knowledge.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOne of my favorite sooktas is &quot;Devi Sooktam&quot; from Rigveda. It is attributed \nto Vagambhrani, a female rishi. She felt oneness with the Divine Mother in \nHer undivided supreme form (nearly nirguna form) and the riks of Devi \nsooktam were revealed to her then. Those eight riks are really fantastic.\n\nThere are other riks in Rigveda that were revealed to the world by female \nrishis. We use those riks in our worship, meditation, homas and other \nsadhanas. Yet, should we insist that women cannot recite Veda? If \nVagambhrani is amid us again as a woman, should we stop her from reciting \nDevi sooktam?\n\n*        *        *\n\nJnaneshwar (or Jnanadev) was a great saint from Maharashtra from about 800 \nyears back. He was a great devotee of Krishna and was a fully self-realized \nmaster at a young age. He reformed religion and corrected some corrupt \ntraditions. He once made a buffalo chant Veda.\n\nHe started to recite Veda and the head of the Brahmin council forbade him \nbecause he was not &quot;qualified&quot; to recite Veda. Jnaneshwar insisted that \neveryone had a right to recite Veda and the head of the council disagreed. \nAs he started reciting Veda, the Brahmins tried to stop him by closing his \nmouth. Then a buffalo standing next to him took over and chanted Veda. \nAstounded by the miracle, the Brahmins fell at his feet. The head apologized \nand said, &quot;we are masquerading as the keepers of Veda, but you have the real \nunderstanding and mastery of Veda&quot;.\n\nJnaneshwar taught the equality of all and did not distinguish between people \nbased on caste, creed or gender. He considered BhagavadGita as the essence \nof Veda and wrote a fantastic commentary on it. His commentary departs from \nthe standard Dwaitic (dualistic) point of view adopted by most Vaishnava \ngurus and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic) point of view. It is a \npriceless and timeless masterpiece.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOne Swamiji who was at my house last month had an interesting take. He said \nthat the belief that women cannot recite Vedas is based on a \nmisinterpretation. He said that the physical body we have is called the \n&quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is called the &quot;purusha sareera&quot;. \nHe said that the physical body comes from mother and the soul comes from \nfather and that is why they are called so. The soul or inner self is the \nthousand-headed purusha within us (described in purusha sooktam).\n\nHe said that Veda is supposed to be recited with the purusha sareera. \nAccording to him, it does not mean that women cannot read it. Whether men or \nwomen, they have to read it with the purusha sareera, i.e. inner body, and \nnot just with the physical body. So, according to him, the standard \nconvention is based on a flawed understanding. According to him, one simply \nreciting Veda with the mouth without the correct internal understanding is \nonly reading with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; and hence not doing the right thing.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIn fact, reciting Veda and chanting the verses is one thing and \nunderstanding them is quite another. When we make sound, there are four \nlevels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibration of material \nbelonging to the gross body (sthoola sareera) produces vaikhari level of \nsound and it is heard through the senses belonging to the gross body (ears). \nBut vibrations at the level of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and vibrations \nat the level of astral body (kaarana sareera) are also there and can be \nperceived thorough subtle perception.\n\nIf one is chanting &quot;Om Namo Narayanaya&quot; and thinking of some mundane \nmatters, the vibrations produced at levels above vaikhari will not be \nauspicious. There is so much stress on what we do physically and people \nforget that what happens at the other layers of existence is equally, if not \nmore, important!\n\nIf you produce the correct vibrations at all levels (not just physical) \nwhile &quot;reciting&quot; any Vedic mantra, you can truly &quot;experience&quot; the mantra. A \nfull experience of a single Vedic mantra may be sufficient to alter one&#39;s \nlife! The mantras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, so much of Vedic \nscholarship these days is only superficial (but it has to be encouraged, \nbecause it will keep atleast one level of knowledge alive).\n\nForget the man vs woman controversy. The difference between genders is only \nin the gross body. When you go to the subtle body and astral body, there is \nno difference at all. One should realize that the role of gross body is too \nlimited in the correct recitation/experience of a Vedic mantra. It is the \npurity of the subtle body and the lightness of the astral body that are far \nmore important.\n\n*        *        *\n\nTo be fair and balanced, I need to throw light on the other angle. Like I \nsaid, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of producing a full \nself-realization (actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;to know self&quot;). \nHowever, given the depth of Kali Yuga, it is difficult for it to come in one \nshot. It comes in steps. When one is half way down the path, one has to be \ncareful and under the vigilant guidance of a sadguru.\n\nWhen one is not fully realized and the gross body has a role to play, there \nare some differences based on the gender that come into play.\n\nIf a lady carrying a baby in her womb has certain spiritual experiences \n(which a good Vedic chanting is capable of bringing), there can even be an \nabortion (or a great siddha being born, on the other extreme).\n\nThere is another subtle factor. Good Vedic chanting can bring an awakening \nof Kundalini (i.e. an awakening of self-awareness) and an ascent of \nKundalini (i.e. an ascent of self-awareness). Though some people may have a \nwrong impression about Kundalini because of the corrupt practices of a \nsection of so-called &quot;Kundalini sadhakas&quot;, the fact is that Kundalini merely \nrepresents one&#39;s ego-consciousness. When one casually associates the body \none sees with &quot;self&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara chakra. As one&#39;s \nself-awareness becomes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends in the \nsookshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kundalini reaches \nSahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or not, Kundalini moves based \non how evolved one is. Whether one is into Bhakti yoga or Raja yoga or Karma \nyoga or Jnana yoga does not matter. All paths lead to an awareness of a more \nand more correct concept of self as time progresses and a full \nself-realization finally. Accordingly, Kundalini rises more and more and \nreaches Sahasrara at the end.\n\nDuring the period when Kundalini is stuck in Swadhishthana chakra, sexual \ndrive can multiply. Several yogis get stuck in this stage and fail the tests \nto progress further. In general, women have a higher drive than men. If that \ndrive multiplies, there can be a difficult situation. However, it really \ndepends on the individual and we cannot generalize.\n\nThus, there are some practical difficulties on the way, which may have made \nsome people come up with some rules. However, are those issues sufficient to \nban women from reciting Veda? I don&#39;t think so. In fact, the factors I wrote \nabove are probably irrelevant given the superficial understanding of Veda \npresent at this time and the superficial recitation of Veda that we find \nthese days.\n\nBut, if you want to be sure and do not want to misguide anyone, it is better \nto not give any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s sadguru. If you have a sadguru who \nis guiding your spiritual sadhana, surrender and do as your guru says! What \nis good for goose may not be good for gander. What goose&#39;s guru taught to \ngoose may be good only for goose and not for gander. Gander will do well to \nfollow gander&#39;s guru.\n\nI think I rambled enough for today... :-)\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rohinipurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, February 24, 2007 12:18 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] reading/learning the veda\n\n\n&gt;A warm namaste to everyone!\n&gt;\n&gt; I have heard it said that women are not allowed to read/know/recite the\n&gt; vedas. Can anyone tell me if this is true? If so, is there any mantra\n&gt; (or evidence)in any of the Vedas which says this?\n&gt;\n&gt; I ask this not as a disrespectful argument but as a genuine desire to\n&gt; know what the text actually says, if it does indeed say anything at all\n&gt; on the subject.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also I have heard that a Brahmin who does have the right to recite/use\n&gt; the mantras has to follow a certain (very strict) way of life.
