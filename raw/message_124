Wood definitely produces smoke. If \nyou use dry coconut pieces mainly and pour small quantities of ghee, there \nis hardly any smoke during homam. Only when the fire finally goes away can \nthere be a good amount of smoke.\n\nImagine that you are stir-frying some vegetables in a bit of oil. If you put \ntoo much oil, oil will burn and produce smoke. If there isn&#39;t enough oil, \nvegetables will burn and produce smoke. If you balance vegetables and oil \ncorrectly, there will be no smoke and vegetables will be cooked well.\n\nHowever, in the cooking analogy, you abruptly turn off fire when the \nvegetables are ready. In a homam, you cannot do that. As long as the coconut \npiecess, sesame seeds etc are burning, you keep pouring drops of ghee at the \nright places to keep it burning smoothly. It is easy to avoid smoke. But, \nonce you are done, the &quot;end game&quot; will produce some smoke.\n\nInstead of putting a whole or half coconut, put small dry coconut pieces. \nFor example, if I put two 1.5&quot;x1.5&quot; pieces of dry coconut, they burn easily \nfor 40 minutes. It is a good idea to start off with two or more pieces, so \nthat one can help re-bring the fire in the other one if it goes away. After \nthe fire is fully established, it is stable. In the beginning, when a piece \njust catches fire, the fire can go away. If there are two pieces, they can \nhelp each other (just as two spiritual aspirants can help each other in the \nbeginning if one of them is wavering).\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;kumar_gh_2000&quot; &lt;kumar_gh_2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 29, 2007 1:47 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Ganapati Havan/Homam\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha ji,\n&gt; Thank you very much for reply.

However, compared to fire in\n&gt; regular\n&gt;&gt; homam, fire in a deepa homam is restricted and unfree. Thus, a\n&gt; regular homam\n&gt;&gt; is far more effective than a deepa homam.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But, if you have no better choice, it can certainly be considered.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some people living in apartments in USA have performed\n&gt; Mahaganapathi homam,\n&gt;&gt; but I am not that familiar with UK.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you use dry coconut pieces only (i.e. no wood) and put the right\n&gt; amount\n&gt;&gt; of ghee, it actually generates hardly any smoke. However, that\n&gt; takes a\n&gt;&gt; little bit of practice. Doing the homam near a window and keeping\n&gt; the window\n&gt;&gt; open can also help.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is a smoke detector right next to the door (which is always\n&gt; kept open)\n&gt;&gt; of the room in which I do my daily homam at my house. It goes off\n&gt; very\n&gt;&gt; rarely.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If Ganapathi wants you to worship Him in fire, He will show you the\n&gt; way.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sharat&quot; &lt;gidoc@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, August 19, 2007 7:32 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Ganapati Havan/Homam\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ||Namah Shivaya||\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narsimha ji,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I follow your teachings and lessons very closely and have been\n&gt;&gt; &gt; reflecting on beginning the Ganapati havan as per your teching and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; illustrations.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; However I live in a modern apartment in UK,with fire/smoke alrams;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have no personal open ground or balcony.
