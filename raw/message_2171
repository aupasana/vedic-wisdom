From NASA Eclipse page I see that the eclipse path starts little west of India and ends in Marshall islands or so. Actually, all of Americaa and especially the North East USA doesn&#39;t seem to be even in the penumbral region. In such a case, do we still observe the eclipse time niyamas like bathing (before/after), disposing off cooked items, protection using dharbha grass etc. Please do clarify, if you get some time before the solar eclipse starts. \n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; -Prasad\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

This total solar eclipse has interesting planetary combinations. This is a great time for spiritual progress. In Boston time (EDT), the eclipse is from 7:58 pm on 2009 July 21 to 12:18 am on 2009 July 22. In India time (IST), it is from 5:28 am to 9:48 am on 2009 July 22. In GMT, it is from 11:58 pm on 2009 July 21 to 4:18 am on 2009 July 22.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; You can meditate, do homam (to any deity) or just contemplate on the meaning of life, who you are or on some articles or books you read. Whatever sadhana you do during the eclipse time, all the best!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; BTW, I am reproducing a small note I wrote in Astrological eMagazine (from the publishers of Astrological Magazine) below.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------  \n&gt; &gt; A Note on the Eclipses in July-Aug 2009\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The occurrence of three consecutive eclipses - a lunar eclipse on 2009 July 7, a solar eclipse on 2009 July 22 and another lunar eclipse on 2009 August 6 - has generated a lot of interest. Especially the solar eclipse of July 22 occurs when Sun is in the 6th degree of Cancer, which is Sun&#39;s Mrityu Bhaga (death inflicting degree) in Cancer. When the eclipse starts in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ketu and ascendant are in the same rasi and navamsa. Hence, this can be a problematic eclipse.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Eclipse time is a very favorable time for spiritual sadhana, though temple rituals are halted during eclipses. There is a reason for it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sun and Moon are the eyes of Parama Purusha (the supreme cosmic being). Microcosmically, individual soul (Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the eyes through which we see the dual world around us. If individual soul and individual mind stop seeing, one no longer experiences any objects in the field of duality. The objectification within Brahman ceases and one is established in Brahman, i.e. non-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In other words, one realizes Self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To fulfil one&#39;s dharma as an individual in the field of duality, one needs to be awake to the duality. One needs the individualized consciousness represented by Sun and Moon. Hence eclipse time when Sun or Moon is blocked is unfavorable for dharmik activities. Temples and temple rituals, which are performed for collective dharma of society, are understandably halted. However, it is a great time for spiritual sadhana for self-realization. This applies to homam as well. If one performs homam for material benefits, one should stop during an eclipse. However, if one performs homam for spiritual progress and self-realization, a homam performed during an eclipse is much more powerful than at other times. One can perform homam to any deity during an eclipse, though homam to an ugra devata may work better.\n\n\n"}}
