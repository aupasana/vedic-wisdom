Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to any=\r\n \n&gt; Hanuman temple\n&gt; &gt; and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my nat=\r\nal chart \nwhich \n&gt; suffers\n&gt; &gt; from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha in=\r\n navamsa). When I \n&gt; visited the\n&gt; &gt; Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha Perum=\r\nal temple, Thirumazhisai \nnear \n&gt; Chennai\n&gt; &gt; and asked the priest about a =\r\nmantra, he advised me to chant the \n&gt; mantra\n&gt; &gt; inscribed on the walls of =\r\nthe temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya \n&gt; ram| which\n&gt; &gt; comes out to be a =\r\n7 word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th \n&gt; house to\n&gt; &gt; the 10th ho=\r\nuse with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per \n&gt; mantra shastra\n&gt; &gt; te=\r\nachings. I&#39;ve been doing this every evening since.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Later I came to=\r\n know this is the Rama taraka mantra. My question \nis \n&gt; how does\n&gt; &gt; this =\r\nmantra help to counter the rajabhanga of Mangal?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Secondly what is =\r\nthe correct form of the Rama taraka mantra? Is it\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; |om sri ram jaya=\r\n ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; |om sri ram=\r\na jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some say it sh=\r\nould be 13 aksharas....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry for astrological content in this mai=\r\nl.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; best regards\n&gt; &gt; Hari\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Get t=\r\nhe world&#39;s best email - http://nz.mail.yahoo.com/\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
