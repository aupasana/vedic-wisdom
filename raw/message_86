When breathing air in,\n&gt; the diaphragm should move down and the stomach should protrude out freely.\n&gt; When breathing in, the diaphragm should move up and the stomach should be\n&gt; drawn in. For some people, artificial and constrained breathing over many\n&gt; years changes this natural breathing. Place the palms on the stomach and\n&gt; then breathe in and out a few times and see if your breathing is correct. \n&gt; If\n&gt; it is not, first it must be corrected.\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) I suggest anuloma-viloma praanaayaama.  Keep the lengths of pooraka\n&gt; (breathing in phase), kumbhaka (holding phase) and rechaka (breathing out\n&gt; phase) about the same. Though other ratios are suggested by some, this is\n&gt; the best.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) In fact, in the beginning, it is better to just omit kumbhaka. Just do\n&gt; Pooraka-Rechaka, Pooraka-Rechaka. When you are ready, kumbhaka will\n&gt; automatically come by itself! Artificially induced kumbhaka can be bad. It\n&gt; should be natural.\n&gt;\n&gt; (3) Use a mantra (any) as a measure of time. Repeat the mantra during each\n&gt; pooraka and rechaka. There is a big difference between a dry praanaayaama\n&gt; without a mantra and one with a mantra. Savitru Gayatri is a good mantra \n&gt; to\n&gt; use, but, if it is too long, use something smaller.\n&gt;\n&gt; (4) Do the pranayama for 5 minutes before dhyana and then do dhyana.\n&gt;\n&gt; (5) During dhyana, keep your back straight (no slouching). Keep head also \n&gt; up\n&gt; and straight. Close the eyes. There is a big difference between meditating\n&gt; with open eyes and closed eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt; (6) Try not to move during dhyana. If you cannot avoid physical movement \n&gt; for\n&gt; extended periods, atleast try small periods. For example, stay absolutely\n&gt; still for 10 minutes, then move a little if needed, and then stay still\n&gt; again and so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; (7) The goal of all spiritual sadhana is to efface ego (I-ness) and return\n&gt; to the source. Whether one does dhyana or homa or pranayama or any other\n&gt; practice, it should somehow or the other efface the I-ness. The practices\n&gt; help one overcome ego, while the ego is an obstacle in the practices and\n&gt; overcoming the ego makes the practices more effective. Thus, there is a\n&gt; chicken-and-egg kind of problem here. You have to somehow get started and\n&gt; the momentum slowly builds.\n&gt;\n&gt; Especially in the beginning, use as many tools as possible to reduce ego.\n&gt; Even if pranayama and dhyana are your chosen path, other tools can be\n&gt; integrated.\n&gt;\n&gt; (8) Cultivate the thinking that everything in this world is a property of\n&gt; Shiva and you are just a caretaker. Just as a servant takes good care of a\n&gt; king&#39;s properties without forming an attachment, we should take care of\n&gt; things entrusted to us by Shiva. Our relations, our body, our name, our\n&gt; fame, our health, our near and dear - all are Shiva&#39;s property only. We \n&gt; own\n&gt; absolutely NOTHING. We are just His servants and temporary caretakers. \n&gt; Just\n&gt; as a servant who takes care of one room in one palace can later be moved \n&gt; to\n&gt; another room in another palace, our duty may later change to another body,\n&gt; another name, another fame, another set of relations etc. A servant takes\n&gt; excellent care of his king&#39;s properties, but does not think of those \n&gt; things\n&gt; as his and doesn&#39;t get attached. We should also be that way.\n&gt;\n&gt; One may wonder what this has to do with pranayama and dhyana. But such\n&gt; detachment and control over mind does help.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranayama literally means &quot;disciplining/restraining the pranas&quot;. Pranas \n&gt; are\n&gt; not just breathing or air. Prana means the life force. It includes the \n&gt; mind\n&gt; and movement of thought in it. We control breathing so that our thoughts \n&gt; are\n&gt; controlled. But again, if thoughts are not restrained, breathing is not\n&gt; fully restrained. This is also a chicken and egg kind of issue. Thus, \n&gt; having\n&gt; the correct mental attitude, control over mind and restraint over the\n&gt; movement of thoughts helps in a more effective praanaayaama.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, having the correct attitude and cutting down on unnecessary\n&gt; attachments IS very conducive to an effective praanaayaama and an \n&gt; effective\n&gt; dhyaana.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now I have to go.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;b_jamnadas&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, July 05, 2007 10:28 AM\n&gt; Subject: [sivacharya] Dhyana and dharana\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Respected Group Members,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I was going though Kirana Agama and in one of the chapters, the\n&gt;&gt; benefits of dhyana/dharana and pranayam are described. Pranayam is a\n&gt;&gt; techique that I have been trying to practice for some time after\n&gt;&gt; suffering from indigestion for some years now. The second resason\n&gt;&gt; was that I wanted to attain a level of concentration in my mantra\n&gt;&gt; jap. There has been occassions (very seldom though) when I attain a\n&gt;&gt; level of concentration higher than what I would attain noramlly and\n&gt;&gt; I very much like this feeling.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I would like to put some discipline in my appraoch to practice pf\n&gt;&gt; pranayam, reading books which illustrates different methods makes me\n&gt;&gt; very confused about the approach that best fits me. If there is any\n&gt;&gt; shiv bhakt in this group who has attained a level of proficiency or\n&gt;&gt; knows someone who has attained proficiency in dhyana and pranayam, I\n&gt;&gt; would very much appreciate some direction. Right now my approach\n&gt;&gt; lacks any specific direction and I am getting frustated. In this\n&gt;&gt; life, after I don;t know how many previous rebirths, I have shown\n&gt;&gt; interest in pranayam. I would like to make progress in this area. If\n&gt;&gt; I forgo this opportunity, who knows what my next rebirth has in\n&gt;&gt; store.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am aware of a lot of material on the internet in this matter but\n&gt;&gt; right now, I am trying to connect to a person with these skills.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I would very much appreciate some inout from anyone who knows about\n&gt;&gt; this.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OM NAMAHA SIVAYA!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; Bhupendra.\n\n\n"}}
