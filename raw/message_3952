Like Rajarshi has mentioned, I w=\r\nish to say that many members of this list are well read. I assume that they=\r\n must have read many a books from different authors and covering many philo=\r\nsophies. I have myself read books of various sages, yogis and philosophers.=\r\n It was not accurate when you said Vimalananda is the only saint, this list=\r\n discuss about. This assumption was not right.\n\nI being a gruhastha, know v=\r\nery well, the importance of Material success, even for survival. I am not c=\r\nompletely against asking for some material success while doing some saadhan=\r\na (Say Homa, Japa etc...) but i feel that it is much better, atleast for pe=\r\nople who engage in serious saadhana, to consciously try for reducing and re=\r\nmoving the thoughts of some or the other wants. If i take my example, When =\r\ni started Homam, i dont remember thinking anytime about money, fame, career=\r\n etc...during Homam or Japa. it is clear now to me that i was provided by M=\r\nother what i needed to survive and even better. It also happened that I los=\r\nt a good amount of money in a certain case but i never related to the Spiri=\r\ntual practices especially Homam. Infact i tried not to relate any Material =\r\nsucces or losses to Homam. though I must say here that several people who a=\r\nttended Homam with me have been benefited materially and that has instilled=\r\n faith in them.\nIn my opinion, it is a very beautiful suggetion to leave it=\r\n to God to decide what is right and what is wrong, what is required and wha=\r\nt is not for us rather than asking or doing saadhana for getting specific m=\r\naterial result on a *Regular basis*. but that is my personal opinion and it=\r\n can differ with yours and i respect that.\n\nMy message to Rajesh was on the=\r\n same line. as i known him, i was little personal when i wrote.\n\n***\nIt is =\r\nto be also noted that while this group is propogating Homam as Saadhana, it=\r\n also respect other paths such as Japa, Kirtana, Self inquiry. Narasimha an=\r\nd others are open in that way. What i personally say is that do any saadhan=\r\na you like but do it with regularity, seriously and dedicatedly. Last thing=\r\n i (or others on the list) will want is to be fanatic about one particular =\r\nsaint or path or God or book.\nHowever, i should also add here that after go=\r\ning through many books and many different forms of Saadhanas, it is better =\r\nto get the crux, select one Saadhana or Idea to experience and stick to it.=\r\n reading many books has a danger of creating fascination for reading, gener=\r\nate confusions and stop one for engaging in to Saadhana.  \n\n***\nOn some oth=\r\ner discussions about Guru, I should put my personal experience again. I nev=\r\ner hanker for Finding Guru. i never went out for that. Niether in Astrology=\r\n nor in Spirituality. As Ramakrsihna aptly used to say- &quot;Satchidananda is t=\r\nhe real Guru&quot;. God is all knowing. i trust and relied upon. when my time wa=\r\ns up, Guru in flash and blood came.\n\nIt is my habit to describe personal ex=\r\nperiences which may or may not be useful. As it is in fashion to say now a =\r\ndays - :Igonre me as a fool if it does not make any sense to you&quot; and also =\r\n&quot;No Offence meant&quot; is also another popular statement. \n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpa=\r\nl\nPS: Raju, there is no pint of thinking as to how Homam will change your d=\r\nestiny and such things. Let us review after a couple of years if anything h=\r\nas changed.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; The original question from Rajesh was a very good on=\r\ne, and a real one . I compliment him for asking it and having the courage t=\r\no ask it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Shiva in Guru Gita tells to Devi Parvati --- &quot;There is =\r\nno mukti without bukti&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any good saint I have had a chance to read or=\r\n listen or speak to,\n&gt; never says that &quot;Do Sadhana with spiritual expectati=\r\nons only&quot; In general I mean any type of Sadhana, Japam, Homam, Karma Yoga, =\r\nSeva, Charitable donation, bhajan,satsang and many other types.\n&gt; \n&gt; They a=\r\nlways try to increase further the Shraddaha of a sadhak in things that capt=\r\nivates a Sadhaka&#39;s mind due to his or her state of sanskars.\n&gt; \n&gt; They alwa=\r\nys try to help the Sadhak walk on the path that leads towards spirituality.=\r\n They always wish well for their disciples and have good amount of patience=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many Sadgurus take care of their disciples for many life times, help=\r\ning and guiding in each life time.\n&gt; \n&gt; They always preach many things and =\r\nshow value for different types of sadhanas depending on their state, time, =\r\nand type of disciple.\n&gt; \n&gt; For householders always there are challanges and=\r\n one should request God to look into it and give guidance and help, whether=\r\n it is food, house, marriage, car, or any material issue. There is nothing =\r\nwrong in doing this, even if sadhana done for materialistic benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nToday even those who have renounced householder life have to pray god to fu=\r\nlfill some of their material needs.\n&gt; \n&gt; We live in very difficult and chal=\r\nlanging times and it appears it is going to become more challenging.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\nome material gain can at times make a person better or more balanced or be =\r\nmore prepared to do sadhana for spiritual benefits. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even during an ec=\r\nlipse many people do mantras etc to solve problems or improve material cond=\r\nitions, there is nothing wrong about it. I have read messages in the past o=\r\nn this group suggesting natives not to do it or it is wrong. These type of =\r\nmessages are not correct, it only confuses people. Time during the eclipse =\r\nis very good for getting results for any sadhana done during that time. it =\r\nis equally good for material or spiritual type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone has right to =\r\nhave a opinion and share their views but one needs to also understand the i=\r\nnfluence aspect of those views.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every Shotra or prayer or even Geeta o=\r\nr Ramayan, there are riders at the end for results like becoming wealthy, o=\r\nvercoming challenges, enemies etc.\n&gt; If it were inappropriate the Seers fro=\r\nm the past would not write it.\n&gt; Are they wrong in writing that?\n&gt;  \n&gt; They=\r\n write it to motivate people to read them as one reads more times there is =\r\na possibility that may lead to change in the person&#39;s attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving=\r\n to original set of questions,\n&gt; \n&gt; Every one is born with accumulated sans=\r\nkars out of which as a native interacts with the world some of these accumu=\r\nlated or sanchit sanskars take the form of prarabdh sanskara, these type of=\r\n sanskars give pleasure, pain and challanges to the native. Sanchit Sanskar=\r\ns are like seeds and Prarabdh sanskars are like a tree that bears fruit.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; All human beings are also born with another quality and that is known as=\r\n will power. They say will power can change destiny ...\n&gt; \n&gt; When one does =\r\nsadhana like say Homaam or Japam. Many things happen\n&gt; at many levels, at t=\r\nimes there is improvement in materialistic situation, problems get solved o=\r\nr if the problems remain that state of sadhaka becomes such that he or she =\r\npays less attention to the problem or attaches less importance to the probl=\r\nem. God or Guru or Shakti shows the sadhaka a path to move forward. Sadhana=\r\n does increase will power and makes one more tolerant and \n&gt; Sadhana also h=\r\nelp in eliminating the sanchit sanskars, in fact one Saint use to say, do y=\r\nour sadhana and your sanchit sanskars will get crushed such that they can n=\r\never germinate or fruitify into prarabdh sanskars.\n&gt; \n&gt; So yes doing sadhan=\r\na can help one overcome many things at different levels and help one move i=\r\nn the right direction. At times one moves faster or very slowly. The import=\r\nant thing is moving and if one falls down, than one should immediately get =\r\nup.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many ways to improve and move faster towards spirtuality=\r\n,\n&gt; Vimalanda is not just one saint, there are many who have reached simila=\r\nr or higher or lower realizations adopting different methods and have writt=\r\nen very good books too. Sprituality is much bigger, deeper and broader than=\r\n what Vimalanada has described in his books.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find it little cultish =\r\nto just refer him all the time in the group. Spirituaity is atleast not a n=\r\narrow cult.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please note that I have nothing against Him, I respect him=\r\n as I respect other saints from the bottom of my heart. I did spent money t=\r\no get his books and plan to read in near future.\n&gt; \n&gt; I urge all the reader=\r\ns of this group to read more books from different sects, different saints a=\r\nnd try to get appropriate influence. Get broader and deeper views as that h=\r\nelps forming a good base for spirituality. Spirtuality is about tolerance a=\r\nnd remaining neutral in different situations.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Nath Sampradaya, Shi=\r\nviates from Kashmir, the lineage of Ramananda,\n&gt; Datta Sampradaya, the sufi=\r\ns, even some christain saints (The book of Mirdad) and many more sects some=\r\n of the Lhamas of Buddhism had very deeper realizations and experiance. The=\r\nre are many sects in south india too, kerala, tamil nadu, andhra pradhesh, =\r\nmaharastra,rajasthan, gujarat and other states, all of them had great saint=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Generally these saints never bothered to write or explain or were n=\r\not able to explain. But some did write and a lot of good work is out there =\r\nto explore along with doing sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; We live in times where there is v=\r\nery little guidance available on the path of spirituality. So in these time=\r\ns we have to make up with reading good books written by saints of yestaryer=\r\ns and surrender more to god.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is scarcity of Sadgurus and good Sa=\r\ndhaks, we have many entry level and confused situation :-) ....\n&gt; \n&gt; If you=\r\n look at sikhism, the last sadguru dev from their sect made the book &quot;grant=\r\nh saheb&quot; as the guru instead of making anyone else take his seat.\n&gt; \n&gt; When=\r\n Lahiri Mahashaya met a famoius saint of kashi, he got lot of respect from =\r\nhim. Some of the famous saint&#39;s disciple were upset,\n&gt; at that the saint re=\r\nminds them that to reach his own spiritual state he took 400 or so years bu=\r\nt Lahiri Mahashaya did it in one birth.\n&gt; His name slips my tongue, he was =\r\nbig and very strong lived in water many hours at a time, his name starts wi=\r\nth tri. They say that one is not able to stare at the eyes of the statue of=\r\n the saint at his samadhi mandir.\n&gt; \n&gt; One must always try to broaden ones =\r\nperspective, all of us have a long long way to go, even if some may feel th=\r\nat oh I only have some more things left so I may be done in some years, eve=\r\nn that is an interesting situation as there is always a chance of falling d=\r\nown.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even for Saint Bharathari one of the nav naths, he was so elevate=\r\nd but he also had some sanskars that forced him to take birth and enjoy fir=\r\nst and than suffer due to pingala. He was already realized before his birth=\r\n as the rajah.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did not intend to offend anyone or thier veiws, If I =\r\ninadvertantly did it I appologize in advance, Narashima has written very we=\r\nll many times and of late has written some good stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; =\r\nMitesh \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pat=\r\nhak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Raju,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It seems honest outburst.

It sounds like- because &#39;Agni&#39; is very effective medium for praying, o=\r\nne is taking its advantage to get all the mundane benefits, release from va=\r\nrious troubling issues, fulfilling the worldly ambitions.
