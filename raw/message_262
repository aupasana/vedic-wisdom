One may be sitting in=\r\n pleasure world, earning money and engaging externally in various activitie=\r\ns, but the mind may be established in peace and bliss.\n \nA realized person =\r\nis NOT identified by the actions he/she engages in. Just as an electric fan=\r\n continues to turn for a few minutes even after the electricity is turned o=\r\nff, a realized person who is still in a body continues to engage in actions=\r\n based on the previous flow. After King Janaka realized Self, he continued =\r\nas the king of Mithila and did all royal duties. After Krishna made Arjuna =\r\nrealize Self, Arjuna fought a war and killed his gurus, brothers, grandfath=\r\ner etc.\n \nOne who has not yet realized Self will distinguish between variou=\r\ns objects of this dual world and view some as good and some as bad. He/she =\r\nwill try to stay away from so-called bad actions. On the other hand, a real=\r\nized person sees all people, objects and actions of this universe as the sa=\r\nme Self and sees no reason to either be attracted to or repelled from anyth=\r\ning. His/her actions and inactions are thus not based on the principles of =\r\nattraction and repulsion. They are based on the previous flow.\n \nRenouncing=\r\n wife, children, job, money etc is an attempt to find true mental renunciat=\r\nion. Renouncing external objects can promote mental renunciation, but not g=\r\nuarantee it. On the other hand, one can remain in the midst of the material=\r\n world and all the external objects and yet have a perfectly stable, peacef=\r\nul and blissful mind that is not attracted to or repelled from any of the o=\r\nbjects one is surrounded by. For all you know, a big film star like Rajinik=\r\nanth, who makes millions of dollars per movie, surrounded by glamour, money=\r\n and adulation, may be more detached at the mental level than many yogis in=\r\n Himalayas. It is probably true in the case of Rajinikanth.\n \nWhen one stay=\r\ns away from objects that may attract one, it is relatively easy to overcome=\r\n attraction temporarily. Whether one can retain that renunciation when one =\r\ncomes in contact with the objects again or not is a questionmark. On the ot=\r\nher hand, to be in contact with the objects that may attract one and yet ma=\r\nintain mental detachment and mental renunciation is tougher. It is the true=\r\n test.\n \nIt is not out of place to mention a small story.\n \nTrilinga Swami =\r\nlived for about 300 years and did unbelievable austerities in Kashi. When R=\r\namakrishna Paramahamsa met him in Kashi, he remarked to his sishyas that Tr=\r\nilinga Swami was Shiva Himself and a fully realized being. Narendranath (Sw=\r\nami Vivekananda) was not with him on that pilgrimage and he made a point to=\r\n force Narendranath to go to Kashi later to have a darshan of Trilinga Swam=\r\ni!\n \nLahiri Mahashaya was the guru of Yukteshwar Maharaj, who was the guru =\r\nof Paramahamsa Yogananda. Lahiri Mahashaya was a householder and had a high=\r\n-paying job. Yet he realized Self. Trilnga Swami spoke little, but he once =\r\nspoke a few words in Lahiri Mahashaya&#39;s praise. He said, &quot;The state of mind=\r\n I achieved by renouncing everything, Lahiri achieved it while being a hous=\r\neholder, being in the middle of everything. I bow to him.&quot;\n \n*         *   =\r\n      *\n \n&gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt make one to cert=\r\nify any\n&gt; &gt; persons doings as good and spiritual.\n \nNobody can &quot;certify&quot; an=\r\nybody. However, those who know some astrology can give their views on chart=\r\ns that are shared and discussed publicly. If some people see those views as=\r\n a &quot;certificates&quot;, it is their perception.\n \n*         *         *\n \nSelf-r=\r\nealization can be consistently defined. However, spirituality is tough to d=\r\nefine. It will mean different things to different people.\n \nThe goal of all=\r\n spiritual journeys is to realize Self, at some time or the other. However,=\r\n most spiritual journeys of this age do NOT end in Self-realization.\n \nIt i=\r\ns limited ego that binds one to a limited existence like a body and stops o=\r\nne from realizing the all-pervading true Self. While a self-realized person=\r\n&#39;s ego is completely killed, it is possible to make partial progress. There=\r\n are many people, who overcome ego to various extents and realize to variou=\r\ns degrees that body is temporary and it is not the true self. One can do so=\r\n by following many spiritual paths, like the path of knowledge, the path of=\r\n devotion, the path of pranayama, the path of hatha yoga, the path of work =\r\nand service etc. One who overcomes ego to some extent, using any path, is m=\r\naking some spiritual progress. When the ego is completely subdued, one real=\r\nizes the true Self. This realization is the same irrespective of the path f=\r\nollowed. However, intermediate steps look and feel different based on the p=\r\nath.\n \nEnough of my 2 cents for tonight...\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi H=\r\nomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedica=\r\nstro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; &gt;   =\r\nDear Prashant ji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt make=\r\n one to certify any\n&gt; &gt; persons doings as good and spiritual.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There=\r\n are many factors which one over looks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and in true sense ....what =\r\nis the real spiritualism.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i will say if the person is spiritual ...=\r\ngo and do tapasya in\n&gt; &gt; Himalay..why sitting in pleasure world and earning=\r\n money and\n&gt; &gt; enjoying all world pleasures.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tarun=\r\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_02F8_01C89C2A.6BE37F50\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3314&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n Sir,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; &gt; i will say if the person is spiritu=\r\nal \n...go and do tapasya in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Himalay..why sitting in pleasure w=\r\norld and \nearning money and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; enjoying all world pleasures.&lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fa=\r\nce=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Sitting in&nbsp;pleasure world and earning money \nis&nb=\r\nsp;NOT synonymous to &quot;enjoying all world pleasures&quot;.
