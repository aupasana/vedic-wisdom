After complete rea=\r\nlisation, differences dont exist for them. Brutality and compassion, Vegeta=\r\nble and Meat, Southpole and North Pole etc...dont make sense, But for most =\r\nof us there is a clear differences.\n\nHence i say that Krishna, Sain Baba, R=\r\namakrsihan and Vivekananda may have had eaten also meat but it may not be w=\r\nise to take their example and shut the door of our own discrimination.\n\nMan=\r\ny SAIN Bhaktaas actually take Sain baba&#39;s quote as a strong argument and cl=\r\nose their eyes to the killing which goes in eating Meat and fish. Its not r=\r\night IMHO.\n\n***\nPlease do not consider my point for Veg/Nonveg with perspec=\r\ntive of Spiritual/Material, Good/Bad, Saatwik/Taamsik etc... My only point =\r\nin Vegterianism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (Non Viole=\r\nnce) against Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).  \n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; kirshna went to hunt deer with Arjuna\n&gt; Lord shiva and Arjuna fought to=\r\n eat a boar\n&gt; radha cooked deer flesh for krishna and arjuna\n&gt; vyasa was so=\r\nn of a fishing women and loved to eat fish\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw a indian yogi writing=\r\n that Jesus was a vegeterian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _____________________________=\r\n___\n&gt; From: Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\n&gt; Sent: Fri, December 11, 2009 5:34:13 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Veg=\r\n Vs. Non-Veg\n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I am a =\r\nfirm believer of Veg being satwik food and consider non-veg as hurdle to sp=\r\niritual growth. But, a friend of mine who otherwise is trying to make some =\r\nspiritual progress, is a non-vegetatian. In our arguments over non-veg food=\r\n, he has put a counter argument. He says that if I can find him a single sh=\r\nloka on this in Bhagwat Geeta, he would give up. \n&gt; \n&gt; So, if anybody on th=\r\nis group can help me find the quote, it would be great. He considers Geeta =\r\nas the absolute reference and believes if Lord Krishna has not spoken about=\r\n it in Geeta, it is actually not worth discussing whether or not you take n=\r\non-veg. If anyone finds it, le me know so that 1 guy on this earth can beco=\r\nme vegetarian.\n&gt; \n&gt; He also quotes Sai Baba, Jesus and Mohammed Prophet adh=\r\nering to non-veg. If any of you know the counter argument, please help.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Sriram \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  The INTE=\r\nRNET now has a personality.
