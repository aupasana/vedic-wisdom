Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev cond=\r\nucted the program and it was very powerful. During the course of Maha Deva =\r\nmeditation, one could see the Divine figures in his/ her ajna chakra. It wa=\r\ns amazing experience. After Kundalini awakening, I am not the old I :). \n\nI=\r\nf you have difficulty for self-realization or Enlightenment in other paths,=\r\n then Yoga is the way for your Enlightenment. This is the first sentence of=\r\n the Yoga Sutras written by Patanjali. This has proved to be absolutely cor=\r\nrect in my case. \n\nGood Luck\n\nShankar\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This business of repeating G=\r\nod Name, that Nobody ji mentioned...it ain&#39;t no joke ...doing it I mean! I =\r\ntried today, and boy, it was hard...failed mostly, to be honest.\n&gt; \n&gt; But e=\r\nvery sage Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma, Ammachi, Sivananda, Chaitanya, Mira, =\r\nRabia, Papa Ramdas, every one of them was obsessed with this Name business.=\r\n That means, there must be something to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I really want to take up N=\r\nobody ji&#39;s suggestion and get obsessed with the Name. I firmly believe in i=\r\nt. I got sick (real sick) a few times, and the Name helped me (have had 2-3=\r\n black outs when I was unwell, long story, but basically, I was conscious d=\r\nuring these black outs, and it felt like I was dying...and it sounds odd, b=\r\nut there were no thoughts except the Name &quot;Keshava please help me&quot; or &quot;Nara=\r\nyana&quot;). These episodes scared the bejesus out of me, and each time I came o=\r\nut of them, I felt &quot;I MUST DO MORE JAPA&quot; it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;ll save m=\r\ne. All else is of no use when I&#39;m in deep sh*t (pardon my language), the Na=\r\nme alone is reliable.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;m trying to say, is I want to devise some=\r\n practical ways to get serious about this sadhana. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sivananda Saraswat=\r\ni (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and especially of Purascharana (repeat=\r\ning mantra as many lakhs as there are syllables in the mantra. Eg Gayatri h=\r\nas 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetitions). He went on to=\r\n say that 14 crore of japa with feeling would result in Darshan of God in p=\r\nhysical form, face to face. That would be great! Really wanted to do it...b=\r\nut when I did the maths, I worked out that, at the rate of 12 hours japa a =\r\nday, every single day from now on, it would take me till age 83 to finish t=\r\nhis. :( \n&gt; \n&gt; But hey, I decided to make a start anyway, and began my my fi=\r\nrst Purascharana of the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in January this year, I =\r\nam doing a measley 11 rounds a day, with my mind wandering most of the time=\r\n (hard core people do hundreds of rounds with proper concentration daily). =\r\nI&#39;m a slow chanter, and need to say the mantra loudly or in a barely audibl=\r\ne whisper. My mental chanting is gradually improving but very difficult to =\r\ndo for more than 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonna take me till October 2013 to finis=\r\nh the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to take a 3 month break (and do 7 rounds a d=\r\nay), and then start another Purascharana. \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, two things help me =\r\nget my 11 rounds of japa done every day when I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thought =\r\nI&#39;d mention it, if anybody&#39;s interested, just in case it&#39;s helpful. \n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nne is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend I&#39;m on the ph=\r\none. While doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and count the japa on m=\r\ny fingers. I get a couple of rounds done during my working day this way (I =\r\ncheck carefully to make sure nobody&#39;s listening). Also while stuck in traff=\r\nic (while the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pieces on, and pr=\r\netend I&#39;m chatting to a friend on the phone and do a couple of rounds. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The other thing that I find useful (now please excuse the phrase), is &quot;To=\r\nilet japa&quot;. When I need to escape to do a round or two of japa at work, I e=\r\nxcuse myself for a few minutes and lock myself up in a toilet cubicle. I th=\r\nen very very quietly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips mov=\r\ning, no sound audible, in case anybody hears). I do about 2 sessions of thi=\r\ns a day. This allows me to complete my 11 rounds a day, on days when my wor=\r\nking hours are long. \n&gt; \n&gt; I know this sounds bonkers, but I thought I&#39;d me=\r\nntion this for anyone else whose work life interferes with their japa. At l=\r\neast, it provides a solution to doing a bit of japa at work.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anybod=\r\ny else has any thoughts/suggestions, on how to repeat God&#39; Name constantly,=\r\n kindly share. \n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya, \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
