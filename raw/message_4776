These writings are free-wheeling in nature and not well-or=\r\nganized.\n&gt;  \n&gt; On 2010 Guru Pournima, my Jyotish students in Boston gifted =\r\nme a book they created out of some of those writings. They organized the wr=\r\nitings topically in the form of a book.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A lot of topics that may be o=\r\nf interest to spiritual seekers are addressed in one place, in a *somewhat*=\r\n organized form. A lot of questions from members were answered in simple la=\r\nnguage and several subtle issues were addressed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The book in PDF form=\r\nat is only 1.5 MB in size and is FREE to download.
