Ye=\r\ns, Mumbai trains journey is a manufacturing plant of robust people. I have =\r\nenjoyed that Journey (Virar train especially) since i was in 8th standard t=\r\nill i was 29 years old. it requires Immense interest to do sadhana after on=\r\ne has come back home travelling through Mumbai train.\n\n4. Spousal support f=\r\nor me is not bad though. initial there were lot of Kach-kach...chik-chik bu=\r\nt now its all settled. She her self does lot of things now.

Around Navaratri this year I \n&gt; &gt; have completed a 108 times recitation =\r\nof chandipath over two/three \n&gt; &gt; months and that was indeed one of the bes=\r\nt periods of my life so far. \n&gt; &gt; Although there is nothing that manifested=\r\n in terms of material benefits, \n&gt; &gt; my overall mood was pretty elevated/ca=\r\nlm most of the time. After that, \n&gt; &gt; however I am not able to practise it =\r\nso much and I don&#39;t enjoy that same \n&gt; &gt; bliss anymore. But whenever I do C=\r\nhandipath, that day in general my \n&gt; &gt; mental state is pretty calm. However=\r\n, it is a tough sadhana to do \n&gt; &gt; everyday. The Path alone takes around an=\r\n hour to recite, that too if you \n&gt; &gt; superfast, which you are not supposed=\r\n to, according to the book. If you \n&gt; &gt; recite at comfortable speed, it tak=\r\nes around 1 hour 20 minutes just for \n&gt; &gt; the 13 chapters. Add the kavacham=\r\n, argala, keelaka, ratrisuktam, \n&gt; &gt; artharvaseersham before and devi sookt=\r\nam, three rahasyams, kshama \n&gt; &gt; prathana and siddha kunjika strotram you a=\r\nre taking 2 to 2.5 hours. For \n&gt; &gt; me that seems impossible on a daily basi=\r\ns. So, I have tried to do 2/3 \n&gt; &gt; chapters a day for daily practise but th=\r\nat does not give me the same \n&gt; &gt; bliss that I enjoy when I do the whole th=\r\ning. So, I don&#39;t know how to \n&gt; &gt; practise this regularly on a permanent ba=\r\nsis.

It is a whole package.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Eventually you get what yo=\r\nu crave for deep down. It is not too difficult \n&gt; &gt; to master the text. Som=\r\ne effort, some patience and it can be done.

Don&#39;t =\r\nask for anything when doing Her worship is \n&gt; &gt; an ideal situation. If you =\r\npray simply as you pray in any temple, then \n&gt; &gt; too there is not a problem=\r\n. Praying with humility is never a problem. \n&gt; &gt; BUT if ever you try out kr=\r\niyas with Chandi or do the Chandipath to get \n&gt; &gt; xyz results in abc timefr=\r\name, (specially during complex forms of worship \n&gt; &gt; of Chandi like those i=\r\nnvolving charnel grounds), then be sure that you \n&gt; &gt; know the precise and =\r\nexact procedures.
