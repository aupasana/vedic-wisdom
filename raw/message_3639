You inspired me to pi=\r\nck up the Gospel yet again and start reading.\n\n Pranams\n\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, Prasanth Jalasutram &lt;jvrsprasanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Those=\r\n who follow monistic (Advaita) Vedanta, however, look upon this world\n&gt; as =\r\nunreal, like a dream. According to them Paramatman, or the Over-Soul, is\n&gt; =\r\nthe witness of the three states of consciousness,--waking, dream and\n&gt; drea=\r\nmless sleep. All these are ideas. The dream state is just as real as the\n&gt; =\r\nwaking state. Let me tell you a story.\n&gt; \n&gt; Parable of the farmer and his o=\r\nnly child\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a farmer who was a monist; he had attained to some=\r\n realization. He\n&gt; lived like any other farmer with his family, and he had =\r\na child. He and his\n&gt; wife had extreme love for this son because he was the=\r\nir only child. The\n&gt; farmer himself was a very spiritual man.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was r=\r\nespected and loved by everyone in the village. Once he was working\n&gt; in the=\r\n field, when suddenly a man brought the news of his son&#39;s severe\n&gt; illness.=\r\n He went home, called physicians, took great care, but could not\n&gt; save the=\r\n child&#39;s life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everybody in the household was overwhelmed with grief, =\r\nbut the farmer looked\n&gt; as if nothing had happened. He consoled others by s=\r\naying, &quot;What can be\n&gt; gained by mourning over the child?&quot; The next day he w=\r\nent to the field as\n&gt; usual, and after finishing his work he came home and =\r\nfound his wife and the\n&gt; other members of the family still weeping and wail=\r\ning and plunged in deep\n&gt; sorrow.\n&gt; \n&gt; The wife reproached him, saying: &quot;Ho=\r\nw heartless you are! you have not shed a\n&gt; single tear for your only child.=\r\n&quot; The farmer then calmly replied: &quot;Shall I\n&gt; tell you why I do not weep? La=\r\nst night I had a wonderful dream.\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw that I was a king, and the fat=\r\nher of eight beautiful children, and\n&gt; that I was enjoying all the pleasure=\r\ns and comforts of life. Suddenly I woke\n&gt; up and the dream passed away. Now=\r\n I am in great confusion,--whether I shall\n&gt; weep and wail for my eight chi=\r\nldren or for this only one.&quot; [p. 93& 94]\n&gt; \n&gt; The farmer was an Advaita Jna=\r\nni, therefore he realized that the waking state\n&gt; was as unreal as the drea=\r\nm state, and that the one permanent Reality was\n&gt; Atman. But I accept all s=\r\ntates as true,--the state of Samadhi, which is the\n&gt; fourth state, and agai=\r\nn, the waking, dream and dreamless sleep state. I\n&gt; accept Brahman the Abso=\r\nlute and Maya, Jiva (the individual soul) and the\n&gt; world. If I do not take=\r\n all, a portion will be missing and the weight will\n&gt; be less.\n&gt; \n&gt; Source:=\r\n THE GOSPEL OF RAMAKRISHNA Revised by SWAMI ABHEDANANDA\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Om Namo =\r\nBhagavate Sri Ramanaya\n&gt; Prasanth Jalasutram\n&gt; \n&gt; Love And Love Alone\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
