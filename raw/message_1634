So, our next step should be practical\n&gt; and enable us to cultivate the niyama of performing it everyday without\n&gt; any obstacles. Keeping this in mind, I myself started performing\n&gt; Mahaganapathi Homam everyday. Doing homam for all gods can be cumbersome\n&gt; and more importantly to introduce the concept of niyama, which includes\n&gt; sticking to one god. So, options a & b are ruled out. I suggest c.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; -Narayan-\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;anooj_001&quot; &lt;anooj_001@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear all,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have a few questions which I hope to get the answers here.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A = do homams for all gods daily\n&gt;&gt; B = do homams daily according to the ruling day god\n&gt;&gt; C = do Ganesha&#39;s homams daily too\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Should I do option &quot;A&quot; daily ? or option &quot;B&quot; + &quot;C&quot; ? or should it be\n&gt;&gt; option &quot;A&quot; + &quot;C&quot; ?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please help me in clearing my confusion.
