If one wants a short version o=\r\nf Saptashati, one can go for Saptashloki. However, to get the same effect a=\r\ns Saptashati (700 verse prayer), one needs to do Saptashloki (7 verse praye=\r\nr) 100 times!\n \n&gt; However, in time people became lazy.\n \nGood point. People=\r\n want shortcuts. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts that really work. Es=\r\npecially one weighed down by heavy karmas needs to put in an intense effort=\r\n to remove material obstacles and achieve spiritual progress.\n \n*        * =\r\n       *\n \nWhen Parvati asks Shiva for a shortcut using which learned men c=\r\nan chant Vishnu&#39;s 1000 names *at all times* (nityaM), Shiva says: &quot;shrI raa=\r\nma raama raameti rame raame manorame. sahasranaama tattulyaM raamanaama var=\r\naanane..&quot;\n \nSome people think that chanting this one verse is equivalent to=\r\n chanting Vishnu&#39;s 1000 names. When told to chant 1000 names everyday, they=\r\n just chant this once and be done with it. That will hardly work, for that =\r\nis not the purpose of this shortcut!\n \nIf you want to establish your mind o=\r\nn God *at all times* and want to use a mantra for that purpose, Vishnu Saha=\r\nsra Naama is too long. Then one can mentally chant the above verse or just =\r\nchant &quot;shrI raama raama raama&quot;. That can be done by the mind no matter wher=\r\ne one is and what one is doing. So one can be contemplating Vishnu all (or =\r\nmost) times. THAT is the purpose of short-cut and NOT to enable one to cut =\r\nshort one&#39;s pooja from 20 minutes to 20 seconds!\n \nPeople who are searching=\r\n for a shortcut - a magical formula - that gives them good material and spi=\r\nritual results without investing much time, energy and effort, are pursuing=\r\n a pipe dream.\n \nStop searching for a magical formula, pick something and s=\r\ntart spending time and energy.

And thus, th=\r\nough=C3=82 some local traditions accepted this idea, many of the \n&gt; major k=\r\naula paramparas rejected this idea (merely reading the Kunjika is equal \n&gt; =\r\nto reading the full 700 verses).\n&gt; \n&gt; At this present=C3=82 time, I strongl=\r\ny feel the reason why 99.99 percent sadhakas \n&gt; cannot use the Kunjika to a=\r\nny real affect is because Chandi Herself has put some \n&gt; brakes (locks) on =\r\nthe Kunjika. To borrow an example from an older mail of \n&gt; Narasimha, the K=\r\nunjika is a=C3=82 gun whose safety catch has been locked by Her \n&gt; firmly. =\r\nTherefore, no one is able to fire that weapon.

I was shown a specific \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;method of chanting the KS -=\r\n there is some breath control required at certain \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;lines etc etc=\r\n. I had almost mugged it up. But the experience of chanting the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;actual Saptashati (full) is vastly more powerful and different than the KS=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt;I \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;have serious doubts whether a person doing only the KS =\r\ncan ever experience \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;samadhi at all; whereas the Saptasati by itself=\r\n is capable of bestowing the \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;highest and varied types of spiritu=\r\nal experiences to a sadhaka. Therefore, I \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tend to agree with th=\r\ne sampradayas from Bengal and Assam that the actual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Saptasati is an=\r\nytime more powerful than the KS when it comes to spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;experien=\r\nces. KS is about siddhis. That too, not a simple straight chanting \n&gt; &gt;but =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with some modulations, breath controls etc etc which have=\r\n to be learnt from \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;someone qualified.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Just my 2 c=\r\nents on the topic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shashi_nambis=\r\nan&quot; &lt;shashin@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot.
