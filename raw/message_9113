One, there are limited items one can offer in fire due to its size. =\r\nTwo, long duration homam invariably generates soot which eventually goes al=\r\nl over the place. General disturbance if you want to do extended sadhana wi=\r\nth Homam. People staying abroad will have more issues due to fire safety sy=\r\nstem also. Since I don&#39;t have any means of creating such a facility at my c=\r\nurrent place in Bangalore, I thought I&#39;ll share this with other folks. If s=\r\nomeone feels it is worth pursuing and has ability (anywhere in world), they=\r\n are welcome to do so.\nMy idea was to create a site, may be 50x50 or 100x10=\r\n0 sq ft, with 11 or 21 or 51 Homa Kunda (whatever practically possible). An=\r\nyone interested to do homam can come to this place anytime 24x7x365 days, d=\r\no extended hours of homam or do 1-3-5-7 days sadhana. Bring your own stuff;=\r\n spend as much as time day/night, evenings/mornings, whatever suits you. Th=\r\ne owner of the place may provide some basic needs if the site is next to hi=\r\ns house.\n Off course all this should not involve any money and should be do=\r\nne with the sankalpa of one&#39;s spiritual progress or restoring Dharma in wor=\r\nld (as Narasimha had told many times). Also, in my opinion the place should=\r\n not be in temple premises as invariably people come with materials wishes =\r\nand pray. Well this is just a thought/wish; feel free to give your opinion.=\r\n This concept could be helpful for people staying abroad too.\nWith regards,=\r\n\nDigamber\n\n\n\n"}}
