Shiva and Vishnu had uncond=\r\nitional love and devotion for each other. They are not like normal human be=\r\nings and their relationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed b=\r\ny petty notions of superiority and dependence.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavit=\r\ne distinctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I=\r\n am willing to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is =\r\nok as long as one is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the available pat=\r\nhs. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to the mounta=\r\nin top or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen leads to t=\r\nhe top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mountain in o=\r\nne&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, there may be many p=\r\naths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other side of t=\r\nhe mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one does not think m=\r\nuch of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own path, that does no =\r\nharm.\n&gt; \n&gt; As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the oth=\r\ner paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one i=\r\ns very close to the top, one will see that all paths are leading there. Whe=\r\nn one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there. After god-realiz=\r\nation, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of course, differen=\r\nt paths come with different obstacles. One path may have some snow. One pat=\r\nh may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may have falling roc=\r\nks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on the =\r\ntop knows that people can reach there using several paths, if they are comm=\r\nitted to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let people fol=\r\nlow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach the top in th=\r\neir own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about your path. It d=\r\noes not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your path a=\r\nnd reach the top!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that some people are doing=\r\n no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judgments on =\r\nother paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the base of th=\r\ne mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to enroll the=\r\nm in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. They stay at=\r\n the base forever and never reach the top. They are a problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, pe=\r\nople with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They a=\r\nre on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishna=\r\n bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their man=\r\ntra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventua=\r\nlly make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even wo=\r\nrship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the=\r\n start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone, =\r\ntry to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep th=\r\neir austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will ev=\r\nentually make progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us not worry about people who are doing so=\r\nme sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their understanding will be=\r\n addressed in due course.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana=\r\n to burn the conditioning and keep making progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hardly disagree with your views but=\r\n for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his miss=\r\nion to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit of Shri Pr=\r\nabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased towards Shri=\r\n Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations and those views of mine =\r\nare not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same views like=\r\n me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking hard st=\r\nuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even that w=\r\nell known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures for Vais=\r\nhnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead of =\r\nShri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

You may like some and=\r\n dislike some based on your own biases about what an elephant looks like.

To go abroad without even k=\r\nnowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam Ne=\r\nw York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requires tremend=\r\nous surrender.

So many great saints came and interpreted scriptures slightly =\r\ndifferently, because there are different groups of people with different sa=\r\nmkaras waiting to be guided by them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My philosophy is simple.

In the former, one is clea=\r\nning up a dirty place that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one is =\r\ngoing to someone else&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there is some ra=\r\ndioactive waste there and one is not protected, one may be affected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like frui=\r\nts lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit after another and eats them. =\r\nSome may be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals a=\r\nnd other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a t=\r\nrash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may=\r\n be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conductin=\r\ng the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the o=\r\nld days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough purity to handle =\r\nsuch things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. They are quite=\r\n vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahm=\r\nanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient f=\r\nor one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions h=\r\nave to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence =\r\nover others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowl=\r\nedge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very=\r\n very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can=\r\n be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desir=\r\nous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for=\r\n others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWell, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when =\r\nyou are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana li=\r\nfestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly be=\r\ncome a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatri=\r\nyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 b=\r\nelow on astrologers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment and t=\r\nhere is an element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here =\r\ntoo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doi=\r\nng this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving a=\r\ndvice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik cr=\r\nossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly =\r\nan action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then=\r\n one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and s=\r\nome sufferings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s k=\r\narmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? We=\r\nll, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle descr=\r\nibed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahma=\r\nna by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. =\r\nIrrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahma=\r\nna if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karma=\r\ns of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again,=\r\n to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmana=\r\ns by conduct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you look at =\r\nthe criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught =\r\nJyotish!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Soft=\r\nware, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Sarasw=\r\natiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Bra=\r\nhmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I t=\r\nhink this is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I am po=\r\nsting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training=\r\n sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\nowever in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and cl=\r\nose uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (ast=\r\nrologer) and yrou family. This may sound a very immature comment, but I tho=\r\nught I should get your opinion / thoughts on this before I proceed on this =\r\njourney.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would appreciate getting a honest response =\r\nso I can put this issue to rest once and for all. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Raj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I am drawn to astology more fr=\r\nom an academic perspective of how it influences our life and how ignorant w=\r\ne are of this power around us. My goal is to get the little understanding t=\r\nhat I can of this marvelous science and educate our next generation so they=\r\n are not blinded by modern society and develop / retain respect for astrolo=\r\ngy and our culture.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
