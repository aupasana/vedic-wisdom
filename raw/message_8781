Golden words!\n\nDoing japa all th=\r\ne time itself is a fine sadhana. Why should there be a harm in it? At the m=\r\ninimum, it will keep purifying your koshas and that have their own great ad=\r\nvantages in sadhana. Eventually the mantra will keep running inside you all=\r\n the time and yet you will be able to flawlessly perform your daily activit=\r\nies.\n\n\nAbout Purushacharana, yes a certain no of repetations have to be don=\r\ne for a mantra, then 1/10 of that given in Homa etc etc. All that is the te=\r\nchnicality. But until one has done the first most crucial step, a purusacha=\r\nrana will not succeed in the real sense.\n\nWithout a Purusa consciousness, a=\r\n purusacharana effort merely becomes a vehemently rajasik sadhana. At the e=\r\nnd of it one gets one more layer of I-ness that I have done such and such s=\r\nadhana, and also zero mantra-chaitanya comes to a person.. Mantra chaitanya=\r\n is a very rare things. The mantra will actually reveal itself in all the p=\r\nlanes. It is the real effect of genuine purusacharana. Of course, mantra-ch=\r\naitanya can come through other methods too. Purusacharana is one method amo=\r\nng many.\n\nIn olden times when a person would *successfully* complete a cert=\r\nain Purusacharana, they would be conferred a higher level of abhisekh. Nowa=\r\ndays, frankly and mostly, all that happens in the name of Purusacharana in =\r\nparamparas is by hook or crook just finish a prescribed number of japa/homa=\r\n and then be given a title and then feel happy and proud about it internall=\r\ny. I have met some people like that. All have heavy titles attached to thei=\r\nr names, this and that. It does not make the person genuinely spiritual at =\r\nall, for the heart of the purusacharana practice has already been lost.\n\n\nF=\r\nor ordinary people like us, doing japa, as you mentioned below, more and mo=\r\nre is very good. It purifies us. One can do it at all times, do it under th=\r\ne breath. Eventually it can become a background process in your life. Moreo=\r\nver, when you do mindful japa, that is even superb. It is a meditation in i=\r\ntself. It can be done even while moving and beauty of the mantra will keep =\r\ntickling in. Not thinking of sadhana in technical terms and rather as a ser=\r\nvice to ones Istha makes the japa even more powerful and beautiful.\n\n\nInfac=\r\nt, if we mindfully do every action - no doubt difficult initially - then li=\r\nke Swami Sivananda says, everything becomes an act of sadhana!\n\n-Regards\n=\r\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAw=\r\namajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n=\r\n From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com \nSent: Tuesday, 23 October 2012 5:08 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A =\r\nfew thoughts on Surrendering and Purushacharana\n \n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\nNamaste Rajars=\r\nhiji,\n\nThank you for the message....I found it very interesting.\n\nI can acc=\r\nept that what you say about purascharana is true. I certainly cannot claim =\r\nto have established this Purusha consciousness perfectly within myself. I a=\r\nm therefore not doing a &#39;true&#39; purascharana in the way you describe.\n\nBased=\r\n on what I had previously read, I thought &#39;Purascharana&#39; was a certain numb=\r\ner of repetitions of the Name or Mantra of God, as a supplication or prayer=\r\n, with proper feeling. Even this is difficult for me at times. Sometimes I =\r\nsay the mantra with feeling, sometimes with boredom (and checking the clock=\r\n to see when japa time will be over). Sometimes I barely manage to fit in t=\r\nhe number of malas I have set for myself in the day. Luckily, though God&#39;s =\r\ngrace, I am kind of on track, if only in terms of doing a certain number of=\r\n repetitions in a certain amount of time.\n\nSo basically, I guess I am not d=\r\noing Purascharana in the way you describe...I guess that I doing a japa pra=\r\nctice, that involves a certain number of repetitions in a certain period of=\r\n time.\n\nI feel comforted by this practice, and feel it&#39;s the right thing fo=\r\nr me to do. I feel one doesn&#39;t have to be qualified to do Japa....the Japa =\r\ngives one all the qualifications that one lack&#39;s including proper devotion.=\r\n \n\nSivananda says that even mechanical repetition has some effect, though r=\r\nepetition with feeling is ideal. This helps me to do japa, when my mind reb=\r\nels saying &quot;there is no feeling!&quot;....I tell myself, some japa is better tha=\r\nn no japa!\n\nThe way I mentally see my sadhana is:\n\n1. Japa with some feelin=\r\ng, devotion- Ideal\n2. Japa with no feeling- Not ideal, but still better tha=\r\nn no japa\n3. No japa at all during the day- very bad. Worst case scenario. =\r\n:)\n\nThanks for the information about Purascharana. I hope the Japa qualifie=\r\ns me to do a true Purascharana one day. :)\n\nOm Namo Narayanaya\n\nAparna\n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Om Namah Narayanaya\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; I agree we have to keep striv=\r\ning....&#39;personal&#39; effort has to \n&gt; continue...what a mahabharatha this inne=\r\nr fight is! Definitely need God \n&gt; as the charioteer for any chance of succ=\r\ness.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Absolutely! One huge Mahabharata of confusions, errors, failing=\r\ns, again getting up and trying, not stopping, changing the gunas of ones sa=\r\ndhana etc etc. Grace is vital.\n&gt; \n&gt; BUT, and here is a big cause, many time=\r\ns people mistake the workings of their own lower nature (Apara Prakriti) as=\r\n some sort of grace. This is nothing but an attempt by different parts - of=\r\n below the surface of the working mind -=C3=82=C2=A0 to pull back the sadha=\r\nna and hang on to the old personality.\n&gt; \n&gt; The whole of sadhana, in a nuts=\r\nhell, is changing our, stupid, flawed, ignorant surface personality. And on=\r\nce you do so, you WILL be forced to renegotiate your old life-equations. Bu=\r\nt there is a lower prakirit in man and nature as well, which works through =\r\nthe automated motions of our prana shakti, that needs to be controlled. It =\r\nhas no light of God within it. Light is knowledge. At the higher spiritual =\r\nlevels light and will are fused together. In our plane of existence light, =\r\nthat is correct knowledge, and will have become separated and distorted. Th=\r\nerefore often you may have the will to achieve to something but not the rig=\r\nht knowledge needed for it. This leads to confusions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway grace is =\r\nproduct of true surrenderance from the mind, from the deeper emotional bein=\r\ng and the physical being. These also correspond to the consciousness workin=\r\ng in manomaya-kosha, pranamaya-kosha and annamaya-kosha. Until this is reac=\r\nhed, grace does not come, and even if it does, it gets perverted by our low=\r\ner nature. In Gita Bhagawan calls it Apara-Prakriti. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is one thing =\r\nto say verbally that all sadhana being done is work of God&#39;s Shakti. It is =\r\nentirely different matter to see it clearly for which one must a) surrender=\r\n constantly b) reject and withdraw ones lower nature, or at least keep it c=\r\nlam and checked c) make a sincere call to God. Only when these three work t=\r\nogether, grace descends. And only grace has the power to cause a thorough t=\r\nransformation of a sadhaka. Nothing less. But you can&#39;t demand grace, you c=\r\nan&#39;t beg for grace, you can&#39;t plead, you can&#39;t command, and you can&#39;t indul=\r\nge in self-pity. We have to calmly and patiently wait for it for when the t=\r\nime is right, it calls like a sweet rain on a parched throat, and in a flas=\r\nh it can do more than what we can imagine. Basically, we cannot negotiate w=\r\nith God. Nothing less than a complete honest recoking on what we are, where=\r\n we are heading, what mistakes lie in our nature is a must.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then slowl=\r\ny you will be made to realize the working of a higher Power that has nothin=\r\ng to do with your little surface personalities push and pulls based on Pavl=\r\novian responses to situations incurred over lifetimes. It is this Power, on=\r\nce understood, that needs to be unquestioningly submitted to in a progressi=\r\nve manner, while rejecting everything else inside us that pull us in a diff=\r\nerent direction and wants to hang on to our earlier flawed personality. Lon=\r\ng, long, long road. Patience is a key.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; A few general thoughts on Purusacharana since =\r\nthere were a few mails on this topic. Again, just my opinion. Feel free to =\r\nreject it if needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Start with the word. Purusha+acharana. Behaving l=\r\nike a man. And what does it mean? Some may say it means being brave, being =\r\nmentally robust, being aggressive, or being commanding etc. All these are t=\r\nerms that are often used in colloquial language to indicate a proverbial &#39;m=\r\nanly&#39; behavior. But in sadhana, Purusha is a different concept. Looking inw=\r\nards and separating a part of your being, from the mind, from your thoughts=\r\n, from your emotions, and even from your physcial nature. This part of your=\r\n being will only stand back and watch, as silent witness, and then either g=\r\nive or reject consent to various movements of your lower nature (lust, ange=\r\nr, jealousy, greed, covetousness, ETC). Once this is firmly installed in yo=\r\nur system - this Purusha - it will be able to stop and clam down various pa=\r\nrts of your being which have the tendency to leap-up in joy (sukha) or get =\r\ndeflated (dukhkha) at surface appearances and shallow understandings. This =\r\nis how a Purusha\n&gt;  works in Yoga. When this kind of Purusha consciounsess =\r\nis installed and established, an expansion of the mind happens beyond the r=\r\national, the emotional or even the physical nature/consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Afte=\r\nr this basic step has been done properly, then the sadhana of purushacharan=\r\na is to be done. By this method, a progressive 1/10 numerical deduction in =\r\nthe sadhana is done for each element. That is for 1000 japas, 100 homas, 10=\r\n tarpana, 1 marjana and finally feeding people. Each of this will affect a =\r\nrealization of the mantra is each of the layers - in reverse order from ann=\r\namaya-kosha, to pranamaya-kosha, to manomaya-kosha to vigyanmaya-kosha (the=\r\n spiritual layers beyond and above the reasoning mind). THAT is the perfect=\r\n effect of a spotless purushacharana. That is mantra siddhi and mantra chai=\r\ntanya.\n&gt; \n&gt; While doing a purushacharana, tremenodus amount of obstacles wi=\r\nll come in the path of the sadhaka. To overcome these, while sticking to th=\r\ne exacting rules of the sadhana, one MUST have done the first step properly=\r\n, that is installed a Purusha consciousness in his/her system, one that is =\r\nunshakeable in any adverse conditions. One that is perfectly unmoved by the=\r\n working of the lower nature in man as well as outside man. For example, on=\r\ne may get affected by high fever, various crisis situations, various attack=\r\ns from hostile forces etc etc, Many things. But inspite of that the Purusha=\r\n consciouness, if it has been firmly established, will drive the sadhana wi=\r\nthout a glitch, remaining unmoved. Of course, one must honestly judge how f=\r\nar such a consciousness has been developed. Self-delusion has to be guarded=\r\n against.\n&gt; \n&gt; One can try for oneself to do purushacharanas and see how fa=\r\nr one succeeds. In my opinion though, 98 % of seekers in this age are unfit=\r\n to do purushacharana and succeed in this sadhana. For the Purusha consciou=\r\nsness has not been established in the system by most people. In the last 6 =\r\nyears among all varieties of sadhakas I have met, of various paths, only tw=\r\no were there who I felt can pull off a genuine purusacharana. Rest no chanc=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doing any sadhana at the same time, same place, using same material=\r\ns, without breaks for years and years is always good. Goes without saying. =\r\nThis too, most people cannot do flawlessly. Purushacharana is far more comp=\r\nlex and demanding. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then the other option is to develop genuine surren=\r\nder from the deepest part of your heart. Do sadhana, and wait patiently. He=\r\nr grace is bound to come and illuminate the path. Meanhile, we can keep wor=\r\nking on rectifying the lower nature in ourselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jai Ma Tara.\n&gt; \n&gt; -R=\r\negards\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyakt=\r\nimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttam=\r\nam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: sunrise_1080 =\r\n&lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 23 =\r\nOctober 2012 3:07 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; =\r\nNamaste Rajarshiji,\n&gt; \n&gt; That is a very interesting way of looking at a yan=\r\ntra.

PurascharaNa or re=\r\ngular \n&gt; &gt; chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:=\r\n10. You \n&gt; &gt; have to follow it strictly.&gt;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is always good =\r\nto do japa, but &quot;strict&quot; is too strong a word. There are many in different =\r\nparts of India, well versed in sadhana as well as respective shastras (resp=\r\nective because no single human being can known all possible Hindu Shastras,=\r\n so most study that which maybe relevant to his line of spiritual inquiry f=\r\nollowed in his tradition) who do homas without doing any pre-requisite japa=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One honest question that every sadhaka must ask himself/herself=\r\n objectively is, how badly do we want God? If the desire pure and unblemish=\r\ned, or is it also mixed with various other desires, however small they mayb=\r\ne. If we also want other materialistic things along with it - and there is =\r\nno harm in wanting legitimate things - then one can follow all instructions=\r\n and rules set for whatever parampara one is mentally afflicted to and give=\r\nn by his/her Guru(s). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But if one is desirous of ONLY God without =\r\nany other desire attached to it, no rule is sufficient, no path is a guaran=\r\ntee, no sadhana is sure-shot way to achieve it.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 =\r\nWorking on internal surrender to God and increased detachment in daily life=\r\n along with and through whatever ritual one performs and in whatever manner=\r\n, can be more helpful in the long run. Human aspiration alone is not enough=\r\n. When the aspiration is genuine and pure, He/She extends his/her energy to=\r\n lift the sadhak up.. this dual phenomenon together make a sadhana success.=\r\n And this simple yet powerful truth is represented by the six-pointed trian=\r\ngle which is the basic yantra of so many deities, and specially one form of=\r\n the Mother. The upward triangle is our aspiration, the downward is Her gra=\r\nce coming down to transform the sadhak from his/her current state. Together=\r\n, it makes a complete whole. And grace is purely proportional to the purity=\r\n of the aspiration, which only God can\n judge\n&gt; &gt;  accurately.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; awaktam wyakti=\r\nmApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; &gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanutta=\r\nmam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt;  From: ashu=\r\ntosh.srikanth &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Sent: Monday, 22 October 2012 5:17 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam -=\r\n Ahuti numbers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; My pranams to=\r\n all.\n&gt; &gt; I have been performing weekly havan for more than a year and half=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; I want to point out certain things related to havan so that it can be=\r\n done as per shastra by others too.\n&gt; &gt; I am using a conversation that in f=\r\nact took place to bring out these relevant points.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sometime back t=\r\nhere was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am presenting below: \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [South Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;ashTamangala prashNa=\r\n&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong - called as dosha.]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm... let me see... Hmm=\r\n.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya at your home re=\r\ngularly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised by this pointe=\r\nd question because I had not told anybody about the havan I did at home)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agni karya you ar=\r\ne doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti does not=\r\n seem to be right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of gh=\r\nee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in=\r\n my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do required J=\r\napa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that=\r\n you use for your regular japa?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is=\r\n there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsh=\r\na. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one become=\r\ns qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for ev=\r\nery 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahut=\r\ni)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I=\r\n read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with =\r\nthat book series)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. Pu=\r\nrascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or =\r\nat least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The conversation we=\r\nnt onto several other things. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesha=\r\n from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra and also using the same =\r\nmantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ratio only and have=\r\n been very happy with my spiritual progress since. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whether all th=\r\ne homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I just wanted to poi=\r\nnt this out to all requesting everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa o=\r\nf the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Ashutosh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n \r\n--1004636618-2146671071-1350997913=:39234\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;Namaste,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; =\r\nfont-family: Courier New,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-serif; background-co=\r\nlor: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D=\r\n&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: Courier New,courier,mon=\r\naco,monospace,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your mail reminded me of a quotation from Swami Sivnanda that I ha=\r\nd read. &quot;Make everything into a sadhana&quot;.

I certainly ca=\r\nnnot claim to have established this Purusha consciousness perfectly within =\r\nmyself. I am therefore not doing a &#39;true&#39; purascharana in the way you descr=\r\nibe.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBased on what I had previously read, I thought &#39;Purascharana&#39;=\r\n was a certain number of repetitions of the Name or Mantra of God, as a sup=\r\nplication or prayer, with proper feeling. Even this is difficult for me at =\r\ntimes. Sometimes I say the mantra with feeling, sometimes with boredom (and=\r\n checking the clock to see when japa time will be over). Sometimes I barely=\r\n manage to fit in the number of malas I have set for myself in the day. Luc=\r\nkily, though God&#39;s grace, I am kind of on track, if only in terms of doing =\r\na certain number of repetitions in a certain amount of time.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo ba=\r\nsically, I guess I am not doing Purascharana in the way you describe...I gu=\r\ness that I doing a japa practice, that involves a certain number of repetit=\r\nions in a certain period of time.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI feel comforted by this practic=\r\ne, and feel it&#39;s the right thing for me to do. I feel one doesn&#39;t have to b=\r\ne qualified to do Japa....the Japa gives one all the qualifications that on=\r\ne lack&#39;s including proper devotion. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSivananda says that even mech=\r\nanical repetition has some effect, though repetition with feeling is ideal.=\r\n This helps me to do japa, when my mind rebels saying &quot;there is no feeling!=\r\n&quot;....I tell myself, some japa is better than no japa!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe way I me=\r\nntally see my sadhana is:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n1. Japa with some feeling, devotion- Ide=\r\nal&lt;br&gt;\n2. Japa with no feeling- Not ideal, but still better than no japa&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n3. No japa at all during the day- very bad. Worst case scenario. :)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nThanks for the information about Purascharana. I hope the Japa qualifie=\r\ns me to do a true Purascharana one day. :)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOm Namo Narayanaya&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nAparna&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wis=\r\ndom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yaho=\r\nogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi1=\r\n4@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Om Namah Nar=\r\nayanaya&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I agree we have to keep strivi=\r\nng....&#39;personal&#39; effort has to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; continue...what a mahabharatha thi=\r\ns inner fight is! Definitely need God &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as the charioteer for any c=\r\nhance of success.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Absolutely! One huge Mahabhara=\r\nta of confusions, errors, failings, again getting up and trying, not stoppi=\r\nng, changing the gunas of ones sadhana etc etc. Grace is vital.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; BUT, and here is a big cause, many times people mistake the working=\r\ns of their own lower nature (Apara Prakriti) as some sort of grace. This is=\r\n nothing but an attempt by different parts - of below the surface of the wo=\r\nrking mind -=C3=82&nbsp; to pull back the sadhana and hang on to the old pe=\r\nrsonality.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The whole of sadhana, in a nutshell, is chang=\r\ning our, stupid, flawed, ignorant surface personality. And once you do so, =\r\nyou WILL be forced to renegotiate your old life-equations. But there is a l=\r\nower prakirit in man and nature as well, which works through the automated =\r\nmotions of our prana shakti, that needs to be controlled. It has no light o=\r\nf God within it. Light is knowledge. At the higher spiritual levels light a=\r\nnd will are fused together. In our plane of existence light, that is correc=\r\nt knowledge, and will have become separated and distorted. Therefore often =\r\nyou may have the will to achieve to something but not the right knowledge n=\r\needed for it. This leads to confusions.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Anyway grace is =\r\nproduct of true surrenderance from the mind, from the deeper emotional bein=\r\ng and the physical being. These also correspond to the consciousness workin=\r\ng in manomaya-kosha, pranamaya-kosha and annamaya-kosha. Until this is reac=\r\nhed, grace does not come, and even if it does, it gets perverted by our low=\r\ner nature. In Gita Bhagawan calls it Apara-Prakriti. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It=\r\n is one thing to say verbally that all sadhana being done is work of God&#39;s =\r\nShakti. It is entirely different matter to see it clearly for which one mus=\r\nt a) surrender constantly b) reject and withdraw ones lower nature, or at l=\r\neast keep it clam and checked c) make a sincere call to God. Only when thes=\r\ne three work together, grace descends. And only grace has the power to caus=\r\ne a thorough transformation of a sadhaka. Nothing less. But you can&#39;t deman=\r\nd grace, you can&#39;t beg for grace, you can&#39;t plead, you can&#39;t command, and y=\r\nou can&#39;t indulge in self-pity. We have to calmly and patiently wait for it =\r\nfor when the time is right, it calls like a sweet rain on a parched throat,=\r\n and in a flash it can do more than what we can imagine. Basically, we cann=\r\not negotiate with God. Nothing less than a complete honest recoking on what=\r\n we are, where we are heading, what mistakes lie in our nature is a must.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Then slowly you will be made to realize the working of a =\r\nhigher Power that has nothing to do with your little surface personalities =\r\npush and pulls based on Pavlovian responses to situations incurred over lif=\r\netimes. It is this Power, once understood, that needs to be unquestioningly=\r\n submitted to in a progressive manner, while rejecting everything else insi=\r\nde us that pull us in a different direction and wants to hang on to our ear=\r\nlier flawed personality. Long, long, long road. Patience is a key.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; A few general thoughts on Purusacharana since there were a few mai=\r\nls on this topic. Again, just my opinion. Feel free to reject it if needed.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Start with the word. Purusha+acharana. Behaving like a =\r\nman. And what does it mean? Some may say it means being brave, being mental=\r\nly robust, being aggressive, or being commanding etc. All these are terms t=\r\nhat are often used in colloquial language to indicate a proverbial &#39;manly&#39; =\r\nbehavior. But in sadhana, Purusha is a different concept. Looking inwards a=\r\nnd separating a part of your being, from the mind, from your thoughts, from=\r\n your emotions, and even from your physcial nature. This part of your being=\r\n will only stand back and watch, as silent witness, and then either give or=\r\n reject consent to various movements of your lower nature (lust, anger, jea=\r\nlousy, greed, covetousness, ETC). Once this is firmly installed in your sys=\r\ntem - this Purusha - it will be able to stop and clam down various parts of=\r\n your being which have the tendency to leap-up in joy (sukha) or get deflat=\r\ned (dukhkha) at surface appearances and shallow understandings. This is how=\r\n a\n Purusha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  works in Yoga. When this kind of Purusha consciounses=\r\ns is installed and established, an expansion of the mind happens beyond the=\r\n rational, the emotional or even the physical nature/consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; After this basic step has been done properly, then the sadhana =\r\nof purushacharana is to be done. By this method, a progressive 1/10 numeric=\r\nal deduction in the sadhana is done for each element. That is for 1000 japa=\r\ns, 100 homas, 10 tarpana, 1 marjana and finally feeding people. Each of thi=\r\ns will affect a realization of the mantra is each of the layers - in revers=\r\ne order from annamaya-kosha, to pranamaya-kosha, to manomaya-kosha to vigya=\r\nnmaya-kosha (the spiritual layers beyond and above the reasoning mind). THA=\r\nT is the perfect effect of a spotless purushacharana. That is mantra siddhi=\r\n and mantra chaitanya.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; While doing a purushacharana, tre=\r\nmenodus amount of obstacles will come in the path of the sadhaka. To overco=\r\nme these, while sticking to the exacting rules of the sadhana, one MUST hav=\r\ne done the first step properly, that is installed a Purusha consciousness i=\r\nn his/her system, one that is unshakeable in any adverse conditions. One th=\r\nat is perfectly unmoved by the working of the lower nature in man as well a=\r\ns outside man. For example, one may get affected by high fever, various cri=\r\nsis situations, various attacks from hostile forces etc etc, Many things. B=\r\nut inspite of that the Purusha consciouness, if it has been firmly establis=\r\nhed, will drive the sadhana without a glitch, remaining unmoved. Of course,=\r\n one must honestly judge how far such a consciousness has been developed. S=\r\nelf-delusion has to be guarded against.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One can try for =\r\noneself to do purushacharanas and see how far one succeeds. In my opinion t=\r\nhough, 98 % of seekers in this age are unfit to do purushacharana and succe=\r\ned in this sadhana. For the Purusha consciousness has not been established =\r\nin the system by most people. In the last 6 years among all varieties of sa=\r\ndhakas I have met, of various paths, only two were there who I felt can pul=\r\nl off a genuine purusacharana. Rest no chance.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Doing any=\r\n sadhana at the same time, same place, using same materials, without breaks=\r\n for years and years is always good. Goes without saying. This too, most pe=\r\nople cannot do flawlessly. Purushacharana is far more complex and demanding=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Then the other option is to develop genuine surrender=\r\n from the deepest part of your heart. Do sadhana, and wait patiently. Her g=\r\nrace is bound to come and illuminate the path. Meanhile, we can keep workin=\r\ng on rectifying the lower nature in ourselves.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jai Ma Ta=\r\nra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; awaktam=\r\n wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamA=\r\nwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; _____________________=\r\n___________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nTo: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 23 October 2012 3:07 PM&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshiji,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; That is a very interestin=\r\ng way of looking at a yantra.

Respectfully yet firmly I disagree on one point.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Myself: Doesnt that only apply to puraschar=\r\naNa (based on what I read in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Aghore book - as everybody in t=\r\nhis group is already familiar with that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; book series)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. Purasch=\r\naraNa or regular &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always=\r\n 1:100 or at least 1:10. You &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; have to follow it strictly.&gt;=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is always good to do japa,=\r\n but &quot;strict&quot; is too strong a word. There are many in different parts of In=\r\ndia, well versed in sadhana as well as respective shastras (respective beca=\r\nuse no single human being can known all possible Hindu Shastras, so most st=\r\nudy that which maybe relevant to his line of spiritual inquiry followed in =\r\nhis tradition) who do homas without doing any pre-requisite japa. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One honest question that every sadhaka must ask himsel=\r\nf/herself objectively is, how badly do we want God? If the desire pure and =\r\nunblemished, or is it also mixed with various other desires, however small =\r\nthey maybe. If we also want other materialistic things along with it - and =\r\nthere is no harm in wanting legitimate things - then one can follow all ins=\r\ntructions and rules set for whatever parampara one is mentally afflicted to=\r\n and given by his/her Guru(s). &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But if one is =\r\ndesirous of ONLY God without any other desire attached to it, no rule is su=\r\nfficient, no path is a guarantee, no sadhana is sure-shot way to achieve it=\r\n.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; Working on internal surrender to God and incre=\r\nased detachment in daily life along with and through whatever ritual one pe=\r\nrforms and in whatever manner, can be more helpful in the long run. Human a=\r\nspiration alone is not enough. When the aspiration is genuine and pure, He/=\r\nShe extends his/her energy to lift the sadhak up.. this dual phenomenon tog=\r\nether make a sadhana success. And this simple yet powerful truth is represe=\r\nnted by the six-pointed triangle which is the basic yantra of so many deiti=\r\nes, and specially one form of the Mother. The upward triangle is our aspira=\r\ntion, the downward is Her grace coming down to transform the sadhak from hi=\r\ns/her current state. Together, it makes a complete whole. And grace is pure=\r\nly proportional to the purity of the aspiration, which\n only God can judge&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  accurately.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; par=\r\nam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  From: ashut=\r\nosh.srikanth &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollo=\r\nw&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, 22 October 2012 5:17 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject=\r\n: [vedic-wisdom] Homam - Ahuti numbers&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; My pranams to all.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; I have been performing weekly havan for more than a year and half.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I want to point out certain things related to havan so that =\r\nit can be done as per shastra by others too.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am using a con=\r\nversation that in fact took place to bring out these relevant points.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sometime back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session =\r\nwhose summary I am presenting below: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [South I=\r\nndians might be familiar with similar &quot;ashTamangala prashNa&quot; conducted in t=\r\nemples when something goes wrong - called as dosha.]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm... let me see...=\r\n Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya at your hom=\r\ne regularly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very =\r\nsurprised by this pointed question because I had not told anybody about the=\r\n havan I did at home)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There=\r\n are certain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using d=\r\nry samith materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little =\r\nbit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Myself:=\r\n Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa before giving ahutis? =\r\nAnd do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for your regular =\r\njapa?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there=\r\n a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti rat=\r\nio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditati=\r\non, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha=\r\n ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified =\r\nto give 1 ahuti)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Myself: Doesnt that only appl=\r\ny to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in th=\r\nis group is already familiar with that book series)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything.

You ha=\r\nve to follow it strictly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The conversation wen=\r\nt onto several other things. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesha =\r\nfrom a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra and also using the same m=\r\nantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ratio only and have =\r\nbeen very happy with my spiritual progress since. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I=\r\n just wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to perform at le=\r\nast 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; f=\r\nor the ahuti.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ashutosh&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1004636618-2146671071-1350997913=:39234--\r\n\n"}}
