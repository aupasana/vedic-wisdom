Since the last 4-5 years I have pref=\r\nerred to stay away from internet forums due to various reasons. It has been=\r\n nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. However after Naras=\r\nimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my write up to my inbo=\r\nx, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some posts. I am happy =\r\nto note that the general atmosphere here is far better and more sincere tha=\r\nn a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this particular thr=\r\nead, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji=\r\n has raised an important question regarding the necessity of initiation. I =\r\nwill address it after summarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked =\r\nin order to understand the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firs=\r\ntly is the question a general or specific one? Generally speaking if the qu=\r\nestion is whether initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life =\r\nor sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question is about the necess=\r\nity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, th=\r\ne answer is =C3=82=E2=80=93YES.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the =\r\ntantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multi=\r\nple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the p=\r\nan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current cont=\r\next of this question I will restrict myself to only the five that are relev=\r\nant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; b. Y=\r\noga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti ma=\r\nrga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless=\r\n Actions)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of th=\r\ne great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES p=\r\narticular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstrac=\r\nt truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant m=\r\nethods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; For those who are p=\r\nredominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external=\r\n guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and =\r\nexperience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the =\r\nmethods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita bein=\r\ng essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik=\r\n practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an important =\r\npractice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a mar=\r\nginal role for external practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (=\r\nself-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-a=\r\nttachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39;=\r\n (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina =\r\nschools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to niri=\r\nshwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional =\r\nacceptance of Iswara&#39;s will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the =\r\ncontrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhaga=\r\nvad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is the main=\r\nstay of Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantri=\r\nc path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation=\r\n and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the pr=\r\nacticalization of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through=\r\n the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab =\r\nexperiment and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be=\r\n remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at vari=\r\nous levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is =\r\nto the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path=\r\n invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, ano=\r\nther the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya=\r\n and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire o=\r\nf Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs hig=\r\nhly powerful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays great empha=\r\nsis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualificati=\r\non. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervision=\r\n? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other l=\r\nab experiment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apar=\r\nt from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However =\r\nthe lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the S=\r\nakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sak=\r\nti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain fr=\r\nom further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless d=\r\netails here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it w=\r\nithin the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river with=\r\nin the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhan=\r\nas comprehensively. However there are actually three major schools that are=\r\n full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikul=\r\na and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya=\r\n sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vaj=\r\nrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are fa=\r\nmiliar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of S=\r\nri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sak=\r\nta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* =\r\ninvokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predomina=\r\nntly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestones in the internal spiritu=\r\nal journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a=\r\n particular set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineag=\r\nes. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particu=\r\nlar spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compar=\r\ned to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk a=\r\nrises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively down=\r\nward till the individual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can vis=\r\nualise it. Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity.=\r\n It is held by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the =\r\ncircuit necessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short ci=\r\nrcuit. Imagine many beautiful\n bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted =\r\ntree of live wires, where there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in sil=\r\nent practice all the way up till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Lig=\r\nht (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As alr=\r\neady stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual consc=\r\niousness through an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnan=\r\na, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved i=\r\nnto highly comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously =\r\nhold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic=\r\n approach. However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like th=\r\ne Upanishads. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Man=\r\ntrasastra. The question of initiation is relevant only to those following t=\r\nhe Tantramarga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those=\r\n who explore the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevan=\r\nt which I have covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are alread=\r\ny inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for im=\r\nmensely powerful reflections through its central message\n of Oneness. The c=\r\nrest jewel, the crowning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Dev=\r\ni Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one wit=\r\nhout a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there be=\r\nsides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads a=\r\nnd reflect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason I advised t=\r\nhe non-initiate to read in English or any other regional language is becaus=\r\ne understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only when =\r\none repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can fully follow. The=\r\n main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic t=\r\next too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chand=\r\ni is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially th=\r\ne four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Ve=\r\nda Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice =\r\nof Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method =\r\nwill straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fa=\r\nct even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on an=\r\nd DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu te=\r\nmple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part =\r\nof Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are =\r\nthose who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mant=\r\nra marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation as per its o=\r\nwn principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path =\r\nof Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even t=\r\nhe Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise =\r\nHomam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidi=\r\nk practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these appro=\r\naches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the living an=\r\nd breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced ori=\r\nginally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to=\r\n Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those paths, be it=\r\n Sri\n Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual =\r\nprogress through any of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhy=\r\naya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, S=\r\nakshi bhava, Homa etc are all effective. However depending on the individua=\r\nl temperament, aptitude etc., some of these methods are more suited relativ=\r\nely to different practitioners. One may progress through a combination of a=\r\nny of these methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrate=\r\nd approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture a=\r\ngainst which the answer to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFinally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and S=\r\nATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular=\r\n self-study of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the =\r\ntexts. This is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. A=\r\ns for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyay=\r\na is the alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not p=\r\nossible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid=\r\n progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted stat=\r\ne by virtue of serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sa=\r\ndhus and sants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath =\r\nmade a quantum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsan=\r\ngha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFor those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will jus=\r\nt quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders=\r\n nowadays that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The compa=\r\nny of Sadhus is a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere dema=\r\nnd, the supply will come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If =\r\nyou are really thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You le=\r\nad a happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. =\r\nYou do not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle g=\r\nossiping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passi=\r\non, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Sats=\r\nanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shal=\r\nl take you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right=\r\n path, guide you and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or h=\r\nigh souls are waiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas =\r\nare in plenty.\n Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no =\r\ngood Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real se=\r\nekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this foru=\r\nm is an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, =\r\nthis group too is a potential Satsangha though not comparable to the actual=\r\n company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-ved=\r\nantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chant=\r\ns lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflection, by discernmen=\r\nt of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on a group such as th=\r\nis, one makes progress truly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly or repl=\r\ny at least for a while. However I might participate in some discussions on =\r\nand off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste e=\r\nverybody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I read this message of respected Narasimha Garu few t=\r\nimes.

Because of this ritual, god may give any material results or spir=\r\nitual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever=\r\n god gives.

In th=\r\ne case of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in the case of (i), =\r\nthere are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get in =\r\ntrouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there =\r\nare very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the =\r\nwhole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and=\r\n rituals only for increasing surrender, getting whatever material results g=\r\nod wants to give and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do ritua=\r\nls for begetting *specific* material results (for oneself or others or soci=\r\nety/universe in general), Nature will make arrangements for one to get corr=\r\nect knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts, one should start with th=\r\ne attitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any=\r\n mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have seve=\r\nral material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this=\r\n ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and not nec=\r\nessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to inc=\r\nrease my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then =\r\nSAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fe=\r\nwer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccup=\r\ns. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten=\r\n fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retr=\r\nieve one good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it=\r\n gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If =\r\nthe person is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage=\r\n of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten f=\r\nruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a bas=\r\nket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and g=\r\nive you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity lik=\r\ne Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit=\r\n, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava\n=\r\n or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out =\r\nfaster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not deit=\r\ny&#39;s creations, but fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;v=\r\ne had to eat each of those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotte=\r\nn fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying w=\r\nith gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed b=\r\ny a guru before starting a practice. If you realize the above, you can star=\r\nt mantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realiz=\r\ne that it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is trying to acceler=\r\nate good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life and were ignor=\r\nant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who took several hou=\r\nrs to read Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 years back are now doing =\r\nChandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them have=\r\n transformed a lot and have experienced some things too. Obviously, they ha=\r\nve done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mothe=\r\nr in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank=\r\n materialism, if someone has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is i=\r\nmportant, is looking for god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhan=\r\na (e.g. Chandipath), that person obviously has some good karmas and good va=\r\nsanas. That person has done that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadha=\r\nna itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good underst=\r\nanding of what is what, how things work, why one should do something, how t=\r\no do it, what is more important and what is less important, that is what in=\r\nitiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yo=\r\nurself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Saraswat=\r\niFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal opinion that Strong and long standing=\r\n urge should be considered as Initiation at least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I =\r\nknow a person who wanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not able=\r\n to almost for a year.

However if the question is about the necessity of being ini=\r\ntiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=\r\n=82=E2=80=93YES.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as t=\r\nhe tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and mu=\r\nltiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In th=\r\ne pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current c=\r\nontext of this question I will restrict myself to only the five that are re=\r\nlevant to the discussion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga\n (Advai=\r\ntic/Vedantic)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; c.=\r\n Mantra marga (Tantric)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of t=\r\nhe great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES =\r\nparticular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstra=\r\nct truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant =\r\nmethods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; For those=\r\n who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even th=\r\ne external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the w=\r\nisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita empha=\r\nsises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Ad=\r\nvaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it\n has retained=\r\n the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an=\r\n important practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way=\r\n with a marginal role for external practices.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yo=\r\nga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vair=\r\nagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally=\r\n emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara=\r\n) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first =\r\ntwo as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhakti =\r\nmarga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will =\r\nthrough total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Kar=\r\nma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in action=\r\ns without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the G=\r\nita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally I will address\n the Tantric path of=\r\n mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and ther=\r\neby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicaliz=\r\nation of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the empl=\r\noyment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experimen=\r\nt and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remember=\r\ned that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various level=\r\ns, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the ag=\r\ne-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/=\r\nemploys the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the =\r\nfire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so o=\r\nn.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with t=\r\nhe fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra em=\r\nploys highly powerful techniques that bring\n results more quickly it lays g=\r\nreat emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about q=\r\nualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any s=\r\nupervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like a=\r\nny other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the proc=\r\nedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too=\r\n. However the lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awake=\r\nning the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kun=\r\ndalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will =\r\nrefrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other =\r\nneedless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampa=\r\nra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, o=\r\nne has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sad=\r\nhana is one major river within the\n Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas =\r\ncover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually=\r\n three major schools that are full-fledged living traditions among the Dash=\r\naMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs=\r\n to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the =\r\npicture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to =\r\nTarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw atten=\r\ntion to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advait=\r\nic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma =\r\nis not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least =\r\nat the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mant=\r\nra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchroni=\r\nstic frequencies for each of\n these three lineages. Initiation is the full-=\r\nfledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of th=\r\nat path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with=\r\n SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-=\r\nbranches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual sa=\r\ndhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern m=\r\netaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric =\r\nadvocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the c=\r\nonduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautif=\r\nul bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where th=\r\nere is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up =\r\ntill Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabd=\r\na). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As already state=\r\nd Sakta sadhana seeks\n to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness =\r\nthrough an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana=\r\n, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highl=\r\ny comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the =\r\nmany in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach=\r\n. However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanish=\r\nads. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra=\r\n. The question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantra=\r\nmarga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who expl=\r\nore the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I=\r\n have covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already incline=\r\nd to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely p=\r\nowerful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel=\r\n, the crowning\n glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself=\r\n proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a se=\r\ncond, saying &quot;I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?=\r\n&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflec=\r\nt on the central truth of Advaita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The reason I =\r\nadvised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional language =\r\nis because understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible o=\r\nnly when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can fully fo=\r\nllow. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic an=\r\nd Yogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri =\r\nSri Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, espe=\r\ncially the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras =\r\nor the Veda Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the =\r\npractice\n of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Ved=\r\nic method will straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic pract=\r\nice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully b=\r\nased on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with th=\r\ne Hindu temple.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do th=\r\ne Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with th=\r\ne Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do=\r\n the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that n=\r\needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if o=\r\nne adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abh=\r\nyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devout=\r\nly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not incline=\r\nd to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit fr=\r\nom\n any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to be=\r\nar in mind that the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as wel=\r\nl as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent o=\r\nriginally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of init=\r\niation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the m=\r\nerthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarap=\r\nranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all=\r\n effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc.,=\r\n some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practitioner=\r\ns. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods in spirit=\r\nual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involv=\r\nes Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer\n to t=\r\nhe question has to be contextualised.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally on=\r\ne last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA a=\r\nre the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-stud=\r\ny of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. Thi=\r\ns is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATS=\r\nANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the a=\r\nlternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. I=\r\nt is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress =\r\nin spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtu=\r\ne of serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and s=\r\nants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a qua=\r\nntum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ram=\r\nakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I=\r\n will just quote Swami Sivananda:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complai=\r\nnt by householders nowadays that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame=\r\n excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of supply and demand. If there=\r\n is a sincere demand, the supply will come at once. This is the inexorable =\r\nlaw of nature. If you are really thirsty, you will find your Master at your=\r\n threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion an=\r\nd unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste y=\r\nour time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopel=\r\ness slave of passion, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I ca=\r\nnnot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then =\r\ncome to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will pu=\r\nt you in the right path, guide you and elevate you to\n sublime heights. The=\r\nse &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting to get hold of the right type of a=\r\nspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring a char=\r\nge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;Th=\r\nere are no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Cond=\r\nucted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a potential Satsangha=\r\n though not comparable to the actual company of the great masters. By swadh=\r\nyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the liv=\r\nes of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or=\r\n singing the uplifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remem=\r\nbrance and reflection, by discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and since=\r\nre discussions on a group such as this, one makes progress truly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly\n or reply at least for a whi=\r\nle. However I might participate in some discussions on and off.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-=\r\nwisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vedic_pa=\r\nthak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste everybody,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I read this message of r=\r\nespected Narasimha Garu few times.

I will accept whatever god give=\r\ns. I want to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress=\r\n&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is a=\r\nn initiation!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ]&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So It=\r\ns a time to say Happy Vijaya Dashami in true sense!

Similarly, a guru wi=\r\nth some achievement in a mantra can transfer\n some of it to a disciple. How=\r\never, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank account =\r\nwith a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. Sim=\r\nilarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and=\r\n build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not=\r\n as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go=\r\n ahead and do it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantra=\r\ns and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific material=\r\n results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender and making spiritual pro=\r\ngress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in the c=\r\nase of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One=\r\n can get in trouble otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; However, as I said several times, there are very few people who can do (i=\r\n) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized\n the whole system, for a reason, as K=\r\nali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing sur=\r\nrender, getting whatever material results god wants to give and making spir=\r\nitual progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* mate=\r\nrial results (for oneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature=\r\n will make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. B=\r\nut, as one starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any m=\r\nantra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have severa=\r\nl material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this r=\r\nitual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and not neces=\r\nsarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to incre=\r\nase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SA=\r\nFE. Initiation is not required.\n That attitude itself is an initiation!&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good res=\r\nults slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast,=\r\n but there may be some hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine t=\r\nhat a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them =\r\nin garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the pe=\r\nrson is gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on t=\r\nhe floor will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, one may do it fast a=\r\nnd there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good f=\r\nruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, pha=\r\nla of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits an=\r\nd throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some=\r\n spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more t=\r\nime to get out the good\n fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce =\r\ndeity like Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, =\r\nbut the good fruit comes out faster.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, b=\r\nut fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat eac=\r\nh of those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spi=\r\nllage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi=\r\n and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can=\r\n be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. If you realize the above=\r\n, you can start mantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you =\r\nhave to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is try=\r\ning to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler d=\r\neities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who =\r\nnever lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing dail=\r\ny homam now. Some people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the =\r\nfirst time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entire sapta=\r\nshati everyday. I know that some of them have transformed a lot and have ex=\r\nperienced some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and =\r\nsadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank=\r\n materialism, if someone has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is i=\r\nmportant, is looking for god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhan=\r\na (e.g. Chandipath), that person obviously has some good karmas and good va=\r\nsanas. That person has done that sadhana in the past.

In this age of Kali, She has become the later and she&#39;ll be happy if so=\r\nmeone just prays with *slightest* of devotion to her by way of recitation o=\r\nf Chandipaatha. this is a strong conviction developed in me.
