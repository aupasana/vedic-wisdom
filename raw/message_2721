Yes, y=\r\nou can use Chandi homam or Mahalakshmi homam as a reference, by replacing t=\r\nhe dhyaana shloka and beejaaksharass used in invocation. For the pradhaana =\r\nhomam, some people chant each verse by adding a swaahaa at the end of the v=\r\nerse, while some break up the sahasra naama stotra into a sahasra naamaaval=\r\ni and add swaahaa after each name (e.g. om shrImaatre namaH svaahaa, om shr=\r\nImahaaraaGYyai namaH svaahaa and so on). Some add beejaaksharas before ever=\r\ny name and say swaahaa.
