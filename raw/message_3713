Narasimha has already\n&gt; discussed=\r\n it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Taking example of MahaaShivaraatri which is celebrated toda=\r\ny Night\n&gt; almost every where. MahaaShivaraatri is celebrated on Krishna Pak=\r\nsha\n&gt; Chaturdashi of Lunar month called Magha (or Maha).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Magha M=\r\nonth should be said to commence logically - (considering two\n&gt; views - Amav=\r\nasyaa as Month end AND Pournima as Month end)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) When Amav=\r\nasyaa coincides with Moon being approximately opposite to\n&gt; Magha Nakshatra=\r\n which eventually creates a situation where in succeeding\n&gt; Pournima coinci=\r\ndes with Moon being in Magha or very close to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To clarify wit=\r\nh example:\n&gt; \n&gt; Current Magha Month popularly started on 15th January 2010 =\r\n(at approx.\n&gt; 12.45 in Noon as per IST). The Pournima of That Month started=\r\n on 29th\n&gt; Jan at around 15.35 IST. At that time, Moon was in 1st pada of P=\r\nushya\n&gt; Nakshatra. When Pournima ended on 30th Jan at around 11.50, Moon wa=\r\ns in\n&gt; 4th pada of Pushya Nakshatra.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So Moon was neither *In* Ma=\r\ngha Nakshatra nor *very close* to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; \n&gt; If one takes, Nex=\r\nt Pournima which falls on 28th February, Moon is IN\n&gt; Magha Nakshatra.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n So does it mean that IN REALITY, MAGHA MONTH starts on 14th Feb instead\n&gt; =\r\nof 15th Of Jan. AND MahaaShivaraatri is in Reality should be celebrated\n&gt; o=\r\nn 13th March Night and NOT on Today Night?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; God Knows!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 2) Consider if Month is said to be ended when Pournima coincides with\n&gt; Mo=\r\non being in Magha or very close to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I.e. Magha Month is taken to be=\r\n ending on Pournima when Moon is also\n&gt; traversing through Magha Nakshatra =\r\nduring that time. Next day, new month\n&gt; Phagan (Phalgun) starts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n As stated in previous example, Moon is in Magha on Pournima which falls\n&gt; =\r\non 28th Feb. If that really means Magha Month&#39;s last day, then\n&gt; MahaaShiva=\r\nraatri can be said to be falling on 13th/14th Feb i.e. today\n&gt; in Reality a=\r\nnd the celebration of the Shiva festival is rightly\n&gt; celebrated.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Not sure as to what it is Reality.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for a long message.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;mysticalsense&quot; &lt;sensemystical@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just to add t=\r\no that written below:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Next this will happen in mid-Jun 2026.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; In all three cases, Moon during Purnima lies closer to Jyeshtha\n&gt; &gt; Naksh=\r\natra (either in 2nd half of Anuradha or 1st half of Mula), than\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; (V=\r\nishakha or) PurvaAshadha.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;mysticalsense&quot; sensemystical@\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Shiva Purana also mentions worshipping Shiva on Krishna\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Chaturdashi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Jyeshtha with mahaardra yoga (i.e. ardra nakshatra c=\r\noinciding\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surya sankranti).

Why is it named Vaisakha? Jyeshtha month starts when\n&gt; &gt; Moon\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; and Sun\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are together in Vrishabha (Krittika 2nd, 3rd and 4th pa=\r\ndas,\n&gt; &gt; Rohini,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mrigasira 1st and 2nd padas). Why is it named Jy=\r\neshtha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you look carefully, the names of the months =\r\nare based on\n&gt; stars\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Chita-Chaitra, Visakha-Vaisakha, Jyeshtha-J=\r\nyeshtha etc).\n&gt; Starting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitra, 12 out of 27 stars ar=\r\ne picked for the names of months.\n&gt; At\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Full Moo=\r\nn in Chaitra month, Moon moves by 180 degrees\n&gt; compared\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was at the beginning of the month (Meena) and is around\n&gt; Chi=\r\ntra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; star. At\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time of Full Moon in Vaisakha month, Moon =\r\nmoves by 180\n&gt; degrees\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compared\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to where he was at the begi=\r\nnning of the month (Mesha) and is\n&gt; &gt; around\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visakha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; star. =\r\nAnd so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is logical to guess that the zodiac was d=\r\nivided into 12 equal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parts (not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily aligned to the =\r\ntwelve rasis) and the name of a month\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decided\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based =\r\non the star occupied by Moon at the middle of the month,\n&gt; &gt; i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time of Full Moon. A prominent star was chosen in the twelve\n=\r\n&gt; equal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parts and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the month was named based on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mooladhara chakra is in the middle of=\r\n the body and it is the\n&gt; basis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; existence. The chakr=\r\nas at the top of the head or the bottom of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feet are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; n=\r\not taken as the base. In astrology, zodiac is decided by the\n&gt; &gt; Chitra\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; star,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i.e. Chitra star is perfectly aligned to the *middle* of=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; zodiac.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not fix the beginning of the zodiac =\r\nby the exact location of\n&gt; &gt; Aswini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; star,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but by taking 180=\r\n degrees from the exact location of Chitra\n&gt; star.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; it is possible that a month is named based on the star occupied\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *middle* of the month rather than the beginning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the current month started as per =\r\nsoli-lunar (chaandramaana)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; calendar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on January 15, Sun and =\r\nMoon were in Capricorn. So it is called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Maagha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maasa&quot; base=\r\nd on current conventions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, Pournima of that mon=\r\nth is running right now and Moon is\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pada of =\r\nPushya star right now. He is far from Magha star. Is\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maagha Pournima as people think?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My personal vi=\r\new is that it is Pushya Pournima right now and Feb\n&gt; &gt; 11\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Pushya Krishna Chaturdasi and not MahaaShivaraatri.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen a new month as per Chaandramaana starts on February 13,\n&gt; &gt; people\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider it as Phalguna maasa because Moon and Sun are in\n&gt; Kumbha.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; But the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next Pournima on February 28 coincides with Magha na=\r\nkshatra. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; THAT is the real Maagha Pournima. S=\r\no March 13 is the Maagha\n&gt; &gt; Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chaturdasi, i.e. MahaaShivar=\r\naatri.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline: I agree wi=\r\nth the conclusion of souramaana proponents\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular =\r\ntime, but for a different reason compared to theirs.\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respectf=\r\nully suggest that we are all lacking in our\n&gt; understanding\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct calendar used with tithi based festivals. We celebrate\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; festivals on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the correct days most of the times, but make m=\r\nistakes now and\n&gt; &gt; then.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misunderstandings still need=\r\n to be corrected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good thing is that the knowledge of r=\r\nishis is self-revealing and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-correcting.
