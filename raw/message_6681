When I told my father that I purchased kundalam for doing homam=\r\n he was little uncomfortable about me doing it without following right proc=\r\nedures. I think, he is afraid that something might happen to me, so I share=\r\nd homam information by Narasimha Rao ji as well but he said not to do Chand=\r\ni homam by myself. I am planning to start Sri Maha Ganapathi Homam over the=\r\n weekend. \n\n-- \nBest Regards,\nAravind \n\n\n"}}
