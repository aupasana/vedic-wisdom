The process of overcoming the springing up=\r\n of new desires often starts with suppressing (and not fulfilling) old desi=\r\nres and take the mind away from it.\n \nBut, that is the beginning and not th=\r\ne end.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding being married and not fulfilling t=\r\nhe desire of spouse:\n \nOne&#39;s karmik debts may require one to fulfil the sex=\r\nual desire of another person. But, the problem is that we incur new debts w=\r\nhile paying off old debts in this matter, like in many other matters. In ge=\r\nneral, if one engages in an action with a detached mind that finds the acti=\r\non neither attractive nor repulsive, one is not committing a new karma and =\r\ncreating new debts to be settled later. One is merely settling old debts wi=\r\nth such detached actions. But, if one engages in an action with an attached=\r\n mind that finds the action either attractive or repulsive, one IS committi=\r\nng a new karma and creating new debts to be settled later. This becomes an =\r\nendless cycle! \n \nSex is a highly physical action. While engaging in it, it=\r\n is nearly impossible to detach the mind from body and focus on god. Mind i=\r\nnvariably gets attached to the body and its experience. Thus, one is not on=\r\nly settling old debts by giving pleasure, but one also creates a new debt b=\r\ny deriving pleasure again. This is an endless cycle.\n \n*        *        *\n=\r\n \nScriptures cover a lot of ground and they say a lot of things that may co=\r\nntradict one another. Yes, one who marries and begets children is needed fo=\r\nr the continuation of human race and smooth running of society. But, dharma=\r\n and moksha are different. Performing your duties sincerely is good and tak=\r\nes you to heaven for a while and then brings you back here. For liberation =\r\nfrom the cycle, one has to overcome the weaknesses and desires.\n \nDo not co=\r\nmpare with gods like Rama and Krishna. Our minds are totally different from=\r\n those of gods and rishis. Krishna was the Ishwara of Yogis, whose mind was=\r\n eternally in yoga with the Absolute. Actually, his mind may be taken as th=\r\ne definition of Absolute. His mind is not anything like ours.\n \nBest regard=\r\ns,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pit=\r\nri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http=\r\n://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan=\r\nnath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: rajesh rajgor \n  To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, December 17, 2008 12:33 AM\n  Subject:=\r\n Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya\n\n\n        Namaste,\n\n        =\r\nI have read the contents of utpal.. that had raised few questions in to my =\r\nmind.. i would be happy if utpal can answer me..\n\n        1.

(???)  still he was called brahmachari.. how? i=\r\n am bit confused.. \n\n        I personally feel that to have sexual desire a=\r\nnd not fulfilling it,  cannot be termed as brahmacharya.. it is like cheati=\r\nng yourself... and if you are married and if you donot fulfill desire of yo=\r\nur spouse is also not good..

This is the nature \n          of \n          &gt; desire. \n          &gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other than \n          &gt; S=\r\nelf) or \n          &gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no mat=\r\nter how much \n          &gt; one gets.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; Removing d=\r\nesire from the root often requires suppressing the \n          &gt; desire \n   =\r\n       &gt; &gt; temporarily. But the thing to remember from the Aghora book is \n=\r\n          &gt; that just \n          &gt; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. =\r\nPractice suppressing \n          &gt; desires, but do \n          &gt; &gt; remember t=\r\nhat the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep \n          &gt; working on i=\r\nt.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying f=\r\nor brahamcharya is if\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time pro=\r\nbasbly i can also do it , \n          if\n          &gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at l=\r\neast in 10-12 years\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; That is the right spirit!\n=\r\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot of things an=\r\nd brahmacharya is \n          &gt; one thing. \n          &gt; &gt; The most fundament=\r\nal thing is to overcome ego and not become \n          &gt; attached to \n      =\r\n    &gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions \n   =\r\n       and \n          &gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is the most funda=\r\nmental thing.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; There are several things in spir=\r\nitual progress. They all come \n          &gt; together! One \n          &gt; &gt; per=\r\nson may develop detachment to actions and possessions and \n          &gt; brah=\r\nmacharya \n          &gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One person may achieve=\r\n brahmacharya \n          &gt; first and \n          &gt; &gt; detachment may become e=\r\nasy as a result and come later. Various \n          &gt; signs of \n          &gt; =\r\n&gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact order can \n       =\r\n   &gt; change from \n          &gt; &gt; person to person. Thus, do not be disappoin=\r\nted by your inability \n          &gt; to get \n          &gt; &gt; something.

&gt; public forum as it may probably offend others.\n          &gt; &gt; =\r\nIf you have time ,if you could please reply.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; I=\r\n was thinking this for many days\n          &gt; &gt; that as mentioned in recent =\r\nthread on brahamcharya,\n          &gt; &gt; it was important to maintain brahamch=\r\narya but i wanted to ask \n          that\n          &gt; &gt; even vimalananda had=\r\n to work for 6 years for overcoming lust \n          though\n          &gt; &gt; he=\r\n had his deity with him from the very early in life.\n          &gt; &gt; \n       =\r\n   &gt; &gt; how can normal college going people like me who don&#39;t even have a\n  =\r\n        &gt; &gt; deity obtain this goal.\n          &gt; &gt; Though i try to maintain =\r\nphysical brahamcharya for few months but\n          &gt; &gt; after that i am not =\r\nable to hold it ,\n          &gt; &gt; and even if i maintain some physical chasti=\r\nty it refuses to go \n          out\n          &gt; &gt; of mind\n          &gt; &gt; \n   =\r\n       &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n =\r\n         &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root\n          &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n          &gt; &gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my mind\n          &gt; &gt;=\r\n Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of \n          &gt; Brah=\r\namcharya\n          &gt; &gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progress=\r\n in maintaing\n          &gt; &gt; Brahamcharya\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; and s=\r\nometimes it makes me guilt ridden.\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; The only re=\r\nason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n          &gt; &gt; vimalanan=\r\nda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if\n          &gt; &gt; not =\r\nin 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; you can als=\r\no reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove my\n          &gt; &gt; identi=\r\nty from this that would be appreciable\n          &gt;

But, the problem is that we incur new debts \nwhile paying o=\r\nff old debts in this matter, like in many other matters. In \ngeneral, if on=\r\ne engages in an action with a detached mind that finds the action \nneither =\r\nattractive nor repulsive, one is not committing a new karma and creating \nn=\r\new debts to be settled later. One is merely settling old debts with such \nd=\r\netached actions. But, if one engages in an action with an attached mind tha=\r\nt \nfinds the action either attractive or repulsive, one IS committing a new=\r\n karma \nand creating new debts to be settled later. This becomes an endless=\r\n cycle! \n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Sex is a highly physical action. While en=\r\ngaging in \nit, it is nearly impossible to detach the mind from body and foc=\r\nus on god. Mind \ninvariably gets attached to the body and its experience. T=\r\nhus, one is not only \nsettling old debts by giving pleasure, but one also c=\r\nreates a new debt by \nderiving pleasure again. This is an endless cycle.&lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\nsize=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Scriptures co=\r\nver a lot of ground and they say a lot \nof things that may contradict one a=\r\nnother.

(???)&nbsp; sti=\r\nll he was called brahmachari.. how? i am \n        bit confused.. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I =\r\npersonally feel that to have sexual desire and \n        not fulfilling it,&=\r\nnbsp; cannot be termed as brahmacharya.. it is like \n        cheating yours=\r\nelf... and if you are married and if you donot fulfill \n        desire of y=\r\nour spouse is also not good..

It was a generally accepted idea among the &lt;BR&gt;d=\r\nisciples \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Thakur that any one who is blessed by Rakha=\r\nl Maharaj will \n          never &lt;BR&gt;&gt; again be troubled by problems of l=\r\nack of Brahmacharya. \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One day an individual cam=\r\ne to Rakhal Maharaj asking \n          for his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; blessings and said &quot;=\r\nMaharaj, please give me \n          brahmacharya as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; blessing&quot;. He=\r\naring this suddenly Rakhal \n          Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; pe=\r\nople always come asking for \n          Brahmacharya?

Isn&#39;t God the =\r\nfinal aim &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; everything.. \n          &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is it =\r\npossible for someone who cannot maintain \n          brahmacharya to &lt;BR&gt;rea=\r\nch &lt;BR&gt;&gt; God?

Som=\r\neone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; else may have to first \n          overcome his lust even=\r\n to have a vision &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the deity. \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; What =\r\nis good for goose is not good for gander. In \n          general, it is &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; good to try &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to overcome lust if \n          it is possibl=\r\ne.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Several &quot;normal college \n          going peop=\r\nle&quot; were taken under his wings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa and transformed into spiritual giants. \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Swami &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami \n          Yogan=\r\nanda etc were college &lt;BR&gt;&gt; students &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; when they \n          =\r\nmet Ramakrishna.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But it is not easy to \n        =\r\n  overcome lust at all. Several of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n =\r\n         disciples also struggled with it initially and overcame lust &lt;BR&gt;w=\r\nith \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic h=\r\numan \n          instinct and not at all &lt;BR&gt;easy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to kill &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n          completely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In the beginning, it=\r\n is ok if \n          the thought does not go out of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind. Set =\r\na &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some =\r\nperiod like that \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; maintain physical br=\r\nahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry \n          if thoughts come.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Feeling of guilt is a \n          weight and it does not help in overco=\r\nming &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the basic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-bur=\r\ndened by it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          &gt; Moreover, what i re=\r\nad in AGHORA was the important thing is \n          not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; su=\r\nppress desires but remove them from the \n          root&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the \n          desire come back =\r\nlater. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But, if one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; keeps \n          fulfilling desir=\r\nes, they never end!! This is the nature &lt;BR&gt;of \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge \n          (of anythin=\r\ng other than &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Self) or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; physical \n          pleasures,=\r\n the desire will never end no matter how much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one \n          gets.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root often \n          =\r\nrequires suppressing the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; temporarily. \n      =\r\n    But the thing to remember from the Aghora book is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that just \n =\r\n         &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice \n    =\r\n      suppressing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desires, but do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; remember that the =\r\n\n          final goal is to uproot it fully and keep &lt;BR&gt;&gt; working on \n =\r\n         it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i ke=\r\nep \n          trying for brahamcharya is if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda t=\r\nook such \n          a long time probasbly i can also do it , &lt;BR&gt;if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; not \n          in 6 years at least in 10-12 years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; That is \n          the right spirit!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Spiritual progress \n          involves a lot of things and brahmacharya i=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one thing. \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing i=\r\ns to overcome ego and not \n          become &lt;BR&gt;&gt; attached to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; things. Developing \n          detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessio=\r\nns &lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          developing a sense of surrender is the =\r\nmost fundamental thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are sev=\r\neral things in spiritual progress. \n          They all come &lt;BR&gt;&gt; togeth=\r\ner! One &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; person may develop \n          detachment to actions a=\r\nnd possessions and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; brahmacharya \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may becom=\r\ne easy as a result. One person may achieve \n          brahmacharya &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n first and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; detachment may become \n          easy as a result =\r\nand come later. Various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; signs of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; spiritua=\r\nl progress come almost together, but the exact order can \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; change from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; person to person. Thus, do not be \n          di=\r\nsappointed by your inability &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          somet=\r\nhing. It may be possible to work it out from another \n          angle!&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- \n          --------- --=\r\n------- -&lt;BR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n          href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3D=\r\nnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n         =\r\n Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          Spirituality: &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; \n          target=3D_blan=\r\nk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n          wisdom&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://ve=\r\ndicastro.home.comcast.net&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri \n          Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.SriJagannath.org&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; ------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- \n          -&lt;BR&gt;- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste sir&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; i know you are \n          lot busy but since i cou=\r\nldn;t ask this question &lt;BR&gt;on a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          public forum as it=\r\n may probably offend others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If you \n          have time ,if y=\r\nou could please reply.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I was \n          thinking=\r\n this for many days&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that as mentioned in recent \n          thr=\r\nead on brahamcharya,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it was important to maintain \n          b=\r\nrahamcharya but i wanted to ask &lt;BR&gt;that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even \n          vimal=\r\nananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming lust \n          &lt;BR&gt;though&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he had his deity with him from the very early \n          in life=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; how can normal college going \n          people=\r\n like me who don&#39;t even have a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; deity obtain this \n          go=\r\nal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though i try to maintain physical brahamcharya for \n      =\r\n    few months but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; after that i am not able to hold it \n      =\r\n    ,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and even if i maintain some physical chastity it \n      =\r\n    refuses to go &lt;BR&gt;out&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n          Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my =\r\nmind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on P=\r\nractice of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Brahamcharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but i don&#39;t think =\r\ni have made any spiritual \n          progress in maintaing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bra=\r\nhamcharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; and sometimes it makes me g=\r\nuilt ridden.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; The only reason for whic=\r\nh i keep trying for brahamcharya is \n          if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; vimalananda =\r\ntook such a long time probasbly i can also \n          do it , if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you \n          can rem=\r\nove my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; identity from this that would be \n          appreciable=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; if what i worte offended you \n          please =\r\ndelete this mail&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt;=\r\n &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLO=\r\nCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00F4_01C9609B.98335C70--\r\n\n"}}
