I have seen exhausts that are 6 ft above the homa kundam sucking smoke quite well. However, the disadvantages of an exhaust are:\n \n(1) It is noisy. You won&#39;t have silence.\n(2) It keeps sucking air. You need to put a fan in another place in the room to keep supplying fresh air as air is sucked by the exhaust.\n \nDoing on the balcony or a patio is also good. But it will work only in spring and summer and perhaps autumn. In winter (which is quite long at northern longitudes), it will be too cold. Moreover, if you use firewood logs and do homam with big fire, then smoke can hit the external walls of the house due to wind and the walls can blacken over the time.\n \nIf there is a fireplace with a chimney that is taller than the entire house, smoke will go up into the air. I know some people who have traditional one-side-open fireplaces and do homam by placing their homa kundam inside it. At my house, I have a custom built four side open fireplace in the middle of the pooja room. It is basically a 2 ft x 2 ft pit with a 1.5 ft wall on all 4 sides and small pillars on the 4 corners of that wall and a chimney resting on the pillars and going 2 ft above the top of the house. People sitting on all 4 sides can see the fire or make offerings. I place a 1ft x 1ft homa kundam inside that pit amid bricks and do my daily homam there. But, when I want, I also have the option of doing a homam in the full 2ft x 2ft pit directly. Of course, a regular one-side-open fireplace will serve the purpose as well.\n \nI think the main factor is where you live and how cold it will get in the winter.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; I have a general question for the group. I am thinking about moving, and\n&gt; since I like to do daily homa, I&#39;m curious as to which system works best for\n&gt; people in terms of avoiding damage to the walls from smoke, etc. A\n&gt; fireplace? A specially installed exhaust fan? Simply doing the homa on a\n&gt; balcony or with balcony doors / windows open? I&#39;d be grateful for people&#39;s\n&gt; thoughts or experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm regards,\n&gt; Aditi\n\n\n"}}
