Ved Vyasji tried to spread knowledge of Vedas and Upanishadas =\r\nto common men and he wrote lots of Puranas and long poem of Mahabharat. Mah=\r\nabharat was a reality but was not in the same form as narrated by Vyasji. V=\r\nyasji has given immaginary characters and incidents but his intention was t=\r\no spread knowledge of Vedas/Upanishadas thru Gita. There was a discussion b=\r\netween Krishna and Arjuna in a normal form and not in Sanskrit. He advised =\r\nArjuna to start war after giving him the theory of Karma.
