The \nknowledge/ignorance I keep sharing (because that is the best I can do \nnow) is most likely different from what rishis meant. So there is no \npoint in looking up to me as a &quot;guru&quot; and following me with fervour. Do \nyour own search instead (and maximize the chance of someone finding \ntruth).\n\nWhen it comes to spirituality, I am NOT an enlightened person and not \ncapable of making anyone enlightened. Even if the un-enlightened \nspiritual state I am in is good enough for someone, I do not know how to \nreplicate it in someone, either through writings or talks or thoughts. \nIn other words, I am capable of giving one NEITHER what one needs in the \nlong run NOR what I have right now. All I can give others, through my \nwritings, is an understanding that is qualified by their and my \nconditioning (like a white conch exchanged between two people with dirty \nhands may have the dirty hand prints of the giver or the taker). Yes, I \ncan also share knowhow of some tools that may help you in your pursuit, \nbut that does not make me a guru either.\n\nThis is not just some humble talk, but the *unquestionable* and honest \nreality. It is better if people who are somehow fascinated with me \nand/or look up to me as a guru and think about me with reverence, divert \nthat attention and reverence towards God. Unlike me, God CAN make you a \nbetter astrologer or a better spiritual sadhaka or both.\n\nHappy Guru Pournima again!\n\nLove & regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n"}}
