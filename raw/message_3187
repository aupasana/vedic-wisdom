Body is like a rented car used in a long journey. If one pla=\r\nns to finish a long journey using a rented car, one should put fuel in the =\r\ncar frequently and do basic maintenance. That is needed and there is nothin=\r\ng wrong in it. After all, if the car breaks down, one cannot reach the dest=\r\nination.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But my point is that one should not be so attached to the ca=\r\nr that one stops every few miles, wipes the dust on the car, washes it and =\r\npulls over on every minor suspicious sound from the engine and so on. Such =\r\na person will never finish the journey. Moreover, such a person will be so =\r\nattached to the car that he may be unable to return it even after reaching =\r\nthe destination.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One should take care of the body, but not be overly =\r\nattached to it or concerned about it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, =\r\ngod IS in the body. But then god is in EVERYTHING. God is in a temple, a ch=\r\nurch, a mosque, a river like Ganges, a gutter next to a dirty lane, a garba=\r\nge can and what not. God is in the entire universe - he lives in every atom=\r\n and every sub-atomic particle. Why then special attachment to one specific=\r\n body in which also god happens to be, among many other things?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let m=\r\ne give a simple analogy to explain the thrust of my main point.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Milk =\r\nmay be present inside khoa, cheese, yogurt, baasundi, cake, a curry, kaju k=\r\natli, sooji halwa, mutter paneer, motichoor laddoo, dum aloo and so many ot=\r\nher things. If a person particularly likes kaju katli and does not like oth=\r\ner things as much, it is probably not the underlying milk that he likes but=\r\n the kaju katli itself. He cannot say &quot;I like kaju katli because it contain=\r\ns milk&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, one attached to one&#39;s body is probably not devote=\r\nd to the underlying god within that body, but devoted to the body itself.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; In fact, finding the milk inside kaju katli may first require one to r=\r\neduce eating kaju katli and eat something that has more milk in it than kaj=\r\nu katli (e.g. khoa) regularly and get used to the milk taste. Then, one wil=\r\nl taste milk even when eating kaju katli, even though kaju (cashew) is the =\r\nmain ingredient in it and not milk, because of one&#39;s familiarity with and a=\r\nttachment to the milk taste.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, finding god inside one&#39;s body=\r\n may first require one to reduce attention to one&#39;s body and focus the mind=\r\n on a specific form of divinity (e.g. a deity such as Vishnu or Shiva or Ga=\r\nnesha or Durga). After one&#39;s mind tastes divinity in that form and get used=\r\n to it, one will taste divinity in one&#39;s own self as well as everything one=\r\n sees, because of one&#39;s familiarity with and attachment to the taste of tha=\r\nt form.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Most embodied beings identify with =\r\nbody, name and other attributes (e.g. &quot;a great actor&quot;, &quot;a path-breaking eng=\r\nineer&quot;, &quot;a good scholar&quot; etc) quite strongly. When that identity is destroy=\r\ned by Nature at the end of life, some disappointment or regret may be left.=\r\n IF such a thing happens, Nature will make one to be born again.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One =\r\nwill be born again and again, as khoa, as kaju katli, as dum aloo, as sooji=\r\n halwa etc, until one realizes the underlying milk in all those things.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; One will be born again and again until one goes through life with zero a=\r\nttachment with body, name and other attributes (e.g. &quot;a great actor&quot;, &quot;a pa=\r\nth-breaking engineer&quot;, &quot;a good scholar&quot; etc) and has no disappointment or r=\r\negret when they are destroyed at the end.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n i remember ramakrishna quoting that if there is a minor defect\n&gt; &gt; in the =\r\nbody that person can not realise god.\n&gt;  \n&gt; On the contrary, he strongly di=\r\nscouraged his students like Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yogananda from prac=\r\nticing Hatha yoga because of its emphasis and reliance on the physical body=\r\n and told them to forget about the body and think of god instead.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ram=\r\nakrishna had a throat cancer and several of his sishyas suffered tremendous=\r\nly towards the ends of their lives, but they succeeded in focusing the mind=\r\n on god through the ordeals and passing the test. They did not do any &quot;praa=\r\nnic healing&quot; or something, but learnt to focus the mind on god despite obst=\r\nacles thrown up by a really suffering body.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When Ramakrishna was suff=\r\nering from cancer, some people told him a pure soul like him could cure him=\r\nself by focussing his mind on such a thought. He said it made no sense to t=\r\nake the mind off the divine Mother even for a moment to ponder his physical=\r\n condition.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though not everyone can be like him, one can take inspira=\r\ntion.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rajarshi, irrespective of whether one=\r\n worships an ugra devata (fierce deity) or a soumya devata (gentle deity), =\r\none has to overcome the attachment to name, body and other attributes (e.g.=\r\n &quot;a great actor&quot;, &quot;a path-breaking engineer&quot;, &quot;a good scholar&quot; etc). Withou=\r\nt it, one is stuck in the cycle of life and death.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ugra devatas may f=\r\norce the lesson on one fast and soumya devatas may take time. But a spiritu=\r\nal aspirant has to overcome this inherent weakness no matter which deity on=\r\ne worships.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; body must be healthy to realise g=\r\nod\n&gt; &gt; tirumoolar says   in his ahama\n&gt; &gt; **************\n&gt; &gt; previously i t=\r\nhought body as dirty\n&gt; &gt; but i found god living in the body\n&gt; &gt; as god live=\r\ns in the body\n&gt; &gt; iam taking care of my body to the best extent\n&gt; &gt; *******=\r\n****\n&gt; &gt; without good body health you can never realise god\n&gt; &gt; bodily atta=\r\nchment is different from worldly attachment\n&gt; &gt; i remember ramakrishna quot=\r\ning that if there is a minor defect in the body that person can not realise=\r\n god.\n&gt; &gt; after realising god only ramakrishna neglected his health and did=\r\n not take care of his body\n&gt; &gt; only as he was healthy before he could reali=\r\nse god\n&gt; &gt; if he had had mouth cancer when he was young he could not have r=\r\nealised god in this birth\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Fro=\r\nm: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Sent: Fri, December 4, 2009 5:28:56 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re:=\r\n Final Rites\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;          I am absolutely not writing aga=\r\ninst the guidance given in the mail below. Only telling how I do things dif=\r\nferently on two points in my own spiritual sadhana everyday.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am =\r\nalways alert towards my physical body. I do a lot more than bare essentials=\r\n to keep it going. I am always listening to its need. I try to lessen its p=\r\nain and suffering using sattvic means so that it remains strong. I am respe=\r\nctful towards it and do not show mental disregard towards it. After all It =\r\nis my vehicle towards salvation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Having lived with sadhu/holy men =\r\nfor several years I am well aware that many of them are in lot of different=\r\n physical pain and discomfort and they are still doing their spiritual sadh=\r\nana.It is good as many people are strong and they can endure pain and still=\r\n do meditation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  But I have noticed when my physical body is in  p=\r\nain and I am doing my everyday sadhana there is a deep subtle current of pa=\r\nin also flowing towards Divine Mother  which I find very upsetting. Few tim=\r\nes I have said to DivineBeings that instead of love, today&#39;s offering is fu=\r\nll of pain.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know from my direct personal experience people who h=\r\nave used bare essential to keep their body alive.And when it takes its reve=\r\nnge, there are doctors and hospitals and hospitals and more pain and misery=\r\n.Their spiritual sadhana gets broken and my own are deeply disturbed. Then =\r\nthere is excuse that it is past life karma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If I will not  properl=\r\ny care for my physical body when there is time to do so and it falls ill wh=\r\nat will Divine Mother will think?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The second thing is that althoug=\r\nh I am not a yogi my prayers/puja/ meditations/ japa are not dress rehearsa=\r\nl. They are real things.I am not doing them for my last moments. I am doing=\r\n them for Divine Mother Who is EverPresent. She resides in Her Dham but She=\r\n  lives in this material world as well.It is her creation and for those who=\r\n are in this world who constantly calling Her, She is present with them.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  What will She think if after doing deep loving meditation/japa or o=\r\nrdinary puja, I offer it to her and also add that it is only a dress rehear=\r\nsal. She might think there seems to be loose screw, has he gone on ganja wi=\r\nthout me knowing it..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do not even think that only after leaving =\r\nmy body I will get libreation. Our devotion cannot bring Her, only Her Grac=\r\ne can make Her give us Her Bliss. Many times I have said, Mother whole day =\r\nhave passed . When will you appear to me again? I am sure She will come.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 1/12/09, Narasimha P.V.=\r\nR.

If one has a deep attachment \n&gt; &gt; &gt;to the body, mind may be attached to t=\r\nhe body even after death, even after \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the connection of the karmendriy=\r\nas and jnanendriyas of the mind to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;physical body is cut off. Then=\r\n what happens to the body does affect the mind \n&gt; &gt; &gt;and its further\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nprogress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;When one takes sannyasa=\r\n, i.e renounces material world, the last rites are to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;be done symboli=\r\ncally. After that, one is dead symbolically. However, if one \n&gt; &gt; &gt;does not=\r\n have true renunciation and detachment from body, relatives and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;other=\r\n material objects, there is no point in taking sannyasa or doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt;symb=\r\nolic last rites. Even if one does it, mind may still be attached to the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;body. If last rites are not done after death, even a sannyasi&#39;s mind may=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;have problems. On the other hand, a true sannyasi who is absolutely =\r\ndetached \n&gt; &gt; &gt;from the body even when alive will fly high when mind is fin=\r\nally freed from \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the body at death.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*        *        *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;One cannot control what others do with one&#39;s body after one leaves =\r\nit. So \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the wisest course of action would be to develop detachment eve=\r\nn when alive.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Divert the concern for the well-being of the body=\r\n towards other people. Do \n&gt; &gt; &gt;bare minimum to keep the body alive and not=\r\n be overly concerned about it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;When you meditate, think only of god a=\r\nnd try to forget that there is a body \n&gt; &gt; &gt;that you occupy. Even if leg hu=\r\nrts or neck itches, try to forget about it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;If you ignore body for a =\r\nwhile, it will cry out for attention, like an \n&gt; &gt; &gt;immature child who need=\r\ns attention. If you give it attention, you cannot \n&gt; &gt; &gt;experience god. But=\r\n, as you ignore body more, body will try more to get your \n&gt; &gt; &gt;attention (=\r\nlike an immature child who needs attention)! However, if you \n&gt; &gt; &gt;persist,=\r\n body will have to eventually give up! THAT is when one can absorb \n&gt; &gt; &gt;th=\r\ne mind fully in god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;If one experiences that often while alive, =\r\nthat experience helps immensely \n&gt; &gt; &gt;at death. When the mind leaves the bo=\r\ndy for the last time, one can focus \n&gt; &gt; &gt;mind on god and ignore the attent=\r\nion grabbing cries for help from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;One who successfully=\r\n focuses mind on god when the last moment comes is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;liberated and gets=\r\n saayujya or moksha. On the other hand, one who wavers \n&gt; &gt; &gt;from the focus=\r\n on god and lets mind turn towards the plight of the dying \n&gt; &gt; &gt;body gets =\r\nstuck.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To a yogi, each session of deep meditation is like a dres=\r\ns rehearsal of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;last moment! Death is not to be feared. If faced c=\r\norrectly, it is the moment \n&gt; &gt; &gt;of final liberation. Life is meant to be a=\r\n practice for it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Instead of worrying about body and its last ri=\r\ntes, let every ritual be a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;last rite! I suggest that one should pract=\r\nice detachment and develop the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;ability to absolutely ignore the pitif=\r\nul cries of the body for attention as \n&gt; &gt; &gt;one tries to focus the mind on =\r\ngod and succeed in absorbing the mind in god \n&gt; &gt; &gt;when meditating. If one =\r\npractices that, the issue of who does last rites and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;what rites becom=\r\nes irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*        *   \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Of course, o=\r\nne who performs brilliantly in dress rehearsals may still forget \n&gt; &gt; &gt;one&#39;=\r\ns lines or put a wrong expression when playing the drama finally on the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;big stage. Similarly, a yogi who has overcome the attachment to body and=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;absorbed the mind perfectly in god many times may still waver at the=\r\n last \n&gt; &gt; &gt;moment and think of body or something else that is impermenant =\r\nand be \n&gt; &gt; &gt;reborn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;However, all that is in our control is to p=\r\nractice and prepare for the last \n&gt; &gt; &gt;moment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*        *       =\r\n *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;You are lucky. There are many Hindus who do not experience an=\r\nything like \n&gt; &gt; &gt;what you described. Keep doing sadhana and overcome the l=\r\nittle rawness that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;may still be left in the consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
