I see no inconsistency betwee=\r\nn the two statements you\n&gt; asked me to reconcile:\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) Nobody can escape=\r\n the result of one&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; (2) Remedies such as homam and japam can pre=\r\nvent the ill-effects of\n&gt; karma.\n&gt;\n&gt; What we have to realize is that karma =\r\n(action) is something that keeps\n&gt; flowing continuously and dynamically. It=\r\n is not something frozen in\n&gt; time. Yes, karmas done in previous lives, *be=\r\nfore* current birth, are\n&gt; frozen in the form of one&#39;s horoscope. BUT, one =\r\ndoes not stop doing\n&gt; karmas after birth. One keeps doing karmas and they g=\r\net added to the\n&gt; karma pipeline.\n&gt;\n&gt; One has to experience the results of =\r\none&#39;s karmas, but different\nkarmas\n&gt; may give results after different waiti=\r\nng times. Some karmas take a\nlong\n&gt; time to give results and some fructify =\r\nfast. When big karmas one\ncommits\n&gt; after birth are added to this karma pip=\r\neline, it may be re-arranged.\nThe\n&gt; newer karmas done in this life may give=\r\n results ahead of older karmas\nor\n&gt; some older karmas may be pushed back.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; When you sow some kind of seeds in a field, it may take a long time\nfor\n=\r\n&gt; them to become trees and give fruits (sweet or sour or bitter). When\nyou\n=\r\n&gt; sow some other kind of seeds, it may take a short time for them to\n&gt; beco=\r\nme trees and give fruits (sweet or sour or bitter). Like that,\n&gt; different =\r\nkarmas (seeds) need different time to give fruits.\n&gt;\n&gt; If your field is fil=\r\nled with bad trees or plants or seeds, it does not\n&gt; prevent you from sowin=\r\ng new seeds that give desirable fruits. A new\n&gt; plant may give good fruits =\r\nor atleast stop an older bad plant from\n&gt; growing.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one blocked an ol=\r\nder bad karma from giving its result using a\nremedy\n&gt; such as homam or japa=\r\nm, that act of homam or japam is also a karma\nthat\n&gt; pushed out or blocked =\r\nthe older karma.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; There is one more thing really. Apart from s=\r\nowing new seeds or\nblocking\n&gt; old seeds/plants from growing, remedies can a=\r\nlso make one spiritually\n&gt; mature and even liberate one. With spiritual mat=\r\nurity, one can handle\n&gt; the stress of bad times better. When I have a probl=\r\nem, I can get\nworried\n&gt; and the problem can be blown up, become weightier i=\r\nn my mind and cause\n&gt; more stress. Or I can say, &quot;well, this too will pass&quot;=\r\n and move on.\n&gt; Though the basic problem itself cannot be avoided, I can st=\r\nop it from\n&gt; becoming weightier in my mind and causing more stress. Most of=\r\n our\n&gt; problems cause far more stress than they should, because we waste so=\r\n\n&gt; much time and mental energy worrying about and worrying about what is\n&gt; =\r\nnot in our hands, instead of accepting what is not in our hands and\n&gt; focus=\r\ning attention on what is in our hands and doing the best we can.\nA\n&gt; clear =\r\nmind enabled by spiritual sadhana can minimize such dispersion\nof\n&gt; energy =\r\nand wasting of time. That way too, spiritual sadhana helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; I personall=\r\ny know several people who do homam everyday now and lead\nmuch\n&gt; happier liv=\r\nes, though the ground situation may have been the same!\n&gt;\n&gt; Japam and homam=\r\n can also be used as &quot;placebos&quot; like you said.

Kavachas of various deities (or\n&gt; planets) are protective=\r\n sheaths covering one&#39;s consciousness and\n&gt; stopping harmful influences.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Grahas (literal meaning: those who grasp or get hold of) give good and\n&gt; =\r\nbad results by grasping one&#39;s consciousness and affecting it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Each plan=\r\net has positives and negatives, in general and also based on\n&gt; the chart. I=\r\nf one chants the kavacha of a planet many times,\neventually\n&gt; a protective =\r\nsheath is formed around one&#39;s consciousness with the\nnature\n&gt; and energy of=\r\n that planet. This will obviously offer protection that\nis\n&gt; consistent wit=\r\nh the nature of that planet, in general and in one&#39;s\n&gt; chart. But, please r=\r\nemember that reading the kavacha of any planet\nwill\n&gt; NOT harm you. Even th=\r\ne kavacha of 8th lord or 6th lord will not harm\n&gt; one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose one has =\r\nPi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavacha, Venus will\nprotect\n&gt; one from loss of=\r\n courage (3rd), problems to shoulders (3rd), untimely\n&gt; death (i.e. loss of=\r\n longevity/8th), problems in anus/genital area\n(8th)\n&gt; etc. There may be ot=\r\nher things based on other factors like aspects,\n&gt; occupancy etc. Based on h=\r\nis inherent nature, Venus may also protect in\n&gt; the matters of love, romanc=\r\ne, creativity etc also. Bottomline is that\n&gt; the aspects of one&#39;s personali=\r\nty that the planet is conducive to will\nbe\n&gt; protected by the planet&#39;s ener=\r\ngy.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you pick a wrong planet, you may not get the desired result, but=\r\n no\n&gt; harm is done. Even bad planets in your chart will have some aspects\nt=\r\nhey\n&gt; want to protect and doing their kavacha will protect those aspects.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Best will be to chant the kavachas of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna\n&gt; =\r\nlord, Moon&#39;s dispositor and Sun&#39;s dispositor. Even better will be to\n&gt; chan=\r\nt the kavachas of devatas instead of planets. Out of all the\n&gt; kavachas I h=\r\nave seen until now, Narayana kavacha (from\n&gt; SrimadBhagavatam)\n&gt; and Chandi=\r\n Kavacha are the most potent kavachas.\n&gt;\n&gt; But please note that chanting a =\r\nkavacha once or twice or even once or\n&gt; twice a day is hardly sufficient. I=\r\nf one has enough purity already,\nmost\n&gt; mantras work right away. But most o=\r\nf us have very dense conditioning\nand\n&gt; the energy of mantras gets disperse=\r\nd. The energy of the planet/deity\nof\n&gt; the kavacha we chant cannot form a s=\r\nheath around us easily. It\nrequires\n&gt; intense sadhana for most people. If o=\r\nne chants a kavacha 10-30 times\n&gt; everyday and does it for 40-60 days, then=\r\n some kind of results can be\n&gt; expected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is=\r\n needed for most people to\n&gt; see some results. Getting things done by a pro=\r\nfessional priest is also\n&gt; not that useful, as there are very very few prie=\r\nsts with the required\n&gt; purity, the ability to identify with your problem a=\r\nnd the ability to\n&gt; transfer the energy. For most people, the best solution=\r\n is to learn\nand\n&gt; chant by themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Soft=\r\nware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual man=\r\nuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &lt;http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Jul 7, 201=\r\n1 at 11:39 AM, monkeymonkeyking10 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I sincerely h=\r\nope our moderator forgives this question which I also\n&gt; posted on the jyoti=\r\nsh forum...I am a bit unclear about Kavacha for the\n&gt; planets.\n&gt;\n&gt; For exam=\r\nple, if a planet such as Rahu is giving one to have problems\n&gt; during his d=\r\nasha, would one recite the Kavach of Rahu, OR some other\n&gt; &quot;counter-balanci=\r\nng&quot; planet that was strong in one&#39;s chart?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt; Raj\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n--8-3050414556-9440056247=:7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Namaste,&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;[&gt;...that act of homam or japam is also a karma that =\r\n&lt;STRONG&gt;pushed out&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &gt;blocked the older karma.]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Jap=\r\nam/Homam etc...are offcourse &quot;new Karmas&quot;.

Kavachas of various deities (or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; planets) are pr=\r\notective sheaths covering one&#39;s consciousness and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; stopping harmful =\r\ninfluences.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Grahas (literal meaning: those who grasp or ge=\r\nt hold of) give good and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; bad results by grasping one&#39;s consciousnes=\r\ns and affecting it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Each planet has positives and negative=\r\ns, in general and also based on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the chart. If one chants the kavach=\r\na of a planet many times, eventually&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a protective sheath is formed =\r\naround one&#39;s consciousness with the nature&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and energy of that plane=\r\nt. This will obviously offer protection that is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; consistent with the=\r\n nature of that planet, in general and in one&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; chart. But, please =\r\nremember that reading the kavacha of any planet will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; NOT harm you. =\r\nEven the kavacha of 8th lord or 6th lord will not harm&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suppose one has Pi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavacha, Venus will =\r\nprotect&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one from loss of courage (3rd), problems to shoulders (3rd)=\r\n, untimely&lt;BR&gt;&gt; death (i.e. loss of longevity/8th), problems in anus/gen=\r\nital area (8th)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; etc. There may be other things based on other facto=\r\nrs like aspects,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; occupancy etc. Based on his inherent nature, Venus=\r\n may also protect in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the matters of love, romance, creativity etc a=\r\nlso. Bottomline is that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the aspects of one&#39;s personality that the p=\r\nlanet is conducive to will be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; protected by the planet&#39;s energy.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you pick a wrong planet, you may not get the desired resul=\r\nt, but no&lt;BR&gt;&gt; harm is done. Even bad planets in your chart will have so=\r\nme aspects they&lt;BR&gt;&gt; want to protect and doing their kavacha will protec=\r\nt those aspects.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best will be to chant the kavachas of lag=\r\nna lord, dispositor of lagna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lord, Moon&#39;s dispositor and Sun&#39;s disp=\r\nositor. Even better will be to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; chant the kavachas of devatas instea=\r\nd of planets. Out of all the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kavachas I have seen until now, Naraya=\r\nna kavacha (from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; SrimadBhagavatam)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and Chandi Kavacha are =\r\nthe most potent kavachas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But please note that chanting a =\r\nkavacha once or twice or even once or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; twice a day is hardly suffici=\r\nent. If one has enough purity already, most&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantras work right away=\r\n. But most of us have very dense conditioning and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the energy of man=\r\ntras gets dispersed. The energy of the planet/deity of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the kavacha =\r\nwe chant cannot form a sheath around us easily. It requires&lt;BR&gt;&gt; intense=\r\n sadhana for most people. If one chants a kavacha 10-30 times&lt;BR&gt;&gt; every=\r\nday and does it for 40-60 days, then some kind of results can be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ex=\r\npected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is needed for most people to&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; see some results. Getting things done by a professional priest is also&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; not that useful, as there are very very few priests with the required=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; purity, the ability to identify with your problem and the ability =\r\nto&lt;BR&gt;&gt; transfer the energy. For most people, the best solution is to le=\r\narn and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; chant by themselves.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishW=\r\nritings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jul 7, 2011 at 11:39 AM, monkeym=\r\nonkeyking10 wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste all,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I sincere=\r\nly hope our moderator forgives this question which I also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; posted on=\r\n the jyotish forum...I am a bit unclear about Kavacha for the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; plane=\r\nts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For example, if a planet such as Rahu is giving one to=\r\n have problems&lt;BR&gt;&gt; during his dasha, would one recite the Kavach of Rah=\r\nu, OR some other&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;counter-balancing&quot; planet that was strong in one&#39;=\r\ns chart?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Raj&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n\r\n--8-3050414556-9440056247=:7--\r\n\n"}}
