I can answer the first query regarding milk. If a=C2=A0 calf is allowed =\r\nto drink lots of milk from its mother=C2=A0 it is not good for the baby&#39;s h=\r\nealth and for the mother storing so much milk in her body is harmful. Hence=\r\n the milk has to be removed or the cow and the calf&#39;s health will be in dan=\r\nger or to say they can die. This was told by my mother who had nurtured a c=\r\now in the village back then. These days I don&#39;t consider milk to be auspici=\r\nous as animals are given hormones etc to extract more milk.\n\n2. Regarding s=\r\nilk its a good question I would want to know about it too.\n\n3. My personal =\r\nunderstanding: There&#39;s no need to chant prayers in sanskrit but the intonat=\r\nions and vibrations coming from the mantras is what counts and makes it mor=\r\ne effective.=C2=A0 God can understand any language afterall he is the creat=\r\nor. Christians\n say their prayers in English.
