Even the sage does not know its true nature\nb=\r\necause it perishes when looked at.\n\nThis is the meaning of a verse from the=\r\n Yoga Vasishta. Strictly speaking,\nmaya is the totality of samsara, consist=\r\ning of the ignorance, which is the\nego-sense, and its expanded form, the mi=\r\nnd and its creation, the universe.\nThese do not survive in the true state o=\r\nf the real Self.\n\n448 The Supreme Being did not become mind, neither did it=\r\n become the world.\nIt remains unswerving from its true nature as pure, unmo=\r\ndified,\nconsciousness, transcending time, space and the rest.\n\n449 The worl=\r\nd did not come into being, nor is it going to be destroyed. No\none called =\r\n=E2=80=98the individual self=E2=80=99 was really born. There is no one in\nb=\r\nondage, no one who has become free, nor is there any spiritual seeker. This=\r\n\nis the most excellent truth that has been clarified.\n\nThis is the truth of=\r\n non-becoming, demonstrated by the sage Gaudapadacharya,\nin his Mandukya Ka=\r\nrikas, which is strictly in agreement with the experience\nof all the sages.=\r\n This is further explained.\n\n450 Just as the supporting screen is not affec=\r\nted by the series of pictures\npassing over it, so the Supreme Being is not =\r\naffected, even while the cinema\nof the world is being seen.\n\nThis is what B=\r\nhagavan says at the very beginning of Ulladu Narpadu (Forty\nVerses), where =\r\nhe employs the simile of the cinema show. The show begins\nwith a lighted sc=\r\nreen. On this is projected a series of pictures passing at\ngreat speed, so =\r\nthat the pictures are not seen separately. The screen does\nnot become wet b=\r\ny the appearance of water, nor is it burned by an appearance\nof fire. At th=\r\ne end of the show the lighted screen alone remains. Such is\nthe world-show.=\r\n The lighted screen represents the real Self, which is both\nreality and con=\r\nsciousness.\n\n451 This truth of non-becoming has been unmistakably stated ma=\r\nny times by\nthe great Guru Sankaracharya. Also, Sri Ramana, the Guru, has s=\r\ntated this\ntruth clearly in a variety of ways for the benefit of aspirants.=\r\n\n\n452 Indeed it has been said by him that the so-called fourth state is alo=\r\nne\nreal, and that the other three [the states of waking, dream and dreamles=\r\ns\nsleep] are always unreal. Also, it has been declared by him that the real=\r\n is\nalways only one, and that multiplicity is always unreal.\n\nThis has been=\r\n set forth in detail in the very beginning. The truth of\nnon-becoming is im=\r\nplicit in these teachings.\n\n453 =E2=80=98There is nothing real apart from y=\r\nou. You are one alone, transcending\ntime, space and so on. Throw off the de=\r\nlusion of ignorance and remain at\npeace.=E2=80=99 Thus did he teach the sta=\r\nte of true being, the Self.\n\n454 =E2=80=98In truth the creatures are not in=\r\n me; all this is only my maya=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 thus\ndid Bhagavan Krishna =\r\nhimself tell the truth of the non-becoming of the real\nSelf in the Gita.\n\n4=\r\n55 =E2=80=98The supreme reality, without losing its fullness of being, by i=\r\nts own\nmaya, became this complete universe. To the sage it appears only as\n=\r\nfullness.=E2=80=99 Thus the Upanishad has stated the truth on non-becoming.=\r\n\n\nNow are given the five verses of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Tamil Ekatma Panchaka=\r\nm.\n\n456 When, forgetting the Self, one thinks that the body is oneself and =\r\ngoes\nthrough innumerable births and in the end remembers and becomes the Se=\r\nlf,\nknow this is only like awakening from a dream wherein one has wandered =\r\nall\nover the world.\n\nIn a dream one may go on a world-tour and in the dream=\r\n itself return home\nand lie down in one=E2=80=99s own bed; but when one awa=\r\nkes one knows that it was all\na dream. In the same way all of one=E2=80=99s=\r\n samsaric reincarnations are only a\nlong-drawn out dream, at the end of whi=\r\nch only the Self remains, unaffected\nby all this. There is a difference her=\r\ne, because it was not the Self that\ndreamed, but only the ego-mind.\n\nIn the=\r\n second verse the quest of =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 is ridiculed, logica=\r\nlly enough.\n\n457 One ever is the Self. To ask oneself =E2=80=98Who and wher=\r\neabouts am I?=E2=80=99 is like\nthe drunken man enquiring, =E2=80=98Who am I=\r\n?=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Where am I?=E2=80=99\n\nHere the difference is that t=\r\nhe drunken man puts the question to others, but\nthe sadhaka puts the questi=\r\non to his own ignorant, false self. The real Self\nremains unaffected all th=\r\ne time.\n\n458 The body is within the Self. And yet one thinks one is inside =\r\nthe inert\nbody, like some spectator who supposes that the screen on which t=\r\nhe film is\nthrown is within the picture.\n\nHerein the relation of supporter =\r\nand the supported is turned topsy-turvy.\n\n459 Does the ornament of gold exi=\r\nst apart from the gold? Can the body exist\napart from the Self? The ignoran=\r\nt one thinks =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. The\nenlightened one knows =E2=\r\n=80=98I am the Self=E2=80=99.\n\nHere the truth is that the one Self is the s=\r\nubstratum of all appearances.\nThis has been explained before. In the true s=\r\ntate there is no\nsuperimposition, only the substratum remains, but it is no=\r\n longer a\nsubstratum.\n\n460 The Self alone, the sole reality, exists forever=\r\n. If of yore the first\nof teachers revealed it through unbroken silence, sa=\r\ny, who can reveal it in\nspoken words?\n\nSo this is the rationale of the sile=\r\nnt teaching by God as Dakshinamurti, the\nfirst Guru. Rightly to teach the S=\r\nelf is to be perfectly quiet. That is\nteaching by being only the Self, with=\r\nout ego and without mind. He who\nlikewise remains as the Self, mind-free an=\r\nd egoless, understands this silent\nteaching.\n\nThus the truth of non-becomin=\r\ng is confirmed.\n\nThe knowledge thus far imparted is only preparatory to the=\r\n teaching of the\nmeans of obtaining the right awareness. It is not itself t=\r\nhat awareness.\n\n461 Even though the truth of the Self has been stated in ma=\r\nny ways, it\nremains untold, because it can be known only by actual experien=\r\nce. For the\naspirant to deliverance, that experiential awareness of the Sel=\r\nf is\nprevented by the mind, and its firmly established conviction, =E2=80=\r\n=98I am the\nbody=E2=80=99.\n\n462 Those minds that have been purified from wo=\r\nrldly attachments immediately\nget firmly established in the natural state o=\r\nf the real Self merely by\nlistening to this truth. Others need to go throug=\r\nh some excellent process\nfor the extinction of the ego sense.\n\n463 =E2=80=\r\n=98One should seek the Self, which is pure and free from sorrow, with a\nfir=\r\nm resolve to know it. This is the way to peace.=E2=80=99 In such terms do t=\r\nhe\nancient revelation and the Guru describe the direct path for the experie=\r\nnce\nof the truth of the real Self.\n\n464 The =E2=80=98resolve to know=E2=80=\r\n=99 mentioned here is the firm intention to win the\nexperience of one=E2=80=\r\n=99s own Self. Only by having such an intention can the\naspirant turn his m=\r\nind inwards in the quest for his own Self.\n\n465 In the ancient revelation i=\r\nt is mentioned that the dwelling place of the\nsupreme one is named the Hear=\r\nt. Since he himself [the supreme one] is all\nthere is, how can the Heart be=\r\n designated as his dwelling place?\n\nThe explanation follows.\n\n466 The real =\r\nHeart is just consciousness in its native purity. The Self is\nalso that con=\r\nsciousness. So, it follows that the Self is itself the Heart,\nand all creat=\r\nion is established in it.\n\n467 The sages and the Vedanta teach that the one=\r\n who really has no dwelling\nplace has a dwelling place called the Heart ins=\r\nide the body in order to\ncause the inward-turning of the mind in the quest.=\r\n\n\nThe necessity of this inward turning is then shown.\n\n468 The organs of pe=\r\nrception are always turned outwards, and this is the\nreason why the Self is=\r\n covered over by the world. There is only one means to\nuncover it: the aspi=\r\nrant turning within in a quest for the Self.\n\nThis is the meaning of an upa=\r\nnishadic verse.\n\n469 The experience of the sages has shown the difference b=\r\netween bondage and\ndeliverance. The bound one suffers from the arising of t=\r\nhe ego sense,\nwhereas the ego sense does not arise in the case of the one w=\r\nho is free.\n\n470 Though the great being, the Self, is ever present, dearly =\r\nbeloved and of\ngreat effulgence, it is as if its effulgence is dimmed by th=\r\ne evil one, the\nego, so that it does not shine sufficiently enough to be re=\r\ncognised.\n\n471 Ignorance is the awareness that consists of the experience =\r\n=E2=80=98I am the\nbody=E2=80=99. How can this experiential awareness be a d=\r\nefinitive knowledge, since\nit is without the experiential awareness, =E2=80=\r\n=98I am the pure consciousness?=E2=80=99\n\nBecause ignorance, which is itsel=\r\nf bondage, consists in an experiential\nawareness, even though wrong, it can=\r\n be extinguished only by the right\nawareness, which is also an experience. =\r\nMere inferential knowledge, usually\ncalled knowledge of something absent =\r\n=E2=80=93 parokshajnanam =E2=80=93 is wholly\nineffectual for winning delive=\r\nrance. The sadhana as taught by Bhagavan is\nthe direct path to that experie=\r\nnce. This sadhana will now be explained.\n\n472 The thought that arises in th=\r\ne form =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 is itself the form\nin which the indi=\r\nvidual soul is experienced. The aspirant must seek the\nsource wherefrom it =\r\narises, after separating from it the fraction of it that\nis real.\n\n473 This=\r\n individual is not altogether unreal. He is not so in the same sense\nas the=\r\n barren woman=E2=80=99s son is unreal. The real Self is present as the\nsubs=\r\ntratum on which the sense of an individual soul is superimposed, and\nhence,=\r\n even though unreal, he is taken to be real.\n\nThis distinction is very impo=\r\nrtant, as it will be seen. Everyone knows that\nthere is no barren woman=E2=\r\n=80=99s son, mare=E2=80=99s horn, and so on, because these\nnotions have no =\r\nsubstratum.\n\nOn the other hand, the rope-snake, the silver in the mother-of=\r\n-pearl, etc.,\nare capable of being imagined to be seen, because these have =\r\na substratum,\nas explained before. So the individual soul comes to be taken=\r\n as existing,\nthough he really does not exist, as taught before.\n\nThe quest=\r\nion then is what is the substratum on which the appearance of an\nindividual=\r\n soul is superimposed. This and other pertinent questions are\nanswered in t=\r\nhe verses that follow.\n\n474 The real element of the soul, the =E2=80=98I=E2=\r\n=80=99, is consciousness, the nature of\nthe real Self. By taking hold of th=\r\nis real element, the seeker of\ndeliverance is enabled to engage in the ques=\r\nt of the Self.\n\n475-7 Give up the element of unreality of this soul, the bo=\r\ndy and all the\nrest of it, and fix the mind on the consciousness of the Sel=\r\nf that has the\nform of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. This is extremely subtle, like =\r\na ray of the real Self. The\nseeker should then dive into the Heart, seeking=\r\n the place of birth of this\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-sense by asking the questio=\r\nn =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98Whence is this =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=\r\n=9D?=E2=80=99 This\nis the way a dog rejoins his master, seeking him by foll=\r\nowing his scent. It\nis like a diver diving into water to recover something =\r\nthat has fallen\nthere. This is the way to attain one=E2=80=99s own real sta=\r\nte.\n\n478 If during this quest of one=E2=80=99s own Self, the mind turns out=\r\nwards, due to\nattachment to sense objects, the seeker should turn it inward=\r\ns again by\nmerging the world in the Self.\n\nThis is explained next.\n\n479 =E2=\r\n=80=98Just as waves, foam, etc., are only the ocean, and as the dream-world=\r\n\nis only the seer of the dream, and nothing else, so the whole world is onl=\r\ny\nmyself and nothing else.=E2=80=99 This view is the merging of the world i=\r\nn the Self.\n\n480 If during the quest of one=E2=80=99s own Self the mind tur=\r\nns outwards on account\nof its attachment to objects of perception, the seek=\r\ner should turn it\ninwards again. He should bring the mind back again and ag=\r\nain and re-engage\nit in the quest. There must be a resolve to become aware =\r\nof the truth of\noneself by means of the question, =E2=80=98Who is he that h=\r\nas this attachment to\nobjects of perception?=E2=80=99\n\nSource: http://www.d=\r\navidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00163683238633bde304a0edc5d5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n447 Through the destruction of maya the aspirant for deliverance=\r\n becomes established in his true state. Even the sage does not know its tru=\r\ne nature because it perishes when looked at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the meaning of =\r\na verse from the Yoga Vasishta. Strictly speaking, maya is the totality of =\r\nsamsara, consisting of the ignorance, which is the ego-sense, and its expan=\r\nded form, the mind and its creation, the universe. These do not survive in =\r\nthe true state of the real Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;448 The Supreme Being did not bec=\r\nome mind, neither did it become the world. It remains unswerving from its t=\r\nrue nature as pure, unmodified, consciousness, transcending time, space and=\r\n the rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;449 The world did not co=\r\nme into being, nor is it going to be destroyed. No one called =E2=80=98the =\r\nindividual self=E2=80=99 was really born. There is no one in bondage, no on=\r\ne who has become free, nor is there any spiritual seeker. This is the most =\r\nexcellent truth that has been clarified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is the truth =\r\nof non-becoming, demonstrated by the sage Gaudapadacharya, in his Mandukya =\r\nKarikas, which is strictly in agreement with the experience of all the sage=\r\ns. This is further explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;450 J=\r\nust as the supporting screen is not affected by the series of pictures pass=\r\ning over it, so the Supreme Being is not affected, even while the cinema of=\r\n the world is being seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=\r\nThis is what Bhagavan says at the very beginning of Ulladu Narpadu (Forty V=\r\nerses), where he employs the simile of the cinema show. The show begins wit=\r\nh a lighted screen. On this is projected a series of pictures passing at gr=\r\neat speed, so that the pictures are not seen separately. The screen does no=\r\nt become wet by the appearance of water, nor is it burned by an appearance =\r\nof fire. At the end of the show the lighted screen alone remains. Such is t=\r\nhe world-show. The lighted screen represents the real Self, which is both r=\r\neality and consciousness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;451 This truth of non-becoming ha=\r\ns been unmistakably stated many times by the great Guru Sankaracharya. Also=\r\n, Sri Ramana, the Guru, has stated this truth clearly in a variety of ways =\r\nfor the benefit of aspirants.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n452 Indeed it has been said by him t=\r\nhat the so-called fourth state is alone real, and that the other three [the=\r\n states of waking, dream and dreamless sleep] are always unreal. Also, it h=\r\nas been declared by him that the real is always only one, and that multipli=\r\ncity is always unreal.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This has been set forth in detail in the ve=\r\nry beginning. The truth of non-becoming is implicit in these teachings.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;453 =E2=80=98There is nothing real apart from you. You are one alone, t=\r\nranscending time, space and so on. Throw off the delusion of ignorance and =\r\nremain at peace.=E2=80=99 Thus did he teach the state of true being, the Se=\r\nlf.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;454 =E2=80=98In truth the creatures are not in me; all this is=\r\n only my maya=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 thus did Bhagavan Krishna himself tell the=\r\n truth of the non-becoming of the real Self in the Gita.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;455 =E2=80=\r\n=98The supreme reality, without losing its fullness of being, by its own ma=\r\nya, became this complete universe. To the sage it appears only as fullness.=\r\n=E2=80=99 Thus the Upanishad has stated the truth on non-becoming.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Now are given the five verses of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Tamil Ekatma Panchakam=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;456 When, forgetting the Self, on=\r\ne thinks that the body is oneself and goes through innumerable births and i=\r\nn the end remembers and becomes the Self, know this is only like awakening =\r\nfrom a dream wherein one has wandered all over the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I=\r\nn a dream one may go on a world-tour and in the dream itself return home an=\r\nd lie down in one=E2=80=99s own bed; but when one awakes one knows that it =\r\nwas all a dream. In the same way all of one=E2=80=99s samsaric reincarnatio=\r\nns are only a long-drawn out dream, at the end of which only the Self remai=\r\nns, unaffected by all this. There is a difference here, because it was not =\r\nthe Self that dreamed, but only the ego-mind.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the second verse =\r\nthe quest of =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 is ridiculed, logically enough.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;457 One ever is the Self. To ask oneself =E2=80=98Who and whereabouts =\r\nam I?=E2=80=99 is like the drunken man enquiring, =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=\r\n=99 and =E2=80=98Where am I?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Here the difference is that =\r\nthe drunken man puts the question to others, but the sadhaka puts the quest=\r\nion to his own ignorant, false self. The real Self remains unaffected all t=\r\nhe time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;458 The body is within the=\r\n Self. And yet one thinks one is inside the inert body, like some spectator=\r\n who supposes that the screen on which the film is thrown is within the pic=\r\nture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Herein the relation of supporter and the supported is=\r\n turned topsy-turvy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;459 Does the o=\r\nrnament of gold exist apart from the gold? Can the body exist apart from th=\r\ne Self? The ignorant one thinks =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. The enligh=\r\ntened one knows =E2=80=98I am the Self=E2=80=99.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Here the t=\r\nruth is that the one Self is the substratum of all appearances. This has be=\r\nen explained before. In the true state there is no superimposition, only th=\r\ne substratum remains, but it is no longer a substratum.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;460 The Se=\r\nlf alone, the sole reality, exists forever. If of yore the first of teacher=\r\ns revealed it through unbroken silence, say, who can reveal it in spoken wo=\r\nrds?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this is the rationale of the silent teaching by God as Daksh=\r\ninamurti, the first Guru. Rightly to teach the Self is to be perfectly quie=\r\nt. That is teaching by being only the Self, without ego and without mind. H=\r\ne who likewise remains as the Self, mind-free and egoless, understands this=\r\n silent teaching.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Thus the truth of non-becoming is confirmed.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;The knowledge thus far imparted is only preparatory to the teaching of =\r\nthe means of obtaining the right awareness. It is not itself that awareness=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;461 Even though the truth of the Self has been stated in many ways=\r\n, it remains untold, because it can be known only by actual experience. For=\r\n the aspirant to deliverance, that experiential awareness of the Self is pr=\r\nevented by the mind, and its firmly established conviction, =E2=80=98I am t=\r\nhe body=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;462 Those minds that have been purified from wor=\r\nldly attachments immediately get firmly established in the natural state of=\r\n the real Self merely by listening to this truth. Others need to go through=\r\n some excellent process for the extinction of the ego sense.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;463 =\r\n=E2=80=98One should seek the Self, which is pure and free from sorrow, with=\r\n a firm resolve to know it. This is the way to peace.=E2=80=99 In such term=\r\ns do the ancient revelation and the Guru describe the direct path for the e=\r\nxperience of the truth of the real Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;464 The =E2=80=98resolve =\r\nto know=E2=80=99 mentioned here is the firm intention to win the experience=\r\n of one=E2=80=99s own Self. Only by having such an intention can the aspira=\r\nnt turn his mind inwards in the quest for his own Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;465 In the a=\r\nncient revelation it is mentioned that the dwelling place of the supreme on=\r\ne is named the Heart. Since he himself [the supreme one] is all there is, h=\r\now can the Heart be designated as his dwelling place?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The explanat=\r\nion follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;466 The real Heart is just consciousness in its native =\r\npurity. The Self is also that consciousness. So, it follows that the Self i=\r\ns itself the Heart, and all creation is established in it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;467 The=\r\n sages and the Vedanta teach that the one who really has no dwelling place =\r\nhas a dwelling place called the Heart inside the body in order to cause the=\r\n inward-turning of the mind in the quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The necessity of this inwa=\r\nrd turning is then shown.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;468 The organs of perception are always =\r\nturned outwards, and this is the reason why the Self is covered over by the=\r\n world. There is only one means to uncover it: the aspirant turning within =\r\nin a quest for the Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is the meaning of an upanishadic ver=\r\nse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;469 The experience of the sages has shown the difference between=\r\n bondage and deliverance. The bound one suffers from the arising of the ego=\r\n sense, whereas the ego sense does not arise in the case of the one who is =\r\nfree.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;470 Though the great being, the Self, is ever present, dearl=\r\ny beloved and of great effulgence, it is as if its effulgence is dimmed by =\r\nthe evil one, the ego, so that it does not shine sufficiently enough to be =\r\nrecognised.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;471 Ignorance is the awareness that consists of the ex=\r\nperience =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. How can this experiential awarene=\r\nss be a definitive knowledge, since it is without the experiential awarenes=\r\ns, =E2=80=98I am the pure consciousness?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Because ignoranc=\r\ne, which is itself bondage, consists in an experiential awareness, even tho=\r\nugh wrong, it can be extinguished only by the right awareness, which is als=\r\no an experience. Mere inferential knowledge, usually called knowledge of so=\r\nmething absent =E2=80=93 parokshajnanam =E2=80=93 is wholly ineffectual for=\r\n winning deliverance. The sadhana as taught by Bhagavan is the direct path =\r\nto that experience. This sadhana will now be explained.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;472 The thought that arises in the form =E2=80=98I a=\r\nm the body=E2=80=99 is itself the form in which the individual soul is expe=\r\nrienced. The aspirant must seek the source wherefrom it arises, after separ=\r\nating from it the fraction of it that is real.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;473 This ind=\r\nividual is not altogether unreal. He is not so in the same sense as the bar=\r\nren woman=E2=80=99s son is unreal. The real Self is present as the substrat=\r\num on which the sense of an individual soul is superimposed, and hence, eve=\r\nn though unreal, he is taken to be real.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This distinction is very =\r\nimportant, as it will be seen. Everyone knows that there is no barren woman=\r\n=E2=80=99s son, mare=E2=80=99s horn, and so on, because these notions have =\r\nno substratum.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the rope-snake, the silver i=\r\nn the mother-of-pearl, etc., are capable of being imagined to be seen, beca=\r\nuse these have a substratum, as explained before. So the individual soul co=\r\nmes to be taken as existing, though he really does not exist, as taught bef=\r\nore.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The question then is what is the substratum on which the appe=\r\narance of an individual soul is superimposed. This and other pertinent ques=\r\ntions are answered in the verses that follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;474 The real element o=\r\nf the soul, the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, is consciousness, the nature of the re=\r\nal Self. By taking hold of this real element, the seeker of deliverance is =\r\nenabled to engage in the quest of the Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;475-7 Give up the element of unreality of this soul, the body an=\r\nd all the rest of it, and fix the mind on the consciousness of the Self tha=\r\nt has the form of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. This is extremely subtle, like a ray=\r\n of the real Self. The seeker should then dive into the Heart, seeking the =\r\nplace of birth of this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-sense by asking the question =E2=\r\n=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98Whence is this =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D?=E2=\r\n=80=99 This is the way a dog rejoins his master, seeking him by following h=\r\nis scent. It is like a diver diving into water to recover something that ha=\r\ns fallen there. This is the way to attain one=E2=80=99s own real state.&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;478 If during this quest of o=\r\nne=E2=80=99s own Self, the mind turns outwards, due to attachment to sense =\r\nobjects, the seeker should turn it inwards again by merging the world in th=\r\ne Self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is explained next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;479 =E2=80=98Just as=\r\n waves, foam, etc., are only the ocean, and as the dream-world is only the =\r\nseer of the dream, and nothing else, so the whole world is only myself and =\r\nnothing else.=E2=80=99 This view is the merging of the world in the Self.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;480 If during the quest of one=E2=\r\n=80=99s own Self the mind turns outwards on account of its attachment to ob=\r\njects of perception, the seeker should turn it inwards again. He should bri=\r\nng the mind back again and again and re-engage it in the quest. There must =\r\nbe a resolve to become aware of the truth of oneself by means of the questi=\r\non, =E2=80=98Who is he that has this attachment to objects of perception?=\r\n=E2=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;=\r\na href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clea=\r\nr:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px=\r\n;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-=\r\nsize:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0=\r\npx;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--00163683238633bde304a0edc5d5--\r\n\n"}}
