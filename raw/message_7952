This is a lo=\r\naded question, \nbut I will share a few random thoughts on this and several =\r\nrelated \ntopics. More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I will be w=\r\nriting \non how NOT to try to recognize it!\n\nIf you don&#39;t like my 2 cents, k=\r\nindly feel free to ignore me and follow \nyour gurus and others whom you may=\r\n prefer.\n\n*        *        *\n\nMATERIAL RESULTS\n\nOne obvious thing is that =\r\nsome people get material benefits, like \nmarriage, job, promotion, childbir=\r\nth etc. That reinforces or increases \nfaith in the initial stages and makes=\r\n one continue sadhana.\n\nHowever, that may not happen to everyone. Moreover,=\r\n such material \nresults do not necessarily show spiritual progress. So, how=\r\n do we \nidentify spiritual progress?\n\n*        *        *\n\nGOAL OF SADHANA\n=\r\n\nSpiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized in \nscri=\r\nptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, it all \nboils =\r\ndown to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, \nattachments and a=\r\ngendas, which come from innate conditioning of the \nmind. How free we are i=\r\ns indicated by how much we are able to resist and \novercome this innate con=\r\nditioning.\n\nMaharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama in &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; that =\r\n\nSelf-realization means overcoming conditioning. Patanjali defined Yoga \n(C=\r\nommunion with Self) in &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; as &quot;yogaH chitta vRtti nirodhaH&quot; \n(Com=\r\nmunion is resisting the working of conditioning).\n\nThis conditioning inflat=\r\nes ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, \nwe can deflate the ego comp=\r\nletely and then identify with the entire \nuniverse, instead of a single ent=\r\nity with a single agenda.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIDENTIFYING CONDITIONING\n\nI=\r\nnnate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determines our \nlik=\r\nes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or dislike) \nsome p=\r\neople for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some things \nthough our=\r\n inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) those \nthings. All =\r\nthis comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated \nover many lives.\n=\r\n\nWhen someone praises us, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner \nvoi=\r\nce tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. When someone puts us \ndown, we =\r\nmay know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice tells us so) \nand yet we ma=\r\ny feel offended and feel like doing something about it. All \nthis comes fro=\r\nm conditioning, which has been accumulated over many \nlives.\n\nIdnetifying t=\r\nhe conditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, \ncalculations and a=\r\nctions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key \nis to learn to list=\r\nen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the \ninner voice of conscienc=\r\ne is telling us one thing and we are impelled \nfrom inside to do otherwise,=\r\n we can conclude that that is the work of \nconditioning. We often suppress =\r\nthe inner voice of conscience and obey \nthe inner voice of our conditioning=\r\n.\n\nIf we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - physical or mental =\r\n\n- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it means our \nconditionin=\r\ng is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful measure of \nspiritual pr=\r\nogress. This may in general be difficult for others to \njudge, but one can =\r\ncertainly judge for oneself.\n\nThe tricky thing is that our self-analysis an=\r\nd self-judgment is also \ncontrolled by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged=\r\n in an action against \nmy inner voice. Suppose I want to analyze what just =\r\nhappened and whether \nI violated my inner voice of conscience. That whole p=\r\nrocess is governed \nby the conditioning too. Depending on how deeply I am c=\r\nonditioned to \nthink that I am a good person doing the right thing and not =\r\nmaking a \nmistake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voice of con=\r\nscience \nas a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance. Instead,=\r\n it \nwill focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts out from \n=\r\ninside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that I did the \nr=\r\night thing.\n\nThe grip of conditioning is too tight to overcome in a day or =\r\ntwo! But, \nthe inner voice of conscience does tell everyone when one is doi=\r\nng \nsomething wrong under the influence of conditioning. If one keeps \ntryi=\r\nng, it can oneday help one identify and overcome conditioning.\n\n*        * =\r\n       *\n\nSPECIAL EXPERIENCES\n\nSometimes, as one makes spiritual progress, =\r\none may have super-normal or \nmystical or out-of-body experiences, visions =\r\nand dreams.\n\nFor example, one person I know started to feel very light in t=\r\nhe head \nwith a vision of bright light of a particular color, when he medit=\r\nated \nwith a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a big fire=\r\n at \nthe base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire (he actual=\r\nly \nfelt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific mantra. Another=\r\n \nperson saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity talked to him. \nI=\r\nnterestingly, the same deity was seen by another person who was also \nsitti=\r\nng there at the same time and that person had a totally different \n(and mor=\r\ne mundane) mental conversation with the same deity at the same \ntime. Anoth=\r\ner person felt like he became very light and was floating in \nair and there=\r\n was an inexpressible happiness. In another case, one \nsadhaka when meditat=\r\ning was filled with the sense that his job was done \non earth and he could =\r\nnow leave. He thought, &quot;let me leave and let me \ntake some more with me&quot;. H=\r\ne felt like he was a point moving up with a \ntremendous speed. At the same =\r\ntime, another person who was meditating a \nfew feet away in front of a homa=\r\nm fire felt like somebody was pulling \nthat person forcibly through a cave =\r\nand felt really overwhelmed.\n\nThere are so many possible experiences. But t=\r\nhe key point is that \nexperiences are secondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY=\r\n NOR SUFFICIENT for \nspiritual progress. I had my share of experiences, pro=\r\ngress and setbacks \nand I am 100% sure of the above. You&#39;ll do well to reme=\r\nmber this \nsentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences or desire t=\r\nhem \nconsciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little later on the \n=\r\ngrave dangers of desiring experiences.\n\n*        *        *\n\nEXPERIENCE VS =\r\nTHEORY: WRONG QUESTION\n\nWe say that god can be known only by experience and=\r\n not by reading \nbooks. That is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply =\r\ndesirous of an \nexperience, one may experience an aspect of god&#39;s Delusory =\r\nPower instead \nof god and that may increase false pride (a true experience =\r\nof god will \ninstead produce infinite humility). Not all experiences are eq=\r\nual.\n\nThere is a famous quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton =\r\nof \ntheory. Though that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of=\r\n \nexperience is useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of \nth=\r\neory may actually be better if it actually reduces one&#39;s ego to a \npound or=\r\n an ounce!\n\nThe issue is not whether one needs practical experience or theo=\r\nretical \nunderstanding. That is secondary. The primary thing is what is hap=\r\npening \nto one&#39;s ego. Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT is undoubted=\r\nly \nthe main issue. If reading books, satsanga, rituals, theoretical \nunder=\r\nstanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal, from a quintal to \na pound=\r\n and from a pound to an ounce, even without a direct experience, \nthat&#39;s aw=\r\nesome. That is better than getting a ton of experience and ego \nbeing infla=\r\nted from a pound to a quintal.\n\nThough it is true that ego does not become =\r\ncomplete zero without an \n&quot;experience&quot; of god in the end, it is still a bad=\r\n idea to seek that \n&quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego is still a ton or a quintal=\r\n. First reduce it \nto as small a quantity as you can. Experience of god wil=\r\nl then come by \nitself.\n\nIn the famous Indian movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, there is a =\r\nnice line: &quot;Don&#39;t \nchase success, but chase capability. Success will follow=\r\n automatically.&quot; \nSimilarly, don&#39;t chase experiences, but chase detachment =\r\nand deflation \nof ego. Experience will automatically follow. Chasing experi=\r\nence without \ntrying to reduce ego is like putting the cart before the hors=\r\ne. To use \nthe analogy from the movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, one then runs the risk of=\r\n \nbecoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Ramalingam (alias Silencer) \n=\r\nof that movie, who chased success, ended up with huge ego from limited \nsuc=\r\ncess and failed in the end!\n\n*        *        *\n\nEXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONI=\r\nNG\n\nAs said above, it is a bad idea to seek an &quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego =\r\n\nis still a ton or a quintal. In other words, when one&#39;s conditioning is \nd=\r\nense enough, a pre-occupation with experiences can be \ncounter-productive. =\r\nThe reason is that any experience will be \ninterpreted (and absorbed into o=\r\nne&#39;s system!!!) through the color of \none&#39;s conditioning.\n\nIf I go into the=\r\n open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see \nthat Sun is orange. =\r\nBut, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass \nwindows of a house. Or sup=\r\npose I go into the open, but see Sun through \ngreen eyeglasses. In either c=\r\nase, I will see that Sun is green. I am \nexperiencing the real Sun, but I w=\r\nill get the wrong knowledge that &quot;Sun \nis green&quot;.\n\nSimilarly, even a genuin=\r\ne spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN \ngenerate false knowledge (e.=\r\ng. Sun is green!) if one&#39;s conditioning is \nconducive (e.g. green eyeglasse=\r\ns!).\n\nThe key is not just to experience, but the ability to interpet, *dige=\r\nst* \nand absorb the experience into one&#39;s system well. One&#39;s conditioning \n=\r\ninfluences how one digests various life experiences, including spiritual \ne=\r\nxperiences and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the \nabo=\r\nve example!\n\n*        *        *\n\nDIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES\n\nIn ayurvedic te=\r\nrms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic \nbuildup in the syste=\r\nm. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various \ntissues and create va=\r\nrious diseases. In the beginning, one may look and \nfeel healthy despite so=\r\nme ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one \ndevelops serious diseases.=\r\n The disease starts to spread to various parts \nof the body. The ama may ev=\r\nen interfere with the digestion of good food \nbeing taken in and the workin=\r\ng of even medicines one may take in. When \ntoo much ama has accumulated and=\r\n destabilizes the system, one may need \nto go through a painful de-toxifica=\r\ntion process.\n\nSimilarly, spiritual experiences one cannot digest well beco=\r\nme spiritual \nama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can slowly buil=\r\nd up, get \nabsorbed into various aspects of one&#39;s being and create various =\r\ndiseases \nin the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and feel \nsp=\r\niritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritual \nama ac=\r\ncumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can \neventually =\r\naffect one&#39;s entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for \nde-toxification=\r\n) may be far more difficult than the physical \npancha-karma.\n\n*        *   =\r\n     *\n\nEXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS\n\nTo illustrate what I mean by spiritual am=\r\na and delusions, let me give a \n*hypothetical* example.\n\nSuppose someone si=\r\nts still for a few hours everyday and meditates. \nSuppose one starts to get=\r\n some special inner experiences and some \nseemingly supernatural things sta=\r\nrt happening externally around one. \nSuppose these experiences give one the=\r\n impression that one is special \nand one is making excellent spiritual prog=\r\nress. Suppose one reads some \nspiritual books and fantasizes &quot;becoming like=\r\n Shiva&quot; mentioned in those \nbooks. Then one may start to think &quot;may be, I h=\r\nave become like Shiva&quot; \nand slowly convince oneself that one HAS become lik=\r\ne Shiva. Suppose one \nreads a spiritual book that claims &quot;If one becomes li=\r\nke Shiva, the whole \nuniverse connives against one who causes an offense to=\r\n him&quot;.\n\nOf course, there is a context behind every statement and no stateme=\r\nnt is \nabsolute. If one misses the nuances, one may digest and absorb it in=\r\nto \none&#39;s system incorrectly. After all, one could have also said, &quot;if one =\r\n\nbecomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully co-operates with one and \nthe=\r\nre is no way anyone can really cause offense to that person&quot;.\n\nAnyway, one =\r\nin the process of convincing oneself that one has indeed \nbecome like Shiva=\r\n may then look for examples of someone causing offense \nand suffering bad t=\r\nhings. Of course, just as one can find any shapes in \nclouds, one can find =\r\nany correlations in things happening around one. \nOne will find a few examp=\r\nles. That may reinforce the delusion that one \nhas become like Shiva. When =\r\ngood and bad happen to people around one, \none may start correlating them t=\r\no good and bad done by those people to \none and/or to things one has done. =\r\nOver time, the delusion may become so \ndeep that it just feels so natural a=\r\nnd obvious. This is like a serious \ndisease developing from a toxic buildup=\r\n of undigested or badly digested \nfood. Inability to fully understand the s=\r\npiritual experiences one had, \nthe fantasy of becoming like Shiva, the pre-=\r\nexising pride (like \npre-existing ama) and the not-so-well-digested notion =\r\nthat offense to \nShiva causes harm, have together created spiritual ama bui=\r\nldup that now \nresulted in a serious disease.\n\nThough original experiences =\r\nmay have been genuine, experiences coming \nlater on MAY be the result of ac=\r\ncumulated delusions (disease) from the \nill-digested experiences and notion=\r\ns (ama). Please note that ama is \nconducive to creating more ama. When unch=\r\necked, disease in one part of \nthe system can spread to others.\n\nAs said be=\r\nfore, the key issue is: Is the ego getting inflated or \ndeflated. If ego is=\r\n getting inflated, then one is on the wrong track. \nOne is either deluding =\r\noneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences due \nto pre-existing condition=\r\ning and delusions (spiritual ama). In either \ncase, whatever one is experie=\r\nncing is not being digested well and is \nweakening the system instead of st=\r\nrengthening it. If, on the other hand, \nego is getting deflated, then one i=\r\ns on the right track. Whatever one is \nexperiencing is being digested well =\r\nand strengthening the system.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIR=\r\nACLES\n\nThis emphasis on ego deflation may make some people wonder about the=\r\n \nprominence given in some books to accumulation of shakti, siddhis and \nmi=\r\nracles. For example, some books describe what a being like Shiva or \nsomeon=\r\ne less but still with high enough shakti, can do.\n\nYes, SOME enlightened be=\r\nings or some beings close to enlightenment MAY \nhave a lot of spiritual sha=\r\nkti and be able to do some special things. \nBut, no book said that you get =\r\nthose abilities by being proud or \npursuing something that can make one pro=\r\nud.\n\nIn fact, if one looks at those abilities described in books and adores=\r\n \nthem from one&#39;s *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is quite akin =\r\n\nto looking at a &quot;green Sun&quot; from green eyeglasses and admiring the \ngreenn=\r\ness of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole point. \nOne wit=\r\nh dense conditioning can&#39;t even understand what that shakti or \nability rea=\r\nlly means or comes from. In order to understand what shakti \nis, to accumul=\r\nate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUST \ndeflate one&#39;s ego.\n\nB=\r\nottomline is this: Most scriptures of most religions are unanimous in \nteac=\r\nhing the importance of humility, compassion and ego deflation. No \nscriptur=\r\ne talks about the glory of pride and ego inflation. It&#39;s as \nsimple as that=\r\n.\n\n*        *        *\n\nGODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS\n\nWe encoun=\r\nter some people who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses \nand also c=\r\nonversations with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime \ncoming from =\r\nthe divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine \nbeings supposed=\r\nly said is well within what one consciously or \nsub-consciously already kne=\r\nw or believed or wanted to believe.\n\nThis may remind one of the encounters =\r\nof Mahatma Gandhi by the character \nplayed by Sanjay Dutt in hit bollywood =\r\nmovie &quot;Lage Rahe Munnabhai&quot;. In \nthat movie, the visions are due to &quot;chemic=\r\nal imbalance&quot; in Munnabhai&#39;s \nmind and the Gandhi he sees and can talk to, =\r\ncannot answer questions \nthat Munnabhai himself does not know (but real Gan=\r\ndhi should know). So \nthe conclusion is that the person Munnabhai imagines =\r\nseeing is a \ncharacter in his own mind constructed based on what Munnabhai =\r\n\nunderstands of Gandhi.\n\nIn the case of divine encounters, it may be a litt=\r\nle different from this \nmovie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied m=\r\neeting based on all \nthat one consciously and sub-consciously knew already,=\r\n OR it may be a \nreal being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her=\r\n actions are \ninterpreted strictly based on one&#39;s conditioning, like the &quot;g=\r\nreen Sun&quot; \nin our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, what divi=\r\nne \nbeings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one consciously or \n=\r\nsub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.\n\nIn the rare=\r\n case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning having a \nreal divine enco=\r\nunter, it is like an innocent child meeting mother or \nfather, and there is=\r\n a real flow of divine and sublime understanding and \nwisdom.\n\nAgain, the k=\r\ney is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be \nde-conditioned enough to re=\r\nally benefit from it!\n\n*        *        *\n\nKUNDALINI AWAKENING & RISE\n\nOne=\r\n more thing people often talk about is Kundalini awakening and rise. \nKunda=\r\nlini shakti is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this \nis &quot;I&quot;).=\r\n Kundalini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra means one does not \neven quest=\r\nion who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties \nself down t=\r\no the physical body and physical senses. However, \nself-awareness rising ab=\r\nove this does not necessarily mean spiritual \nprogress or enlightenment. Ku=\r\nndalini awakening is only the beginning of \na long process. If one&#39;s condit=\r\nioning is deeply holding down to subtle \nideas of who one is (e.g. I am a g=\r\nreat spiritual soul who saved the \nworld many times in the past and came ba=\r\nck to save it), an awakened \nKundalini may take one&#39;s notion of self beyond=\r\n the physical body, but \nwill get stuck somewhere else. In fact, one&#39;s subt=\r\nle notions of self may \nbecome aggrandized when Kundalini reaches conducive=\r\n regions and one may \nexperience things that aggravate and strengthen those=\r\n notions. One may \nget badly stuck.\n\nAs mentioned above, any spiritual expe=\r\nrience can create spiritual ama \nwhen not digested properly. Any pre-existi=\r\nng conditioning may make it \ndifficult to digest anything complex. Instead =\r\nof eating a heavy-duty \nprotein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxi=\r\nc buildup in the \nsystem, one is better off eating simple food that one&#39;s o=\r\nwn system can \nprocess and digest well.\n\nTo be clear, whether one&#39;s Kundali=\r\nni is awakened or not, and where one&#39;s \nKundalini is currently, is NOT a me=\r\nasure of one&#39;s spiritual progress. As \nKundalini does not rise through a si=\r\nngle path, as the rise is not linear \nand as the obstructions are not unifo=\r\nrm in all people, one cannot \ncompare two people based on Kundalini experie=\r\nnces.\n\nOne can cling to the body and overcome all conditioning slowly and \n=\r\noneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the way to Sahasrara. Another \nper=\r\nson may awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck somewhere where it is \nextrem=\r\nely difficult to overcome the corresponding conditioning.\n\nThe bottomline i=\r\ns that how much conditioning is overcome and how reduced \none&#39;s ego is is t=\r\nhe correct measure of spiritual progress and not \nwhether Kundalini is awak=\r\nened and where Kundalini is.\n\n*        *        *\n\nCORRELATIONS GALORE\n\nDo =\r\nnot get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or may \nnot me=\r\nan much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, &quot;wow, I was \njust thin=\r\nking about you&quot;. Or suppose you say something and someone says, \n&quot;wow, I wa=\r\ns just thinking about it. You answered me as though you read \nmy mind.&quot; Sup=\r\npose you were unhappy with the happenings in some region of \nthe world, did=\r\n a special sadhana and suppose something bad happened \nthere. Or suppose yo=\r\nu had a desire at the back of your mind, did some \nsadhana and the desire w=\r\nas fulfilled.\n\nIn several such cases, correlating a result with something y=\r\nou did can \noften increase pride and your sense of self-worth. And, doing t=\r\nhat will \nnot enable you to do your dharma any better.\n\nKeep thinking your =\r\nthoughts and desires, keep doing your actions and \nkeep doing your sadhana.=\r\n That&#39;s it. Don&#39;t correlate actions and results \nand think that you made X =\r\nor Y result happen. We engage in actions and \ngod gives results. The sense =\r\nof &quot;I made X happen&quot; is conducive to pride \nand ego inflation. Moreover, yo=\r\nu can *never* know *for sure* whether \naction A or B caused result X or Y, =\r\nbecause the action-result pipeline \nhas variable delay!! So, why even bothe=\r\nr to correlate and run the risk \nof ego inflation?\n\n*        *        *\n\nBO=\r\nTTOMLINE\n\nDon&#39;t run after special experiences and special abilities or anyt=\r\nhing \nthat makes you special (as you imagine currently, based on your dense=\r\n \nconditioning). Spiritual progress is not about becoming &quot;special&quot;, but \na=\r\nbout becoming humble. Special experiences and abilities do not matter \nat a=\r\nll. In fact, they can distract one and give false pride. God makes \none spe=\r\ncial AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost completely.\n\nAlso, stop cor=\r\nrelating things happening to or around you, with your \nactions, and think t=\r\nhat you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actions is \nyour sacred duty and =\r\ngiving whatever results are fit at a given time is \ngod&#39;s prerogative. That=\r\n is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe \nin one&#39;s thinking.\n\nRemem=\r\nber the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful measure of \nspiritual prog=\r\nress is how deflated your ego is and how humble you become \n(not how humble=\r\n you act or behave, but how humble you have really become \ninternally). It =\r\nis how well you are able to resist the temptations of \nfollowing the voice =\r\nof your conditioning (which inflates ego) and how \nwell you can follow the =\r\nvoice of conscience.\n\nWhen inflations in ego occur, it is the job of a guru=\r\n/mentor to notice \nit, bring it to the attention and perhaps even be ruthle=\r\nss in belling \nthe cat [of ego]. But most gurus now-a-days may not do that =\r\nwell. So, \nyou have to do your best to avoid any serious ego inflations.\n\nU=\r\nnfortunately, the path of spiritual progress and self-realization IS \nvery =\r\nvery very likely for most of us to include many many many \nopportunities fo=\r\nr very very very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict \nwatch on your ego=\r\n.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf I offended anybody with some strong assertions i=\r\nn this email, my \napologies.\n\nOm Tat Sat.\n\nKrishnarapanamstu,\nNarasimha\n---=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms th=\r\nat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/JyotishWritings\nTwitter ID: @homam108\n----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n\n \r\n--1411505736-1839098891-1330529788=:55868\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;great ..in=\r\nfact I want to take print-out and read it again and again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new ro=\r\nman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: =\r\ntimes new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr=\r\n&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Wedne=\r\nsday, 29 February 2012 9:38 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Su=\r\nbject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Spiritual Progress, Ego &amp; Experiences&lt;=\r\nbr&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1256486267&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1256486267ygrp-t=\r\next&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Om Harih Om&lt;br&gt;\nNamaste friends,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nA =\r\nlot of people asked in the past how to know if they are making &lt;br&gt;\nspiritu=\r\nal progress with their sadhana or not. This is a loaded question, &lt;br&gt;\nbut =\r\nI will share a few random thoughts on this and several related &lt;br&gt;\ntopics.=\r\n More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I will be writing &lt;br&gt;\non h=\r\now NOT to try to recognize it!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you don&#39;t like my 2 cents, kindl=\r\ny feel free to ignore me and follow &lt;br&gt;\nyour gurus and others whom you may=\r\n prefer.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMATERIAL RESULTS&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOn=\r\ne obvious thing is that some people get material benefits, like &lt;br&gt;\nmarria=\r\nge, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That reinforces or increases &lt;br&gt;\nfaith=\r\n in the initial stages and makes one continue sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever, th=\r\nat may not happen to everyone. Moreover, such material &lt;br&gt;\nresults do not =\r\nnecessarily show spiritual progress. So, how do we &lt;br&gt;\nidentify spiritual =\r\nprogress?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nGOAL OF SADHANA&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSp=\r\niritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized in &lt;br&gt;\nscr=\r\niptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, it all &lt;br&gt;\nb=\r\noils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, &lt;br&gt;\nattachme=\r\nnts and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the &lt;br&gt;\nmind. How =\r\nfree we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist and &lt;br&gt;\novercom=\r\ne this innate conditioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMaharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama in=\r\n &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; that &lt;br&gt;\nSelf-realization means overcoming conditionin=\r\ng. Patanjali defined Yoga &lt;br&gt;\n(Communion with Self) in &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; as &quot;y=\r\nogaH chitta vRtti nirodhaH&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n(Communion is resisting the working of con=\r\nditioning).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis conditioning inflates ego and by overcoming all t=\r\nhe conditioning, &lt;br&gt;\nwe can deflate the ego completely and then identify w=\r\nith the entire &lt;br&gt;\nuniverse, instead of a single entity with a single agen=\r\nda.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIDENTIFYING CONDITIONING&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nInnate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determines our &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nlikes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or dislike) &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nsome people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some things &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nthough our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) those=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nthings. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nover many lives.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen someone praises us, we may know that it=\r\n is irrelevant (our inner &lt;br&gt;\nvoice tells us so) and yet we may feel elate=\r\nd. When someone puts us &lt;br&gt;\ndown, we may know that it is irrelevant (our i=\r\nnner voice tells us so) &lt;br&gt;\nand yet we may feel offended and feel like doi=\r\nng something about it. All &lt;br&gt;\nthis comes from conditioning, which has bee=\r\nn accumulated over many &lt;br&gt;\nlives.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIdnetifying the conditioning a=\r\ns it works on our instincts, thoughts, &lt;br&gt;\ncalculations and actions, is no=\r\nt easy. But it is not impossible. The key &lt;br&gt;\nis to learn to listen to the=\r\n inner voice of conscience. Whenever the &lt;br&gt;\ninner voice of conscience is =\r\ntelling us one thing and we are impelled &lt;br&gt;\nfrom inside to do otherwise, =\r\nwe can conclude that that is the work of &lt;br&gt;\nconditioning. We often suppre=\r\nss the inner voice of conscience and obey &lt;br&gt;\nthe inner voice of our condi=\r\ntioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - phys=\r\nical or mental &lt;br&gt;\n- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it mea=\r\nns our &lt;br&gt;\nconditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful m=\r\neasure of &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progress. This may in general be difficult for oth=\r\ners to &lt;br&gt;\njudge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe tr=\r\nicky thing is that our self-analysis and self-judgment is also &lt;br&gt;\ncontrol=\r\nled by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action against &lt;br&gt;\nmy in=\r\nner voice. Suppose I want to analyze what just happened and whether &lt;br&gt;\nI =\r\nviolated my inner voice of conscience. That whole process is governed &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nby the conditioning too. Depending on how deeply I am conditioned to &lt;br&gt;\nt=\r\nhink that I am a good person doing the right thing and not making a &lt;br&gt;\nmi=\r\nstake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voice of conscience &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nas a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance. Instead, it &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nwill focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts out from &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\ninside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that I did the &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nright thing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe grip of conditioning is too tight to overcome =\r\nin a day or two! But, &lt;br&gt;\nthe inner voice of conscience does tell everyone=\r\n when one is doing &lt;br&gt;\nsomething wrong under the influence of conditioning=\r\n. If one keeps &lt;br&gt;\ntrying, it can oneday help one identify and overcome co=\r\nnditioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSPECIAL EXPERIENCES&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nSometimes, as one makes spiritual progress, one may have super-normal o=\r\nr &lt;br&gt;\nmystical or out-of-body experiences, visions and dreams.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFo=\r\nr example, one person I know started to feel very light in the head &lt;br&gt;\nwi=\r\nth a vision of bright light of a particular color, when he meditated &lt;br&gt;\nw=\r\nith a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a big fire at &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nthe base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire (he actually =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nfelt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific mantra. Anothe=\r\nr &lt;br&gt;\nperson saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity talked to hi=\r\nm. &lt;br&gt;\nInterestingly, the same deity was seen by another person who was al=\r\nso &lt;br&gt;\nsitting there at the same time and that person had a totally differ=\r\nent &lt;br&gt;\n(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same deity at the =\r\nsame &lt;br&gt;\ntime. Another person felt like he became very light and was float=\r\ning in &lt;br&gt;\nair and there was an inexpressible happiness. In another case, =\r\none &lt;br&gt;\nsadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense that his job was=\r\n done &lt;br&gt;\non earth and he could now leave. He thought, &quot;let me leave and l=\r\net me &lt;br&gt;\ntake some more with me&quot;. He felt like he was a point moving up w=\r\nith a &lt;br&gt;\ntremendous speed. At the same time, another person who was medit=\r\nating a &lt;br&gt;\nfew feet away in front of a homam fire felt like somebody was =\r\npulling &lt;br&gt;\nthat person forcibly through a cave and felt really overwhelme=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere are so many possible experiences. But the key point is th=\r\nat &lt;br&gt;\nexperiences are secondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIEN=\r\nT for &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progress. I had my share of experiences, progress and =\r\nsetbacks &lt;br&gt;\nand I am 100% sure of the above. You&#39;ll do well to remember t=\r\nhis &lt;br&gt;\nsentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences or desire the=\r\nm &lt;br&gt;\nconsciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little later on the=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\ngrave dangers of desiring experiences.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe say that god can b=\r\ne known only by experience and not by reading &lt;br&gt;\nbooks. That is not incor=\r\nrect. However, when one is deeply desirous of an &lt;br&gt;\nexperience, one may e=\r\nxperience an aspect of god&#39;s Delusory Power instead &lt;br&gt;\nof god and that ma=\r\ny increase false pride (a true experience of god will &lt;br&gt;\ninstead produce =\r\ninfinite humility). Not all experiences are equal.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere is a famo=\r\nus quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton of &lt;br&gt;\ntheory. Thoug=\r\nh that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of &lt;br&gt;\nexperience =\r\nis useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of &lt;br&gt;\ntheory may =\r\nactually be better if it actually reduces one&#39;s ego to a &lt;br&gt;\npound or an o=\r\nunce!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe issue is not whether one needs practical experience or t=\r\nheoretical &lt;br&gt;\nunderstanding. That is secondary. The primary thing is what=\r\n is happening &lt;br&gt;\nto one&#39;s ego. Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT i=\r\ns undoubtedly &lt;br&gt;\nthe main issue. If reading books, satsanga, rituals, the=\r\noretical &lt;br&gt;\nunderstanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal, from a =\r\nquintal to &lt;br&gt;\na pound and from a pound to an ounce, even without a direct=\r\n experience, &lt;br&gt;\nthat&#39;s awesome. That is better than getting a ton of expe=\r\nrience and ego &lt;br&gt;\nbeing inflated from a pound to a quintal.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThou=\r\ngh it is true that ego does not become complete zero without an &lt;br&gt;\n&quot;exper=\r\nience&quot; of god in the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that &lt;br&gt;\n&quot;experie=\r\nnce&quot; when one&#39;s ego is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce it &lt;br&gt;\nto as=\r\n small a quantity as you can. Experience of god will then come by &lt;br&gt;\nitse=\r\nlf.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn the famous Indian movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, there is a nice line: &quot;=\r\nDon&#39;t &lt;br&gt;\nchase success, but chase capability. Success will follow automat=\r\nically.&quot; &lt;br&gt;\nSimilarly, don&#39;t chase experiences, but chase detachment and =\r\ndeflation &lt;br&gt;\nof ego. Experience will automatically follow. Chasing experi=\r\nence without &lt;br&gt;\ntrying to reduce ego is like putting the cart before the =\r\nhorse. To use &lt;br&gt;\nthe analogy from the movie &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, one then runs the=\r\n risk of &lt;br&gt;\nbecoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Ramalingam (alias=\r\n Silencer) &lt;br&gt;\nof that movie, who chased success, ended up with huge ego f=\r\nrom limited &lt;br&gt;\nsuccess and failed in the end!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        =\r\n*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs said above, it is a bad =\r\nidea to seek an &quot;experience&quot; when one&#39;s ego &lt;br&gt;\nis still a ton or a quinta=\r\nl. In other words, when one&#39;s conditioning is &lt;br&gt;\ndense enough, a pre-occu=\r\npation with experiences can be &lt;br&gt;\ncounter-productive. The reason is that =\r\nany experience will be &lt;br&gt;\ninterpreted (and absorbed into one&#39;s system!!!)=\r\n through the color of &lt;br&gt;\none&#39;s conditioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf I go into the op=\r\nen and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see &lt;br&gt;\nthat Sun is orange.=\r\n But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass &lt;br&gt;\nwindows of a house. O=\r\nr suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through &lt;br&gt;\ngreen eyeglasses. In=\r\n either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am &lt;br&gt;\nexperiencing the real=\r\n Sun, but I will get the wrong knowledge that &quot;Sun &lt;br&gt;\nis green&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nSimilarly, even a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\ngenerate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one&#39;s conditioning is &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nconducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe key is not just to exper=\r\nience, but the ability to interpet, *digest* &lt;br&gt;\nand absorb the experience=\r\n into one&#39;s system well. One&#39;s conditioning &lt;br&gt;\ninfluences how one digests=\r\n various life experiences, including spiritual &lt;br&gt;\nexperiences and mystica=\r\nl experiences, like the green eye glasses in the &lt;br&gt;\nabove example!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn ayurve=\r\ndic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic &lt;br&gt;\nbuildup in=\r\n the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various &lt;br&gt;\ntissues=\r\n and create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look and &lt;br&gt;\nfeel =\r\nhealthy despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one &lt;br&gt;\ndeve=\r\nlops serious diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts &lt;br&gt;\no=\r\nf the body. The ama may even interfere with the digestion of good food &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nbeing taken in and the working of even medicines one may take in. When &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\ntoo much ama has accumulated and destabilizes the system, one may need &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nto go through a painful de-toxification process.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSimilarly, spi=\r\nritual experiences one cannot digest well become spiritual &lt;br&gt;\nama, a toxi=\r\nc buildup in the subtle system. It can slowly build up, get &lt;br&gt;\nabsorbed i=\r\nnto various aspects of one&#39;s being and create various diseases &lt;br&gt;\nin the =\r\nsubtle system. In the beginning, one may look and feel &lt;br&gt;\nspiritually hea=\r\nlthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritual &lt;br&gt;\nama accumulates=\r\n, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can &lt;br&gt;\neventually affec=\r\nt one&#39;s entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for &lt;br&gt;\nde-toxification)=\r\n may be far more difficult than the physical &lt;br&gt;\npancha-karma.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =\r\n       *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo illustrate =\r\nwhat I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a &lt;br&gt;\n*hypothetica=\r\nl* example.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSuppose someone sits still for a few hours everyday an=\r\nd meditates. &lt;br&gt;\nSuppose one starts to get some special inner experiences =\r\nand some &lt;br&gt;\nseemingly supernatural things start happening externally arou=\r\nnd one. &lt;br&gt;\nSuppose these experiences give one the impression that one is =\r\nspecial &lt;br&gt;\nand one is making excellent spiritual progress. Suppose one re=\r\nads some &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual books and fantasizes &quot;becoming like Shiva&quot; mentione=\r\nd in those &lt;br&gt;\nbooks. Then one may start to think &quot;may be, I have become l=\r\nike Shiva&quot; &lt;br&gt;\nand slowly convince oneself that one HAS become like Shiva.=\r\n Suppose one &lt;br&gt;\nreads a spiritual book that claims &quot;If one becomes like S=\r\nhiva, the whole &lt;br&gt;\nuniverse connives against one who causes an offense to=\r\n him&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOf course, there is a context behind every statement and no=\r\n statement is &lt;br&gt;\nabsolute. If one misses the nuances, one may digest and =\r\nabsorb it into &lt;br&gt;\none&#39;s system incorrectly. After all, one could have als=\r\no said, &quot;if one &lt;br&gt;\nbecomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully co-operat=\r\nes with one and &lt;br&gt;\nthere is no way anyone can really cause offense to tha=\r\nt person&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnyway, one in the process of convincing oneself that o=\r\nne has indeed &lt;br&gt;\nbecome like Shiva may then look for examples of someone =\r\ncausing offense &lt;br&gt;\nand suffering bad things. Of course, just as one can f=\r\nind any shapes in &lt;br&gt;\nclouds, one can find any correlations in things happ=\r\nening around one. &lt;br&gt;\nOne will find a few examples. That may reinforce the=\r\n delusion that one &lt;br&gt;\nhas become like Shiva. When good and bad happen to =\r\npeople around one, &lt;br&gt;\none may start correlating them to good and bad done=\r\n by those people to &lt;br&gt;\none and/or to things one has done. Over time, the =\r\ndelusion may become so &lt;br&gt;\ndeep that it just feels so natural and obvious.=\r\n This is like a serious &lt;br&gt;\ndisease developing from a toxic buildup of und=\r\nigested or badly digested &lt;br&gt;\nfood. Inability to fully understand the spir=\r\nitual experiences one had, &lt;br&gt;\nthe fantasy of becoming like Shiva, the pre=\r\n-exising pride (like &lt;br&gt;\npre-existing ama) and the not-so-well-digested no=\r\ntion that offense to &lt;br&gt;\nShiva causes harm, have together created spiritua=\r\nl ama buildup that now &lt;br&gt;\nresulted in a serious disease.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThough =\r\noriginal experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming &lt;br&gt;\nlater o=\r\nn MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from the &lt;br&gt;\nill-di=\r\ngested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is &lt;br&gt;\nconduciv=\r\ne to creating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of &lt;br&gt;\nthe sys=\r\ntem can spread to others.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs said before, the key issue is: Is the=\r\n ego getting inflated or &lt;br&gt;\ndeflated. If ego is getting inflated, then on=\r\ne is on the wrong track. &lt;br&gt;\nOne is either deluding oneself or ill-digesti=\r\nng genuine experiences due &lt;br&gt;\nto pre-existing conditioning and delusions =\r\n(spiritual ama). In either &lt;br&gt;\ncase, whatever one is experiencing is not b=\r\neing digested well and is &lt;br&gt;\nweakening the system instead of strengthenin=\r\ng it. If, on the other hand, &lt;br&gt;\nego is getting deflated, then one is on t=\r\nhe right track. Whatever one is &lt;br&gt;\nexperiencing is being digested well an=\r\nd strengthening the system.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSHAKTI, S=\r\nIDDHIS AND MIRACLES&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis emphasis on ego deflation may make some p=\r\neople wonder about the &lt;br&gt;\nprominence given in some books to accumulation =\r\nof shakti, siddhis and &lt;br&gt;\nmiracles. For example, some books describe what=\r\n a being like Shiva or &lt;br&gt;\nsomeone less but still with high enough shakti,=\r\n can do.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings close to enli=\r\nghtenment MAY &lt;br&gt;\nhave a lot of spiritual shakti and be able to do some sp=\r\necial things. &lt;br&gt;\nBut, no book said that you get those abilities by being =\r\nproud or &lt;br&gt;\npursuing something that can make one proud.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn fact,=\r\n if one looks at those abilities described in books and adores &lt;br&gt;\nthem fr=\r\nom one&#39;s *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is quite akin &lt;br&gt;\nto l=\r\nooking at a &quot;green Sun&quot; from green eyeglasses and admiring the &lt;br&gt;\ngreenne=\r\nss of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole point. &lt;br&gt;\nOne =\r\nwith dense conditioning can&#39;t even understand what that shakti or &lt;br&gt;\nabil=\r\nity really means or comes from. In order to understand what shakti &lt;br&gt;\nis,=\r\n to accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUST &lt;br&gt;\ndeflat=\r\ne one&#39;s ego.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBottomline is this: Most scriptures of most religions=\r\n are unanimous in &lt;br&gt;\nteaching the importance of humility, compassion and =\r\nego deflation. No &lt;br&gt;\nscripture talks about the glory of pride and ego inf=\r\nlation. It&#39;s as &lt;br&gt;\nsimple as that.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nGODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS &amp; CONVERSATIONS&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe encounter some peo=\r\nple who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses &lt;br&gt;\nand also conversat=\r\nions with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime &lt;br&gt;\ncoming from the =\r\ndivine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine &lt;br&gt;\nbeings supposed=\r\nly said is well within what one consciously or &lt;br&gt;\nsub-consciously already=\r\n knew or believed or wanted to believe.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis may remind one of the=\r\n encounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character &lt;br&gt;\nplayed by Sanjay Dutt i=\r\nn hit bollywood movie &quot;Lage Rahe Munnabhai&quot;. In &lt;br&gt;\nthat movie, the vision=\r\ns are due to &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; in Munnabhai&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\nmind and the Gandhi h=\r\ne sees and can talk to, cannot answer questions &lt;br&gt;\nthat Munnabhai himself=\r\n does not know (but real Gandhi should know). So &lt;br&gt;\nthe conclusion is tha=\r\nt the person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a &lt;br&gt;\ncharacter in his own mind =\r\nconstructed based on what Munnabhai &lt;br&gt;\nunderstands of Gandhi.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn=\r\n the case of divine encounters, it may be a little different from this &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nmovie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied meeting based on all &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nthat one consciously and sub-consciously knew already, OR it may be a &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nreal being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her actions are &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\ninterpreted strictly based on one&#39;s conditioning, like the &quot;green Sun&quot; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nin our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, what divine &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nbeings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one consciously or &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nsub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn=\r\n the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning having a &lt;br&gt;\nrea=\r\nl divine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mother or &lt;br&gt;\nfat=\r\nher, and there is a real flow of divine and sublime understanding and &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nwisdom.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAgain, the key is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nde-conditioned enough to really benefit from it!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        * =\r\n       *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nKUNDALINI AWAKENING &amp; RISE&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne more thing pe=\r\nople often talk about is Kundalini awakening and rise. &lt;br&gt;\nKundalini shakt=\r\ni is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this &lt;br&gt;\nis &quot;I&quot;). Kunda=\r\nlini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra means one does not &lt;br&gt;\neven questio=\r\nn who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties &lt;br&gt;\nself down=\r\n to the physical body and physical senses. However, &lt;br&gt;\nself-awareness ris=\r\ning above this does not necessarily mean spiritual &lt;br&gt;\nprogress or enlight=\r\nenment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of &lt;br&gt;\na long process. I=\r\nf one&#39;s conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle &lt;br&gt;\nideas of who one=\r\n is (e.g. I am a great spiritual soul who saved the &lt;br&gt;\nworld many times i=\r\nn the past and came back to save it), an awakened &lt;br&gt;\nKundalini may take o=\r\nne&#39;s notion of self beyond the physical body, but &lt;br&gt;\nwill get stuck somew=\r\nhere else. In fact, one&#39;s subtle notions of self may &lt;br&gt;\nbecome aggrandize=\r\nd when Kundalini reaches conducive regions and one may &lt;br&gt;\nexperience thin=\r\ngs that aggravate and strengthen those notions. One may &lt;br&gt;\nget badly stuc=\r\nk.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs mentioned above, any spiritual experience can create spiritu=\r\nal ama &lt;br&gt;\nwhen not digested properly. Any pre-existing conditioning may m=\r\nake it &lt;br&gt;\ndifficult to digest anything complex. Instead of eating a heavy=\r\n-duty &lt;br&gt;\nprotein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxic buildup in =\r\nthe &lt;br&gt;\nsystem, one is better off eating simple food that one&#39;s own system=\r\n can &lt;br&gt;\nprocess and digest well.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo be clear, whether one&#39;s Kund=\r\nalini is awakened or not, and where one&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\nKundalini is currently, is N=\r\nOT a measure of one&#39;s spiritual progress. As &lt;br&gt;\nKundalini does not rise t=\r\nhrough a single path, as the rise is not linear &lt;br&gt;\nand as the obstruction=\r\ns are not uniform in all people, one cannot &lt;br&gt;\ncompare two people based o=\r\nn Kundalini experiences.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne can cling to the body and overcome al=\r\nl conditioning slowly and &lt;br&gt;\noneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the=\r\n way to Sahasrara. Another &lt;br&gt;\nperson may awaken Kundalini and it may get =\r\nstuck somewhere where it is &lt;br&gt;\nextremely difficult to overcome the corres=\r\nponding conditioning.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe bottomline is that how much conditioning=\r\n is overcome and how reduced &lt;br&gt;\none&#39;s ego is is the correct measure of sp=\r\niritual progress and not &lt;br&gt;\nwhether Kundalini is awakened and where Kunda=\r\nlini is.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCORRELATIONS GALORE&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nDo not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or may &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nnot mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, &quot;wow, I was &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\njust thinking about you&quot;. Or suppose you say something and someone says,=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&quot;wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as though you rea=\r\nd &lt;br&gt;\nmy mind.&quot; Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings in some regio=\r\nn of &lt;br&gt;\nthe world, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad happen=\r\ned &lt;br&gt;\nthere. Or suppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did so=\r\nme &lt;br&gt;\nsadhana and the desire was fulfilled.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn several such case=\r\ns, correlating a result with something you did can &lt;br&gt;\noften increase prid=\r\ne and your sense of self-worth. And, doing that will &lt;br&gt;\nnot enable you to=\r\n do your dharma any better.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nKeep thinking your thoughts and desire=\r\ns, keep doing your actions and &lt;br&gt;\nkeep doing your sadhana. That&#39;s it. Don=\r\n&#39;t correlate actions and results &lt;br&gt;\nand think that you made X or Y result=\r\n happen. We engage in actions and &lt;br&gt;\ngod gives results. The sense of &quot;I m=\r\nade X happen&quot; is conducive to pride &lt;br&gt;\nand ego inflation. Moreover, you c=\r\nan *never* know *for sure* whether &lt;br&gt;\naction A or B caused result X or Y,=\r\n because the action-result pipeline &lt;br&gt;\nhas variable delay!! So, why even =\r\nbother to correlate and run the risk &lt;br&gt;\nof ego inflation?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*     =\r\n   *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBOTTOMLINE&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDon&#39;t run after special experien=\r\nces and special abilities or anything &lt;br&gt;\nthat makes you special (as you i=\r\nmagine currently, based on your dense &lt;br&gt;\nconditioning). Spiritual progres=\r\ns is not about becoming &quot;special&quot;, but &lt;br&gt;\nabout becoming humble. Special =\r\nexperiences and abilities do not matter &lt;br&gt;\nat all. In fact, they can dist=\r\nract one and give false pride. God makes &lt;br&gt;\none special AFTER one sheds p=\r\nride completely or almost completely.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAlso, stop correlating thing=\r\ns happening to or around you, with your &lt;br&gt;\nactions, and think that you ca=\r\nused events X or Y. Engaging in actions is &lt;br&gt;\nyour sacred duty and giving=\r\n whatever results are fit at a given time is &lt;br&gt;\ngod&#39;s prerogative. That i=\r\ns the simplest and safest model one can imbibe &lt;br&gt;\nin one&#39;s thinking.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nRemember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful measure of &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nspiritual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble you become &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have really become=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\ninternally). It is how well you are able to resist the temptations of=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nfollowing the voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and how=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nwell you can follow the voice of conscience.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen inflations=\r\n in ego occur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice &lt;br&gt;\nit, bring it t=\r\no the attention and perhaps even be ruthless in belling &lt;br&gt;\nthe cat [of eg=\r\no]. But most gurus now-a-days may not do that well. So, &lt;br&gt;\nyou have to do=\r\n your best to avoid any serious ego inflations.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUnfortunately, the=\r\n path of spiritual progress and self-realization IS &lt;br&gt;\nvery very very lik=\r\nely for most of us to include many many many &lt;br&gt;\nopportunities for very ve=\r\nry very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict &lt;br&gt;\nwatch on your ego.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf I offended anybody with some strong a=\r\nssertions in this email, my &lt;br&gt;\napologies.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOm Tat Sat.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nK=\r\nrishnarapanamstu,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyo=\r\ntish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                   &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n      Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      =\r\nSpirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n   Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;\n----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1411505736-1839098891-1330529788=:55868--\r\n\n"}}
