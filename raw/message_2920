Subsequently, He says t=\r\nhat He Himself is the\n=91doer=92, the =91doing=92 and the =91deed=92 (karta=\r\n, karma and karyam); though =91doing=92\n(karma) is the most important of th=\r\ne three, it is ineffectual by itself\n(jadam). If this is so, then everythin=\r\ng depends upon the =91doer=92, who is\nIshwara. Why when He first created =\r\n=91doing=92 (karma), did He create different\nkarmas for different people? I=\r\nt is said that afterwards everyone is made to\nfunction according to his kar=\r\nma. How did this difference come about in the\nvery beginning? How did it ar=\r\nise? Not only that, if everything is left to\nthe =91doing=92 and to the =91=\r\ndoer=92 who is Ishwara, where does personal effort\n(purushakaram) come in? =\r\nIf there is no personal effort, why is it said that\nwe ourselves must attai=\r\nn Realization? What does it mean?=94\n\nBhagavan said,=93Who is it that is as=\r\nking? To whom has this doubt arisen? Why\nhas it arisen? First think that ov=\r\ner and find out.=94\n\nThe devotee: =93Swami, I am only enquiring why Lord Kr=\r\nishna said that.=94\n\nBhagavan: =93That is what I am referring to. What exac=\r\ntly did Lord Krishna\ntell Arjuna? He told him, the deed will get done accor=\r\nding to the =91doing=92. I\nam the =91doer=92 watching the whole thing from =\r\nabove. Why do you worry? It is\nyour body which does the killing of your rel=\r\natives. Are you the body?\n\nNo! Why then this bondage for you? Renounce the =\r\nidea, He said. This means\nthat He asks Arjuna to do the thing but to give u=\r\np the feeling that it is he\nthat is doing it. That is personal effort.\n\nThe=\r\n feeling that one is, or is not, the body, comes from one=92s own\nignorance=\r\n. One only has to give up that feeling; that which one has, one\nmust onesel=\r\nf reject. Who else can do it? If by personal effort that bondage\nis removed=\r\n,action, under the orders of the =91doer=92, Ishwara, goes on of its\nown ac=\r\ncord.\n\nEvery one has his work allotted to him and he will do it automatical=\r\nly. Why\nshould one worry? Arjuna, when he felt that it was not proper to ki=\r\nll his\nrelatives, was only told to give up the feeling that he was the =91d=\r\noer=92, yet\nit was Arjuna himself who ultimately fought.By listening to the=\r\n Gita, he\nlost the feeling of being the =91doer=92 and the doubt he had had=\r\n was no longer\nthere.\n\nThe work had to be done with that particular body, a=\r\nnd it was done. Even\nDuryodhana was like that. Not that he was not aware of=\r\n the correctness or\notherwise of what he was doing. He knew that what he wa=\r\ns doing was not\nright, but some force was leading him on to that work. What=\r\n could he do?\nThat work had to be done in that way by that body, and it was=\r\n done. He is\nreported to have said so at the time of his death. Hence it is=\r\n clear that\nsome Force is making all people to do things. Getting rid of th=\r\ne feeling\nthat =91I myself am doing=92 is personal effort (purushakaram). A=\r\nll spiritual\npractices (sadhanas) are towards that end.=94\n\nAnother devotee=\r\n: =93That is all right. For this karma there must be a\nbeginning, but how i=\r\nt began, no one has mentioned.=94\n\nBhagavan: =93Yes, but it is the same thi=\r\nng. If you are asked =91how did you get\nthis?=92 you say you have got it by=\r\n =91doing=92 (karma). How were you born? By\n=91doing=92 (karma) that is all=\r\n that could be said. If, however, you ask how was\nthis karma born, you are =\r\ntold you should not ask such questions.\n\nThis is known as the Law of the se=\r\ned and the tree (bija ankura nyayam). The\ntree is born of the seed; again f=\r\nrom the tree a seed is born. Where is the\norigin of that seed? That is a qu=\r\nestion which you are told is not to be\nasked. What can we say to that? That=\r\n is why I always ask people to find out\nfirst how they were born and where =\r\nthey were born.=94\n\nO Arjuna, the Lord dwells in the heart of all beings wh=\r\no are mounted upon\nthe automation of this body, causing them by His illusiv=\r\ne power to spin\nround according to their actions.\n\n-- Gita XVIII: 61\n\nSeek =\r\nrefuge in Him alone, with all your being, O Arjuna!
