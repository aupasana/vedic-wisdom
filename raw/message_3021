That is maintained as Supramental tra=\r\nnsformation, where not just the consciousness is established at once in bot=\r\nh the Absolute and the relative but all other grosser levels of existences =\r\nincluding the body &quot;transform&quot; and become direct manifestation of the absol=\r\nute without any distortions as is currently the case. People took some of h=\r\nis words on physical transformation or bodily immortality out of context an=\r\nd misrepresented this as Sri Aurobindo wanting physical immortality in the =\r\nordinary sense of the term, etc. \n\nAnyways, all of this is mental concepts =\r\nto me right now, and I will sign off this thread.\n\nRegards,\n-Siva.\n\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namast=\r\ne Hari,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Samaadhi is sam+aa+dhi. It is a state of intense mental conce=\r\nntration on something.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kalpa means create or perceive (the word kalpa=\r\nna is from the same root). Vikalpa means existence of variety. Savikalpa me=\r\nans &quot;with vikalpa&quot;. Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense concentration o=\r\nf the mind, while creational variety or objectification still exists in the=\r\n mind. One perceives that there is an &quot;I&quot; and there are &quot;other&quot; objects (e.=\r\ng. deities, demons, people etc). But one is able to focus the mind intensel=\r\ny on one object (e.g. a deity) and able to achieve oneness with that object=\r\n. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and many great yogi=\r\ns also cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In nirvikalpa samadhi, the=\r\n creational variety and objectification ceases (nirvikalpa=3Dnir+vikalpa, n=\r\nir=3Ddevoid of). Mind reaches a state where there is no perception of I and=\r\n &quot;other&quot; objects. One&#39;s consciousness is absorbed in supreme consciousness =\r\n(Brahman or Aatman), without any perception of a variety of objects. This s=\r\ntate is reached by very very few yogis.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sahaja samadhi is a state whe=\r\nre the mind is *simultaneously* perceiving a variety of objects *and* absor=\r\nbed in the supreme consciousness!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one =\r\nis normally perceiving a variety objects, one&#39;s mind is absorbed in an *ind=\r\nividualized* consciousness that is colored with the conditioning of that in=\r\ndividual&#39;s experiences over various lives. When one sees a beautiful person=\r\n, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts (depending on the experiences, values=\r\n and desires accumulated from many lives). When somebody is praising one, o=\r\nne&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts. When somebody is criticizing one, one&#39;s=\r\n mind may get certain thoughts. And so on. One&#39;s mind has likes, dislikes, =\r\nattractions, repulsions etc, based on the accumulated experiences, values a=\r\nnd desires of that individualized consciousness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In sahaja samadhi, o=\r\nne has no individualized consciousness and one&#39;s mind is absorbed in the in=\r\nfinite supreme consciousness that is not colored by the experiences and con=\r\nditioning of a single individual. One is actively living in the material wo=\r\nrld; one&#39;s mind is perceiving various objects of various attributes through=\r\n jnanendriyas; and, one&#39;s mind is engaging in various actions in the materi=\r\nal world though karmendriyas. Yet, one has no individualized conditioning o=\r\nr I-ness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Very very very few beings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis=\r\n and gods, can reach that state. For most others, that state is not really =\r\na possibility.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I gave an analogy earlier to=\r\n explain various aspects of consciousness, using parts of a computer.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n ahamkaara (I-ness) - CPU\n&gt; chitta (conditioning) - DRAM\n&gt; buddhi - ALU or =\r\nlogic coprocessor\n&gt; manas - I/O controller\n&gt; jnanendriyas - input channels\n=\r\n&gt; karmendriyas - output channels\n&gt; praanas - on-board power supply\n&gt; deha (=\r\nbody) - mechanical parts, chassis etc\n&gt;  \n&gt; Normally, CPU is running a comp=\r\nlex program where a lot of input channels and output channels are active. D=\r\nRAM has a lot of stored data and CPU is refreshing it frequently. ALU is ru=\r\nnning several algorithms based on stored data and a lot of I/O data gets st=\r\nored/retrieved from DRAM all the time. This is analogous to a person&#39;s norm=\r\nal state.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a state where the computer is in=\r\n a power standby. On-board power supply is hardly supplying any power, all =\r\ninput and output channels are turned off, I/O controller is turned off and =\r\nALU is not running any algorithms. If a computer goes into power standy and=\r\n exits it quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. Similarly, a pe=\r\nrson reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly will resume previou=\r\ns activities. If a computer stays in the power standby for too long, it wil=\r\nl be turned off and its state may be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one st=\r\nays in nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, one will simply merge in Brahman an=\r\nd cannot resume previous activities.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sahaja samadhi is akin to a comp=\r\nuter running a bare minimum program that accesses a program running on a ce=\r\nntral super computer on a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are running on a ce=\r\nntral super computer and our individual computer&#39;s CPU simply has a small r=\r\noutine that accesses the results of the algorithm running on the super comp=\r\nuter and controls the local I/O controller accordingly. There isn&#39;t much da=\r\nta stored locally and there is no algorithm running locally. One&#39;s praanas =\r\nare supplying power, one&#39;s jnanendriyas are getting inputs and one&#39;s karmen=\r\ndriyas are engaging in actions, one&#39;s manas is controlling this Input/Ouput=\r\n activity and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by running a small pro=\r\ngram that accesses a super computer that is monitoring all the computers of=\r\n the world and deciding what this computer should do.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt;  \n&gt; As I said, very very very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi an=\r\nd it is beyond the reach of even the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis =\r\ncannot even reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come b=\r\nack to regular consciousness after a while and start to accumulate conditio=\r\nning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM). The CPU is running some program or the othe=\r\nr, however small, and accumulating more data in DRAM and building up an alg=\r\norithm in ALU. Minimization of I-ness is possible, but elimination of I-nes=\r\ns while embodied is very difficult! If any limited I-ness is left and any c=\r\nonditioning (I am this, I need this, I like this etc) is left, then it is N=\r\nOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja samadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness an=\r\nd connecting the supreme universal I-ness directly to one&#39;s mind and body.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; I cannot make judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my bus=\r\niness. I will take on individuals only when they interfere with my dharma a=\r\nnd my sense of dharma dictates that I should take them on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But the bo=\r\nttomline is that sahaja samadhi state is no joke and only yogis of an absol=\r\nutely tremendous caliber reach it. Those who reach this state are like the =\r\ngod - supreme cosmic being - himself.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let m=\r\ne give another analogy. This life is like a long dream. Saviklapa samadhi i=\r\ns like wakig up *within* the dream. Nirvikalpa samadhi is like waking up fr=\r\nom the dream. Sahaja samadhi is like being in the dream and yet being awake=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This may confuse people, but this analogy shows how complex and dif=\r\nficult sahaja samadhi is. The previous computer analogy highlights how thin=\r\ngs work in a sahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how difficult it is.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Fr=\r\nee Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is sahaja samadhi and how is it different from nirvikalpa samad=\r\nhi?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; best regards\n&gt; &gt; Hari\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Ravishankar is a full=\r\ny Enlightened Master living in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sahaj Samadhi all times.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
