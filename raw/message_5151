The \nonly major point where I di=\r\nsagree is whether one can do Sri Sri Chandi path \n*without initiation*. The=\r\n rest of the confusion on translation of mantras needs \nsome clarification =\r\nas there seems to be some unnecessary confusion. A few \npointers:\n\n1. There=\r\n are various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas \netc.=\r\n Broadly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras=\r\n, \nkavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahamantras=\r\n and \nmantras. The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantr=\r\nas.\n\n2. Undoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the original.=\r\n Reading a \ntranslation is not even comparable to chanting the original cha=\r\nnt. So far it is \nfine.\n\n3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based=\r\n on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes \na distinction between them.\n\n4. As per the =\r\ntraditional view one doesn&#39;t need to be initiated to chant a \nstotra or dhy=\r\nanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras \ncontaining bijak=\r\nsharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need \ninitiation. This is=\r\n the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not \nthe same as t=\r\nhese other mantras that need initiation, which are generally \nreferred to a=\r\ns Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the \nactual idea =\r\nis that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct \nspiritual =\r\nspecialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such \nas Ka=\r\nli or Sri.\n\n5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do no=\r\nt need initiation \nas they fall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasrana=\r\nma and Devi Mahatmyam \nare traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or pa=\r\nrts of puranas. They have a \nlarger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya=\r\n sadhana. Chanting them without \ninitiation is not recommended especially w=\r\nhen the reader combines the navarna or \nshodashi mantras too as an integral=\r\n part of the chanting.\n\n6. I know from personal interaction that acharyas b=\r\nelonging to both Kanchi as \nwell as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiatio=\r\nn for both the sadhanas of Sri \nSri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their r=\r\nespective NAVAKSHARI AND \nSHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INT=\r\nEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the \nsadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold t=\r\nhat one needs to be initiated \nto chant the Navarna as well as shodashaksha=\r\nri mantras.\n\n7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text=\r\n that has an \nindependent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is si=\r\nmultaneously a \nMahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the =\r\nspirit of the \nUpanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral =\r\npart of Sri Sri \nChandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be =\r\ninitiated to chant it. \nHowever if one wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Veda=\r\nnta or Sacred myth aspects of \nthe Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myt=\r\nh in the vernacular has been \nrecommended in my write-up, as chanting the o=\r\nriginal along with the navakshari \namounts to practicing the sadhana of a M=\r\nahavidya. In that case it is recommended \nto be initiated and go through th=\r\ne specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.\n\n8. Arguably if an uninitia=\r\nted person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original \nSanskrit as part of th=\r\ne *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an \ninherent problem i=\r\nn our times. The problem with attempting to do a parayana of \nDevi Mahatmya=\r\nm from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers \ninadvertently=\r\n end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the \nSiddhakunj=\r\nika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.\n\n9. I you carefully peruse m=\r\ny write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, \nnowhere do I put dow=\r\nn the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I \nattempted to write a =\r\ncommentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the \npower of the ori=\r\nginal mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know \nthe essenc=\r\ne or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. \nInfac=\r\nt `artha&#39; is the import, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a translation! \n\n\n10. Fo=\r\nr those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, \nther=\r\ne is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain level of \ns=\r\namskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. \nOth=\r\nerwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please keep =\r\n\ndoing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana. A=\r\ns \nNarasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the sadha=\r\nna \nWITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself will re=\r\nduce a \nlot of the potential problem. Things will happen on their own accor=\r\nd in the \nnatural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess. \n\n\nHop=\r\ne the above pointers help in clearing any confusion. \n\nRegards,\nSatya Praka=\r\nsh \n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, h ramalingam &lt;hramalinga=\r\nm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; I want to share one anecdote happened=\r\n in front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri\n&gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamig=\r\nal\n&gt; When Swamigal was staying in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One day a=\r\nll the\n&gt; learned persons male and female alike\n&gt; requested Swamigal to tran=\r\nslate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in kannada language\n&gt; so that they can chant =\r\nknowing the meaning fully.\n&gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which wa=\r\ns made early in the morning.\n&gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc we=\r\nre over as usual Postman came to\n&gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi=\r\n Mutt Swamigal. Swamigal was\n&gt; seriously looking at the cover\n&gt; in front of=\r\n the learned members and was looking at one line written as PIN\n&gt; Code and =\r\nfollowed by six numbers. Then he asked the learned members to\n&gt; explain the=\r\n meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell that. But everyone\n&gt; understood =\r\nthe significance of that number. Then swamigal asked his crew\n&gt; member to p=\r\nick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his library and read\n&gt; the meani=\r\nng as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that even the meaning\n&gt; of PIN=\r\nCode was not known to the group and still it serves the purpose and\n&gt; peopl=\r\ne are using it in day to day work. Similarly not knowing the meaning of\n&gt; V=\r\nishnu Saharanamam will not take away the benefits of chanting the stothsram=\r\n\n&gt; was he told the group. Hope the above incidence bring some clue to our\n&gt;=\r\n discussion forum\n&gt; RamanaPatham\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Oct 26, 2010 at 9:10 PM=\r\n, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Girish,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I am not at all against knowing the meaning, so that one can immerse\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nneself in what one is chanting. That is definitely the ideal situation.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; If that is not possible, what I am saying is that reading something\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; composed by an elevated being even without understanding the meaning is v=\r\nery\n&gt; &gt; useful. Suppose someone does not understand what Ganapathi Atharvas=\r\neersham\n&gt; &gt; means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; everything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. On=\r\ne can\n&gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, it =\r\nis more\n&gt; &gt; likely because one does not have the correct attitude and surre=\r\nnder and\n&gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the specific meaning of Gan=\r\napathi\n&gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the meaning and chanting ma=\r\ny also\n&gt; &gt; experience nothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realized soul=\r\n have meanings at many layers and\n&gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one superfici=\r\nal layer. Some important layers are\n&gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most impor=\r\ntant layers of meaning are never\n&gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but only ex=\r\nperienced internally.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning or not, chant th=\r\ne mantra with a calm and\n&gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. =\r\nMany people keep a target\n&gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it mechanical=\r\nly with a sense of duty. If it\n&gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love a=\r\nnd surrender to the deity, it can do\n&gt; &gt; something. The key to success with=\r\n a mantra is calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands o=\r\nf thoughts and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; one of those thousand act=\r\nivities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts\n&gt; &gt; subside and mind is esse=\r\nntially reverberating with a mantra, that is when\n&gt; &gt; one experiences a man=\r\ntra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical =\r\nvibration is\n&gt; &gt; accompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, th=\r\ne thoughts and\n&gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. S=\r\nome mantras composed\n&gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentiall=\r\ny beings with very stable\n&gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such that the ph=\r\nysical vibration of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; can eventually cause the corresponding i=\r\nmagery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; &gt; when other mental activity subsides. T=\r\nhus, after repeating the mantra and\n&gt; &gt; calming the mind down, you can recr=\r\neate a certain imagery and thought system\n&gt; &gt; in your mind. That can perman=\r\nently alter the way your mind workd. But the\n&gt; &gt; key is to attain a reasona=\r\nbly stable, focused and calm mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi inter=\r\npretation of BhagavadGita and Sant\n&gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a=\r\n power of their own, as they were\n&gt; &gt; realized souls. In comparison, for ex=\r\namplle, Satyadevaashtakam composed by\n&gt; &gt; me, though in metrical Sanskrit, =\r\nwill not have a similar power.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; rit=\r\nual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: =\r\n\n&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- Girish Shahapurkar &lt;geniusgirish=\r\n@...&lt;geniusgirish%40yahoo.co.in&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Would it=\r\n not be of immense help to the ordinary person whose knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; Sansk=\r\nrit is limited not only to &quot;understand&quot; what he says but also take more\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n interest, enjoyment, and truly get immersed in what he is reciting/ readin=\r\ng?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the reason for the great saints like Sant Dnyanesh=\r\nwar to\n&gt; &gt; compose the Bhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I agree with=\r\n you that the sacred stotras should be recited in\n&gt; &gt; sanskrit...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hum=\r\nbly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Girish Shahapurkar\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 26/10/10, Narasimha P=\r\nVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha =\r\nPVR Rao &lt;pvr@... &lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Transla=\r\ntions, Initiation, Vedic vs Tantrik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com =\r\n&lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 26 October, 2010, 2:5=\r\n3 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will give my 2 cents on a f=\r\new points.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I once wanted to translate Devi Sa=\r\nptashati into my mother tongue Telugu\n&gt; &gt; in poetic form, so that Telugu pe=\r\nople who find Saptashati too complicated to\n&gt; &gt; read or feel uncomfortable =\r\nbecause they do not know the meaning, can read\n&gt; &gt; the Telugu version inste=\r\nad. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me.\n&gt; &gt; He asked me, &quot;who d=\r\no you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be considered\n&gt; &gt; later, but fi=\r\nrmly told me to drop the idea for then.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please note=\r\n that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting\n&gt; &gt; mantras =\r\nand prayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they\n&gt; &gt; mea=\r\nn. They are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nstorehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used the=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; in the past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An intellectual understanding ma=\r\ny help facilitate the right mood, right\n&gt; &gt; frame of mind and right imagery=\r\n. But, even without it, a mantra that was\n&gt; &gt; used by great sadhakas, yogis=\r\n and rishis holds power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the words of a ri=\r\nshi that one cannot intellectually understand\n&gt; &gt; can be more effective for=\r\n spiritual progress, than the words of a normal\n&gt; &gt; person that one can int=\r\nellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest\n&gt; &gt; not worrying about=\r\n whether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; mantras coming fro=\r\nm great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsm=\r\nan may\n&gt; &gt; read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to se=\r\ne the ball\n&gt; &gt; from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into =\r\nthe line of the\n&gt; &gt; ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play =\r\nfront foot and when\n&gt; &gt; to play back foot etc. But that does not necessaril=\r\ny make one a good\n&gt; &gt; batsman. If one practices, THAT can make one a good p=\r\nlayer. Of course, some\n&gt; &gt; basic understanding of principles is needed. But=\r\n, above that, practice is\n&gt; &gt; more important than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in =\r\nspirituality\n&gt; &gt; also, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, al=\r\nl paths is\n&gt; &gt; very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions that =\r\nwe are doing\n&gt; &gt; things and realize that the divine acts through all of us.=\r\n The divine acts\n&gt; &gt; through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and giv=\r\nes corresponding\n&gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overco=\r\nmes the notions of &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dis=\r\nlike that&quot; etc. Though this\n&gt; &gt; is the essence of all scriptures and one kn=\r\nows it, one may be deluded again\n&gt; &gt; and again. There is no magic formula t=\r\no internalize this understanding fully\n&gt; &gt; and overcome the instincts of &quot;I=\r\n am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if one pra=\r\nctices a mantra that one does not intellectually\n&gt; &gt; understand, that is ok=\r\n. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at the\n&gt; &gt; back of one&#39;s mi=\r\nnd, one is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; own thought=\r\ns and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; &gt; will y=\r\nield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is=\r\n why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read\n&gt; &gt; scripture=\r\ns and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically\n&gt; &gt; or v=\r\nirtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n a theoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understand=\r\ning of what is\n&gt; &gt; what and what we want, is like a blind person running ar=\r\nound a mountain,\n&gt; &gt; instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but hav=\r\ning an excellent\n&gt; &gt; theoretical understanfing, is like a person who knows =\r\nthat he needs to climb\n&gt; &gt; the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle =\r\ninstead of climbing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Regarding the statement that initiation is important in tantric path but=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nontinuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one=\r\n&#39;s attitude and\n&gt; &gt; what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material res=\r\nults needs to be\n&gt; &gt; careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement o=\r\nf karmas to affect a\n&gt; &gt; particular result is not easy. It requires supervi=\r\nsion of a good guru and\n&gt; &gt; not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if=\r\n one is NOT looking for\n&gt; &gt; specific material results and is looking for sp=\r\niritual progress, the\n&gt; &gt; constraints are fewer and options more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some may sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path is =\r\nfor begetting\n&gt; &gt; specific material results and Vedic path is for self-real=\r\nization. That is\n&gt; &gt; incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant =\r\nManyu sooktam for\n&gt; &gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevit=\r\ny, and so on.\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substa=\r\nnce in an elaborate\n&gt; &gt; ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman=\r\n&quot; and to remove the\n&gt; &gt; mental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are =\r\nlooking for a specific material result,\n&gt; &gt; you need clear guidance and sup=\r\nervision, which not many are capable of\n&gt; &gt; giving today! Instead, if you w=\r\nant spiritual progress and an increase of\n&gt; &gt; your surrender, you can just =\r\nkeep doing sadhana without initiation or\n&gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep company of=\r\n scriptures and other like-minded people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After all=\r\n, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise\n&gt; &gt; directions =\r\nand some supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; &gt; can kee=\r\np walking towards north. Of course, having supervision helps there\n&gt; &gt; too,=\r\n but you can do without it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicas=\r\ntrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: \n&gt;http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedi=\r\nc_pathak@... &lt;vedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste S=\r\natya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non=\r\n-initiate to read in English or any\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other regional language is because=\r\n understanding the meaning and &gt;constant\n&gt; &gt; reflection are possible only w=\r\nhen one repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a\n&gt; &gt; language that they can fully fo=\r\nllow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its u=\r\nnderstandable.

Since\n&gt; &gt; the last 4-5 years I have preferred to =\r\nstay away from internet forums due to\n&gt; &gt; various reasons. It has been near=\r\nly a year since I interacted on an internet\n&gt; &gt; forum. However after Narasi=\r\nmha garu forwarded a copy of the original post\n&gt; &gt; with my write up to my i=\r\nnbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed\n&gt; &gt; through some posts. I am=\r\n happy to note that the general atmosphere here is\n&gt; &gt; far better and more =\r\nsincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly\n&gt; &gt; browsed through this=\r\n particular thread, I thought that I might reply to\n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji&#39;s question=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important ques=\r\ntion regarding the necessity\n&gt; &gt; of initiation. I will address it after sum=\r\nmarizing the big picture that\n&gt; &gt; needs to be invoked in order to understan=\r\nd the ONE question and the MANY\n&gt; &gt; answers possible. Firstly is the questi=\r\non a general or specific one?\n&gt; &gt; Generally speaking if the question is whe=\r\nther initiation is an absolute\n&gt; &gt; requirement for spiritual life or sadhan=\r\na, *my* answer is- NO. However if\n&gt; &gt; the question is about the necessity o=\r\nf being initiated for mantra sadhana as\n&gt; &gt; enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the=\r\n answer is =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde mat=\r\nir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the\n&gt; &gt; necessity for multipl=\r\ne approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the\n&gt; &gt; inevitability of multi=\r\nple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are\n&gt; &gt; many paths for sa=\r\ndhana. But in the current context of this question I will\n&gt; &gt; restrict myse=\r\nlf to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. Y=\r\noga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma =\r\nmarga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the grea=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES par=\r\nticular\n&gt; &gt; methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstr=\r\nact truths at\n&gt; &gt; an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predomi=\r\nnant methods/\n&gt; &gt; techniques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; speaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct=\r\n path\n&gt; &gt; of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vic=\r\nhara\n&gt; &gt; (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the =\r\nVaidik\n&gt; &gt; system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regul=\r\nar\n&gt; &gt; self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these prac=\r\ntices\n&gt; &gt; involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for external=\r\n practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhya=\r\nsa (self-coaching by consistent\n&gt; &gt; practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity =\r\nor Non-attachment). Hindu schools of\n&gt; &gt; Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswar=\r\napranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards\n&gt; &gt; the Supreme Iswara) too while B=\r\nauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga\n&gt; &gt; emphasise only the first two as th=\r\ney subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti =\r\nmarga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of\n&gt; &gt; Iswara&#39;s w=\r\nill through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the\n&gt; &gt; emphasi=\r\ns in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt; &gt; Engagi=\r\nng in actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay of\n&gt; &gt; Karm=\r\na marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will add=\r\nress the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where\n&gt; &gt; alone the inevitable nece=\r\nssity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a\n&gt; &gt; Guru arises. Mantra =\r\nsadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult\n&gt; &gt; truths via the =\r\nenergetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It\n&gt; &gt; presupposes certa=\r\nin dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby\n&gt; &gt; certain regulatio=\r\nns and safe practices. It should be remembered that except\n&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga=\r\n most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti\n&gt; &gt; predomi=\r\nnantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old\n&gt; &gt; `Agni-Someeya=\r\nm&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs\n&gt; &gt; the fir=\r\ne of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of\n&gt; &gt; aus=\r\nterity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the=\r\n fire of Vak through\n&gt; &gt; the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra =\r\nemploys highly powerful\n&gt; &gt; techniques that bring results more quickly it l=\r\nays great emphasis on\n&gt; &gt; adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but mor=\r\ne about qualification.\n&gt; &gt; Would you allow a child to experiment with fire =\r\nwithout any supervision?\n&gt; &gt; Does the supervisor need experience and traini=\r\nng or not? Like any other lab\n&gt; &gt; experiment proper training and experience=\r\n are part of the procedure apart\n&gt; &gt; from certain safety measures, in the T=\r\nantric lab experiment too. However the\n&gt; &gt; lab is one&#39;s own consciousness w=\r\nhilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti\n&gt; &gt; within the individual consc=\r\niousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti).\n&gt; &gt; As this is not a topic =\r\nfor mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from\n&gt; &gt; further discussion on=\r\n the Kundalini. Without going into other needless\n&gt; &gt; details here, I will =\r\njust elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextuali=\r\nse\n&gt; &gt; it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major=\r\n river\n&gt; &gt; within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the enti=\r\nre Sakta\n&gt; &gt; sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three maj=\r\nor schools\n&gt; &gt; that are full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaV=\r\nidyas- Kalikula,\n&gt; &gt; Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs t=\r\no Kalikula whilst Sri\n&gt; &gt; Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make th=\r\ne picture more complete the\n&gt; &gt; Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have tak=\r\nen to Tarakula. To those who are\n&gt; &gt; familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will =\r\ndraw attention to the the 21 forms of\n&gt; &gt; Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares b=\r\noth the Advaitic outlook as well as the\n&gt; &gt; Sakta sadhanas in its approach =\r\nto sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* i=\r\nnvokes Agni (not that Soma is not\n&gt; &gt; invoked at all) while Sri kula predom=\r\ninantly invokes Soma, at least at the\n&gt; &gt; major milestones in the internal =\r\nspiritual journey. The yantra, mantra,\n&gt; &gt; bija, devata, etc are all consis=\r\ntently of a particular set of synchronistic\n&gt; &gt; frequencies for each of the=\r\nse three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; entry of the practiti=\r\noner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path\n&gt; &gt; (kula). The Guru =\r\nparampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA\n&gt; &gt; himself at the =\r\nroot from where the trunk arises. Each branch and\n&gt; &gt; sub-branches and twig=\r\ns spread out progressively downward till the individual\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka. It is =\r\na beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern\n&gt; &gt; metaphor t=\r\nhat one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric\n&gt; &gt; advoc=\r\nate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the\n&gt; &gt; co=\r\nnduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many\n&gt; &gt; beau=\r\ntiful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires,=\r\n where\n&gt; &gt; there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice al=\r\nl the way up\n&gt; &gt; till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa=\r\n) and Sound\n&gt; &gt; (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; individual consciousness through an integrated approach that combin=\r\nes the\n&gt; &gt; practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikul=\r\na and\n&gt; &gt; Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrated app=\r\nroaches\n&gt; &gt; that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chand=\r\ni seemingly\n&gt; &gt; starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a ful=\r\nl-fledged\n&gt; &gt; Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simult=\r\naneously a text\n&gt; &gt; on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of =\r\ninitiation is\n&gt; &gt; relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus=\r\n employing the text\n&gt; &gt; as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the te=\r\nxt as a yogasastra, the\n&gt; &gt; esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have =\r\ncovered extensively in my\n&gt; &gt; write-up. For those who are already inclined =\r\nto the Advaitic path, Sri Sri\n&gt; &gt; Chandi provides the context for immensely=\r\n powerful reflections through its\n&gt; &gt; central message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Oneness. The=\r\n crest jewel, the crowning glory in the text is the\n&gt; &gt; Mahavakya wherein t=\r\nhe Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic\n&gt; &gt; fashion that She =\r\nis one without a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in this\n&gt; &gt; universe. Who el=\r\nse is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other\n&gt; &gt; Mahavakyas o=\r\nf the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in Eng=\r\nlish or any\n&gt; &gt; other regional language is because understanding the meanin=\r\ng and constant\n&gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads t=\r\nhe text in a\n&gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the =\r\nwriteup is to\n&gt; &gt; explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart =\r\nfrom its obvious\n&gt; &gt; status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also =\r\nequally regarded as\n&gt; &gt; Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four=\r\n hymns. In that regard\n&gt; &gt; all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda=\r\n Samhita are equally\n&gt; &gt; possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practic=\r\ne of Chandi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; &gt; Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic m=\r\nethod will straightaway\n&gt; &gt; identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic pract=\r\nice. In fact even the worship\n&gt; &gt; of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is ful=\r\nly based on and DERIVED from a one\n&gt; &gt; on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala=\r\n with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some pr=\r\nactitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri\n&gt; &gt; Sri Chandi sadhana =\r\nin accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those\n&gt; &gt; who adhere to th=\r\ne Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra\n&gt; &gt; marga. It is th=\r\nis particular approach that needs initiation as per its own\n&gt; &gt; principles.=\r\n Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of\n&gt; &gt; Viveka =\r\nand Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the\n&gt; &gt; Pau=\r\nranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise\n&gt; &gt; Ho=\r\nmam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for =\r\nthose\n&gt; &gt; paths, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any =\r\nof the\n&gt; &gt; merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vich=\r\nara,\n&gt; &gt; Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, =\r\nHoma etc\n&gt; &gt; are all effective. However depending on the individual tempera=\r\nment, aptitude\n&gt; &gt; etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively t=\r\no different\n&gt; &gt; practitioners. One may progress through a combination of an=\r\ny of these\n&gt; &gt; methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integr=\r\nated approach of\n&gt; &gt; KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big pi=\r\ncture against which\n&gt; &gt; the answer to the question has to be contextualised=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective o=\r\nf the method and path,\n&gt; &gt; SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective m=\r\nethods for all of us.\n&gt; &gt; Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed=\r\n by reflection on the\n&gt; &gt; truths expounded in the texts. This is best done =\r\nin a language that one is\n&gt; &gt; fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is=\r\n the FIRST AND BEST choice\n&gt; &gt; among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternat=\r\ne method (though not as\n&gt; &gt; powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It i=\r\ns Satsangha and satsangha\n&gt; &gt; alone that enables one to make rapid progress=\r\n in spiritual life. Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by =\r\nvirtue of serving, listening\n&gt; &gt; to and spending time in the company of sad=\r\nhus and sants in his younger days.\n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhna=\r\nth made a quantum leap in their\n&gt; &gt; spiritual lives after they attended the=\r\n Satsangha of Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scar=\r\ncity of Satsangha nowadays, I\n&gt; &gt; will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that ther=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the sup=\r\nply will\n&gt; &gt; come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are=\r\n really\n&gt; &gt; thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas.=\r\n You do\n&gt; &gt; not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in i=\r\ndle gossiping\n&gt; &gt; and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave=\r\n of passion, greed,\n&gt; &gt; and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot =\r\nget good Satsanga.&#39;...\n&gt; &gt; Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then c=\r\nome to me. I shall take you\n&gt; &gt; to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will=\r\n put you in the right path, guide\n&gt; &gt; you and elevate you to sublime height=\r\ns. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are\n&gt; &gt; waiting to get hold of the right=\r\n type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Real seekers are few. If =\r\nyou bring a charge, &quot;There are no good\n&gt; &gt; Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a=\r\n serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers\n&gt; &gt; after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is a=\r\nn opportunity for\n&gt; &gt; Satsangha.

However, one with=\r\nout a rich father is still better off\n&gt; &gt; opening a bank account with a zer=\r\no balance and building it up slowly with\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly=\r\n, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana\n&gt; &gt; with famous mantras and b=\r\nuild one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a\n&gt; &gt; guru to initiate you (n=\r\not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get\n&gt; &gt; initiated. Otherwise, j=\r\nust go ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Ma=\r\nntras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for\n&gt; &gt; getting specific =\r\nmaterial results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender\n&gt; &gt; and making s=\r\npiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that\n&gt; &gt; importan=\r\nt. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can\n&gt; &gt; prepare o=\r\nne sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are very few pe=\r\nople who\n&gt; &gt; can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole syste=\r\nm, for a\n&gt; &gt; reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and ritual=\r\ns only for\n&gt; &gt; increasing surrender, getting whatever material results god =\r\nwants to give\n&gt; &gt; and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do ritu=\r\nals for begetting\n&gt; &gt; *specific* material results (for oneself or others or=\r\n society/universe in\n&gt; &gt; general), Nature will make arrangements for one to=\r\n get correct knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; such rituals. But, as one starts, one should =\r\nstart with the attitude of\n&gt; &gt; (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nny homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give =\r\nany\n&gt; &gt; material results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my=\r\n desires.\n&gt; &gt; I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devot=\r\nion and\n&gt; &gt; surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Init=\r\niation is not\n&gt; &gt; required. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results sl=\r\nowly, but there are\n&gt; &gt; fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, bu=\r\nt there may be some\n&gt; &gt; hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine =\r\nthat a person is taking\n&gt; &gt; rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing =\r\nthem in garbage and trying to\n&gt; &gt; retrieve one good fruit from under them. =\r\nIf the person is gentle, one may do\n&gt; &gt; it gently and the spillage of rotte=\r\nn fruits on the floor will be minimal. If\n&gt; &gt; the person is aggressive, one=\r\n may do it fast and there may be more spillage\n&gt; &gt; of rotten fruits on the =\r\nfloor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten\n&gt; &gt; fruits will be retriev=\r\ned faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a\n&gt; &gt; basket. The deity is=\r\n trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and\n&gt; &gt; give you a goo=\r\nd fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity\n&gt; &gt; like Ganapat=\r\nhi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good\n&gt; &gt; fruit, but=\r\n the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairava=\r\n or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit\n&gt; &gt; comes =\r\nout faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remembe=\r\nr that these fruits are not deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; creations, but fruits of your own a=\r\nctions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had\n&gt; &gt; to eat each of those rotten f=\r\nruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten\n&gt; &gt; f=\r\nruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed =\r\nby a\n&gt; &gt; guru before starting a practice. If you realize the above, you can=\r\n start\n&gt; &gt; mantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you have =\r\nto realize\n&gt; &gt; that it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is tryi=\r\nng to accelerate\n&gt; &gt; good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentle=\r\nr deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who =\r\nnever lit a lamp in their life and were\n&gt; &gt; ignorant of rituals, are doing =\r\ndaily homam now. Some people who took several\n&gt; &gt; hours to read Saptashati =\r\nfor the first time just 2-3 years back are now\n&gt; &gt; doing Chandi homam with =\r\nentire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them\n&gt; &gt; have transformed a=\r\n lot and have experienced some things too. Obviously, they\n&gt; &gt; have done sa=\r\ndhana with fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine\n&gt; &gt; Mother in s=\r\nome past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age=\r\n of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone\n&gt; &gt; has even a faint idea th=\r\nat spiritual progress is important, is looking for\n&gt; &gt; god and is attracted=\r\n to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that\n&gt; &gt; person obviousl=\r\ny has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person has done\n&gt; &gt; that sadh=\r\nana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of=\r\n what is what, how\n&gt; &gt; things work, why one should do something, how to do =\r\nit, what is more\n&gt; &gt; important and what is less important, that is what ini=\r\ntiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; H.Ramalin=\r\ngam\n&gt; \n&gt; Managing Director\n&gt; \n&gt; Shri Ramana Heavy Engineering Private Limit=\r\ned\n&gt; \n&gt; No.769, 59th Street, 10th Sector, K.K.nagar\n&gt; \n&gt; Chennai-600078\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Ph: Off-044-23662346\n&gt; \n&gt; Cell: +91-93847 41969\n&gt; \n&gt; +91-99620 31969\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n +91-99406 51969\n&gt; \n&gt; Email: hramalingam@...\n&gt; \n&gt; hramalingam@...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-236412870-1288210659=:35567\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;You have mentioned the importance of initiation.

The only major point where I disagree is whether one c=\r\nan do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion o=\r\nn translation of mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some=\r\n unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. There are various sacred =\r\nchants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking suc=\r\nh sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams =\r\netc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras. The Samh=\r\nita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. Undoubted=\r\nly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the original. Reading a transl=\r\nation is not even comparable to chanting the original chant. So far it is f=\r\nine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak=\r\n, tradition makes a distinction between\n them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. As per the traditi=\r\nonal view one doesn&#39;t need to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. Th=\r\ne case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, a=\r\ngamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the tradi=\r\ntional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other =\r\nmantras that need initiation, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tan=\r\ntrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the actual idea is that these=\r\n mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities t=\r\nhat need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need in=\r\nitiation as they fall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Dev=\r\ni Mahatmyam are traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of pura=\r\nnas. They have a larger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Ch=\r\nanting them without initiation is\n not recommended especially when the read=\r\ner combines the navarna or shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the =\r\nchanting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6. I know from personal interaction that acharyas belongin=\r\ng to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for bo=\r\nth the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective=\r\n NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB=\r\n (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one nee=\r\nds to be initiated to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that =\r\nhas an independent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultane=\r\nously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit o=\r\nf the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part of S=\r\nri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initiated =\r\nto chant it. However if one\n wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sac=\r\nred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the ve=\r\nrnacular has been recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original alon=\r\ng with the navakshari amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In =\r\nthat case it is recommended to be initiated and go through the specialised =\r\nsadhanas properly under guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8. Arguably if an uninitiated pers=\r\non reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauran=\r\nik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent problem in our time=\r\ns. The problem with attempting to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from text=\r\ns alone (without initiation) is that most readers inadvertently end up also=\r\n chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stotram w=\r\nhich too contain the bijaksharas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;9. I you carefully peruse my write=\r\n-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere do I put down the Na=\r\nvarna mantra even in\n writing. Neither have I attempted to write a commenta=\r\nry on it. Translations of mantras do not have the power of the original man=\r\ntra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know the essence or impor=\r\nt (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. Infact `artha&#39; i=\r\ns the import, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a translation! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10. For thos=\r\ne who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is no=\r\n need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain level of samskara =\r\nto be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. Otherwise we=\r\n would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please keep doing wha=\r\ntever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimh=\r\na garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the sadhana WITHOUT =\r\nasking for any favours or results. That attitude itself will reduce a lot o=\r\nf the potential problem. Things will happen on their own accord in the natu=\r\nral flow.\n Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hope the ab=\r\nove pointers help in clearing any confusion. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards,&lt;BR&gt;Satya Prak=\r\nash &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, h ramalingam &lt;hramalinga=\r\nm@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste everybody&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I want to share =\r\none anecdote happened in front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Ch=\r\nandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When Swamigal was staying in a camp n=\r\near Mysore in Karnataka One day all the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; learned persons male and fe=\r\nmale alike&lt;BR&gt;&gt; requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam =\r\nin kannada language&lt;BR&gt;&gt; so that they can chant knowing the meaning full=\r\ny.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was made early in th=\r\ne morning.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc were\n over as =\r\nusual Postman came to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt=\r\n Swamigal. Swamigal was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; seriously looking at the cover&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in f=\r\nront of the learned members and was looking at one line written as PIN&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Code and followed by six numbers. Then he asked the learned members to&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; explain the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell that. But eve=\r\nryone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; understood the significance of that number. Then swamigal ask=\r\ned his crew&lt;BR&gt;&gt; member to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from h=\r\nis library and read&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the=\r\n group that even the meaning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of PINCode was not known to the group =\r\nand still it serves the purpose and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; people are using it in day to d=\r\nay work.

That is definitely the ideal =\r\nsituation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If that is not possible, what I am say=\r\ning is that reading something&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; composed by an elevated being ev=\r\nen without understanding the meaning is very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; useful. Suppose s=\r\nomeone does not understand what Ganapathi Atharvaseersham&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mean=\r\ns, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n everything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. One can&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, i=\r\nt is more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; likely because one does\n not have the correct attitu=\r\nde and surrender and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the sp=\r\necific meaning of Ganapathi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many people knowi=\r\nng the meaning and chanting may also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; experience nothing.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at =\r\nmany layers and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one superficial layer.=\r\n Some important layers are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most impor=\r\ntant layers of meaning are never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; understood intellectually, bu=\r\nt only experienced internally.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether you know t=\r\nhe meaning or not, chant the mantra with a calm and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; relaxed mi=\r\nnd and with devotion and surrender. Many people keep a target&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ncount and race through it or do it mechanically with a sense of duty. If it=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and surrender to the d=\r\neity, it can do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; something.\n The key to success with a mantra i=\r\ns calmness of the mind. If a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands of =\r\nthoughts and chanting of the mantra is just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one of those thous=\r\nand activities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; subside =\r\nand mind is essentially reverberating with a mantra, that is when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; one experiences a mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are 4 levels =\r\nof sabda. When one says a mantra, physical vibration is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; accomp=\r\nanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, the thoughts and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some mantras co=\r\nmposed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentially bei=\r\nngs with very stable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such that th=\r\ne physical vibration of the mantra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can eventually cause the co=\r\nrresponding imagery in the mind by resonance,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; when other menta=\r\nl activity subsides. Thus, after\n repeating the mantra and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; cal=\r\nming the mind down, you can recreate a certain imagery and thought system&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; in your mind. That can permanently alter the way your mind work=\r\nd. But the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; key is to attain a reasonably stable, focused and c=\r\nalm mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpretati=\r\non of BhagavadGita and Sant&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have=\r\n a power of their own, as they were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; realized souls.
