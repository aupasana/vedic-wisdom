I think you should follow what your heart is saying and what you hav=\r\ne been advised to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhis is a more general comment on one line form the mail below. Respectfully=\r\n yet firmly I disagree on one point.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;Myself: Doesnt that only apply =\r\nto purascharaNa (based on what I read in \n&gt; Aghore book - as everybody in t=\r\nhis group is already familiar with that \n&gt; book series)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conduc=\r\ntor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular \n&gt; chanting. Doesnt=\r\n matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You \n&gt; have to follow i=\r\nt strictly.&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is always good to do japa, but &quot;strict&quot; is too str=\r\nong a word. There are many in different parts of India, well versed in sadh=\r\nana as well as respective shastras (respective because no single human bein=\r\ng can known all possible Hindu Shastras, so most study that which maybe rel=\r\nevant to his line of spiritual inquiry followed in his tradition) who do ho=\r\nmas without doing any pre-requisite japa. \n&gt; \n&gt; One honest question that ev=\r\nery sadhaka must ask himself/herself objectively is, how badly do we want G=\r\nod? If the desire pure and unblemished, or is it also mixed with various ot=\r\nher desires, however small they maybe. If we also want other materialistic =\r\nthings along with it - and there is no harm in wanting legitimate things - =\r\nthen one can follow all instructions and rules set for whatever parampara o=\r\nne is mentally afflicted to and given by his/her Guru(s). \n&gt; \n&gt; But if one =\r\nis desirous of ONLY God without any other desire attached to it, no rule is=\r\n sufficient, no path is a guarantee, no sadhana is sure-shot way to achieve=\r\n it.=C2=A0 Working on internal surrender to God and increased detachment in=\r\n daily life along with and through whatever ritual one performs and in what=\r\never manner, can be more helpful in the long run. Human aspiration alone is=\r\n not enough. When the aspiration is genuine and pure, He/She extends his/he=\r\nr energy to lift the sadhak up.. this dual phenomenon together make a sadha=\r\nna success. And this simple yet powerful truth is represented by the six-po=\r\ninted triangle which is the basic yantra of so many deities, and specially =\r\none form of the Mother. The upward triangle is our aspiration, the downward=\r\n is Her grace coming down to transform the sadhak from his/her current stat=\r\ne. Together, it makes a complete whole. And grace is purely proportional to=\r\n the purity of the aspiration, which only God can judge\n&gt;  accurately.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabud=\r\ndhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______=\r\n__________________________\n&gt;  From: ashutosh.srikanth &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@..=\r\n.&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Monday, 22 October 2012 5:17=\r\n PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam - Ahuti numbers\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; My p=\r\nranams to all.\n&gt; I have been performing weekly havan for more than a year a=\r\nnd half.\n&gt; I want to point out certain things related to havan so that it c=\r\nan be done as per shastra by others too.\n&gt; I am using a conversation that i=\r\nn fact took place to bring out these relevant points.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometime back th=\r\nere was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am presenting below: \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; [South Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;ashTamangala prashNa&quot; con=\r\nducted in temples when something goes wrong - called as dosha.]\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashN=\r\na conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes...=\r\n You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya at your home regularly.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised by this pointed question be=\r\ncause I had not told anybody about the havan I did at home)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa co=\r\nnductor: There are certain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem=\r\n to be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Y=\r\nou should mix that with atleast a little bit of ghee before giving it as ah=\r\nuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa before giving ahutis? And do =\r\nyou do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for your regular japa?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No =\r\nI dont do any pre-defined set of japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictl=\r\ny the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a=\r\n mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it=\r\n should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditatio=\r\nn, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to=\r\n purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this g=\r\nroup is already familiar with that book series)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: No =\r\nit applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. Th=\r\ne rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; The conversation went onto several other things. Subsequently I went on =\r\nto get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra an=\r\nd also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mention=\r\ned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual progress since. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I =\r\njust wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to perform at lea=\r\nst 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; fo=\r\nr the ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ashutosh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
