To get a correct understanding, one may need to combine knowle=\r\ndge from other scriptures.\n=C2=A0\nAs an example, if the body of one having =\r\nan attachment to the body is afflicted with cancer, one may see it as a pro=\r\nblem. Because one feels attachment and responsibility towards the body, one=\r\n may be thinking about how to fix it and may get agitated. So, one is not f=\r\nree from the negative repercussions of that cancer. But, when Ramana Mahars=\r\nhi or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had cancer, they did not view it as a problem=\r\n and displayed the same attitude and mental equanimity. So, while their *bo=\r\ndies* experienced the repercussions of that cancer, &quot;they&quot; were free from t=\r\nhem.\n=C2=A0\nIf one has surrendered one&#39;s sense of duty/responsibility towar=\r\nds *everything* as Lord says in that verse (&quot;sarva dharmAn parityajya&quot;), wh=\r\nere &quot;everything&quot; inlcudes body, name, wife, children, properties etc, then =\r\nanything bad (or good) happening to those entities will not touch one or bi=\r\nnd one. One is &quot;free&quot; from those happenings. *That* liberation is what Lord=\r\n says he shall give and the pre-condition is to give up any sense of duty/r=\r\nesponsibility towards anything.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThough some =\r\npeople interpret &quot;dharma&quot; in this verse as a religious path, the real meani=\r\nng of dharma is &quot;duty, that which is correct&quot;. We have a sense of responsib=\r\nility towards so many entities, stemming from our conditioning (vasana). Th=\r\nis includes a sense of responsibility towards body, name, wife, children, p=\r\narents, relatives, community, country, religion, subjects of study (e.g. Jy=\r\notish) etc etc. Every sense of &quot;I need to do this&quot;, whether noble or evil, =\r\ncomes from one&#39;s conditioning and *binds* one. If one surrenders all these,=\r\n i.e. effectively one surrenders one&#39;s entire conditioning, at Lord&#39;s feet =\r\nand accepts whatever happens to one as god&#39;s prasad, then one is liberated.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nBased on the &quot;momentum&quot; from actions before liberation, one may fac=\r\ne various life situations even after liberation. In one case, one may get c=\r\nancer and die. In another case, one may roam the world and spread Sanatana =\r\nDharma. In another case, one may sit in a cave and meditate for 10,000 more=\r\n years. In another case, one may roam the streets looking like a mad person=\r\n. In another case, one may continue to work as a day labourer. In another c=\r\nase, one may destroy a kingdom in a battle. And so on. In all these cases, =\r\nthe liberated being has surrendered all preferences, all likes and dislikes=\r\n, all agendas, attachments and sense of resposibility towards everything on=\r\ne has (body, name, wife, children etc and all attributes of the body-mind c=\r\nomplex that once ruled the roost) and engages in spontaneous actions based =\r\non the circumstances one finds oneself in, based on pre-existing momentum. =\r\nNothing that happens to one binds one and nothing that one does binds one.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nLiberation does not mean that all of one&#39;s belongings (body, name, f=\r\namily, community etc) are &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;well&quot;. Nor does it mean that one does=\r\n nothing. Things may keep happening to one and one may keep doing things. Y=\r\net, one is untouched by them, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, because on=\r\ne has no desires, demands, preferences or agendas and accepts whatever Lord=\r\n gives.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne who tells Krishna, &quot;I surrender to=\r\n you. I will not follow any religion or rituals or gods and just pray to yo=\r\nu. So forgive all my sins and make sure that only good things befall my bod=\r\ny, my name, my family etc [because I really care about them and any damage =\r\nto them will upset me]&quot; has missed the point big time! The sublime verse yo=\r\nu referred to is like the culmination of entire Bhagavad Gita and is the es=\r\nsence of all Upanishads.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne word of caution. =\r\nIMHO, what follows is far more relevant to most readers of this writeup tha=\r\nn what lies above!\n=C2=A0\nThis verse is the essence of Self-knowledge. But =\r\nmost people of this era are unlikely to realize Self (until the end of this=\r\n yuga cycle). So my suggestion is to set more reasonable goals. It is ok if=\r\n you haven&#39;t surrendered all of your dharmas to Lord.\n=C2=A0\n!!!!! In fact,=\r\n even if you try, you will probably end up misusing that notion to run away=\r\n from most of your higher (and selfless) dharmas and yet end up sticking to=\r\n your lowest and most selfish dharmas (e.g. dharma towards body and its sur=\r\nvival instinct, very tough to shake off). That is useless. !!!!! \n=C2=A0\nNo=\r\n wonder Vedanta comes at the end of all Veda and the verse above comes afte=\r\nr so many chapters on so many other things. Don&#39;t jump to it right away!\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nFirst *expand* your sense of self and your sense of responsibility a=\r\nnd attachment to be more inclusive. Current body-mind complex we inhabit is=\r\n a very limited notion of self. Expand it to family, then to community, the=\r\nn to town, then to nation etc. Or may be to a large community of people wit=\r\nh certain attributes. Basically, try to put others before you, learn to sac=\r\nrifice and engage in more selfless actions than selfish actions. Not everyo=\r\nne may be liberated in this life, but everyone can make SOME progress towar=\r\nds it!\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Res=\r\nources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n\n\n&gt;__________=\r\n______________________\n&gt; From: Sriraman Annaswamy &lt;sriraman@...&gt;\n&gt;T=\r\no: &quot;JyotishWritings-owner@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;JyotishWritings-owner@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&gt; \n&gt;Cc: Vedic Wisdom &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;; &quot;vedic-astrology=\r\n@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&gt;; &quot;JyotishGroup@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot; &lt;JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com&gt;; &quot;JyotishWritings@yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\n&lt;JyotishWritings@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, March 5, 2013 1:40 AM\n&gt;S=\r\nubject: Re: [JyotishWritings] Re: Karma, Phala, Remedies, Blessings, Curses=\r\n etc (Re: few questions)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Sorry Narasimha, Verse 66 of the Bhagawad Gi=\r\nta is very clear isn&#39;t it - sarva papebyo=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Is it your position th=\r\nat when Sri Krishna states sarva papebyo, he is excluding prarabda karma an=\r\nd referring solely to sanchita and agami karma or am I missing something?\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Sriraman\n&gt;Sydney, AUS\n&gt;\n&gt;Sent from my iPad\n&gt;\n&gt;On 05/03/2013, at 15:33, =\r\n&quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Why not accept \nwhatever comes our way as &#39;PRASAD&#39; from Isvara and =\r\nmove on.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;My response: The final goal is indeed to reach a state=\r\n of mind where one can accept the fruits of all karmas as prasad of Lord, w=\r\nith an equanimous mind. However, it is not easy. When we receive the fruits=\r\n of some really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agitated that=\r\n we lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This may result in=\r\n further bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused state.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;Thus, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really bad impending ka=\r\nrmas when one is still in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer stat=\r\ne of mind in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad fruits b=\r\netter. It is even possible theoretically that one pushes off a really bad k=\r\narma, makes progress during that borrowed\n time, reaches an equanimous stat=\r\ne of mind, becomes liberated and then faces the karma as a liberated being =\r\nwith a totally equanimous mind that does not get agitated.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Comment 2: Prarabda karma is which was already done =\r\nand sanchitha and agami are what we going to do.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;My Response: Ac=\r\ntually sanchita karmas are also karmas already done. Sanchita means &quot;piled =\r\nup&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are different in the sense that their fructification =\r\nhas already begun. The verb &quot;prArabh&quot; means &quot;to begin&quot;. Its noun form &quot;prAr=\r\nambha&quot; means &quot;beginning&quot; and its gerund noun form &quot;prArabdha&quot; means &quot;the [o=\r\nne that was] begun&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process of =\r\nreaction has already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are=\r\n piled up karmas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be del=\r\nayed indefinitely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in =\r\nCosmic Self without experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fr=\r\nuits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experie=\r\nnced even by a liberated being.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Though fruits of prarabdha karma=\r\ns are already in the pipeline, even they can actually be delayed or manipul=\r\nated. Bottomline is that there are agents of delivery at the physical and s=\r\nubtle level even for things deep in the pipeline and hence some limited adj=\r\nustment is possible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Comment 3:How =\r\ndoes nishkam karma works? In other words, when a doer detaches himself from=\r\n an action, where does the reaction goes?\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;My Response: If one id=\r\nentifies with a body-mind complex and a limited sense of self-identificatio=\r\nn and pursues its selfish agenda, one keeps accumulating karmas. But, if on=\r\ne has minimal identification with a body-mind complex to just sustain it, p=\r\nursues no agenda and engages in whatever action is natural in the situation=\r\n one is in (but not driven by any conditioning, i.e. agendas or desires or =\r\nlikes/dislikes), then one is untouched by karmas performed in that state.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;In the words of Swami Sivananda of Hrishikesh, &quot;The accumulated a=\r\nnd current actions of a Jnani take shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti&quot;. In other=\r\n words, Sanchita karmas (piled up actions from past that have not yet begun=\r\n fructifying) and aagami karmas (actions being performed right now) of a li=\r\nberated being take shelted in\n Cosmic Kinetic Consciousness (Brahmanda Prak=\r\nriti).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Comment 4: If my destiny is to =\r\nsuffer, why should I pray to God? And if i am being \npunished for some kind=\r\n of bad karma from the past, why am i not aware of it? It is like getting p=\r\nunishment without knowing your bad deeds.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;My Response: One need =\r\nnot pray to God.All one needs to do is to stop engaging in problematic karm=\r\nas to add to the pile of such karmas from the past. More importantly, one n=\r\needs to reach a calm and sustainable state of mind in which that can be mai=\r\nntained even in the middle of a tumultous hurricane caused in one&#39;s life du=\r\ne to serious bad karmas from the past. Once serious troubles set in or mind=\r\n focuses on sense objects, material world and one&#39;s pleasures and pains, mi=\r\nnd tends to lose its balance and judgment, starts pursuing its limited self=\r\nish agendas and starts performing even more bad karmas. Thus, praying to Go=\r\nd and contemplating various ideals and qualities that God represents can gi=\r\nve a shelter to the mind in which it can maintain some calmness, balance an=\r\nd judgment. If that is not the case for one, perhaps one needs to perfect i=\r\nt further.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;God has no agenda to either punish you or hide the re=\r\nason. God is an impartial balancer of reactions to all actions. If there is=\r\n something unreasonable about the reaction you are getting, it means your a=\r\nction had a similar unreasonableness.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Let me turn around your qu=\r\nestion on being &quot;aware&quot; and ask a simple question. When we cause loss or hu=\r\nrt to someone, do we always tell that person why we are doing it? If not, h=\r\now can we expect someone to tell us before causing loss or hurt to us? If I=\r\n caused terrible strife to someone pious and pure for no reason, then Natur=\r\ne will use someone in future to cause terrible strife to me despite my piet=\r\ny and purity and apparently for no reason.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;In fact, what will yo=\r\nu achieve by knowing exactly what was the action that caused what is happen=\r\ning to you right now? Why is that useful? More useful is your conscience (a=\r\n representation of God in each heart) that tells you right from wrong.

(Chidaakaasha is the space of pure consciousness and chittaakaasha is the=\r\n space of conditioned consciousness that has likes, dislikes, desires, agen=\r\ndas etc.) Vasishtha defined liberation as overcoming vasanas in Yoga Vaasis=\r\nhtham and Patanjali defined yoga as &quot;chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yogaH&quot; (resist=\r\ning the working of conditioning is oneness with Cosmic Self) in Yoga Sutras=\r\n. Until we overcome our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense and some are =\r\nvery subtle. But all of them bind us.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;Comment 6:1. As per Shri Vimalananda, you may also offer all the karmas as=\r\n Homa to inner \ndevas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is lesser of =\r\nsuffering if \nyou do that. Who gets the remaining delta suffering?\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;My Response: Karmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of that k=\r\narma alone. It is a function of that karma and one&#39;s current state of mind.=\r\n If someone serves spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day =\r\nor diaria for a week. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same =\r\nkarmaphala set in motion by the same external agents of delivery (physical =\r\n& subtle) can cause different reaction inside one, depending on one&#39;s curre=\r\nnt state of mind.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;An idle mind is devil&#39;s workshop. Our minds ke=\r\nep vibrating with various notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfi=\r\nsh desires and unnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effec=\r\nts of one&#39;s environment (through which fruits of karmas are\n administered).=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;If one thinks of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates v=\r\narious ideals and qualities of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik=\r\n energy, it absorbs the negative effects of one&#39;s environment better or at =\r\nleast does not amplify them.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;-------=\r\n-\n&gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt;--=\r\n------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Nara=\r\nsimha P.V.R.

Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various agenda=\r\ns engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purusha =\r\nis the witness of it all.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Though each karma should give karmap=\r\nhala that is commensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the =\r\nkarmaphala, i.e. another being. So this requires a complicated balancing ac=\r\nt on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There a=\r\nre very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and p=\r\nicking of agents for their delivery.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;At any time, some kar=\r\nmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this lif=\r\ne&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in this life&quot; p=\r\nool and the rest in the third pool which may not be experienced anytime soo=\r\nn. The way karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is based on the b=\r\nalancing of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The ass=\r\nignment and ordering of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one en=\r\ngages in various new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new peopl=\r\ne enter one&#39;s life, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents an=\r\nd sequencing may change and hence the pools may be re-arranged.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As one engages in remedial measures such as =\r\nprayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, change one=\r\n&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (includin=\r\ng planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karmaphala=\r\n, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of delivery!)=\r\n. The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable karmas m=\r\nay be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the same po=\r\nol. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or pushed up=\r\n in order within the same pool.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses one=\r\n, with sufficient mental force behind it (this is the key), the same thing =\r\ncan happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. E=\r\nvery action by one, or even people around one, has the potential to re-arra=\r\nnge one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postponed o=\r\nr a karma that was not to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced soon=\r\ner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;However, remember that the remedial measure has to be as i=\r\nntense as the karma that it is trying to manipulate. You can move a small r=\r\nock with small force, but you need a large force to move a big rock or a hi=\r\nll.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can g=\r\nive a specific result, nobody can make one experience that result, no matte=\r\nr what ritual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative ka=\r\nrmas in their optional pool and even evil people have a lot of positive kar=\r\nmas in their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessin=\r\ngs can often make some difference.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;This point is well illustra=\r\nted by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If one thinks that one can escape t=\r\nhe fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human bei=\r\nngs, who may show favoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. T=\r\nhe He-aspect of God is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She=\r\n-aspect of God is the power that impartially and impassionately manages the=\r\n fine balance and order within this play of actions and fruits. All beings =\r\nare equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of sa=\r\nints. She administers just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using=\r\n available agents.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The karmas we committed in the past are alr=\r\neady in the pipeline and will give their results sooner or later. The best =\r\nwe can do with them, with some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat.=\r\n The most important thing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipe=\r\nline now. Simply put, selfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm t=\r\no others are bad karmas and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasur=\r\ne or benefit to others are good karmas.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When it comes to manip=\r\nulating the pre-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through co=\r\nnscious effort and current action, yes, it is possible and general guidelin=\r\nes are available in shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific im=\r\npact of each action. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for overcomin=\r\ng a karma has to be commensurate with the karma\n itself.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;You n=\r\need only small force to push a cat out of your way, but need a large force =\r\nto push an elephant.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-------=\r\n-\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n--------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Ajit=\r\n Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] few questions\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear=C2=A0Digamber,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by th=\r\ne courtiers to randomly pick the next king.

Whose karma is this?=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, k=\r\ning, and all the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned k=\r\ning.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Everything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him =\r\na king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the k=\r\ning. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the =\r\nking. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and a=\r\nccept the result.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, o=\r\nr promise, or oath. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of m=\r\nankind, and are actually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with=\r\n a certain amount of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through =\r\nspeech.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, we=\r\n usually make an assumption. We assume that there is a person, and separate=\r\n from the person are his many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person=\r\n from time to time. We then want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; k=\r\narmas from our karmic pipeline.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;=\r\nperson&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. And you are no=\r\nthing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your va=\r\nasanaas are your karmas.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, yo=\r\nu have changed your karma. Or course, that is easier said than done.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Any moment when your mind becomes quiet is a blessing.

I vaguely remember Vimalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s cur=\r\nse in Aghora trilogy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(2) On similar note, what happens when you get `=\r\nblessings&#39; say from a saint or elders? We also come across lot of tantric i=\r\ntems like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 w=\r\nhat do this items really do if they work? Something similar with wearing ge=\r\nmstones for planets =E2=80=93 do they bring forward good karmas or they cre=\r\nate new ones?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (w=\r\nell known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Gu=\r\nru &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At =\r\nthat point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shis=\r\nya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse m=\r\ne if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episo=\r\nde from old memory]. So question I have is, does our sadhana change karmaph=\r\nal to a great extent or it is just our perception that changes?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanki=\r\nng you,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Digamber\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n--1287737115-996562704-1362514078=:38858\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv54243352&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, s=\r\nans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;Namaste Sir,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;People may misundersta=\r\nnd the word &quot;mokShayiShyAmi&quot; (I shall liberate) in that verse based on what=\r\n their conditioning tells them liberation is. To get a correct understandin=\r\ng, one may need to combine knowledge from other scriptures.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As=\r\n an example, if the body of one having an attachment to the body is afflict=\r\ned with cancer, one may see it as a problem. Because one feels attachment a=\r\nnd responsibility towards the body, one may be thinking about how to fix it=\r\n and may get agitated. So, one is not free from the negative repercussions =\r\nof that cancer. But, when Ramana Maharshi or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had ca=\r\nncer, they did not view it as a problem and displayed the same attitude\n an=\r\nd mental equanimity. So, while their *bodies* experienced the repercussions=\r\n of that cancer, &quot;they&quot; were free from them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one has surren=\r\ndered one&#39;s sense of duty/responsibility towards *everything* as Lord says =\r\nin that verse (&quot;sarva dharmAn parityajya&quot;), where &quot;everything&quot; inlcudes bod=\r\ny, name, wife, children, properties etc, then anything bad (or good) happen=\r\ning to those entities will not touch one or bind one. One is &quot;free&quot; from th=\r\nose happenings. *That* liberation is what Lord says he shall give and the p=\r\nre-condition is to give up any sense of duty/responsibility towards anythin=\r\ng.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Though some people interpret &quot;d=\r\nharma&quot; in this verse as a religious path, the real meaning of dharma is &quot;du=\r\nty, that which is correct&quot;. We have a sense of responsibility towards so ma=\r\nny entities, stemming from our conditioning (vasana). This\n includes a sens=\r\ne of responsibility towards body, name, wife, children, parents, relatives,=\r\n community, country, religion, subjects of study (e.g. Jyotish) etc etc. Ev=\r\nery sense of &quot;I need to do this&quot;, whether noble or evil, comes from one&#39;s c=\r\nonditioning and *binds* one. If one surrenders all these, i.e. effectively =\r\none surrenders one&#39;s entire conditioning, at Lord&#39;s feet and accepts whatev=\r\ner happens to one as god&#39;s prasad, then one is liberated.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Base=\r\nd on the &quot;momentum&quot; from actions before liberation, one may face various li=\r\nfe situations even after liberation. In one case, one may get cancer and di=\r\ne. In another case, one may roam the world and spread Sanatana Dharma. In a=\r\nnother case, one may sit in a cave and meditate for 10,000 more years. In a=\r\nnother case, one may roam the streets looking like a mad person. In another=\r\n case, one may continue to work as a day labourer. In another case, one may=\r\n destroy a kingdom in a battle. And so on. In all\n these cases, the liberat=\r\ned being has surrendered all preferences, all likes and dislikes, all agend=\r\nas, attachments and sense of resposibility towards everything one has (body=\r\n, name, wife, children etc and all attributes of the body-mind complex that=\r\n once ruled the roost) and engages in spontaneous actions based on the circ=\r\numstances one finds oneself in, based on pre-existing momentum. Nothing tha=\r\nt happens to one binds one and nothing that one does binds one.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Liberation does not mean that all of one&#39;s belongings (body, name, family=\r\n, community etc) are &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;well&quot;. Nor does it mean that one does noth=\r\ning. Things may keep happening to one and one may keep doing things. Yet, o=\r\nne is untouched by them, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, because one has=\r\n no desires, demands, preferences or agendas and accepts whatever Lord give=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One who tells Krishna, &quot;I surr=\r\nender to you. I will not follow any religion or rituals or gods and just pr=\r\nay to you. So forgive all my sins and make sure that only good things befal=\r\nl my body, my name, my family etc [because I really care about them and any=\r\n damage to them will upset me]&quot; has missed the point big time! The sublime =\r\nverse you referred to is like the culmination of entire Bhagavad Gita and i=\r\ns the essence of all Upanishads.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;O=\r\nne word of caution. IMHO, what follows is far more relevant to most readers=\r\n of this writeup than what lies above!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This verse is the essen=\r\nce of Self-knowledge. But most people of this era are unlikely to realize S=\r\nelf (until the end of this yuga cycle). So my suggestion is to set more rea=\r\nsonable goals. It is ok if you haven&#39;t surrendered all of your dharmas to\n =\r\nLord.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;!!!!! In fact, even if you try, you will probably end up=\r\n misusing that notion to run away from most of your higher (and selfless) d=\r\nharmas and yet end up sticking to your lowest and most selfish dharmas (e.g=\r\n. dharma towards body and its survival instinct, very tough to shake off). =\r\nThat is useless. !!!!! &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;No wonder Vedanta comes at the end of =\r\nall Veda and the verse above comes after so many chapters on so many other =\r\nthings. Don&#39;t jump to it right away!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;First *expand* your sense=\r\n of self and your sense of responsibility and attachment to be more inclusi=\r\nve. Current body-mind complex we inhabit is a very limited notion of self. =\r\nExpand it to family, then to community, then to town, then to nation etc. O=\r\nr may be to a large community of people with certain attributes. Basically,=\r\n try to put others before you, learn to sacrifice and engage in more selfle=\r\nss actions than selfish actions.

Why not accept \nwhatever comes =\r\nour way as &#39;PRASAD&#39; from Isvara and move on.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;My response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt; The &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;final &lt;/span&gt;goal is indeed to =\r\nreach a state of mind where one can accept the fruits of all karmas as pras=\r\nad of Lord, with an equanimous mind. However, it is not easy. When we recei=\r\nve the fruits of some really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and =\r\nagitated that we lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This =\r\nmay result in further bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused =\r\nstate.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Thus, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really ba=\r\nd impending karmas when one is still in a position to do so. If one reaches=\r\n a calmer state of mind in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle th=\r\ne bad fruits better. It is even possible theoretically that one pushes off =\r\na really bad karma, makes progress during that borrowed\n time, reaches an e=\r\nquanimous state of mind, becomes liberated and then faces the karma as a li=\r\nberated being with a totally equanimous mind that does not get agitated.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-style:italic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comment 2&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_18_1362375052103_47&quot;&gt;Prarabda=\r\n karma is which was already done and sanchitha and agami are what we going =\r\nto do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Actually sanchita karmas ar=\r\ne also karmas already done. Sanchita means &quot;piled up&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are=\r\n different in the sense that their fructification has\n &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nstyle:italic;&quot;&gt;already begun&lt;/span&gt;. The verb &quot;prArabh&quot; means &quot;to begin&quot;. I=\r\nts noun form &quot;prArambha&quot; means &quot;beginning&quot; and its gerund noun form &quot;prArab=\r\ndha&quot; means &quot;the [one that was] begun&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are actions for whi=\r\nch the process of reaction has already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas s=\r\nanchita karmas are piled up karmas that have not kicked off their fruits ye=\r\nt. They can be delayed indefinitely. If one becomes liberated while living,=\r\n one can merge in Cosmic Self without experiencing the fruits of sanchita k=\r\narmas. However, fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and =\r\nneed to be experienced even by a liberated being.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Though fruit=\r\ns of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline, even they can actually b=\r\ne delayed or manipulated. Bottomline is that there are agents of delivery a=\r\nt the physical and subtle level even for things deep in the pipeline and he=\r\nnce some limited adjustment is possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div\n class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3=\r\n_7_2_30_1362238784009_96&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-f=\r\namily:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font=\r\n-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv5=\r\n4243352yui_3_7_2_30_1362238784009_101&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetic=\r\na, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-s=\r\ntyle:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comment 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_1362238784009_105&quot; s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_136223=\r\n8784009_107&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;\n &lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_1362238784009_108&quot; style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;font&gt;How does &lt;i&gt;nishkam karma&lt;/i&gt; works?

But, if one has minimal i=\r\ndentification with a body-mind complex to just sustain it, pursues no agend=\r\na and engages in whatever action is natural in the situation one is in (but=\r\n not driven by any conditioning, i.e. agendas or desires or likes/dislikes)=\r\n, then one is untouched by karmas performed in that state.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In =\r\nthe words of Swami Sivananda of Hrishikesh, &quot;The accumulated and current ac=\r\ntions of a Jnani take shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti&quot;.

And if i am being \npunished for some kind of bad karma =\r\nfrom the past, why am i not aware of\n it? It is like getting punishment wit=\r\nhout knowing your bad deeds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic=\r\n;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;need not pray t=\r\no God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; All one needs to do is to stop engaging in problematic =\r\nkarmas to add to the pile of such karmas from the past. More importantly, o=\r\nne needs to reach a calm and sustainable state of mind in which that can be=\r\n maintained even in the middle of a tumultous hurricane caused in one&#39;s lif=\r\ne due to serious bad karmas from the past. Once serious troubles set in or =\r\nmind focuses on sense objects, material world and one&#39;s pleasures and pains=\r\n, mind tends to lose its balance and judgment, starts pursuing its limited =\r\nselfish agendas and starts performing even more bad karmas. Thus, praying t=\r\no God and contemplating various ideals and qualities that God represents ca=\r\nn give a shelter to the mind in\n which it can maintain some calmness, balan=\r\nce and judgment. If that is not the case for one, perhaps one needs to perf=\r\nect it further.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;span&gt;God has no agenda to either punish you or hide the reason. God i=\r\ns an impartial balancer of reactions to all actions. If there is something =\r\nunreasonable about the reaction you are getting, it means your action had a=\r\n similar unreasonableness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let me turn around your question on being &quot;aware&quot; and ask a simp=\r\nle question. When we cause loss or hurt to someone, do we always tell that =\r\nperson why we are doing it? If not, how can we expect someone to tell us be=\r\nfore causing loss or hurt to\n us? If I caused terrible strife to someone pi=\r\nous and pure for no reason, then Nature will use someone in future to cause=\r\n terrible strife to me despite my piety and purity and apparently for no re=\r\nason.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In fact, what will you achieve by knowing exactly what w=\r\nas the action that caused what is happening to you right now? Why is that u=\r\nseful? More useful is your conscience (a representation of God in each hear=\r\nt) that tells you right from wrong. It constantly gives guidance on which a=\r\nctions will give good reactions *in future*.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Comment 5&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Vasana can be for wealth, fame, power, d=\r\nomination (a struggle for power!) etc. Many ripus, many reasons...!&lt;br&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wel=\r\nl-said. Though we are discussing karma and karma phala here, the root cause=\r\n of karma is vasana in chittaakasha.

It is a function of that karma and one&#39;s current state of mind. If someo=\r\nne serves spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day or diaria=\r\n for a week. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same karmaphal=\r\na set in motion by the same external agents of delivery (physical &amp; sub=\r\ntle) can cause different reaction inside one, depending on one&#39;s current st=\r\nate of mind.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An idle mind is devil&#39;s workshop. Our minds keep =\r\nvibrating with various notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfish =\r\ndesires and unnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effects =\r\nof one&#39;s environment (through which fruits of karmas are\n administered).&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one thinks of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates va=\r\nrious ideals and qualities of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik =\r\nenergy, it absorbs the negative effects of one&#39;s environment better or at l=\r\neast does not amplify them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;----=\r\n----&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_13622387840=\r\n09_161&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helve=\r\ntica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;--=\r\n------&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid r=\r\ngb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_1362238784009_163=\r\n&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div=\r\n class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_1362238784009_164&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:t=\r\nimes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; =\r\n&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha P.V.R.

Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various age=\r\nndas engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purus=\r\nha is the witness of it all.&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Though each karma should =\r\ngive karmaphala that is commensurate with it, that requires an\n *agent* to\n=\r\n deliver the karmaphala, i.e. another\n being. So this\n requires a complicat=\r\ned balancing act on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. S=\r\nhakti). There are very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of ka=\r\nrmaphalas and picking of agents for their delivery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;At any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;must &lt;/span&gt;experience karmaphala in this life&quot; p=\r\nool, some karmas in a &quot;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;preferably &lt;/span=\r\n&gt;experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third pool wh=\r\nich may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigned and or=\r\ndered in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala sequenci=\r\nng of all beings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The assignment and ordering of=\r\n these pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in various new ac=\r\ntions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, pos=\r\nsibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents\n and sequencing may chang=\r\ne and hence the pools may be re-arranged.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As one engages in remedial measures suc=\r\nh as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, chang=\r\ne one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (inc=\r\nluding planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karma=\r\nphala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of deliv=\r\nery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable kar=\r\nmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the sa=\r\nme pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or push=\r\ned up in order within the same pool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;When someone cur=\r\nses or blesses one, with &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;sufficient &lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;mental force behind it (this is the key),\n the same thing &lt;span&gt;can &lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. Ev=\r\nery action by one, or even people around one, has the &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-s=\r\ntyle:italic;&quot;&gt;potential &lt;/span&gt;to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma ab=\r\nout to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give kar=\r\nmaphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, =\r\nremember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma that i=\r\nt is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force, but =\r\nyou need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a &lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;specific &lt;/span&gt;result, nobody can make one experie=\r\nnce &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;that &lt;/span&gt;result, no matter what r=\r\nitual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in =\r\ntheir optional pool and even evil people\n have a lot of positive karmas in =\r\ntheir optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can =\r\noften make some difference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This point is well i=\r\nllustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (=\r\n3).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If=\r\n one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistake=\r\nned. God is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towards those=\r\n who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness to the pl=\r\nay of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that impartial=\r\nly and impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this play o=\r\nf actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of =\r\nevil persons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced de=\r\nlivery of fruits to actions using\n available agents.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline and wil=\r\nl give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, with so=\r\nme effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing is=\r\n to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-sty=\r\nle:italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;span&gt;ow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Simply put, selfish actio=\r\nns and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and selfles=\r\ns actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are good kar=\r\nmas.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline o=\r\nf karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current action, =\r\nyes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in shastras, but w=\r\ne can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action. One thing is f=\r\nor sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be commensurate wi=\r\nth the karma\n itself.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You need only small force to push a cat =\r\nout of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_1362238784009_178&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);=\r\nfont-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-c=\r\nolor:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nof=\r\nollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_136223=\r\n8784009_179&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, =\r\nhelvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal=\r\n;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid =\r\nrgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_1362238784009_18=\r\n1&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:arial,\n helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;di=\r\nv class=3D&quot;yiv54243352yui_3_7_2_30_1362238784009_182&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:=\r\ntimes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;=\r\n &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nweight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ajit Krishnan &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailt=\r\no=3D&quot;mailto:ajit.krishnan@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:ajit.=\r\nkrishnan@...&quot;&gt;ajit.krishnan@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nweight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] few=\r\n questions&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv54243352&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv54243352ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n    =\r\n  \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear&nbsp;Digamber,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When a kingdom h=\r\nad no royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by the courtiers to ran=\r\ndomly pick the next king.

The beggar&#39;s karma mad=\r\ne him a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick=\r\n the king. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pic=\r\nk the king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom,=\r\n and accept the result.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaap=\r\na&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curses that we see are f=\r\nor the benefit of mankind, and are actually blessings. At the end of the da=\r\ny, some people with a certain amount of purity of speech discharge their ta=\r\npas shakti through speech.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When it comes to peop=\r\nle and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume that=\r\n there is a person, and separate from the person are his many karmas. These=\r\n karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We then want someone to=\r\n come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the sa=\r\nme thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing but your mind-impression=\r\ns ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have changed yo=\r\nur karma.
