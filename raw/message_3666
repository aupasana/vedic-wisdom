The place was full of bundles of old p=\r\napers\nand documents, which his father had decided to store there and which =\r\nrelated\nto lawsuits long-since settled. The children took one of the bundle=\r\ns down\nand made a fleet of paper boats out of it, which they then sailed in=\r\n the\ntemple tank.When Ramana=E2=80=99s father came home, he was furious, so=\r\n Ramana\nquickly made himself scarce. When he did not return for the midday =\r\nmeal, a\nsearch was organized. He was found sitting in the temple in the shr=\r\nine of\ngoddess Sahayambal (one of Shiva=E2=80=99s consorts),from whom he ha=\r\nd sought solace.\n\nOn another occasion Ramana went even further, he climbed =\r\ninto the house of a\nneighbouring lawyer and carried away some papers he fou=\r\nnd in a cupboard,\nunaware that they were important documents relating to a =\r\ncourt case. He\ninvented a game for himself,distributing the documents to pa=\r\nssers-by on the\nstreet, as if they\nwere advertising leaflets. When the lawy=\r\ner returned home and saw what had\nhappened, he demanded the papers back, bu=\r\nt it proved impossible to recover\nmany of them. Of course when he told Rama=\r\nna=E2=80=99s father what had happened, the\nlatter became very angry\nand sho=\r\nuted, =E2=80=9CUndress the boy! Shave his head completely and give him only=\r\n a\nloincloth to wear! Don=E2=80=99t give him any food!=E2=80=9D How far the=\r\n punishment was\ncarried out is, unfortunately, not reported.\n\nRamana, howev=\r\ner, in addition to his predilection for playing pranks, also\nhad a compassi=\r\nonate heart, as is illustrated by the following story, which\nhe later recou=\r\nnted himself, =E2=80=9COne day he [referring to a neighbouring boy\nthree ye=\r\nars his younger] got a sugarcane and a knife, and as he could not\ncut it hi=\r\nmself, he requested his brothers to help him, but they went away\nwithout he=\r\neding his request.\nHe began weeping. I felt sorry for him. I took the sugar=\r\ncane and tried to\ncut it. My finger got cut and began to bleed. Even so, I =\r\nfelt sorry for him\nbecause he was weeping and was a little fellow,so someho=\r\nw I managed to cut\nthe cane into pieces. I tied my finger with a wet cloth;=\r\n the bleeding,\nhowever did not stop.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe rite of Upanayama (putti=\r\nng on the sacred Brahmin thread) was performed\nwhen Ramana was around the a=\r\nge of eight, and he thus became a full member of\nthe Brahmin caste, but sti=\r\nll he showed no special spiritual inclination.\n\nAlthough this fortunate fam=\r\nily was no more religious than any other, there\nwas one peculiar feature in=\r\n its history. An old family legend tells how, one\nday, an ascetic came to t=\r\nhe house begging for food, but, against all\ntradition, he was not treated w=\r\nith the proper respect and was not given a\nmeal. The ascetic promptly issue=\r\nd a curse, stating that henceforth one\nmember of each generation of the fam=\r\nily would wander about begging as an\nascetic like himself.This =E2=80=98cur=\r\nse=E2=80=99 had its effect, because in each generation\none member renounced=\r\n worldly life to become a wandering ascetic. One of\nSundaram Iyer=E2=80=99s=\r\n uncles on his father=E2=80=99s side had taken the ochre robe, the\nstaff an=\r\nd the water jug of a sannyasin and had left to live life as a\nwandering ren=\r\nunciant and beggar. His elder brother Venkatesa also\ndisappeared from the v=\r\nillage one day, no doubt to embark upon the same path.\nHe was never heard o=\r\nf again and since that time Sundaram had been the head\nof the family.\n\nTher=\r\ne are no indications that Sundaram Iyer ever thought that one of his\nsons w=\r\nould one day also leave home. And no doubt the thought never crossed\nthe mi=\r\nnd of the young Ramana either.\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biograp=\r\nhy by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =\r\n=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd117680c3612047f12bff7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nNot a great deal is known about this period of Ramana=E2=80=99s =\r\nlife, but what is known makes it clear that he was a lively boy who liked t=\r\no play pranks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, when he was about six years old, he climbed =\r\nup to the loft of his house along with some friends.
