Which is better addressing problem/trait/duality directly or Devotion=\r\n to ishta devata?\n\n* * *\n\nOf late doing khadagamala strotra, i felt and rea=\r\nlized different kind of energy. I can say for sure that each strotra carrie=\r\ns different energy. \n\nEarlier in your post to someone you had suggested Dur=\r\nga strotra for rahu, as rahu is tamsic planet. To practically experience an=\r\nd experiment on this i got my chart analyzed my a astrologer, to know the r=\r\nemedies specific for me.\n\nHe said there are some major faults/trends. He as=\r\nked me to stop my other strotras as they dont direct address my problem. He=\r\n asked me read Aditya hrudayam, Sri rudram daily. I tried this and it does =\r\nhelp. I feel that addressing problem directly/precisely has faster effect.\n=\r\n\nMy question is my regular practice includes Ganapati atharvshirsham, Vishn=\r\nu sahastranaam, Narayan kavachh, Khadagmala, Navgrah strotra. \nI dotn want =\r\nto leave this, but at same time the the problems have piled up which i want=\r\n to solve. \n\n* * * \n\nWill appreciate if you can suggest the remedy for My c=\r\nhart\n- Moon in scorpio in sixth with mars, Sun with Saturn and Mercury in F=\r\nourth house, Venus in third (Mahadasa), Rahu in First in gemini, Venus maha=\r\ndasa, guru antar dasa (supposedly markesh) just started.\n\n\nregards\npriyank\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
