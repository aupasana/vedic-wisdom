This particular goddess, according to my gu=\r\nru, attracts others \nto a sadhaka and gives &quot;control and mastery&quot; over othe=\r\nrs.\n\nI want to share what I realized towards the end of sadhana, because th=\r\nat \nrealization MAY be helpful to some others.\n\n*        *        *\n\nDIFEER=\r\nENT TRAJECTORIES\n\nThere are beings that can give specific limited things, b=\r\nut the ultimate \ngoal of sadhana is liberation and sadhana of higher beings=\r\n eventually \ntransforms one and takes one closer to liberation. What these =\r\nhigher \nbeings are supposed to give in tradition is a simplificaation or \ns=\r\nymbolism of something sublime that takes towards liberation, from \n*differe=\r\nnt angles*.\n\nFor example, ability to work very hard (with no expectations o=\r\nf anything \nselfish in return), fine judgment and discrimination (that incr=\r\neases \ndetachment in one&#39;s actions), complete surrender to god (and \nwhole-=\r\nhearted acceptance of every life situation one finds oneself in), \nability =\r\nto focus mind (on a mantra or a deity and not let various \nthoughts distrac=\r\nt it), are all useful to a sadhaka. If one develops one \nof these 4 basic q=\r\nualities, other qualities will eventually develop. \nThey all lead to the sa=\r\nme thing - liberation - in the end, but the \ntrajectory is different.\n\nThes=\r\ne four basic paths constitute what are known as karma yoga \n(communion thro=\r\nugh action), jnana yoga (communion through wisdom), \nbhakti yoga (communion=\r\n through devotion) and raja yoga (communion \nthrough [self-]control). Howev=\r\ner, there are many sub-paths.\n\nBasically, different higher beings can incre=\r\nase a different fine quality \ninside one, which is conducive to liberation.=\r\n The trajectory is \ndifferent with each deity.\n\n*        *        *\n\nTOO MU=\r\nNDANE?\n\nThe higher being I worshipped is supposed to increase control and \n=\r\nmastery over others. While I did the sadhana in the last few months, I \nwon=\r\ndered how *that* can lead to liberation. After all, control and \nmastery ov=\r\ner others sounded too *mundane* to me to have anything to do \nwith liberati=\r\non. But a simple realization came towards the end of the \nsadhana.\n\n*      =\r\n  *        *\n\nCONTROL & FRICTION\n\nWhether A is attracted to B or B is attra=\r\ncted to A, the bottomline is \nthat objects A and B come together. The abili=\r\nty to attract others also \nmeans to come together with them.\n\nOne is unhapp=\r\ny with others and thinks of controlling them, when one&#39;s \nown agenda is mis=\r\n-aligned with their agenda. The friction between the \nagendas is the basis =\r\nfor the entire dynamics of likes, dislikes, \nfrustrations etc. Control of t=\r\nhat friction comes when the agendas are \nnicely aligned!\n\nAbility to contro=\r\nl the agenda pursued by someone else has limited use, \nscope and lifetime. =\r\nSuch an ability can work only with a limited set of \npeople or a limited am=\r\nount of time. This is like pumping rainwater from \nthe fields surrounding a=\r\n hill to the top of the hill. It requires a lot \nof energy that is proporti=\r\nonal to the area of the field and the amount \nof rainwater.\n\nThe best way t=\r\no avoid the friction, with ALL beings of the cosmos, is to \neliminate one&#39;s=\r\n own agenda! This is like removing the hill from the \nmiddle of the field, =\r\nin the above analogy.\n\nIf one has no agenda whatsoever, then there is no fr=\r\niction with anyone&#39;s \nagenda. There is no reason to like or dislike anyone =\r\nor find fault with \nor admire anyone. One can just observe others. Because =\r\none has no \nagenda, one can identify with the agendas of others and relate =\r\nto them \ncompletely. One can then put oneself completely in the shoes of ot=\r\nhers \nand feel their pleasures, pains etc.\n\nWhen one has an agenda and anot=\r\nher has another agenda, then there is \nfriction and one feels a need to &quot;co=\r\nntrol&quot; and remove friction. But, \nwhen one has no agenda and another has an=\r\n agenda, then there is no \nfriction. One can then completely &quot;understand&quot; t=\r\nhe perspective of the \nother (because there is no friction from one&#39;s own a=\r\ngenda stopping one \nfrom doing so!). What better mastery and control can on=\r\ne have on someone \nelse than be able to understand that person completely?!=\r\n\n\nThough what I described above is the end, one path to that end is to \nide=\r\nntify one&#39;s own agenda/conditioning that is resulting in friction, \nwheneve=\r\nr one is not happy with someone, and try to remove/suppress that \ncondition=\r\ning. One can first try this with a few people (e.g. spouse).\n\n*        *   =\r\n     *\n\nLOVE & COMPASSION FOR ALL\n\nBottomline is this: Control and mastery =\r\nover others does not mean making \nthem think and behave in tune with the ag=\r\nenda of one&#39;s own limited \nconditioning. Instead, it means overcoming&#39;s one=\r\n&#39;s own agendas and being \nable to put oneself in the shoes of anybody and u=\r\nnderstand and feel each \nof their feelings and emotions. It means unconditi=\r\nonal love and \ncompassion for all.\n\n*        *        *\n\nLOOKING DOWN ON OT=\r\nHERS\n\nWhen one is doing some sadhana, one of the stages one goes through ma=\r\ny \nbe to feel proud of one&#39;s sadhana, look at some others doing such a \nsad=\r\nhana favorably or with admiration and look down on others who are not \ndoin=\r\ng much sadhana (or doing a different sadhana!) and pursuing mundane \nthings=\r\n. This may be a natural tendency, but realize that this is a work \nof the l=\r\nimited personality or ego.\n\nOne has to overcome that tendency, for looking =\r\ndown on others will \neventually block one.\n\n*        *        *\n\nLOVING THE=\r\n DIVINE MOTHER\n\nPeople talk of loving the Divine Mother. The personality of=\r\n Divine \nMother is beyond one&#39;s perception. How can one really love Her the=\r\nn?\n\nOne may do tremendous sadhana and get tremendous visions and think that=\r\n \none has grasped the personality of Divine Mother, but what one perceives =\r\n\nis merely what one&#39;s conditioning fancies and is capable of grasping! \nThe=\r\n complete personality of Divine Mother is beyond anybody&#39;s \nperception.\n\nHo=\r\nwever, Divine Mother does manifest in a perceptible way as the cosmos. \nEve=\r\nry being in the cosmos is a limited manifestation of Her. Being able \nto lo=\r\nve every being is the FIRST step in truly loving the Divine Mother.\n\nLoving=\r\n someone because they are doing some good work (as we see it!) or \nbecause =\r\nthey have something we need (as we see it!) etc, is *egoistic* \nloving. Suc=\r\nh love is *conditioned* by the agendas of a limited ego. Such \nlove cannot =\r\nextend to entire cosmos and permanently. The only love that \ncan extend to =\r\nentire cosmos and be permanent is unconditional love of \nall beings.\n\nThat =\r\ncomes only when one has no agenda and no expectations from anyone.\n\nBest re=\r\ngards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nTwitter ID: @homam108\n--------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n\n \r\n--2118110249-303566225-1331288147=:77323\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is wr=\r\nong in having good agenda like doing havan regualrily &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;span&gt;though friends in&nbsp; our&nbsp; room may not like that&nbsp;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this case can I drop the idea of doing havan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,tim=\r\nes,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new=\r\n york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Friday, 9 March 2012 5:51 =\r\nAM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wis=\r\ndom]\n Liberation, Control &amp; Love&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1=\r\n397940798&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    =\r\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1397940798ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Namaste friend=\r\ns,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI recently finished a specific sadhana of a specific form of Di=\r\nvine &lt;br&gt;\nMother.

Instead, it means overc=\r\noming&#39;s one&#39;s own agendas and being &lt;br&gt;\nable to put oneself in the shoes o=\r\nf anybody and understand and feel each &lt;br&gt;\nof their feelings and emotions.=\r\n It means unconditional love and &lt;br&gt;\ncompassion for all.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*       =\r\n *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLOOKING DOWN ON OTHERS&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen one is doing some=\r\n sadhana, one of the stages one goes through may &lt;br&gt;\nbe to feel proud of o=\r\nne&#39;s sadhana, look at some others doing such a &lt;br&gt;\nsadhana favorably or wi=\r\nth admiration and look down on others who are not &lt;br&gt;\ndoing much sadhana (=\r\nor doing a different sadhana!) and pursuing mundane &lt;br&gt;\nthings. This may b=\r\ne a natural tendency, but realize that this is a work &lt;br&gt;\nof the limited p=\r\nersonality or ego.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne has to overcome that tendency, for looking =\r\ndown on others will &lt;br&gt;\neventually block one.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLOVING THE DIVINE MOTHER&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPeople talk of loving the Divin=\r\ne Mother. The personality of Divine &lt;br&gt;\nMother is beyond one&#39;s perception.=\r\n How can one really love Her then?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne may do tremendous sadhana a=\r\nnd get tremendous visions and think that &lt;br&gt;\none has grasped the personali=\r\nty of Divine Mother, but what one perceives &lt;br&gt;\nis merely what one&#39;s condi=\r\ntioning fancies and is capable of grasping! &lt;br&gt;\nThe complete personality o=\r\nf Divine Mother is beyond anybody&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\nperception.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever, Divi=\r\nne Mother does manifest in a perceptible way as the cosmos. &lt;br&gt;\nEvery bein=\r\ng in the cosmos is a limited manifestation of Her. Being able &lt;br&gt;\nto love =\r\nevery being is the FIRST step in truly loving the Divine Mother.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nL=\r\noving someone because they are doing some good work (as we see it!) or &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nbecause they have something we need (as we see it!) etc, is *egoistic* &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nloving. Such love is *conditioned* by the agendas of a limited ego. Such =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nlove cannot extend to entire cosmos and permanently. The only love tha=\r\nt &lt;br&gt;\ncan extend to entire cosmos and be permanent is unconditional love o=\r\nf &lt;br&gt;\nall beings.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThat comes only when one has no agenda and no e=\r\nxpectations from anyone.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n---------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish Softw=\r\nare, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual ma=\r\nnuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                   &lt;a rel=3D&quot;n=\r\nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n   Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollo=\r\nw&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;=\r\n&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                    =\r\n  Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; =\r\n&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--2118110249-303566225-1331288147=:77323--\r\n\n"}}
