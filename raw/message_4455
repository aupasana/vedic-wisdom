Note\n&gt; that most priests these days let YOU participate in the homam and\n&gt; constantly guide you on every aspect of the homam. It just makes it more\n&gt; convenient.\n \nThe catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or any ritual) once every 6 months or so is unlikely to cause any considerable material or spiritual benefit. Given the kind of kaarmik blockages most people have, persistent sadhana over a period of time is needed and one event cannot fix things.\n \nAs one does a sadhana (homam or japam or any ritual) everyday or atleast every weekend, it will tilt the scales in one&#39;s favor over the time and start fixing material problems and enabling one&#39;s spiritual evolution.\n \nIf one has access and is able to engage a priest everyday or every weekend, what you said is a fine strategy.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; One point I want to make is that priests may have fallen just like rest\n&gt; of us , but they are also human living in the same world or rather same\n&gt; Yuga as we are! I feel a priest with reasonable desires of taking care\n&gt; of his daily needs and his family need not be shunned although he is\n&gt; doing rituals for the sake of money/tips/gifts.\n \nAbsolutely. We should have nothing against them. Giving them money or helping them or engaging them is perfectly noble. My only point is that *most* (though not all) of them have no ability to give a boost to the material and spiritual pursuit of others (like many priests of old days did) and hence people should not leave the remedying of their problem completely to the priest (they are very likely to be disappointed that way). If they realize that they are on their own and do something about it, they are more likely to succeed over time.\n \n*        *        *\n \nJyotisha readings that you talk about the end are a different ball game. They are mostly an intellectual exercise and can be done well by one without spiritual energy. But, doing a ritual for someone and giving a boost to one&#39;s material and spiritual pursuits (using one&#39;s own spiritual energy by using the ritual as a tool) is a spiritual exercise and one without a good level of spiritual energy cannot do it well. These days, people hardly have enough spiritual energy to fix their own blockages and how can they take care of others?\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; I apologize if I offended you.

I feel a priest with reasonable desires of taking care\n&gt; of his daily needs and his family need not be shunned although he is\n&gt; doing rituals for the sake of money/tips/gifts. When we do rituals for\n&gt; the sake of fulfulling our desires I see no harm in priest doing the\n&gt; same for his personal gains. He has put in so much of efforts memorizing\n&gt; tons of Vedic verses , procedures and rituals. In the old days people\n&gt; used to take care of priests and make donations to priests. In today&#39;s\n&gt; democratic world priest has bills to pay and make ends meet with this\n&gt; earnings!  The government does not care much about them.How should he\n&gt; survive ?\n&gt; \n&gt; You have provided details on how homam should be done and also gave very\n&gt; valid reasons on why it will not have negative effects when done with\n&gt; sincerity, humilty and with a sense of surrender. That&#39;s wonderful and\n&gt; it&#39;s great deal of information for people who have reservations on doing\n&gt; homam by themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would still go to a priest for doing homam. Why ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of going through an online manual I get a live person with\n&gt; experience who can help me setup the homam the ingredients needed. Note\n&gt; that most priests these days let YOU participate in the homam and\n&gt; constantly guide you on every aspect of the homam. It just makes it more\n&gt; convenient. Utimately its my sincerity, devotion and attitude that\n&gt; matters to the diety being invoked in the homam. I also get the\n&gt; satisfaction of helping out the priest by using his services and thus\n&gt; supporting the priest community. I was born in a Brahman family , rather\n&gt; I was born in a family whose ancestors were Brahmans. My father had a\n&gt; full time job and I&#39;m a software engineer working for a paycheck. So as\n&gt; you can see clearly neither my father nor myself qualify to be a\n&gt; Brahmans. Quite frankly , I see sons of priests today do not want to\n&gt; become priests anymore. They want to get into college, get degrees and\n&gt; get a job! So in my humble opinion we need to support the priests as\n&gt; much. The current generation of priests may not be great Sadhakas, but\n&gt; you must give it to them for still continuing to do what they are doing.\n&gt; Me and my family have had good experiences with priests although I agree\n&gt; there are greedy ones out there.  Its a mattery of finding the right\n&gt; priest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Same goes with Jyotishis. A full time Jyotishi (I&#39;m talking about \n&gt; genuine Jyotishis like yourself or Shri KN Rao and his advanced\n&gt; students) who has put tons and tons of efforts in learning Jyotish and\n&gt; continue to do so. I see no harm if you or anyone I mentioned charge\n&gt; their clients. Infact I feel happy to pay genuine astrologers with a\n&gt; great sense of  gratitude with a feeling that the money is nothing\n&gt; compared to the great service they are doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I apologize if I offended you. I&#39;m a nobody compared to you. I do\n&gt; understand and acknowledge the amount of contribution you&#39;ve made in\n&gt; Jyotish and other areas of Sanathan Dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; J\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In mature hands, a knife can heal (surgeon&#39;s)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT in immature and evil hands, the same knife would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; commit a punishable crime (Murderer!)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree fully and hopefully that resonates with what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you were trying to express, in a borader and general\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sense, at least partly so.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It does. But I am trying make one more crucial point. Let me make it\n&gt; using an analogy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Atleast in US, we have child-proof scissors that cut paper/cloth but\n&gt; do not cut the finger even if a child accidentally puts finger in it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In an age when children did not need to use scissors and parents did\n&gt; scissors work for them, these kind of scissors weren&#39;t needed. Now, with\n&gt; parents being busy or otherwise unable to help, children need to use\n&gt; scissors for their homework sometimes. So the market came up with\n&gt; child-proof scissors that are safe and do not cut fingers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Simialrly, remedies were done by trained experts (priests) in the\n&gt; past. As the priest class started to become weak and unable to help\n&gt; laymen, Nature is evolving things so that laymen are enabled and safely\n&gt; too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the old days, ruling kshatriya class contained very dharmik kings\n&gt; who were unselfish and used the power and authority vested in them to\n&gt; provide prosperity to their subjects and render selfless justice. As\n&gt; Kali yuga advanced and the kshatriya class became selfish, self-serving\n&gt; and incapable, Nature gave rise to an evolution and people became\n&gt; responsible for governing themselves. Kings who rule for their entire\n&gt; life are slowly fading away from the surface of earth and democracy is\n&gt; taking root everywhere, where kings change in every few years.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, priest class of old days contained genuine braahmanas who\n&gt; did sadhana, realized god and were selfless and used the energy they\n&gt; accumulated through sadhana to provide prosperity, material and\n&gt; spiritual, to people around them selflessly. As Kali yuga advances and\n&gt; the braahmana class becomes selfish, self-serving and incapable, Nature\n&gt; is giving rise to an evolution and people are responsible for their own\n&gt; remedies and sadhana for material prosperity and spiritual evolution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But it is not so bad. Nature is very kind. Nature makes easy and safe\n&gt; tools available to laymen before its tells them &quot;you&#39;re on your own&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; People are suffering from terrible material problems now-a-days and\n&gt; also starving for good spiritual direction.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Based on old habits, they instinctively expect someone else to fix\n&gt; their problems. They think that getting a pooja or homam done by a\n&gt; priest for a couple of hours oneday or getting a &quot;charged&quot; yantra and\n&gt; rudraksha maalaa will magically cure their problems. Unfortunately, it\n&gt; is not so simple today. If there is a sadhaka who does enough sadhana\n&gt; and &quot;charges&quot; an object such as a yantra or a maalaa or an idol with\n&gt; that energy and gives it to you, you can indeed benefit from it. But\n&gt; gone are those days and gone are those people. Remember, you&#39;re on your\n&gt; own!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Forget special yantras, forget special maalaas, forget special idols,\n&gt; and forget rituals done by priests. Have faith, have confidence and do\n&gt; sadhana by yourself on a regular basis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The most effective and safest sadhana to do by oneself is homam (fire\n&gt; ritual). Download the homam manuals (see site below) and try a homam on\n&gt; a regular basis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Or pick a mantra and do japam with it mentally everyday for an hour or\n&gt; so, while sitting still with closed eyes and an erect back. If your\n&gt; knees hurt, sit on a chair or sofa comfortably, but keep the back\n&gt; straight and eyes closed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are many generic mantras (see my original mail at the bottom for\n&gt; a sample list) that are appliable to everybody and can solve ALL\n&gt; problems. For example, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra explicitly says it can\n&gt; solve ANY problem. Instead of looking for a &quot;perfect mantra\n&gt; recommendation&quot;, you can pick a generic mantra like that and start\n&gt; sadhana. The key is faith and persistence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, small amount energy\n&gt; may be enough to move it away. If it is the size of a big boulder on the\n&gt; other hand, much more energy may be needed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All that is in your hands is to do sadhana with faith and persistence.\n&gt; And, remember, no effort is ever wasted. Every effort bears a fruit of\n&gt; comparable size eventually.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, you may be looking for a shortcut, but there is NONE. And\n&gt; sadhana is not so bad. Even before it solves your actual problem, the\n&gt; first thing sadhana does to you is: it gives you the courage to face the\n&gt; problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing sadhana and selfless surrender to the supreme being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is of course ideal, but not tenable in the current times\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the majority of the humans.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nothing is untenable. Though selfless surrender makes sadhana more\n&gt; efficient, sadhana without selfless surrender is also fine!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even if one&#39;s mind is filled with reasonable material desires\n&gt; (marriage, children, job, health etc), one can still do sadhana. Sadhana\n&gt; then takes care of one&#39;s material and spiritual needs and increases\n&gt; surrender and selflessness in one *over the time*.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: Good sadhana increases selfless surrender and selfless\n&gt; surrender promotes better sadhana. This is a positive feedback loop. One\n&gt; should somehow or the other break through. Break the impasse and just\n&gt; start some sadhana. Don&#39;t fear that something bad will happen or that\n&gt; you will not be able to do it. Just pick a sadhana and take the plunge!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And we need well-meaning people who are immersed in sadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves to come forward and show us the way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is what we are trying to do here..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Every mandala in RigVeda starts with hymns to Fire. Fire was\n&gt; worshipped by ancient people such as Zorostrains, Vedic rishis and\n&gt; ancient Greco-Romans. Even progressive modern paths such as Buddhism and\n&gt; Arya Samaj accept fire worship. Fire is a living representation of\n&gt; divinity on earth and spending time worshipping god in fire has a\n&gt; magical and purifying impact on one&#39;s consciousness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try homam every day\n&gt; or or every weekend for a few months and see for oneself what it does to\n&gt; one.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinicrystal&quot; jyotish_vani@\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What I read in your posting is the simple fact that:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In mature hands, a knife can heal (surgeon&#39;s)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or feed those who choose animal proteins for whatever reasons\n&gt; (Butcher&#39;s)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT in immature and evil hands, the same knife would commit a\n&gt; punishable crime (Murderer!)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So it is not the mantra, ritual but the INTENT and the person who is\n&gt; wielding the knife (III, to keep it simple!) that is important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree fully and hopefully that resonates with what you were trying\n&gt; to express, in a borader and general sense, at least partly so.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ranjan\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jyotishi&quot; raj@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO for a profession to progress, you need art, science and\n&gt; commerce to work together in tandem.

But what if the dal I made has some germs.\n&gt; Is it OK to eat the dal and fall sick or better starve till you know how\n&gt; to make a clean good meal ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; J\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Astrologers routinely recommend remedial measures involving\n&gt; mantras and poojas and people spend a lot of money on them. Do they\n&gt; work? I will give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and\n&gt; insights. I will be honest, straight-forward and blunt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though believers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope\n&gt; that their problems will be solved, many priests today are incapable of\n&gt; producing any results. As a result, some believers got accustomed to\n&gt; accepting that a pudding exists even without eating it and remain hungry\n&gt; throughout life. And some intelligent people stopped believing in god\n&gt; and in remedies. Let me first address why this has come to be and then\n&gt; talk about what we should do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In ancient times, caste system was not as rigid as it is\n&gt; today. One&#39;s varna was decided based on one&#39;s aptitude. One primarily\n&gt; interested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana. One\n&gt; primarily interested in power, authority and control over others would\n&gt; be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One\n&gt; primarily interested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would\n&gt; start off with the varna of one&#39;s father, as that is what one is exposed\n&gt; to in childhood. However, as one&#39;s vasana (mental conditioning) blooms,\n&gt; one would get one&#39;s own varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for\n&gt; example, can later turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born\n&gt; a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for example, can later turn into a Brahmana\n&gt; and become a Maharshi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be\n&gt; interested in knowledge and spiritual progress and not caring about\n&gt; power, influence, money, pleasures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure\n&gt; and accumulated enough spiritual energy through continuous sadhana over\n&gt; years and were capable of performing very effective poojas for people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today, people who have spiritual potential may be born in\n&gt; non-Brahmana families and not allowed to develop fully due to the rigid\n&gt; caste structures. Some people born in Brahmana families may also end up\n&gt; getting into modern careers and not developing fully as Brahmanas. Some\n&gt; people may be born in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/Shudra\n&gt; tendencies and may end up becoming priests who are interested in power,\n&gt; authority and control over others, money and physical pleasures. Those\n&gt; priests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. true\n&gt; Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine\n&gt; sadhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check\n&gt; given by one for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account\n&gt; is empty, what good is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will\n&gt; bounce. Similarly, poojas done and blessings given by a priest without\n&gt; enough spiritual energy cannot bring one any benefits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One important note: The power is not in a combination of\n&gt; syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power\n&gt; is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a\n&gt; sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind\n&gt; overcomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing.\n&gt; Different mantras and rituals as the focus points may generate different\n&gt; kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual\n&gt; produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are\n&gt; just engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas. In the old\n&gt; days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the table\n&gt; when they did rituals at the houses of people or in temples.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did see priests who have done good sadhana, purified\n&gt; themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But those are getting rarer\n&gt; and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on finding such a\n&gt; priest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given this, one is better off not depending on the\n&gt; priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing against the\n&gt; &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana\n&gt; family myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by\n&gt; birth&quot; class. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste -\n&gt; develop into true Brahmanas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possibly proud of his\n&gt; skills and thinking about money and possibly not identifying with your\n&gt; trouble, you can do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your\n&gt; identification with the trouble and your desire to solve the problem\n&gt; will be better than the priest. If you manage to generate enough focus\n&gt; after practice, the mantra/ritual may actually produce some result.\n&gt; There is no harm in trying.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people think that poojas to gods are a serious matter and\n&gt; only a trained priest should do them. The procedures have evolved to\n&gt; become quite complicated over the time too!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, complexity of rituals should never be a deterrent.\n&gt; Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams\n&gt; of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access\n&gt; to such balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a\n&gt; balanced meal or will you manage with whatever you have? If you just\n&gt; have a bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You\n&gt; atleast get some energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a\n&gt; mantra/ritual, you need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can\n&gt; start with what you know. It will only give you energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from\n&gt; the notion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is\n&gt; not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and rituals\n&gt; and get specific results. When used by someone with a high level of\n&gt; spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give\n&gt; specific powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost)\n&gt; such things in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will give an analogy. A machine gun and a stick can be used\n&gt; to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one using a machine gun\n&gt; needs to be very careful. One needs to learn well, practice well and\n&gt; then use it, lest one should hurt oneself by accident.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, suppose the house lord purposely removed ammunition\n&gt; from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick and not risky.\n&gt; Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use the machine\n&gt; gun, just take it and start beating your enemies with it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ammunition&quot; has purposely been removed from most targeted\n&gt; mantras and rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for\n&gt; perfect knowledge, one can start using them right away.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A lot of technicalities related to mantras and rituals are\n&gt; irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to be taken up with faith,\n&gt; devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicalities one can\n&gt; realistically follow should be followed and emphasis should be placed on\n&gt; devotion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one&#39;s\n&gt; devotion and focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may\n&gt; come.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we\n&gt; cannot expect specific results to come in specific counts of recitation.\n&gt; So we should just do the best job we can and leave the result to god,\n&gt; who decides when and what result should be given.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in the end. Every\n&gt; sincere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or the\n&gt; other!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of\n&gt; different shapes. They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a\n&gt; begging bowl you use, you may be given different kind of alms. But it is\n&gt; important to start begging with some begging bowl or the other, instead\n&gt; of spending years looking for the perfect begging bowl.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or\n&gt; ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual, do\n&gt; what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder you respect)\n&gt; tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra,\n&gt; Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa,\n&gt; Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s\n&gt; shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s\n&gt; ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga\n&gt; saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa&#39;s\n&gt; navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotra\n&gt; etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purpose.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation,\n&gt; perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the\n&gt; other with a sincere heart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your effort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or\n&gt; you may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus\n&gt; will improve.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this context, I want to say a few words about homam, the\n&gt; sadhana of rishis.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the\n&gt; elements of earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies\n&gt; whatever it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is\n&gt; paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has access\n&gt; to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purifies one&#39;s subtle\n&gt; consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other sadhanas in\n&gt; improving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner personality and removing\n&gt; material and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for\n&gt; granted. One can try for oneself for a few months. The proof of the\n&gt; pudding is in eating it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regularly, for the\n&gt; benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece &quot;Brihat\n&gt; Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Kali yuga, for\n&gt; guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended\n&gt; various types of homam as remedial measures for various problems in the\n&gt; horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara\n&gt; asked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fire and\n&gt; did not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra\n&gt; to beused in homam. Parasara&#39;s clear teachings set to rest the notion\n&gt; that some people have, that homam is not for Kali yuga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM\n&gt; japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I am japa among all sacrifices. Some people use\n&gt; this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior to homa/yajna.\n&gt; Let me put that in perspective.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the line just above that line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am\n&gt; Om among all mantras&quot;. However, do we only meditate with the supreme\n&gt; mantra &quot;Om&quot; and leave all other mantras?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of\n&gt; climbing a mountain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it\n&gt; using various kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process\n&gt; to reach the pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, Om is the supreme of all mantras being the source\n&gt; of all, but reaching the source may require using several mantras first\n&gt; to purify oneself. Meditating and absorbing consciousness in the Supreme\n&gt; (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but it may require purification and\n&gt; preparation by engaging in other kinds of sacrifices (hama/yajna).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one does homam or yajna, one is engaging in external\n&gt; actions and one is unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in the\n&gt; Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits still\n&gt; and contemplates), one may reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself,\n&gt; homam is far more effective.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Detailed manuals giving short procedures for doing various\n&gt; types of homam by oneself are available on the website given below. You\n&gt; can use the resources on that website to perform several kinds of short\n&gt; homam by yourself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now *hundreds* of people are performing homam by themselves\n&gt; either daily or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Manish (my spiritual guru - a small write-up on him can\n&gt; be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e.\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481) told me that\n&gt; the Divine Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi homam at a\n&gt; temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him to spread a simplified\n&gt; homam ritual around the world, and showed him that hundreds of thousands\n&gt; of people would be performing regular homam in a few years, thus helping\n&gt; reverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite\n&gt; far-fetched to my rational mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, just 4 years after the Mother&#39;s command, hundreds of\n&gt; people are already performing regular homam. Though these are just the\n&gt; early days, the developments are amazing. Some of them are laymen who\n&gt; never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It\n&gt; is a miracle that such people are doing a homam everyday, like the\n&gt; rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that some people\n&gt; doing homam for a couple of years are actually starting to experience\n&gt; things within and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid\n&gt; internal transformation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell\n&gt; anything to anyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just freely\n&gt; share what I know, what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The rest\n&gt; is not in my hands.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite those who\n&gt; have even an iota of interest to check out the homam website! If one\n&gt; gets into the habit of performing homam regularly, it has the great\n&gt; potential to transform one&#39;s life, materially and spiritually..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Homam website:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
