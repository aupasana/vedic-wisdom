They are the object of=\r\n worship by millions\nof people whom you may call =91Hindus=92.  We look upo=\r\nn these deities as the\nUltimate TRUTH, the Absolute one, in your words the =\r\n=93God=94 Himself.\n\n\n\nThus, we view this latest episode of selling shoes wi=\r\nth these pictures as a\nblatant denigration of oldest living Spirituality fr=\r\nom which all the religions originated.\nTherefore, I like to point out to yo=\r\nu that your actions are very insulting to all\n=93Hindus=94 and =93Hinduism=\r\n=94. It is extremely hurting the pace loving people, the\nso-called Hindus a=\r\nll over the world.\n\n\n\nIt is puzzling to us how a reputed company like Conve=\r\nrse can be so\nirresponsible and childish to put such pictures on the shoes.=\r\n If you are very\nmuch interested in doing so, i.e., putting pictures why do=\r\n not you put a\npicture of Christ or Mohammad on the shoes and see what happ=\r\nens?
