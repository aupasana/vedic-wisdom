Always one hesitates as regards the instinctiv=\r\ne actions of the\nunregenerate; one never refers to what may compromise othe=\r\nrs, but attends to\ntheir righteous deeds. One does gentle deeds that pain n=\r\none; always dreads\nsin and avoids all forms of sense-gratification.\n\n7. Suc=\r\nh a one=E2=80=99s speech is informed by affection and love; it is lovely an=\r\nd\nfit, with due regard to time and place.\n\n8. With proper thought, act and =\r\nspeech, one waits upon the virtuous. Getting\nthem from all conceivable sour=\r\nces, one studies the Shastras.\n\n9-10(a). Then one attains the first stage o=\r\nf Yoga. Whoever entertains such\nthoughts as regards the crossing of transmi=\r\ngratory life is said to have\nattained a state of Yoga. The rest are said to=\r\n be just =E2=80=98noble=E2=80=99 (arya).\n\n10(b)-11. Coming to the next stag=\r\ne of Yoga, called =E2=80=98Analysis=E2=80=99 (vichara), the\nsadhaka resorts=\r\n to the foremost scholars, well-known for their serious\ninterpretations of =\r\nSruti and Smriti, good conduct, fixed attention,\ncontemplation and activiti=\r\nes.\n\n18. As a result of his meritorious actions, the righteous (sadhaka) pa=\r\nsses\nhis time in the delights of detachment, repeatedly studying the positi=\r\nve\nShastras.\n\n23. =E2=80=98Enjoyments and non-enjoyments are dread diseases=\r\n; possessions are great\ndisasters. All contacts just promote separation. Su=\r\nfferings are diseases of\nthoughts=E2=80=99.\n\n27. The first stage that occur=\r\ns is sweet on account of the satisfaction and\njoy (that attend it). The sad=\r\nhaka (puman) has just stepped into the sequence\nof states. The first is an =\r\nambrosial sprout.\n\n28. The first stage is the internal, cleansed, birth-pla=\r\nce of the other\nstages. Thence one attains the second and third stages.\n\n29=\r\n. Among these, the all-pervading third (stage) is superior. Here the\nsadhak=\r\na has outgrown all proneness to imagine (and get ensnared).\n\n30. Those who =\r\nreach the fourth (stage) after the dwindling of nescience\nthrough the exerc=\r\nises of the three stages look on all things with the same\neye.\n\n31. When no=\r\nn-duality is established and duality dissolved, those who have\nreached the =\r\nfourth stage look upon the phenomenal world as a dream.\n\n32. The first thre=\r\ne states are said to be the waking state; the fourth is\ncalled the dream st=\r\nate. And the mind dissolves like the fragments of an\nautumnal cloud.\n\n34. R=\r\neaching the fifth stage called =E2=80=98deep sleep=E2=80=99, the sadhaka re=\r\nmains as\npure non-dual being, all particulars having completely vanished.\n\n=\r\n35. Having reached the fifth stage, one stays consolidated in deep sleep,\nj=\r\noyful, inwardly awake, all dual appearances gone.\n\n36. Looking inwards, eve=\r\nn when attending to outer things, he appears always\nindrawn, being extremel=\r\ny exhausted.\n\n37. Practising in this fifth stage, free from all innate impu=\r\nlses, one\nreaches, as a matter of course, the sixth stage named =E2=80=98th=\r\ne Fourth=E2=80=99.\n\n38. Where there is neither the non-existent nor the exi=\r\nstent, neither the\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 nor the non-=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, wit=\r\nh all analytic thinking gone, one stays alone,\ntotally fearless, in non-dua=\r\nlity.\n\n40. Having dwelt in the sixth stage, he shall reach the seventh. The=\r\n state\nof disembodied liberation is called the seventh stage of Yoga.\n\n47-4=\r\n8. Therefore, thou sinless one, renouncing everything, be devoted to\nTruth.=\r\n Think: I am Brahman, solid Intelligence and Bliss, free from\nimpurity, hol=\r\ny, lifted above mind and words, beyond the darkness of\nignorance, beyond al=\r\nl appearances. This is the secret doctrine.\n\nSource: http://www.celextel.or=\r\ng/108upanishads/akshi.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016361e8758d5506c049d6b9b32\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13px; COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); FONT-FAMILY: Verdana,=\r\n Arial, sans-serif&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;MARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3=\r\nem&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Translated by Dr. A.
