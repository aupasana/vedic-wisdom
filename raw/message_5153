The \nonly major point where=\r\n I disagree is whether one can do Sri Sri Chandi path \n*without initiation*=\r\n. The rest of the confusion on translation of mantras needs \nsome clarifica=\r\ntion as there seems to be some unnecessary confusion. A few \npointers:\n\n1. =\r\nThere are various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas =\r\n\netc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, st=\r\notras, \nkavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahama=\r\nntras and \nmantras. The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as =\r\nmantras.\n\n2. Undoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the orig=\r\ninal. Reading a \ntranslation is not even comparable to chanting the origina=\r\nl chant. So far it is \nfine.\n\n3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all =\r\nbased on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes \na distinction between them.\n\n4. As per=\r\n the traditional view one doesn&#39;t need to be initiated to chant a \nstotra o=\r\nr dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras \ncontaining =\r\nbijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need \ninitiation. Th=\r\nis is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not \nthe same=\r\n as these other mantras that need initiation, which are generally \nreferred=\r\n to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the \nactual =\r\nidea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct \nspiri=\r\ntual specialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such \n=\r\nas Kali or Sri.\n\n5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc =\r\ndo not need initiation \nas they fall under stotra category only. Lalitasaha=\r\nsranama and Devi Mahatmyam \nare traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras =\r\nor parts of puranas. They have a \nlarger status as integral parts of a Maha=\r\nvidya sadhana. Chanting them without \ninitiation is not recommended especia=\r\nlly when the reader combines the navarna or \nshodashi mantras too as an int=\r\negral part of the chanting.\n\n6. I know from personal interaction that achar=\r\nyas belonging to both Kanchi as \nwell as Sringeri paramparas recommend init=\r\niation for both the sadhanas of Sri \nSri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with th=\r\neir respective NAVAKSHARI AND \nSHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as a=\r\nn INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the \nsadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions h=\r\nold that one needs to be initiated \nto chant the Navarna as well as shodash=\r\nakshari mantras.\n\n7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great=\r\n text that has an \nindependent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It =\r\nis simultaneously a \nMahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in=\r\n the spirit of the \nUpanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an inte=\r\ngral part of Sri Sri \nChandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs t=\r\no be initiated to chant it. \nHowever if one wishes to benefit from the Yoga=\r\n-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of \nthe Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacre=\r\nd myth in the vernacular has been \nrecommended in my write-up, as chanting =\r\nthe original along with the navakshari \namounts to practicing the sadhana o=\r\nf a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommended \nto be initiated and go throu=\r\ngh the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.\n\n8. Arguably if an uni=\r\nnitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original \nSanskrit as part =\r\nof the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an \ninherent prob=\r\nlem in our times. The problem with attempting to do a parayana of \nDevi Mah=\r\natmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers \ninadvert=\r\nently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the \nSiddh=\r\nakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.\n\n9. I you carefully per=\r\nuse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, \nnowhere do I pu=\r\nt down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I \nattempted to wri=\r\nte a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the \npower of th=\r\ne original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know \nthe e=\r\nssence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. \n=\r\nInfact `artha&#39; is the import, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a translation! \n\n\n1=\r\n0. For those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, =\r\n\nthere is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain level =\r\nof \nsamskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it.=\r\n \nOtherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please =\r\nkeep \ndoing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadha=\r\nna. As \nNarasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the =\r\nsadhana \nWITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself wi=\r\nll reduce a \nlot of the potential problem. Things will happen on their own =\r\naccord in the \nnatural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess. \n=\r\n\n\nHope the above pointers help in clearing any confusion. \n\nRegards,\nSatya =\r\nPrakash \n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, h ramalingam &lt;hram=\r\nalingam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; I want to share one anecdote ha=\r\nppened in front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri\n&gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi =\r\nSwamigal\n&gt; When Swamigal was staying in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One=\r\n day all the\n&gt; learned persons male and female alike\n&gt; requested Swamigal t=\r\no translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in kannada language\n&gt; so that they can =\r\nchant knowing the meaning fully.\n&gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request wh=\r\nich was made early in the morning.\n&gt; Later in the day after the days pooja =\r\netc were over as usual Postman came to\n&gt; camp to deliver the posts came to =\r\nKanchi Mutt Swamigal. Swamigal was\n&gt; seriously looking at the cover\n&gt; in fr=\r\nont of the learned members and was looking at one line written as PIN\n&gt; Cod=\r\ne and followed by six numbers. Then he asked the learned members to\n&gt; expla=\r\nin the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell that. But everyone\n&gt; under=\r\nstood the significance of that number. Then swamigal asked his crew\n&gt; membe=\r\nr to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his library and read\n&gt; the=\r\n meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that even the meaning\n&gt; =\r\nof PINCode was not known to the group and still it serves the purpose and\n&gt;=\r\n people are using it in day to day work. Similarly not knowing the meaning =\r\nof\n&gt; Vishnu Saharanamam will not take away the benefits of chanting the sto=\r\nthsram\n&gt; was he told the group. Hope the above incidence bring some clue to=\r\n our\n&gt; discussion forum\n&gt; RamanaPatham\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Oct 26, 2010 at 9=\r\n:10 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Girish,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not at all against knowing the meaning, so that one can immerse=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; oneself in what one is chanting. That is definitely the ideal situatio=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If that is not possible, what I am saying is that reading someth=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; composed by an elevated being even without understanding the meanin=\r\ng is very\n&gt; &gt; useful. Suppose someone does not understand what Ganapathi At=\r\nharvaseersham\n&gt; &gt; means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the =\r\nsource of\n&gt; &gt; everything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapat=\r\nhi. One can\n&gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anythin=\r\ng, it is more\n&gt; &gt; likely because one does not have the correct attitude and=\r\n surrender and\n&gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the specific meaning =\r\nof Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the meaning and chant=\r\ning may also\n&gt; &gt; experience nothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realize=\r\nd soul have meanings at many layers and\n&gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one sup=\r\nerficial layer. Some important layers are\n&gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most=\r\n important layers of meaning are never\n&gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but o=\r\nnly experienced internally.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning or not, ch=\r\nant the mantra with a calm and\n&gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and surre=\r\nnder. Many people keep a target\n&gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it mech=\r\nanically with a sense of duty. If it\n&gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of =\r\nlove and surrender to the deity, it can do\n&gt; &gt; something. The key to succes=\r\ns with a mantra is calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; mind is filled with thous=\r\nands of thoughts and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; one of those thousa=\r\nnd activities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts\n&gt; &gt; subside and mind i=\r\ns essentially reverberating with a mantra, that is when\n&gt; &gt; one experiences=\r\n a mantra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, phy=\r\nsical vibration is\n&gt; &gt; accompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mi=\r\nnd, the thoughts and\n&gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind =\r\netc. Some mantras composed\n&gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (esse=\r\nntially beings with very stable\n&gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such that =\r\nthe physical vibration of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; can eventually cause the correspon=\r\nding imagery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; &gt; when other mental activity subsi=\r\ndes. Thus, after repeating the mantra and\n&gt; &gt; calming the mind down, you ca=\r\nn recreate a certain imagery and thought system\n&gt; &gt; in your mind. That can =\r\npermanently alter the way your mind workd. But the\n&gt; &gt; key is to attain a r=\r\neasonably stable, focused and calm mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi=\r\n interpretation of BhagavadGita and Sant\n&gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions =\r\nhave a power of their own, as they were\n&gt; &gt; realized souls. In comparison, =\r\nfor examplle, Satyadevaashtakam composed by\n&gt; &gt; me, though in metrical Sans=\r\nkrit, will not have a similar power.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimh=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a differ=\r\nence: \n&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- Girish Shahapurkar &lt;genius=\r\ngirish@...&lt;geniusgirish%40yahoo.co.in&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wo=\r\nuld it not be of immense help to the ordinary person whose knowledge of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Sanskrit is limited not only to &quot;understand&quot; what he says but also take mo=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; interest, enjoyment, and truly get immersed in what he is reciting/ =\r\nreading?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the reason for the great saints like Sant Dn=\r\nyaneshwar to\n&gt; &gt; compose the Bhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I agre=\r\ne with you that the sacred stotras should be recited in\n&gt; &gt; sanskrit...\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Humbly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Girish Shahapurkar\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 26/10/10, Naras=\r\nimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Nara=\r\nsimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@... &lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] T=\r\nranslations, Initiation, Vedic vs Tantrik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 26 October, 201=\r\n0, 2:53 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will give my 2 cents =\r\non a few points.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I once wanted to translate D=\r\nevi Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu\n&gt; &gt; in poetic form, so that Tel=\r\nugu people who find Saptashati too complicated to\n&gt; &gt; read or feel uncomfor=\r\ntable because they do not know the meaning, can read\n&gt; &gt; the Telugu version=\r\n instead. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me.\n&gt; &gt; He asked me, =\r\n&quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be considered\n&gt; &gt; later, =\r\nbut firmly told me to drop the idea for then.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pleas=\r\ne note that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting\n&gt; &gt; ma=\r\nntras and prayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; mean. They are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They ar=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who us=\r\ned them\n&gt; &gt; in the past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An intellectual understand=\r\ning may help facilitate the right mood, right\n&gt; &gt; frame of mind and right i=\r\nmagery. But, even without it, a mantra that was\n&gt; &gt; used by great sadhakas,=\r\n yogis and rishis holds power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the words o=\r\nf a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand\n&gt; &gt; can be more effecti=\r\nve for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal\n&gt; &gt; person that one c=\r\nan intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest\n&gt; &gt; not worrying=\r\n about whether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; mantras comi=\r\nng from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a=\r\n batsman may\n&gt; &gt; read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how=\r\n to see the ball\n&gt; &gt; from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get=\r\n into the line of the\n&gt; &gt; ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to=\r\n play front foot and when\n&gt; &gt; to play back foot etc. But that does not nece=\r\nssarily make one a good\n&gt; &gt; batsman. If one practices, THAT can make one a =\r\ngood player. Of course, some\n&gt; &gt; basic understanding of principles is neede=\r\nd. But, above that, practice is\n&gt; &gt; more important than bookish knowledge.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, some conceptual understanding is importa=\r\nnt in spirituality\n&gt; &gt; also, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhan=\r\nas, all paths is\n&gt; &gt; very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions=\r\n that we are doing\n&gt; &gt; things and realize that the divine acts through all =\r\nof us. The divine acts\n&gt; &gt; through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning a=\r\nnd gives corresponding\n&gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through the cycle until one =\r\novercomes the notions of &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and=\r\n I dislike that&quot; etc. Though this\n&gt; &gt; is the essence of all scriptures and =\r\none knows it, one may be deluded again\n&gt; &gt; and again. There is no magic for=\r\nmula to internalize this understanding fully\n&gt; &gt; and overcome the instincts=\r\n of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if o=\r\nne practices a mantra that one does not intellectually\n&gt; &gt; understand, that=\r\n is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at the\n&gt; &gt; back of on=\r\ne&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; own t=\r\nhoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwill yield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read\n&gt; &gt; scr=\r\niptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; or virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only crea=\r\nte\n&gt; &gt; a theoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern=\r\n all of\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical unde=\r\nrstanding of what is\n&gt; &gt; what and what we want, is like a blind person runn=\r\ning around a mountain,\n&gt; &gt; instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, b=\r\nut having an excellent\n&gt; &gt; theoretical understanfing, is like a person who =\r\nknows that he needs to climb\n&gt; &gt; the mountain, but keeps staring at the pin=\r\nnacle instead of climbing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the statement that initiation is important in tantric pa=\r\nth but\n&gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue =\r\nis one&#39;s attitude and\n&gt; &gt; what one wants. Anybody who wants specific materi=\r\nal results needs to be\n&gt; &gt; careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrange=\r\nment of karmas to affect a\n&gt; &gt; particular result is not easy. It requires s=\r\nupervision of a good guru and\n&gt; &gt; not many are left anyway. On the other ha=\r\nnd, if one is NOT looking for\n&gt; &gt; specific material results and is looking =\r\nfor spiritual progress, the\n&gt; &gt; constraints are fewer and options more.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some may sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik pa=\r\nth is for begetting\n&gt; &gt; specific material results and Vedic path is for sel=\r\nf-realization. That is\n&gt; &gt; incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may =\r\nchant Manyu sooktam for\n&gt; &gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for lo=\r\nngevity, and so on.\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross =\r\nsubstance in an elaborate\n&gt; &gt; ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is B=\r\nrahman&quot; and to remove the\n&gt; &gt; mental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If yo=\r\nu are looking for a specific material result,\n&gt; &gt; you need clear guidance a=\r\nnd supervision, which not many are capable of\n&gt; &gt; giving today! Instead, if=\r\n you want spiritual progress and an increase of\n&gt; &gt; your surrender, you can=\r\n just keep doing sadhana without initiation or\n&gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep comp=\r\nany of scriptures and other like-minded people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aft=\r\ner all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise\n&gt; &gt; direc=\r\ntions and some supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nan keep walking towards north. Of course, having supervision helps there\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; too, but you can do without it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyo=\r\ntish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam =\r\nand Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.v=\r\nedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: \n&gt;http://Sar=\r\naswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak=\r\n &lt;vedic_pathak@... &lt;vedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nam=\r\naste Satya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised t=\r\nhe non-initiate to read in English or any\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other regional language is b=\r\necause understanding the meaning and &gt;constant\n&gt; &gt; reflection are possible =\r\nonly when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a\n&gt; &gt; language that they can fu=\r\nlly follow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then=\r\n its understandable.

Since\n&gt; &gt; the last 4-5 years I have preferr=\r\ned to stay away from internet forums due to\n&gt; &gt; various reasons. It has bee=\r\nn nearly a year since I interacted on an internet\n&gt; &gt; forum. However after =\r\nNarasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post\n&gt; &gt; with my write up t=\r\no my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed\n&gt; &gt; through some posts=\r\n. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere here is\n&gt; &gt; far better and=\r\n more sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly\n&gt; &gt; browsed throug=\r\nh this particular thread, I thought that I might reply to\n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji&#39;s qu=\r\nestion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an importan=\r\nt question regarding the necessity\n&gt; &gt; of initiation. I will address it aft=\r\ner summarizing the big picture that\n&gt; &gt; needs to be invoked in order to und=\r\nerstand the ONE question and the MANY\n&gt; &gt; answers possible. Firstly is the =\r\nquestion a general or specific one?\n&gt; &gt; Generally speaking if the question =\r\nis whether initiation is an absolute\n&gt; &gt; requirement for spiritual life or =\r\nsadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if\n&gt; &gt; the question is about the neces=\r\nsity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as\n&gt; &gt; enjoined by *Tantra marga=\r\n*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde mun=\r\nde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the\n&gt; &gt; necessity for m=\r\nultiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the\n&gt; &gt; inevitability of=\r\n multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are\n&gt; &gt; many paths =\r\nfor sadhana. But in the current context of this question I will\n&gt; &gt; restric=\r\nt myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantr=\r\nic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. =\r\nKarma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of th=\r\ne great\n&gt; &gt; abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASIS=\r\nES particular\n&gt; &gt; methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the=\r\n abstract truths at\n&gt; &gt; an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the p=\r\nredominant methods/\n&gt; &gt; techniques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, stric=\r\ntly\n&gt; &gt; speaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one can gr=\r\neatly\n&gt; &gt; benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The =\r\ndirect path\n&gt; &gt; of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) a=\r\nnd Vichara\n&gt; &gt; (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination o=\r\nf the Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; =\r\n(regular\n&gt; &gt; self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of thes=\r\ne practices\n&gt; &gt; involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for ex=\r\nternal practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises=\r\n Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent\n&gt; &gt; practice) and Vairagya (Non-react=\r\nivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of\n&gt; &gt; Yoga additionally emphasise =\r\n&#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards\n&gt; &gt; the Supreme Iswara) too w=\r\nhile Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga\n&gt; &gt; emphasise only the first two=\r\n as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of\n&gt; &gt; Iswa=\r\nra&#39;s will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the\n&gt; &gt; e=\r\nmphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nEngaging in actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I wi=\r\nll address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where\n&gt; &gt; alone the inevitabl=\r\ne necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a\n&gt; &gt; Guru arises. M=\r\nantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult\n&gt; &gt; truths vi=\r\na the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It\n&gt; &gt; presupposes=\r\n certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby\n&gt; &gt; certain reg=\r\nulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that except\n&gt; &gt; Bhakti=\r\n marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\nredominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old\n&gt; &gt; `Agni-S=\r\nomeeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals wi=\r\nth the fire of Vak through\n&gt; &gt; the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since T=\r\nantra employs highly powerful\n&gt; &gt; techniques that bring results more quickl=\r\ny it lays great emphasis on\n&gt; &gt; adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority b=\r\nut more about qualification.\n&gt; &gt; Would you allow a child to experiment with=\r\n fire without any supervision?\n&gt; &gt; Does the supervisor need experience and =\r\ntraining or not? Like any other lab\n&gt; &gt; experiment proper training and expe=\r\nrience are part of the procedure apart\n&gt; &gt; from certain safety measures, in=\r\n the Tantric lab experiment too. However the\n&gt; &gt; lab is one&#39;s own conscious=\r\nness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti\n&gt; &gt; within the individual=\r\n consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti).\n&gt; &gt; As this is not a =\r\ntopic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from\n&gt; &gt; further discuss=\r\nion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless\n&gt; &gt; details here, I=\r\n will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to conte=\r\nxtualise\n&gt; &gt; it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one=\r\n major river\n&gt; &gt; within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover th=\r\ne entire Sakta\n&gt; &gt; sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually thr=\r\nee major schools\n&gt; &gt; that are full-fledged living traditions among the Dash=\r\naMahaVidyas- Kalikula,\n&gt; &gt; Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana bel=\r\nongs to Kalikula whilst Sri\n&gt; &gt; Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to m=\r\nake the picture more complete the\n&gt; &gt; Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) ha=\r\nve taken to Tarakula. To those who are\n&gt; &gt; familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I=\r\n will draw attention to the the 21 forms of\n&gt; &gt; Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana sh=\r\nares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the\n&gt; &gt; Sakta sadhanas in its app=\r\nroach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominan=\r\ntly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not\n&gt; &gt; invoked at all) while Sri kula =\r\npredominantly invokes Soma, at least at the\n&gt; &gt; major milestones in the int=\r\nernal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra,\n&gt; &gt; bija, devata, etc are all =\r\nconsistently of a particular set of synchronistic\n&gt; &gt; frequencies for each =\r\nof these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; entry of the pr=\r\nactitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path\n&gt; &gt; (kula). The=\r\n Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA\n&gt; &gt; himself a=\r\nt the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and\n&gt; &gt; sub-branches an=\r\nd twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka. =\r\nIt is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern\n&gt; &gt; meta=\r\nphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; beautiful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live =\r\nwires, where\n&gt; &gt; there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent pract=\r\nice all the way up\n&gt; &gt; till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (P=\r\nrakasa) and Sound\n&gt; &gt; (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti w=\r\nithin the\n&gt; &gt; individual consciousness through an integrated approach that =\r\ncombines the\n&gt; &gt; practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both K=\r\nalikula and\n&gt; &gt; Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrat=\r\ned approaches\n&gt; &gt; that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri=\r\n Chandi seemingly\n&gt; &gt; starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also=\r\n a full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also =\r\nsimultaneously a text\n&gt; &gt; on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The questi=\r\non of initiation is\n&gt; &gt; relevant only to those following the Tantramarga an=\r\nd thus employing the text\n&gt; &gt; as a mantramaya text . For those who explore =\r\nthe text as a yogasastra, the\n&gt; &gt; esoteric meaning is more relevant which I=\r\n have covered extensively in my\n&gt; &gt; write-up. For those who are already inc=\r\nlined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri\n&gt; &gt; Chandi provides the context for imm=\r\nensely powerful reflections through its\n&gt; &gt; central message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Onenes=\r\ns. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in the text is the\n&gt; &gt; Mahavakya whe=\r\nrein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic\n&gt; &gt; fashion tha=\r\nt She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in this\n&gt; &gt; universe. =\r\nWho else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other\n&gt; &gt; Mahava=\r\nkyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read =\r\nin English or any\n&gt; &gt; other regional language is because understanding the =\r\nmeaning and constant\n&gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one repeatedly r=\r\neads the text in a\n&gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow. The main idea o=\r\nf the writeup is to\n&gt; &gt; explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too =\r\napart from its obvious\n&gt; &gt; status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is=\r\n also equally regarded as\n&gt; &gt; Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially th=\r\ne four hymns. In that regard\n&gt; &gt; all the applications of Veda mantras or th=\r\ne Veda Samhita are equally\n&gt; &gt; possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the p=\r\nractice of Chandi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; &gt; Anyone who is acquainted with the original V=\r\nedic method will straightaway\n&gt; &gt; identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic=\r\n practice. In fact even the worship\n&gt; &gt; of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple =\r\nis fully based on and DERIVED from a one\n&gt; &gt; on one mapping of the Vedic Ya=\r\ngasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as s=\r\nome practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri\n&gt; &gt; Sri Chandi sa=\r\ndhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those\n&gt; &gt; who adhere=\r\n to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra\n&gt; &gt; marga. It=\r\n is this particular approach that needs initiation as per its own\n&gt; &gt; princ=\r\niples. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of\n&gt; &gt; V=\r\niveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predominantly V=\r\naidik\n&gt; &gt; practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of the=\r\nse\n&gt; &gt; approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula =\r\nas\n&gt; &gt; practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally=\r\n trace\n&gt; &gt; themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiatio=\r\nn for those\n&gt; &gt; paths, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress throug=\r\nh any of the\n&gt; &gt; merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka=\r\n, Vichara,\n&gt; &gt; Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi b=\r\nhava, Homa etc\n&gt; &gt; are all effective. However depending on the individual t=\r\nemperament, aptitude\n&gt; &gt; etc., some of these methods are more suited relati=\r\nvely to different\n&gt; &gt; practitioners. One may progress through a combination=\r\n of any of these\n&gt; &gt; methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* =\r\nintegrated approach of\n&gt; &gt; KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this =\r\nbig picture against which\n&gt; &gt; the answer to the question has to be contextu=\r\nalised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespec=\r\ntive of the method and path,\n&gt; &gt; SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effec=\r\ntive methods for all of us.\n&gt; &gt; Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts fo=\r\nllowed by reflection on the\n&gt; &gt; truths expounded in the texts. This is best=\r\n done in a language that one is\n&gt; &gt; fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA=\r\n it is the FIRST AND BEST choice\n&gt; &gt; among all methods. Swadhyaya is the al=\r\nternate method (though not as\n&gt; &gt; powerful) where Satsangha is not possible=\r\n. It is Satsangha and satsangha\n&gt; &gt; alone that enables one to make rapid pr=\r\nogress in spiritual life. Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted sta=\r\nte by virtue of serving, listening\n&gt; &gt; to and spending time in the company =\r\nof sadhus and sants in his younger days.\n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Go=\r\nrakhnath made a quantum leap in their\n&gt; &gt; spiritual lives after they attend=\r\ned the Satsangha of Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respec=\r\ntively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about th=\r\ne scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I\n&gt; &gt; will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays tha=\r\nt there\n&gt; &gt; are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sad=\r\nhus is a\n&gt; &gt; question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, t=\r\nhe supply will\n&gt; &gt; come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If y=\r\nou are really\n&gt; &gt; thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You=\r\n lead a\n&gt; &gt; happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Va=\r\nsanas. You do\n&gt; &gt; not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your tim=\r\ne in idle gossiping\n&gt; &gt; and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless=\r\n slave of passion, greed,\n&gt; &gt; and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I c=\r\nannot get good Satsanga.&#39;...\n&gt; &gt; Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. =\r\nThen come to me. I shall take you\n&gt; &gt; to the lotus-feet of blessed souls wh=\r\no will put you in the right path, guide\n&gt; &gt; you and elevate you to sublime =\r\nheights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are\n&gt; &gt; waiting to get hold of the=\r\n right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Real seekers are fe=\r\nw. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good\n&gt; &gt; Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also b=\r\nring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers\n&gt; &gt; after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQ=\r\nUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this foru=\r\nm is an opportunity for\n&gt; &gt; Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhava=\r\nna, this group too is a\n&gt; &gt; potential Satsangha though not comparable to th=\r\ne actual company of the great\n&gt; &gt; masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi a=\r\ns a yoga-vedantic text alongside a\n&gt; &gt; study of the lives of great Saktas s=\r\nuch as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by\n&gt; &gt; listening and/or singing the upl=\r\nifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by\n&gt; &gt; constant remembrance and r=\r\neflection, by discernment of sat and asat, by\n&gt; &gt; genuine and sincere discu=\r\nssions on a group such as this, one makes progress\n&gt; &gt; truly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly or reply at least for a=\r\n while.

However, on=\r\ne without a rich father is still better off\n&gt; &gt; opening a bank account with=\r\n a zero balance and building it up slowly with\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s own hard work. Sim=\r\nilarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana\n&gt; &gt; with famous mantras=\r\n and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a\n&gt; &gt; guru to initiate =\r\nyou (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get\n&gt; &gt; initiated. Otherw=\r\nise, just go ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (=\r\n2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for\n&gt; &gt; getting spe=\r\ncific material results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender\n&gt; &gt; and ma=\r\nking spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that\n&gt; &gt; im=\r\nportant. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can\n&gt; &gt; pre=\r\npare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are very =\r\nfew people who\n&gt; &gt; can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole=\r\n system, for a\n&gt; &gt; reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and =\r\nrituals only for\n&gt; &gt; increasing surrender, getting whatever material result=\r\ns god wants to give\n&gt; &gt; and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to d=\r\no rituals for begetting\n&gt; &gt; *specific* material results (for oneself or oth=\r\ners or society/universe in\n&gt; &gt; general), Nature will make arrangements for =\r\none to get correct knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; such rituals. But, as one starts, one s=\r\nhould start with the attitude of\n&gt; &gt; (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires=\r\n, but\n&gt; &gt; I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may=\r\n give any\n&gt; &gt; material results or spiritual results and not necessarily ful=\r\nfil my desires.\n&gt; &gt; I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my=\r\n devotion and\n&gt; &gt; surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE=\r\n. Initiation is not\n&gt; &gt; required. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good resu=\r\nlts slowly, but there are\n&gt; &gt; fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fa=\r\nst, but there may be some\n&gt; &gt; hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Im=\r\nagine that a person is taking\n&gt; &gt; rotten fruits from a fruit basket and thr=\r\nowing them in garbage and trying to\n&gt; &gt; retrieve one good fruit from under =\r\nthem. If the person is gentle, one may do\n&gt; &gt; it gently and the spillage of=\r\n rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If\n&gt; &gt; the person is aggressiv=\r\ne, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage\n&gt; &gt; of rotten fruits o=\r\nn the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten\n&gt; &gt; fruits will be r=\r\netrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a\n&gt; &gt; basket. The de=\r\nity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and\n&gt; &gt; give you=\r\n a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity\n&gt; &gt; like G=\r\nanapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good\n&gt; &gt; frui=\r\nt, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bh=\r\nairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncomes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, r=\r\nemember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; creations, but fruits of your=\r\n own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had\n&gt; &gt; to eat each of those ro=\r\ntten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and stayin=\r\ng with\n&gt; &gt; gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be ass=\r\nessed by a\n&gt; &gt; guru before starting a practice. If you realize the above, y=\r\nou can start\n&gt; &gt; mantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you=\r\n have to realize\n&gt; &gt; that it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity i=\r\ns trying to accelerate\n&gt; &gt; good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to =\r\ngentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some peopl=\r\ne who never lit a lamp in their life and were\n&gt; &gt; ignorant of rituals, are =\r\ndoing daily homam now. Some people who took several\n&gt; &gt; hours to read Sapta=\r\nshati for the first time just 2-3 years back are now\n&gt; &gt; doing Chandi homam=\r\n with entire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them\n&gt; &gt; have transfo=\r\nrmed a lot and have experienced some things too. Obviously, they\n&gt; &gt; have d=\r\none sadhana with fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine\n&gt; &gt; Mothe=\r\nr in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In th=\r\nis age of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone\n&gt; &gt; has even a faint i=\r\ndea that spiritual progress is important, is looking for\n&gt; &gt; god and is att=\r\nracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that\n&gt; &gt; person ob=\r\nviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person has done\n&gt; &gt; tha=\r\nt sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understand=\r\ning of what is what, how\n&gt; &gt; things work, why one should do something, how =\r\nto do it, what is more\n&gt; &gt; important and what is less important, that is wh=\r\nat initiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bes=\r\nt regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; H.R=\r\namalingam\n&gt; \n&gt; Managing Director\n&gt; \n&gt; Shri Ramana Heavy Engineering Private=\r\n Limited\n&gt; \n&gt; No.769, 59th Street, 10th Sector, K.K.nagar\n&gt; \n&gt; Chennai-6000=\r\n78\n&gt; \n&gt; Ph: Off-044-23662346\n&gt; \n&gt; Cell: +91-93847 41969\n&gt; \n&gt; +91-99620 3196=\r\n9\n&gt; \n&gt; +91-99406 51969\n&gt; \n&gt; Email: hramalingam@...\n&gt; \n&gt; hramalingam@...\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-189461866-1288227954=:78600\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1=\r\n2pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Satya Prakash ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;I wa=\r\ns wondering while in the south Mahishasura Mardini stotram, Lalitha sahasra=\r\nnama stotram&nbsp;is the most read sloka where else&nbsp;in Bengal and the =\r\nnorth durga saptashati is most popular.

The only major point where I disagree is whether one can do Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion on translation of=\r\n mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some unnecessary con=\r\nfusion. A few pointers:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. There are various sacred chants embedded =\r\nwithin the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants =\r\ncan be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotra=\r\ns too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras. The Samhita portion of t=\r\nhe Vedas too is referred to as mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. Undoubtedly mantras and s=\r\ntotras have to be chanted in the original. Reading a translation is not eve=\r\nn comparable to chanting the original chant. So far it is fine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. W=\r\nhilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition make=\r\ns a distinction between\n them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. As per the traditional view one do=\r\nesn&#39;t need to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not th=\r\ne same with most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, m=\r\nantras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Man=\r\ntras from the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that nee=\r\nd initiation, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Wh=\r\natever you call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are int=\r\negral parts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiat=\r\nion, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5. Vishnusaha=\r\nsranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they=\r\n fall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are =\r\ntraditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a=\r\n larger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them with=\r\nout initiation is\n not recommended especially when the reader combines the =\r\nnavarna or shodashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;6. I know from personal interaction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi=\r\n as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas =\r\nof Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND =\r\nSHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the s=\r\nadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one needs to be initiat=\r\ned to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7. Recapp=\r\ning my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an independe=\r\nnt status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidy=\r\na, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the Upanishads=\r\n. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi pa=\r\nth***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initiated to chant it. How=\r\never if one\n wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects=\r\n of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular has bee=\r\nn recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original along with the navak=\r\nshari amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is =\r\nrecommended to be initiated and go through the specialised sadhanas properl=\r\ny under guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8. Arguably if an uninitiated person reads the Dev=\r\ni Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and=\r\n not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent problem in our times. The problem w=\r\nith attempting to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without=\r\n initiation) is that most readers inadvertently end up also chanting the Na=\r\nvarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain=\r\n the bijaksharas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;9. I you carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi =\r\nMahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna mantra eve=\r\nn in\n writing. Neither have I attempted to write a commentary on it. Transl=\r\nations of mantras do not have the power of the original mantra as Sabda or =\r\nVak. However it is recommended to know the essence or import (artha) of the=\r\n mantra and its sadhana while chanting it. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, th=\r\ne essence of `Vak&#39;, not a translation! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10. For those who are alread=\r\ny doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is no need to worry o=\r\nr be confused. There has to be a certain level of samskara to be attracted =\r\nto Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. Otherwise we would not be do=\r\ning it (initiation or no initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are do=\r\ning. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has right=\r\nly pointed out it is better to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any f=\r\navours or results. That attitude itself will reduce a lot of the potential =\r\nproblem. Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow.\n Leave=\r\n the rest to the compassionate Goddess. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hope the above pointers hel=\r\np in clearing any confusion. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards,&lt;BR&gt;Satya Prakash &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, h ramalingam &lt;hramalingam@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste everybody&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I want to share one anecdote h=\r\nappened in front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bh=\r\narathi Swamigal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When Swamigal was staying in a camp near Mysore in =\r\nKarnataka One day all the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; learned persons male and female alike&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in kannada lan=\r\nguage&lt;BR&gt;&gt; so that they can chant knowing the meaning fully.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swa=\r\nmigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was made early in the morning.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc were\n over as usual Postman =\r\ncame to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamigal. Swa=\r\nmigal was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; seriously looking at the cover&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in front of the le=\r\narned members and was looking at one line written as PIN&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Code and f=\r\nollowed by six numbers. Then he asked the learned members to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; explai=\r\nn the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell that. But everyone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nunderstood the significance of that number. Then swamigal asked his crew&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; member to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his library and=\r\n read&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that ev=\r\nen the meaning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of PINCode was not known to the group and still it s=\r\nerves the purpose and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; people are using it in day to day work. Simil=\r\narly not knowing the meaning of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vishnu Saharanamam will not take aw=\r\nay the benefits of chanting the stothsram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was he told the group.

That is definitely the ideal situation.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If that is not possible, what I am saying is that re=\r\nading something&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; composed by an elevated being even without und=\r\nerstanding the meaning is very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; useful. Suppose someone does no=\r\nt understand what Ganapathi Atharvaseersham&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; means, thinks in g=\r\neneral that it extols Ganapathi as the source of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; everything an=\r\nd chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. One can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; st=\r\nill benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, it is more&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; likely because one does\n not have the correct attitude and surrend=\r\ner and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the specific meaning=\r\n of Ganapathi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the meaning=\r\n and chanting may also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; experience nothing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; The words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many layers an=\r\nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one superficial layer. Some importan=\r\nt layers are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most important layers of=\r\n meaning are never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but only experie=\r\nnced internally.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning or =\r\nnot, chant the mantra with a calm and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with de=\r\nvotion and surrender. Many people keep a target&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; count and race=\r\n through it or do it mechanically with a sense of duty. If it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nis done even with a little bit of love and surrender to the deity, it can d=\r\no&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; something.\n The key to success with a mantra is calmness of =\r\nthe mind. If a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands of thoughts and c=\r\nhanting of the mantra is just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one of those thousand activities=\r\n, nothing will happen. If most thoughts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; subside and mind is es=\r\nsentially reverberating with a mantra, that is when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one experi=\r\nences a mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are 4 levels of sabda. When=\r\n one says a mantra, physical vibration is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; accompanied in other=\r\n layers by the imagery in the mind, the thoughts and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; instincts=\r\n in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some mantras composed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentially beings with very =\r\nstable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such that the physical vib=\r\nration of the mantra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can eventually cause the corresponding im=\r\nagery in the mind by resonance,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; when other mental activity sub=\r\nsides. Thus, after\n repeating the mantra and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; calming the mind =\r\ndown, you can recreate a certain imagery and thought system&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in=\r\n your mind. That can permanently alter the way your mind workd. But the&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; key is to attain a reasonably stable, focused and calm mind.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpretation of Bhagavad=\r\nGita and Sant&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a power of th=\r\neir own, as they were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; realized souls. In comparison, for examp=\r\nlle, Satyadevaashtakam composed by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; me, though in metrical Sans=\r\nkrit, will not have a similar power.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual ma=\r\nnuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://sa=\r\nraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://saraswatifilms.org=\r\n/&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- Girish Shahapurkar &lt;geni=\r\nusgirish@...&lt;geniusgirish%40yahoo.co.in&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Would it not be of immense help t=\r\no the ordinary person whose knowledge of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sanskrit is limited n=\r\not\n only to &quot;understand&quot; what he says but also take more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; inter=\r\nest, enjoyment, and truly get immersed in what he is reciting/ reading?&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the reason for the great saints like Sant Dn=\r\nyaneshwar to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; compose the Bhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; But I agree with you that the sacred stotras should be recited i=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sanskrit...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Humbly,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Giri=\r\nsh Shahapurkar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 26/10/10, Na=\r\nrasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@... &=\r\nlt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Tran=\r\nslations, Initiation, Vedic vs Tantrik&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n\n &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 2=\r\n6 October, 2010, 2:53 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friend=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I will give my 2 cents on a few poin=\r\nts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; I once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Tel=\r\nugu&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in poetic form, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati =\r\ntoo complicated to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; read or feel uncomfortable because they do =\r\nnot know the meaning, can read&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the Telugu version instead. Whe=\r\nn I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He asked me, &quot;who=\r\n do you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be considered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; la=\r\nter, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that the goal o=\r\nf sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mantras\n and pr=\r\nayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nmean. They are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, =\r\nwho used them&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in the past.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; An intellectual understanding may help=\r\n facilitate the right mood, right&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; frame of mind and right imag=\r\nery. But, even without it, a mantra that was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; used by great sad=\r\nhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the words of a rishi that one ca=\r\nnnot intellectually understand&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can be more effective for spiri=\r\ntual progress, than the words of a normal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; person that one can =\r\nintellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not wo=\r\nrrying about whether one understands or not and reading\n Sanskrit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
