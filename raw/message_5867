Lot of Thanks for posting it.\n\nRespec=\r\nted Utpal ji has answered about hinduism in a very touching manner. I don&#39;t=\r\n think anything need to be added.\n\nI believe that every soul born on earth =\r\nis Hindu(not a very correct word to use for our religion although). Sanatan=\r\n dharma is the basic functioning with default settings coming with every br=\r\nand new body. Just like basic functioning default settings of new mobile ph=\r\none. Although after buying, one can make changes in it as per his own prefe=\r\nrences and taste. But still basic functions remain the same.  When a call c=\r\nomes, your phone will tell you. It can tell by vibration, or by singing a s=\r\nong or by chanting an aarti. But still it will tell you, because it is the =\r\nbasic functioning of phone. \n\nAll the religions, including the now-a-days c=\r\nalled hinduism, are different just on the basis of their profile settings. =\r\nBasic functioning of all the religions is same. They all are used to make c=\r\nalls! And that basic functioning is &#39;sanatan dharma&#39;. These religions known=\r\n as  hinduism, sikhism, budhism, islam, christianity and many other religio=\r\nns just use different ring tones, different wallpapers and different screen=\r\n savers. Rest is same :)\n\nAbout initiation in religion i think that initiat=\r\nion is a stage when you think &#39; i want to know what is god&#39; when you think =\r\nsuch a thought, you are initiated! It means that you just received a call! =\r\nYour ringtone may be different, your caller image may be different. But all=\r\n it means is that you had just received a call. Pick up your phone! \n\nSorry=\r\n for mistakes. Sorry if i confused you instead of helping you. I usually do=\r\n so :)\n\nKind regards\n\n\n"}}
