This came from the \n&gt; context of Rajarshi&#39;s comm=\r\nents on the &quot;maturity&quot; & &quot;errors&quot; of \n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples (regarding =\r\ntheir attitude towards Tantra). He \n&gt; compared them with Vimalananda and sa=\r\nid their spiritual caliber was of \n&gt; the scale of 2, while Vimalananda&#39;s wa=\r\ns 2 power 16. He also talked about \n&gt; the hierarchy of spiritual caliber me=\r\nntioned by V. I want to share 2 \n&gt; cents of musings on that.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; Measuring Spiritual Caliber\n&gt; \n&gt; Rajarshi, here ar=\r\ne a few comments on your statements a couple of days \n&gt; back on Twitter com=\r\nparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare \n&gt; flowers like hibiscus, r=\r\nose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say \n&gt; which is a better flower. Th=\r\ney have different properties like color, \n&gt; size, shape, number of petals, =\r\ntype/intensity of smell etc. Relative \n&gt; values depend on the purpose and t=\r\nhey cannot be quantified universally. \n&gt; How can any sane person then say t=\r\nhat spiritual caliber of different \n&gt; people can be compared and quanitifie=\r\nd? The field of duality has \n&gt; infinite variety and the [self-]control of a=\r\n yogi has infinite aspects \n&gt; to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual cali=\r\nber of a person as one \n&gt; number and compare them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before one even att=\r\nempts to understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa \n&gt; &lt; Siddha &lt; Natha &lt; =\r\nRishi), please note that different hierarchies exist \n&gt; in scriptures for d=\r\neities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities \n&gt; where Vishnu is suprem=\r\ne. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where \n&gt; Shiva is supreme. Some con=\r\nsider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is \n&gt; supreme. And so on. None of=\r\n them is absolute. All of them are relative \n&gt; and for specific purposes, i=\r\n.e. from a specific perspective. There are \n&gt; people who take them as absol=\r\nute and argue that so and so thing taught \n&gt; by Vishnu is superior to so an=\r\nd so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we \n&gt; know that none of the hierarchie=\r\ns is absolute.\n&gt; \n&gt; One who has the nerve to think that one can compare the=\r\n wisdom of \n&gt; Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of Ra=\r\nmakrishna \n&gt; Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion of S=\r\nhirdi Sai, \n&gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri Maha=\r\nshaya, \n&gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of Ekna=\r\nth \n&gt; Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc=\r\n, \n&gt; is a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific \n&gt; =\r\nlimited perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in \n&gt; a=\r\nnother Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so \n&gt; o=\r\nn. You cannot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. \n&gt; You=\r\n should just appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any \n&gt; of t=\r\nhem that you like the most.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda&#39;s list may be correct from spe=\r\ncific perspective. More \n&gt; importantly, his words should make one realize t=\r\nhat there is always \n&gt; scope for further self-control (and the resulting ma=\r\nstery over the field \n&gt; of duality) while one is still embodied. One should=\r\n never rest and \n&gt; aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel =\r\nand starting to \n&gt; judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making s=\r\ntatements like \n&gt; &quot;Vimalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;=\r\n and thinking \n&gt; that something is absolute truth because Vimalananda is as=\r\nsumed to have \n&gt; said that (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ev=\r\nen if Vimalananda&#39;s hierarchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume \n&gt; th=\r\nat you can judge the stature of each yogi accurately. Because \n&gt; Ramakrishn=\r\na was popularly known as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as \n&gt; per Vimal=\r\nananda&#39;s classification or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi? \n&gt; Or may b=\r\ne a deity? My friend, don&#39;t assume you know for sure!!! Based on \n&gt; the det=\r\nails we know, can we be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s \n&gt; stature ba=\r\nsed on his own classification?\n&gt; \n&gt; You said &quot;Approximating 2 equal to each=\r\n disciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16 \n&gt; =3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You proba=\r\nbly made this statement based on \n&gt; what you read and heard of Vimalananda.=\r\n For the sake of argument, it is \n&gt; not even 100% clear whether he was a re=\r\nal person or an imagined \n&gt; character. Svoboda intentionally (and very wise=\r\nly!) left the latter \n&gt; option open in the preface of his Aghora book!\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n If we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use a \n&gt; simp=\r\nler definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure of \n&gt; one&#39;s &quot;=\r\nspiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples fare quite well. RK \n&gt; told Abh=\r\nedananda that it was going to be his last birth. Others would be \n&gt; back, b=\r\nut he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he said there would be \n&gt; one more =\r\nbirth and he would be free forever after that. Vimalananda, on \n&gt; the other=\r\n hand, had atleast one more birth clearly as he said a body was \n&gt; waiting =\r\nfor him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;, just \n&gt; Abhedana=\r\nnda alone is superior to Vimalananda!\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, please note that this is =\r\njust one definition. One can have many \n&gt; definitions. The key is not to ju=\r\nmp to unwise conclusions on any \n&gt; hierarchies and say that &quot;X is weightier=\r\n than Y and so what he said must \n&gt; be more correct&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; People with lops=\r\nided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledge \n&gt; to be absolute =\r\nand jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people \n&gt; are doing the sa=\r\nme now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the Aghora \n&gt; books. Don&#39;t fall int=\r\no the trap of taking something as gospel or as \n&gt; absolute. Written words a=\r\nre always relative and never absolute. \n&gt; Discriminate relative knowledge u=\r\nsing intellect at first and hopefully \n&gt; using experencial realization late=\r\nr on.\n&gt; \n&gt; More importantly, while we are still searching for &quot;maturity&quot;, w=\r\ne should \n&gt; not commit the &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental comments o=\r\nf greats \n&gt; who did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more tha=\r\nn us.\n&gt; -------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free=\r\n Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://=\r\nSaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritin=\r\ngs\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
