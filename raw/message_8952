Very interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; This reminds me of a=\r\nn incident with a good friend of mine. There is an\n&gt; individual I know, who=\r\n had never chanted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever.\n&gt; He used to feel, as p=\r\ner his own confession, no special love or attraction\n&gt; for this mantra and =\r\nbeing born in a non-brahmin family, there was no\n&gt; religious-cultural occas=\r\nion where he was formally introduced to this\n&gt; mantra.\n&gt;\n&gt; One day while me=\r\nditating on some Tantrik mantras, he got a random\n&gt; inspiration to meditate=\r\n on the Gayatri mantra. He had a vague idea of what\n&gt; the Gayatri mantra me=\r\nant, and no idea at all of correct swara or\n&gt; intonation. So he started cha=\r\nnting, mentally and soundlessly, the Savitur\n&gt; Gayatri mantra. Within less =\r\nthan 20-30 japas of the mantra, he felt/saw -\n&gt; and I describe it as he tol=\r\nd me - an unbroken steam of tremendous, pure,\n&gt; flood of Golden Light above=\r\n his head. Like a world above and outside our\n&gt; world. Intensely pure, inte=\r\nnsely Divine. The eventual idea, he told me, was\n&gt; to enter into that strea=\r\nm of Light above and see things from that\n&gt; perspective. But as long as the=\r\nre are impurities in the mind and body, it\n&gt; is not possible to enter into =\r\nthat realm easily. The gunas must be in a\n&gt; stable equilibrium. Neither the=\r\n laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience of\n&gt; rajas is conducive for it, but =\r\nthe stable, illuminating, self-assurance of\n&gt; satwa leading to a deeper equ=\r\nanimity in mind and life is needed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Apparently, he also realized that t=\r\nhere are some Tantrik mantras of Ma\n&gt; which serve a similar purpose as the =\r\nGayatri mantra. They take a person to\n&gt; the spiritual planes above.\n&gt;\n&gt; So =\r\nI asked him why did you not continue the meditation or japa of Gayatri\n&gt; ma=\r\nntra, since there was a nice experience. He said it would have pulled him\n&gt;=\r\n in and he would not have been able to continue the spiritual practices\n&gt; w=\r\nhich he was already doing for some time, and leaving something half way is\n=\r\n&gt; not good.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Reading the explanation your provided below, that is :\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH)\n=\r\n&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his light,=\r\n\n&gt; we would not be able to distinguish different objects. This is explained=\r\n in\n&gt; the Aitaterya Upanishad =93The sun, having become eyesight, entered t=\r\nhe\n&gt; eyes=94.

This tejas is the light of the sun,\n&gt; which is experienced by all liv=\r\ning beings, and is thus easy to meditate\n&gt; upon.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whatever is experience=\r\nd is easy to meditate upon, and that which is not\n&gt; experienced can be diff=\r\nicult to meditate upon. Everyone can meditate upon\n&gt; the light of the Sun. =\r\nThis is why this meaning for the Gayatri mantra is\n&gt; always taken first.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; vareNyam =3D whatever we can ask / desire. Through all karmas and\n&gt; upaas=\r\nanaas, whatever fruits we may ask for is vareNyam. =93Savitaa&quot; is the\n&gt; fru=\r\nit of all karmas ... this is taught in the Chandogya Upanishad. [ A long\n&gt; =\r\nexplanation follows, which is omitted here ].

He wrote a simple, lucid commentary on the Gayatri mantra. It starts with=\r\n a summary in 32 shlokas, followed by an introduction. He then gives 4 expl=\r\nanations / meditations on the mantra -- (1) gayatri, (2) narayana, (3) para=\r\nmashiva and (4) paramatma.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am not attemptin=\r\ng a literal or scholarly translation ... I=92ll try to summarize the main p=\r\noint, from a practical point of view.

This follows the famous verse from th=\r\ne Agastya Smriti --=A0=93yo devaH savitA=A0 .asmAkam dhiyo dharmAdigocarAH.=\r\n prerayet tasya yad\n bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe=94. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;We=A0meditate upon (dhiimahi)=A0the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) of the =\r\ndeva (devasya) that is the Sun (savituH).=A0This tejas is the light of the =\r\nsun, which is experienced by all living beings, and is thus easy to meditat=\r\ne upon.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whatever is experienced is easy to meditat=\r\ne upon, and that which is not experienced can be difficult to meditate upon=\r\n. Everyone can meditate upon the light of the Sun. This is why this meaning=\r\n for the Gayatri mantra is always taken first. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;va=\r\nreNyam=A0=3D whatever we can ask=A0/ desire. Through all karmas and upaasan=\r\naas, whatever fruits we may ask for is vareNyam. =93Savitaa&quot; is the fr=\r\nuit of all karmas ... this is taught in the Chandogya Upanishad.

Without his light, we would not be abl=\r\ne to distinguish different objects. This is explained in the Aitaterya Upan=\r\nishad=A0=93The sun, having become eyesight, entered the eyes=94. He thus bl=\r\nesses all living beings. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;----&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Sent from Windows Mail&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n   =\r\n  \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n =\r\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  =\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--e89a8fb1f418fb188904d32c90d8--\r\n\n"}}
