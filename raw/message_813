He was born and the time given in Notable \nHoroscope is also=\r\n correct. Ved Vyasji was also alive in the same \nperiod when Shri Krishna w=\r\nas alive. Ved Vyasji tried to spread \nknowledge of Vedas and Upanishadas to=\r\n common men and he wrote lots \nof Puranas and long poem of Mahabharat. Maha=\r\nbharat was a reality but \nwas not in the same form as narrated by Vyasji. V=\r\nyasji has given \nimmaginary characters and incidents but his intention was =\r\nto spread \nknowledge of Vedas/Upanishadas thru Gita. There was a discussion=\r\n \nbetween Krishna and Arjuna in a normal form and not in Sanskrit. He \nadvi=\r\nsed Arjuna to start war after giving him the theory of Karma. \nVyasji just =\r\ngave a poetic form in sanskrit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dr.Ashwin Rawal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 23/12=\r\n/08, utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_=\r\npathak@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Mahabhaarat is an epic or historical =\r\n\nreality !!!\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, 23 Decembe=\r\nr, 2008, 12:17 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha Garu & Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; There =\r\nis a long pending question with me and that is Historical \n&gt; reality or oth=\r\nerwise of our many revered personalities/ events.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take for instance, &#39;=\r\nMahabhaarat&#39; & &#39;Shri Krishna&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would try to give some view points ga=\r\nthered from all these years \n&gt; from various sources and my own thinking as =\r\nwell-\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Mahatma Gandhi didn&#39;t belive that Mahabhaarat was a reality.h=\r\ne \n&gt; thought that it was &#39;epic&#39;-creation of a poet. he seems to be \nunable =\r\n\n&gt; to belive logically the creation of 100 sons etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) How can pare=\r\nnts name their children as &#39;DURYodhan&#39;, &#39;Du:Shasan&#39; \n&gt; etc.. i am not sure =\r\nabout the meaning of the names but it implies \n&gt; something perverted. knwol=\r\nedgable person in sanskrit can shed some \n&gt; light on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Mahabhaa=\r\nrat was a Grand Poem created by super-intelligent \nauthor, \n&gt; Maharshi Vyaa=\r\ns and hence Gita was also his own creation and \nkrsihna \n&gt; was just a &#39;imag=\r\ninary&#39; central character of his grand work.\n&gt; \n&gt; !.....!..... !\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Dr.=\r\n Raman, in Notable Horoscopes has strongly written that Shri \n&gt; Krishna was=\r\n a historically reality. His reasoning was that an \n&gt; *Imaginery creation* =\r\nof some poet can never Inspire & attract \n&gt; millions of people for thousans=\r\n of years.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) If Maharshi Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabha=\r\narat to \n&gt; satisfy his poetic genious then how come he himself features in =\r\n\nthe \n&gt; story? if let&#39;s consider even that as a possibility but then WHY \n&gt;=\r\n he&#39;ll write another book just on Shri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. why \n&gt; he&#39;l=\r\nl himself Worship his own &#39;Kaalpanik Paatra&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was n=\r\never born, then how come so many Saints of \n&gt; yesteryears, saw his form.\n&gt; =\r\nOne can argue that becuase of their intense worship of that \n&gt; perticular F=\r\norm, they could see the same form of the supreme \n&gt; reality...the supreme p=\r\nower can take any form for the Bhakta.\n&gt; The solid counter argument is that=\r\n, Paramhamsa Yogananda and \n&gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, never were a De=\r\nvotee of that form of \n&gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in their case, without=\r\n devotion & \ndesire \n&gt; they got to see the form of Shri Krushna?\n&gt; \n&gt; !....=\r\n!....!\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts about this?
