Why should one worship Ganesha or Rudra or Chandika or Mahakala.\nIn=\r\n fact can anybody actually worship any deity.\n \n1. The fact of the matter i=\r\ns that one&#39;s mind will be drawn to the worship of deities which one has wor=\r\nshipped in past lives.\n2. But, whether one will achive or not with that asp=\r\nect of the divine is based on\n  a. What is the residue of karmas which one =\r\nhas left? Karana Shareera basically is responsible for this.One in a millio=\r\nn\n      individuals will achieve the burning of the Karana Shareera. But wh=\r\nen this is being done, then every karma done to that person\n     to his bod=\r\ny or mind, good or bad must have an almost hundred times more intensity res=\r\nult, like for like.\n     \n  b. What is the intensity of the desire of that =\r\nperson for the Divine Beloved?\n      Which again boils down to the amount o=\r\nf karmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thicker the overlay of karmas, t=\r\nhe lesser the  desire to actually perform any kind of worship.\n \nPeople tal=\r\nk about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.\nI find that it simply does not =\r\nmatter.\nEvery mantra is a name (nam), every nam has a form (rupa).\nSo, when=\r\n the mantra is chanted, the rupa is forming.\nWhere is the rupa forming?\nIn =\r\nthe physical body, mind, koshas and everywhere.\nSo the deity will actually =\r\noccupy the person.\nBut when can this happen?\nOnly when the body is dead. No=\r\nt dead physically, but in a different sense.\nie. ASANA: the mind forgets th=\r\ne body exists after a few hours of sitting really still for a few hours a d=\r\nay.\n    Pranayana: the mind reflects on the breath and feels it is alive, i=\r\nt tries to still the breath.\n    Dhyana, the rupa of the deity forms in the=\r\n mind, remember the body is dead for the mind at this stage.\n    Dharana: T=\r\nhe mind percieves that form of God which is the object of the consciousness=\r\n, but duality exists.\n    Pratyahara: a phenomenon where the eyes do not se=\r\ne, the ears do not hear.\n    Samadhi: the rupa is so well established, that=\r\n the ultimate form of that rupa, that mantra, the Nirguna manifests.\n \nSo t=\r\nhe emptiness must come about in the mind and body about one&#39;s own identity =\r\nbefore God fills it up with His form.\nSo, mantra is simply a tool to make u=\r\ns realise God. Anybody can do mantras, but most people&#39;s internal fire or A=\r\ngni is\nnot really charged up to digest these.\nJapa is no doubt great, but i=\r\nt is involved with the purification of air, whereas fire is involved in the=\r\n purification of internal fire.\nWhen internal fire is purified, then the ab=\r\nility to visualise your deity becomes stronger. Hence homam in this age is =\r\neasy and moreover, Agni is a living God, pratyaksha Devata who can be seen =\r\nby your physical eyes.\nIt moves, eats, talks with the sadhaka and finally w=\r\nhen it dies, it continues to live on within the sadhaka.\nIn Kali Yuga, this=\r\n ability to call a living God into the house is so powerful and so exhaltin=\r\ng that later on japa after homam\nbrings very fast results.\nWhy Ganesha? Mos=\r\nt people do not want spirituality, and in any case are not destined to be s=\r\npiritual in this lifetime, so the only way they will pursue some sadhana is=\r\n if they are given some material result quite quickly by their sadhana.\nTho=\r\nse who have problems in career, litigation, problems with marriage or in fi=\r\nnding life partner, problems with education or speech can really advance th=\r\neir mundane satisfaction with Ganapati homa.\nI have seen this numerous time=\r\ns myself with people who are in this movement and outside.\nThat is not to s=\r\nay that Ganapati can&#39;t give Mukti. The ultimate form of Ganapati is the wor=\r\nd of God.\nAnd He is sakshama in giving Mukti as well.\n \nThe mahamantras are=\r\n many and I agree that some may say that lets do this(mahamantras) first.\nB=\r\nUT,\nThe Vedic mahamantras require the kind of intonation so perfect with vi=\r\nsualisation at different bits of the body with various syllables, that for =\r\nmost people this is not feasible, especially since their Sanskrit itself is=\r\n somewhat imperfect.(remember name is form, if name is not repeated properl=\r\ny then how will the form be?)(example, of someone who repeated bhakshati fo=\r\nr rakshati in Pune many years ago).\nAnd then there are mahamantras which ar=\r\ne ok with almost any intonation. If someone wants to follow this that is al=\r\nso ok.\nBut, with any mantra sadhana, Ganesha sadhana is anivarya. Because, =\r\nthe entrance to Shakti at Sushumna is guarded by Him.\n \nAgain some doubt co=\r\nmes into people&#39;s heads about some mantras harming them when recited:\nIf so=\r\nmebody experiences bad things when a mantra of a certain deity is recited t=\r\nhen all it means is that the karmas of the Karana shareera are being dealt =\r\nwith(by the deity) quite fast, so they have to be experienced. It actually =\r\nmeans that the Devata is close and more intense sadhana is needed.\n \nActual=\r\nly, all this business about mantra and mahamantra is immaterial, Allah mali=\r\nk Hai, voh sab janta hai.\nUs parvardigar se prarthana kar, woh sab raste kh=\r\nol deta hai.\n\n\n\n"}}
