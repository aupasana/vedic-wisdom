Is something in=\r\nherently &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong with question itself? \n\n\nNo sir. There is nothing wrong =\r\nwith the question itself. In fact it is a very good question in view of the=\r\n big picture.   \n\n\nWhilst the Devi is assuring us that She will fondly acce=\r\npt all acts of worship, sacrificial offerings and homas whether they are do=\r\nne with appropriate knowledge or not, Her assurance need not be taken as *p=\r\nermission* to dispense with knowledge of the same. She is proclaiming just =\r\nas Lord Krishna too proclaims in the B. Gita,&quot;Aham hi sarvayajnanam bhokta =\r\nca prabhur eva ca&quot; (9.24) and &quot;Patram puspam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya pra=\r\nyacchati...&quot; (9.28). \n\nMost of the verses in the Devi Mahatmyam have parall=\r\nels in the B. Gita and Upanishads. Studying the 9th chapter of the B. Gita =\r\nwill enable the sadhaka to comprehend the depth of this verse better. \n\nLor=\r\nd Krishna further proclaims (9.30), &quot;Even if the most sinful person worship=\r\ns me with unwavering devotion, he must be considered as righteous for he ha=\r\ns made the right resolve&quot;. So are we to understand that the sinful person s=\r\ntraightaway attains the same state as the righteous? No, certainly not. The=\r\n Lord Himself unambigiously clarifies this in the very next verse wherein H=\r\ne says that such a person &quot;BECOMES&quot; righteous and attains everlasting peace=\r\n. Here the EFFECT of the RIGHT RESOLVE is declared and the devotees are ass=\r\nured that they will never perish.  \n\nLikewise the Devi too is assuring us t=\r\nhat She will fondly accept all acts of worship, sacrificial offerings and h=\r\nomas whether they are done with appropriate knowledge or not. Her devotees =\r\nwill never perish irrespective of whether they have the right knowledge of =\r\nhow to worship Her or not. She will fondly accept the worship, offerings et=\r\nc of both classes of devotees. In accordance with Lord Krishna&#39;s affirmatio=\r\nn, here too those who worship Her without appropriate knowledge of mantras,=\r\n procedures etc, by their very resolve to worship Her, will soon attain the=\r\n knowledge of the same and thereby attain Her. This verse is also a reminde=\r\nr that one need not stay away from worshipping Her because they have no kno=\r\nwledge or only limited knowledge of how to worship Her. Every sadhaka has t=\r\no perform the worship to the best of his/her abilities sincerely and humbly=\r\n after surrendering to Her. Her grace will enable the rest to happen natura=\r\nlly be it the required knowledge or initiation or something else. In conclu=\r\nsion through this verse, the Devi is encouraging all of us to worship Her i=\r\nrrespective of our current level of knowledge.\n\n\nRegards,\nSatya Prakash\n\nNo=\r\nte: Please see the following link for an explanation of the same verse by a=\r\nnother practitioner. \n\nhttp://kamakhyamandir.org/vidya/scriptures/mother-ac=\r\ncepts-all-sincere-worship/\n\n\n                                   \n\n\n"}}
