When my bus was approaching the ashram on the Chengam Road I\nask=\r\ned the driver to stop and let me off near Palakothu, just west of the\nashra=\r\nm. S. S. Cohen occupied a small cottage there and during my previous\nstay i=\r\nn Tiruvannamalai he often requested me to come and live with him in\nPalakot=\r\nhu. I decided to take him up on the offer. Leaving my luggage in his\nroom, =\r\nI walked over to the ashram, entered the Old Hall, prostrated before\nthe Ma=\r\nharshi and sat down until 11:00 a.m., which was the dinner time. I\nthen ret=\r\nurned to Cohen&#39;s cottage to eat. I didn&#39;t realize at the time that\ndevotees=\r\n just arriving after a long absence were usually requested to take\ntheir fi=\r\nrst meal with Bhagavan, even though, as in my case, they may be\nliving outs=\r\nide the ashram. When Bhagavan came to Palakothu on his walk after\nlunch, hi=\r\ns attendant stopped and told me that Bhagavan, not seeing me in the\ndining =\r\nhall, had inquired as to my whereabouts. The attendant stayed and\ntalked to=\r\n us as Bhagavan continued on alone. I was very touched by the\nMaharshi&#39;s so=\r\nlicitude. I met him as he was returning from his walk and told\nhim about my=\r\n North Indian trip. I began narrating my visit to Krishnaprem\nand told Bhag=\r\navan how keen he was to hear all about him and Ramanasramam. It\nwas then th=\r\ne month of May, the hottest time of the year.\n\nI explained to Bhagavan how =\r\ndelightfully pleasant and cool the climate of\nAlmora was, especially compar=\r\ned to the present weather in\nTiruvannamalai. Bhagavan\nsaid, &quot;The real cooln=\r\ness is within. If we have that coolness it will be cool\nwherever we go. Sim=\r\nilarly, if you want to protect your feet from the rough\nground, you don&#39;t t=\r\nry to cover the earth with a piece of leather. You simply\nput leather shoes=\r\n on your own feet and the job is done.&quot;\n\nIn this same year, 1939, I occupie=\r\nd another hut near Cohen&#39;s in Palakothu.\nThis hut consisted of two small ro=\r\noms, about six feet by eight feet each. I\nstayed in one of these and Swami =\r\nPrajnanananda, a westerner, was using the\nother. One night before I returne=\r\nd from the ashram, someone broke the lock\non the door and made off with my =\r\nsuitcase and some other things. The next\nday I searched in the nearby woods=\r\n and found the suitcase, which contained\nmostly books. The books were scatt=\r\nered around near the suitcase. I collected\nthem and returned to my room. A =\r\nshort time later there was another robbery.\nSomeone pounded a hole in the m=\r\nud wall near the window frame. At this exact\nplace I kept some money in a j=\r\nar. Somebody must have seen me taking money\nfrom there and got the idea of =\r\nstealing it. The next day when Bhagavan came\nto Palakothu on his walk I tol=\r\nd him about the theft. He looked over the\nscene and explained to others how=\r\n some of these local people keep an eye\nopen for such opportunities, and ho=\r\nw they must have seen me take money from\nthat jar and decided to pound a ho=\r\nle in the wall to get at it. He then told\nme that I should not keep anythin=\r\ng in this place that would be desired by\nothers. I therefore shifted my bel=\r\nongings to town and gradually moved back\nthere myself.\n\nBhagavan&#39;s brother =\r\nhad to endure considerable criticism while managing the\nashram. Even so, th=\r\nere is little doubt that Bhagavan used him as his\ninstrument. When Niranjan=\r\nananda Swami felt an inner prompting from Bhagavan,\nhe confidently acted on=\r\n it. The following may be an example of one such\noccasion.\n\nIt is widely kn=\r\nown that Paul Brunton&#39;s book, A Search in Secret India, did\nmuch to make kn=\r\nown to the world that the Maharshi, a unique sage of this\ncentury, was livi=\r\nng inTiruvannamalai. Brunton was a professional writer and\nin those days wh=\r\nerever he would go he would often be seen taking notes on\nbits of paper. Wh=\r\nile in the Old Hall listening to questions put to Bhagavan\nand his replies,=\r\n he would be eagerly taking notes. After the success of A\nSearch in Secret =\r\nIndia, he began writing many other books in which he would\nsometimes adopt =\r\nthe Maharshi&#39;s teachings without giving due acknowledgment.\nWhen the ashram=\r\n authorities realized this they decided to stop him from\ntaking notes in th=\r\ne hall.\n\nOne day in 1939, Brunton was sitting next to me taking notes as us=\r\nual when\nNiranjanananda Swami boldly walked into the hall, stood next to Bh=\r\nagavan and\ntold Munagala Venkataramiah to tell Brunton in English that he i=\r\ns no longer\npermitted to take notes while sitting before Bhagavan. Brunton =\r\nwas told\naccordingly. Brunton looked at Venkataramiah and said, &#39;Is this al=\r\nso\nBhagavan&#39;s view ?&#39; Venkataramiah did not reply to this question and Bhag=\r\navan\nwho was quietly sitting there didn&#39;t say a word either. A few tense mo=\r\nments\npassed. Then Brunton stood up and left the hall. That was the last ti=\r\nme he\ntook notes in the hall, and that was also when Brunton began distanci=\r\nng\nhimself from the ashram.\n\nIt was very unusual to see the Sarvadhikari ap=\r\npear so bold and authoritative\nbefore the Maharshi. He must have felt that =\r\nthis exploitation should stop\nand was confident that Bhagavan was behind hi=\r\nm.\n\n\nSources\n\n1) http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Djul-aug\n2=\r\n) http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=\r\n=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd2de02266bba047da7d3d3\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIt was near the end of May in 1938 when I returned to Ramanasram=\r\nam from North India.
