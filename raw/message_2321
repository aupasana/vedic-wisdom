[The dualist says:] Just as the\npotter makes pots. Go=\r\nd the potter; we the pots. . . . In more philosophical\nlanguage the questio=\r\nn is: How is it taken for granted that the real nature\nof man is pure, perf=\r\nect, and infinite? This is the one difficulty found in\nany system of monism=\r\n. Everything else is clean and clear. This question\ncannot be answered. The=\r\n monists say the question itself is a contradiction.\n\nTake the system of du=\r\nalism =97 the question is asked why God created the\nworld. This is contradi=\r\nctory. Why? Because =97 what is the idea of God? He is\na being who cannot b=\r\ne acted upon by anything outside.\n\nYou and I are not free. I am thirsty. Th=\r\nere is something called thirst, over\nwhich I have no control, [which] force=\r\ns me to drink water. Every action of\nmy body and even every thought of my m=\r\nind is forced out of me. I have got to\ndo it. That is why I am bound . . . =\r\n. I am forced to do this, to have this,\nand so on . . . . And what is meant=\r\n by why and wherefore? [Being subject to\nexternal forces.] Why do you drink=\r\n water? Because thirst forces you. You are\na slave. You never do anything o=\r\nf your own will because you are forced to do\neverything. Your only motive f=\r\nor action is some force. . . .\n\nThe earth, by itself, would never move unle=\r\nss something forced it. Why does\nthe light burn? It does not burn unless so=\r\nmebody comes and strikes a match.\nThroughout nature, everything is bound. S=\r\nlavery, slavery! To be in harmony\nwith nature is [slavery]. What is there i=\r\nn being the slave of nature and\nliving in a golden cage? The greatest law a=\r\nnd order is in the [knowledge\nthat man is essentially free and divine] Now =\r\nwe see that the question why\nand wherefore can only be asked [in ignorance]=\r\n. I can only be forced to do\nsomething through something else.\n\n[You say] G=\r\nod is free. Again you ask the question why God creates the world.\nYou contr=\r\nadict yourself. The meaning of God is entirely free will. The\nquestion put =\r\nin logical language is this: What forced Him, who can never be\nforced by an=\r\nybody, to create the world? You say in the same question, What\nforced Him? =\r\nThe question is nonsense. He is infinite by His very nature; He\nis free. We=\r\n shall answer questions when you can ask them in logical\nlanguage. Reason w=\r\nill tell you that there is only one Reality, nothing else.\nWherever dualism=\r\n has risen, monism came to a head and drove it out.\n\nMany want pleasure [as=\r\n] the goal. For that pleasure they seek only the\nsenses. On the higher plan=\r\nes much pleasure is to be sought. Then on\nspiritual planes. Then in himself=\r\n =97 God within him. The man whose pleasure\nis outside of [himself] becomes=\r\n unhappy when that outside thing goes. You\ncannot depend for this pleasure =\r\nupon anything in this universe. If all my\npleasures are in myself, I must h=\r\nave pleasure there all the time because I\ncan never lose my Self. . . . Mot=\r\nher, father, child, wife, body, wealth =97\neverything I can lose except my =\r\nself . . . bliss in the Self All desire is\ncontained in the Self. . . . Thi=\r\ns is individuality which never changes, and\nthis is perfect.\n\nWhatever we [=\r\nthink] that we become. If you think you are poor sinners you\nhypnotise your=\r\nselves: &quot;I am a miserable, crawling worm.&quot; Those who believe\nin hell are in=\r\n hell when they die; those who say that they will go to heaven\n[go to heave=\r\nn].\n\nThere is not much value in books, and in [secondhand] religion there i=\r\ns no\nvalue whatsoever. It is like eating. Your religion would not satisfy m=\r\ne\nJesus saw God and Buddha saw God. If you have not seen God, you are no\nbe=\r\ntter than the atheist. Only he is quiet, and you talk much and disturb the\n=\r\nworld with your talk. Books and bibles and scriptures are of no use. I met\n=\r\nan old man when I was a boy; [he did not study any scripture, but he\ntransm=\r\nitted the truth of God by a touch].\n\nSilence ye teachers of the world. Sile=\r\nnce ye books. Lord, Thou alone speak\nand Thy servant listeneth. . . . If tr=\r\nuth is not there, what is the use of\nthis life? We all think we will catch =\r\nit, but we do not. Most of us catch\nonly dust. God is not there. If no God,=\r\n what is the use of life? Is there\nany resting-place in the universe? [It i=\r\ns up to us to find it]; only we do\nnot [search for it intensely. We are] li=\r\nke a little piece of maw carried on\nin the current.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wiki=\r\nsource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Practical_=\r\nVedanta_and_other_lectures/The_Goal\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPra=\r\nsanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00163600d853dc2a830471ca4f1e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family=\r\n:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;THE GOAL (Deliv=\r\nered in San Francisco, March 27, 1900)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why did the infinite G=\r\nod make this world?
