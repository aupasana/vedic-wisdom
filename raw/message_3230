My only point in\nVegterianism is related to Compession=\r\n against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)\nagainst Adharama (Killing Innocent =\r\ncreatures).\n***\nAnyway, my point is, I understand that it is good to eat to=\r\ntally vegetarian food when you engage in sadhana, specially things like hav=\r\nans, or else it conflicts with your system badly.\nIn my opinion, Saadhana o=\r\nr No Saadhana, if something is not correct will remain Incorrect. killing f=\r\nor filling stomach is if Not right then for me it&#39;ll remain *Not right in a=\r\nll conditions*. it is a different matter, if in future i succumb to challan=\r\nging conditions and start eating meat but even then it&#39;ll not justify and m=\r\nake it proper thing.\n***\nDear Rajarshi, Now i hope you don&#39;t get offended b=\r\ny my message. i apologise in advance for my bluntness.\n your second Para an=\r\nd some writings in your earlier message gives me impression that you are he=\r\navily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be ve=\r\nry honest. \nIn my opinon, if one can justify eating popular meat of chicken=\r\n, etc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable.  with that logic, those peo=\r\nple who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alrig=\r\nht. even people who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable and=\r\n not doing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.\nTo talk about Karma,=\r\n Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to make quality judgements by the lo=\r\ngic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of already dead&#39; does not go well =\r\nwith me. it is just a philosophy to cover up.\nPoeple born in Those cultures=\r\n have become Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved. I gave an examp=\r\nle of one such person and there are few more i know. howvever they are very=\r\n very very rare.\n***\nThe above arguments are incorrect. I know some non-veg=\r\netarian people who provide such arguements,  but these arguments are nonsen=\r\nsical and childish. Almost Zakir Naik style of arguments.\n I agree complete=\r\nly. it is childish, Laughable and cruel jokes. Thats how i also take it whe=\r\nn such people talk such nonsense.\n***\nLastly, i&#39;ll add a philospohical thou=\r\nght.

My point is, as a non-vegetarian I am not claiming that I ha=\r\nve any special sensitivity to plants, over animals. No. All I am saying is =\r\nthat,=C3=82  this logic that many vegetarian people provide to convince ave=\r\nrage non-veg people to quit eating non-veg, does not hold good.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;=\r\n I personally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats.=\r\n its pathetic site. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the c=\r\nutting of throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash =\r\nof so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for =\r\nthe humans that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish wh=\r\nich comes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;=\r\nt have proper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of water=\r\n). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; I underst=\r\nand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share them. Call m=\r\ne cruel hearted. \n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; When the question of sensitivity comes in, th=\r\nere is no universal standard for such. It is moslty a case of conditioning.=\r\n What one feels disgusted or pained about may not affect another. Same rule=\r\n cannot be used to judge everyone.=C3=82  \n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; Some of my non-veget=\r\narian friends were watching discovery channel where they showed that people=\r\n in some parts of the world eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I ask=\r\ned them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=82 if=\r\n someone eats an insect. Just because one is born in a certain area in a ce=\r\nrtain culture in a certain set of value, one gets the believe that what one=\r\n is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I told them if in a future life ti=\r\nme they were to be born in that place, they would gladly keep eating insect=\r\ns without the slightest doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible pro=\r\nduct of our own conditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the proble=\r\nm happens when we think our conditions are the only possible conditioning i=\r\nn the world, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. =\r\nThat is incorrect. Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is. Ever=\r\nything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a\n&gt; vegetarian in this life, if =\r\nhe gets born in a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=82 eat=\r\ns non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid while eating the sa=\r\nme. I know=C3=82 people who faint at the sight of blood, but there are doct=\r\nors who do multiple operations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity =\r\ncan be a very good reason for an individual, but it=C3=82 cannot be=C3=82 a=\r\n universal logic applicable to all.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; A far better angle of tackl=\r\ning this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is no=\r\nt directly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but=\r\n rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily.=\r\n Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82 does not want to deal in the =\r\nraw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma =\r\nthat you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=\r\n=C3=82 It is similar to the one you would get for buying some simple daal w=\r\nhich has come to the market through the hands of a middle man who has cheat=\r\ned the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions in all=\r\n food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - broiler =\r\neggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten because t=\r\nhey never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma does=\r\n one get for consuming that? God knows.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; An average non-vegetari=\r\nan, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple =\r\ndiet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. F=\r\nrom a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. People who feed=\r\n on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to se=\r\nrious heath issues at a younger age.

Karama, Desh/=\r\nkaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my opino=\r\nn, if one can justify eating&nbsp;popular meat of&nbsp;chicken, etc..&nbsp;=\r\nthen anything under the Sun is eatable.&nbsp; with that logic, those people=\r\n who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright.=\r\n even people who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable and no=\r\nt doing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To talk about Ka=\r\nrma, Conditioning, Culture&nbsp;etc..., and&nbsp;try to&nbsp;make quality j=\r\nudgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of already dead=\r\n&#39; does not go well with me.&nbsp;it is&nbsp;just a philosophy to cover up.&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Poeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becuase they ha=\r\nte killing invloved.

My point is, as a non-v=\r\negetarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to plants, =\r\nover animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=82&nbsp; this logic that many=\r\n vegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit eatin=\r\ng non-veg, does not hold good.&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; I personally c=\r\nan not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic s=\r\nite. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutting of throa=\r\nt of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly b=\r\nutchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that=\r\n they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which comes out o=\r\nf water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper E=\r\nnglish word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and then the=\r\n dead fish thus is so tasty.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share=\r\n them. Call me cruel hearted. &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; When the questi=\r\non of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for such. It is =\r\nmoslty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may=\r\n not affect another. Same rule cannot be used to\n judge everyone.=C3=82&nbs=\r\np; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were wat=\r\nching discovery channel where they showed that people in some parts of the =\r\nworld eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If yo=\r\nu can eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=82&nbsp;if someone eats an =\r\ninsect. Just because one is born in a certain area in a certain culture in =\r\na certain set of value, one gets the believe that what one is not accustome=\r\nd to must be incorrect. I told them if in a future life time they were to b=\r\ne born in that place, they would gladly keep eating insects without the sli=\r\nghtest doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own c=\r\nonditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we=\r\n think our conditions are the only possible conditioning in the world, and =\r\ntherefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. That is incorrect=\r\n. Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is.\n Everything is desh-k=\r\naal-patra. A person who is a&lt;br&gt;&gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets bo=\r\nrn in a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=82&nbsp;eats non=\r\n-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I=\r\n know=C3=82&nbsp;people who faint at the sight of blood, but there are doct=\r\nors who do multiple operations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity =\r\ncan be a very good reason for an individual, but it=C3=82&nbsp;cannot be=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;a universal logic applicable to all.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nA far better angle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if som=\r\neone can make sure he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a li=\r\nve animal to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma gener=\r\nated can be handled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-veget=\r\narian food. The amount of karma that you would get for it is quite\n acceptb=\r\nle IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=82&nbsp;It is similar to the one you w=\r\nould get for buying some simple daal which has come to the market through t=\r\nhe hands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else=\r\n. There is karmic repurcussions in all food we eat in this age. It is unavo=\r\nidable. There are some eggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. T=\r\nhey are designed to be eaten because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot=\r\n like dead from birth. What karma does one get for consuming that? God know=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; An average non-vegetarian, at least in Indi=\r\na, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 =\r\npercent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. From a scientific poi=\r\nnt of view, this is a good combination. People who feed on more than 60 per=\r\ncent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to serious heath issues a=\r\nt a younger age. But this 80-20 veg/non-veg, is biologically\n good.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;If we don&#39;t eat fish=\r\n then sea will be full of fishes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg f=\r\nood will become unaffordable if everybody will become vegetarian :Etc...are=\r\n more often than not, put up such arguments to defend however as i said ear=\r\nlier they are themselves not convinced.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The above=\r\n arguments are incorrect.
