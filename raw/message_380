In fact, one who keeps checking various das=\r\nas, somanath drekkana, vimsamsa etc, pondering on atmakaraka, ishta devata =\r\netc and waiting for the right dasa, right deity and right mantra with the r=\r\night number of letters etc is more likely to lose oneself easily!\n \nIf one =\r\ndoes prayoga of a mantra for killing an enemy or attracting someone or some=\r\nthing like that, things are different. Then rules do matter. But I want to =\r\nemphasize that the rules given in books are full of corruptions and no wond=\r\ner people trying such feats these days suffer so much.\n \nBut sadhana meant =\r\njust for spiritual progress comes with no risks. If something is wrong, the=\r\n only implication is that progress is slow. Still slow progress is better t=\r\nhan no progress or retrogression.\n \nMy point is that Jyotish knowledge avai=\r\nlable to us today is not perfect and contains many corruptions. Anybody who=\r\n thinks otherwise has not studied deeply enough yet. :-)\n \nWe can learn Jyo=\r\ntish, respect it and use it when possible, but we cannot rely on it to deci=\r\nde when to do spiritual sadhana and when to wait. If one *wants* to do a sa=\r\ndhana, there is no reason to wait. Right now is the best time. At best, wai=\r\nt for a good muhurta in a few weeks or months. But, using somanatha drekkan=\r\na or vimsamsa and waiting for right dasa is unneeded. God knows if the dasa=\r\n system you are using is the correct one or not. There are so many dasas af=\r\nter all.\n \nIf astrology says your digestion will be weak when Jupiter trans=\r\nits a particular sign, will you stop eating during that one year and wait f=\r\nor Jupiter to move out of the sign? Spiritual sadhana is as much of a *need=\r\n* as food, water and air. One who realizes *that* should just go full-steam=\r\n ahead instead of bookishly checking so many technicalities of astrology ba=\r\nsed on a corrupt understanding.\n \nNot all differences are valid by the way.=\r\n Sometimes differences are a result of two people looking at something from=\r\n two angles. Both views can be appreciated and understood. Sometimes differ=\r\nences are a result of corruption, confusion and outright mistakes. In such =\r\ncases, we can ignore one view.\n \n&gt; Difference is the very essence of Prakri=\r\nti and the one who doesn`t\n&gt; appreciate it, doesn`t know nor respect Mother=\r\n and will hardly reach\n&gt; the freedom from Her maya.\n \n:-) :-) Yaa devi sarv=\r\na *buddhi* rupena samsthitaa namastasyai namastasyai namastasyai namo namah=\r\n. Also, yaa devi sarva *bhraanti* rupena samsthitaa namastasyai namastasyai=\r\n namastasyai namo namah. The mother shines in all as the wisdom and discrim=\r\nination and the same mother shines in all as the confusion and delusion. Bo=\r\nth are Her manifestations.

What you wrote is well-taken.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That is why chastity and b=\r\nramacarya has always been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; considered the highest virtue. No YOga can =\r\nhappen without chastity.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; That is absolutely correct. Brahmacharya=\r\n and control of one&#39;s sexual\n&gt; thoughts is quite needed to make spiritual p=\r\nrogress.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If anybody maintains brahmacharya for one year while per=\r\nforming a 45\n&gt; minute homam everyday or meditating with Gayatri mantra (or =\r\nsome other\n&gt; mantra) for 3 hours everyday, definitely he/she will cross som=\r\ne\n&gt; important hurdles and make some good progress.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is clear =\r\nwhy it is even more important for women to be chaste and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pious consid=\r\nering the strength of Moon and Venus in her body-gross and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; causal.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Chastity and brahmacharya are *equally important* for men and women=\r\n\n&gt; to make spiritual progress. But the level of difficulty one\n&gt; experience=\r\ns in controlling the mind depends on various factors such as\n&gt; gender and, =\r\nmore importantly, mental conditioning acquired from\n&gt; previous lives.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At least, Somannath drekana should be checked for the period of pooj=\r\nas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to see how the dasas support celibacy vow that is usually required=\r\n in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the cases of sadhanas whose aim is spiritual elevation. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Well, two relevant points:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (1) The astrology we know and unders=\r\ntand is imperfect without a\n&gt; doubt. Even knowledge taught unambiguously by=\r\n Maharshi Parasara is so\n&gt; misunderstood in this age. Then what to speak of=\r\n knowledge not found\n&gt; in the available teachings of Parasara and available=\r\n in the &quot;secrets&quot;\n&gt; of various paramparas? It is quite prone to corruptions=\r\n and\n&gt; misunderstanding. Can we *rely* on it?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (2) Astrology, even=\r\n when understood perfectly, only predicts the\n&gt; predisposition at a given t=\r\nime due to the dynamics of *previous*\n&gt; actions (karmas). The dynamics of p=\r\nrevious actions decides under what\n&gt; kind of circumstances one has to opera=\r\nte now. Those circumstances can\n&gt; place *limitations* on what actions can b=\r\ne performed *now*. Depending\n&gt; on the seriousness of previous actions decid=\r\ning the current\n&gt; circumstances, the limitations can be either mere challen=\r\nges or\n&gt; serious handicaps. But, in most cases, there are multiple actions\n=\r\n&gt; possible currently. Horoscope only decides the situations faced now.\n&gt; Th=\r\ne actions performed *now* are based on *free will* exerted now,\n&gt; which is =\r\nNOT captured by the horoscope.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If there is one good thing to use =\r\nfree will for, spiritual progress\n&gt; is definitely *the* thing. One should p=\r\nush one&#39;s free will to the\n&gt; extreme when it comes to spiritual progress. I=\r\nt is worth it! Forget\n&gt; somanatha drekkana and other tenets of astrology. W=\r\nhen the inspiration\n&gt; comes from within, just boldly take a vow, pray to go=\r\nd and your guru\n&gt; (if you have no guru, think of me or my Guru Dr Manish Pa=\r\nndit) and do\n&gt; your best to keep the vow.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; Even if one cannot keep brahmacharya, one can still do spiritual\n&gt; p=\r\nractices like homam and japam. It will atleast keep one floating\n&gt; (i.e. no=\r\nt sinking). Basically, one will keep accumulating shakti\n&gt; (purity) and kee=\r\np consuming it. So purification is slow. But atleast\n&gt; there is no further =\r\nimpurification. With brahmacharya, one can\n&gt; actually start accumulating sh=\r\nakti and purify oneself much faster.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Regarding women doing sadhanas:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A great Vedic scholar known as =\r\nUpasani maharaj lived at the time of\n&gt; Shirdi Sai Baba, about 100 years bac=\r\nk. He was learned in several Vedas\n&gt; and Upanishads and did tremendous sadh=\r\nana. Once he realized Self, he\n&gt; threw away his orthodoxy and went against =\r\nthe customs of the time\n&gt; boldly. He went and lived in Harijanwada (untouch=\r\nables colony), swept\n&gt; the floors there and forced the Brahmins from Brahma=\r\nnawada (Brahmins\n&gt; colony) who revered him highly to come *there* if they w=\r\nanted to see\n&gt; him! He opened a Vedic school for women and taught them chan=\r\nting Vedic\n&gt; mantras and performing traditional yajnas. He gave women of al=\r\nl births\n&gt; sacred thread and initiated them into vedic mantras and yajnas.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When Shridi Sai Baba saw him oneday, he said &quot;Upasani is God\n&gt; Hi=\r\nmself. Today we will do pooja to Upasani!&quot; and made his disciples do\n&gt; a po=\r\noja to Upasani maharaj.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A temple run by women stands in the place=\r\n of Upasani maharaj, a few\n&gt; miles away from Shirdi. If anyone goes to Shir=\r\ndi, it is a good idea to\n&gt; go to that temple. Though it has no rush, it has=\r\n very nice energy. It\n&gt; is a great place to meditate.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Also, Krish=\r\nna temple at Alandi near Pune where Sant Jnaneshwar\n&gt; Maharaj went into und=\r\nerground samadhi 700 years back (believed to be\n&gt; there even now) has a tre=\r\nmendous level of spiritual energy. It is also\n&gt; a great place for productiv=\r\ne meditation.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.ho=\r\nme.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tijana Damjanovic&quot;\n&gt; &lt;tijanadamjan=\r\novic@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; om krishna guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Ana and other members =\r\nof the thread,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Difference exists and it makes the world go rou=\r\nnd, which is perfectly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fine. After it is understood properly, no pots=\r\n and pans will be needed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to define anyones role or place under the su=\r\nn...that shines the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to one and all. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shrimad Devi Bhagav=\r\natam (one of the Upapuranas) states that sexual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; urge is much stronger=\r\n in the case of women. This is not surprising as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sexual urge is produ=\r\nced and governed by the liquid fluctuation in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body (watter, blood=\r\n, semen and hormones in the first place). This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fluctuation is much hi=\r\ngher in woman`s body due to the predominance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jala tatva in her bod=\r\ny governed by planets Moon and Venus. These two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; planets are also resp=\r\nonsible for the producing of the ojas (the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finniest energetic product=\r\n of our body that makes the brain function\n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly, it is often unde=\r\nrstood as a vigor, vitality and procreative\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power). In general, this =\r\nmeans that women can produce more ojas\n&gt; than man.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How is this relate=\r\nd to poojas and spirituality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sexual energy, or sexual thoughts, are =\r\nbeing transformed into ojas in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the process of yoga. The process of yo=\r\nga as one of its aim has lifting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the ojas from its storage in the =\r\nprimal chakra and its storing in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the brain. The more ojas in the brai=\r\nn the prettier, smarter and more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual we are. But this lifting o=\r\nf the ojas can be done ONLY by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chaste ones. That is why chastity and =\r\nbramacarya has always been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; considered the highest virtue. No YOga can=\r\n happen without chastity. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is clear why it is even more important f=\r\nor women to be chaste and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pious considering the strength of Moon and =\r\nVenus in her body-gross and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; causal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Without chastity, yogic pra=\r\ntice can lead into a mental disorder as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ojas and prana directly influ=\r\nence the work of the brain centres. Thus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is crucial how demanding =\r\nand serious the homam or pooja in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question, or any other, is. Prohibi=\r\ntion during the monthly cycle is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based upon this also-increasing of t=\r\nhe jala tatva and the sexual urge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At least, Somannath drekana should=\r\n be checked for the period of poojas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to see how the dasas support cel=\r\nibacy vow that is usually required in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the cases of sadhanas whose aim=\r\n is spiritual elevation. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The approaches to the final truth may be nu=\r\nmerous and different, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all of them must find their path through th=\r\ne Sushumna. The one who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; claims that this path is hidden or blocked to=\r\n women simply lacks ojas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in his/her brain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tijan=\r\na Damjanovic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; P.S.
