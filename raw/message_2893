One day a 80 year old sannayasin=A0 woman came to live in=\r\n the next room to me. She was from South and well educated and from a good =\r\nfamily. She told me several of her spiritual experiences.\n=A0 \nOne thing sh=\r\ne said that in Sri Giriraj area some holy men are living who are nearly 400=\r\n hundred years old. They come out of their hidden cave once a year on the d=\r\nay after Depaavali. But on that day thousands and thousands are doing Parik=\r\nrima. And with so many sadhus there, nobody pays them any attention.\n\nShe s=\r\naid when she learned about them she came to find them. No luck first and se=\r\ncond year. Perhaps it was third year when she said, that she took a vow tha=\r\nt she would not leave Sri Giriraj area till she finds them.\n\nShe said to me=\r\n that she saw them on that day from a distance. One lifted his hand in bles=\r\nsing and she understood that he was saying to her---- keep doing the Bhajan=\r\ns.\nThen they mingled in crowd and disappeared.\n\nI completely believed her s=\r\ntory.
