He was born and the time given in Notable \n&gt; Horoscop=\r\ne is also correct. Ved Vyasji was also alive in the same \n&gt; period when Shr=\r\ni Krishna was alive. Ved Vyasji tried to spread \n&gt; knowledge of Vedas and U=\r\npanishadas to common men and he wrote lots \n&gt; of Puranas and long poem of M=\r\nahabharat. Mahabharat was a reality but \n&gt; was not in the same form as narr=\r\nated by Vyasji. Vyasji has given \n&gt; immaginary characters and incidents but=\r\n his intention was to spread \n&gt; knowledge of Vedas/Upanishadas thru Gita. T=\r\nhere was a discussion \n&gt; between Krishna and Arjuna in a normal form and no=\r\nt in Sanskrit. He \n&gt; advised Arjuna to start war after giving him the theor=\r\ny of Karma. \n&gt; Vyasji just gave a poetic form in sanskrit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dr.Ashw=\r\nin Rawal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 23/12/08, utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Mahabhaarat is an epic or historical \n&gt; reality !!!\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wis=\r\ndom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 23 December, 2008, 12:17 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha Garu & Members,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is a l=\r\nong pending question with me and that is Historical \n&gt; &gt; reality or otherwi=\r\nse of our many revered personalities/ events.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Take for instance, &#39;=\r\nMahabhaarat&#39; & &#39;Shri Krishna&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would try to give some view point=\r\ns gathered from all these years \n&gt; &gt; from various sources and my own thinki=\r\nng as well-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Mahatma Gandhi didn&#39;t belive that Mahabhaarat was a=\r\n reality.he \n&gt; &gt; thought that it was &#39;epic&#39;-creation of a poet. he seems to=\r\n be \n&gt; unable \n&gt; &gt; to belive logically the creation of 100 sons etc...\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 2) How can parents name their children as &#39;DURYodhan&#39;, &#39;Du:Shasan&#39; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; etc.. i am not sure about the meaning of the names but it implies \n&gt; &gt; so=\r\nmething perverted. knwoledgable person in sanskrit can shed some \n&gt; &gt; light=\r\n on this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Mahabhaarat was a Grand Poem created by super-intelli=\r\ngent \n&gt; author, \n&gt; &gt; Maharshi Vyaas and hence Gita was also his own creatio=\r\nn and \n&gt; krsihna \n&gt; &gt; was just a &#39;imaginary&#39; central character of his grand=\r\n work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; !.....!..... !\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Dr. Raman, in Notable Horoscopes=\r\n has strongly written that Shri \n&gt; &gt; Krishna was a historically reality. Hi=\r\ns reasoning was that an \n&gt; &gt; *Imaginery creation* of some poet can never In=\r\nspire & attract \n&gt; &gt; millions of people for thousans of years.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) =\r\nIf Maharshi Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabhaarat to \n&gt; &gt; satisf=\r\ny his poetic genious then how come he himself features in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; story=\r\n? if let&#39;s consider even that as a possibility but then WHY \n&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll writ=\r\ne another book just on Shri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. why \n&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll himself=\r\n Worship his own &#39;Kaalpanik Paatra&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was never =\r\nborn, then how come so many Saints of \n&gt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.\n&gt; &gt; O=\r\nne can argue that becuase of their intense worship of that \n&gt; &gt; perticular =\r\nForm, they could see the same form of the supreme \n&gt; &gt; reality...the suprem=\r\ne power can take any form for the Bhakta.\n&gt; &gt; The solid counter argument is=\r\n that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and \n&gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, never we=\r\nre a Devotee of that form of \n&gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in their case=\r\n, without devotion & \n&gt; desire \n&gt; &gt; they got to see the form of Shri Krushn=\r\na?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts about this?
