Swami Saradananda takes so my pains to beautifully explain various aspec=\r\nts of Ramakrishna&#39;s spiritual behaviour and general explanations of spiritu=\r\nal things as well.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nFor example it is from this book that I fir=\r\nst understood why an Avatar like Ramakrishna had to perform such severe sad=\r\nhana. Also thiis book gives a detailed recording of Ramakrishna&#39;s Tantric s=\r\nadhanas, how he completed all the 64 kriyas.\n=C2=A0\nThere is one point I ha=\r\nve observed with Ramakrishna&#39;s teachings.His advises are often specific to =\r\nthe person he was advising. For someone he may say=C2=A0study the Adhyatma =\r\nRamayana, for another he advised never to touch the Adhyatma Ramayana! Like=\r\n a perfect teacher he advised the specific medicine for the specific proble=\r\nm=C2=A0in the path of spirituality that the specific person was facing.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nSecond is his =C2=A0fantastic razor sharp intellect. No one gives bette=\r\nr examples to explain some aspect of spirituality than=C2=A0Ramakrishna. Si=\r\nmple yet perfect. He uses the intellect to explain yet does not get caught =\r\nup in the mazes of words. \n=C2=A0\nThird and most important, the range of sp=\r\niritual moods he expressed was staggering. With all due to respect to every=\r\n great master who has walked on this planet, I can&#39;t recall another name wh=\r\no has expressed/manifested such diverse spiritual moods. His spiritual jour=\r\nney is not like a bicycle race but rather a seven course meal where he reli=\r\nshes every dish to the core.\n=C2=A0\nJuding purely from an intellectual pers=\r\npective, I believe there are=C2=A0some possibility of corruption in the tea=\r\nchings of almost all masters starting from Jesus to Buddha to Shanakara to =\r\nGuru Nanak to Chaitanya to Vivekanada to=C2=A0Aurobindo . Corruptions not i=\r\nn the teaching per se=C2=A0but corruption arising out of misinterpretation =\r\nof the words over time. One cannot really blame them for this because it is=\r\n almost impossible to forsee what turn of events lead to what kind of minds=\r\nets which can make their statements/advises defuct or even dangerous over t=\r\nime.\n=C2=A0\nFor example, Jesus says I am the path. Obviously Christians hav=\r\ne mistook this to understand that Jesus is the only path. What he ment by I=\r\n may not be Jesus the man, but Jesus the idea - of purity and of love.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nBuddha gave a practical advise that Nirvana is sunya and practical spir=\r\nituality is more important than spiritual discussion. People mistook that t=\r\no understand Budha was as atheist.\n=C2=A0\nShanakara, the great man that he =\r\nwas, would have died of a heart attack if he saw the flippant way in which =\r\nwe later day college educated Indians use the phrases like=C2=A0Aham Brahma=\r\nsmi and everything is Brahman as if we are speaking about the latest movie =\r\nin town. =C2=A0Also I feel his misjudged certain paths like Tantra.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nGuru Nanak in order to infuse more life into spirituality of Hindus as well=\r\n as Muslims and bring a comprise in the two ideas decried practises like id=\r\nol worship and pitri tarpan.\n=C2=A0\nChaitanya was the emotional pinnacle of=\r\n spirituality. He was capable. Others less capable misunderstood the path t=\r\no feel that without shedding bucket full of tears you wont land at God&#39;s do=\r\norsteps. Emotions are good, but they can mislead too.\n=C2=A0\nVivekananda - =\r\nabsolute leader. Like all leaders, he does make some statements at times wh=\r\nich are not well deliberated upon, which results in misinterpretations late=\r\nr on. Of course a leader cannot be expected to think for ten days before sp=\r\neaking one=C2=A0 sentence. A leader has to be spontaneous, just like Viveka=\r\nnada, but the price of spontaneity is misrepresentation at a later date spe=\r\ncially if you are fantastic.\n=C2=A0\nAurobindo, brilliant and rare analysis =\r\nof spiritual steps/stages. One that I have never found in any other writing=\r\n. However the problem is exactly the same. Often people wrongly believe tha=\r\nt only by reading and intellectually comprehending Aurobindo;s writings one=\r\n can make spiritual progress. There is no substitute for raw old fashioned =\r\nsadhana.\n=C2=A0\nPlease note all these are great men were=C2=A0without quest=\r\nion, spiritually much realized. I am merely doing an intellectual analysis =\r\nfrom a historial perspective.\n=C2=A0\nAnd then Ramakrishna, such a vast rang=\r\ne of emotions and practices coupled with simple and pointed examples=C2=A0a=\r\nnd advises, it is hardly possible for him to get misinterpreted. He uses Sh=\r\nanakra&#39;s phrase &quot;Brahma satya jagat mithya&quot; but he also teaches Totapuri wh=\r\ny Mahamaya is so powerful. He seems like a perfect assimilation of all idea=\r\ns.\n=C2=A0\nJust my two cents. \n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bha=\r\nirava - Shiva Sutra\n\n--- On Fri, 20/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@yahoo=\r\n.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] Re: How Ramakrishna deals with a debater.\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com\nDate: Friday, 20 November, 2009, 9:17 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nNamaste Rajar=\r\nshi,\n\n&gt;That is the effect of Ramakrishna, who was born and brought up in a =\r\n&gt;village in west bengal, who probably could not even sign his own &gt;name.\n\nR=\r\namakrishna, whom i lovingly address as &#39;Thakur&#39; is simply Rama and Krishna =\r\nand no less......\n\nAnd Kathamruta is THE book which has given answers and c=\r\nonfirmations to my queries and understandings which haunted me from childho=\r\nod.

The brahmani - who was Thakur&#39;s guru - had called =\r\nGauri for a session of discussion on the spiritual abilities etc of Thakur.=\r\n Now Gauri was a very famous debater and a sadhaka=C3=82=C2=A0who never los=\r\nt any debate. \n&gt; Plus Thakur used to say that Gauri had remakrable siddhis.=\r\n He used to perform a homa of Ma Kali by stretching out his left hand, pili=\r\nng wood on the bare=C3=82=C2=A0arm, lighting it and then using his right ha=\r\nnd to pour ghee! And the homa would last for an hour or more and he would k=\r\neep his left hand perfectly still all this while. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; He had =\r\na certain siddhi in the use of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtue of which one c=\r\nould never win in a debate=C3=82=C2=A0against him. Plus he had a deep, reso=\r\nunding voice which Ramakrishna described as the &quot;rumbling of clouds&quot;.\n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; When Gauri entered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw th=\r\ne Kali temple, he started repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that tim=\r\ne was coming out of the temple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna starte=\r\nd saying that specific mantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that G=\r\nauri could hear. Gauri, on being thus challanged=C3=82=C2=A0started shoutin=\r\ng the mantra even louded. To this Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just g=\r\niven him a divine voice and he too thundered back. Gauri was even more amaz=\r\ned. He roared again=C3=82=C2=A0but Ramakrishna roared louder. Finally, sudd=\r\nenly Gauri realized he has lost his voice. And his siddhi too! \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; At first he was furious with anger and ego but soon he became friends=\r\n with Ramakrishna. Finally he proclaimed that Ramakrishna was He by a fract=\r\nion of whose power do Avatars come down on earth. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Later o=\r\nne day Gauri came to Ramakrishna asking for his blessing to take sanyasa. H=\r\ne quit debating and went away from that place, promising that he would not =\r\nreturn untill he realized the Self.

Sardar Patel is the one for whom i h=\r\nave same love and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda or Naras=\r\nimha. Why? Because all the 3 were the ideal statesman who did us proud not =\r\nonly by effectively countering religious fanaticism but also BECAUSE THEY O=\r\nPERATED IN THE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA&#39;. BIGOTRY CAN NEVER BE ATT=\r\nACHED TO THEM. And for me this is fantastic and fitting to the ideals of Sa=\r\nnatan Dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding Dr. Zakir Naik: I did not kn=\r\now about him initially. a year and half back, i visited Oman and there once=\r\n i switched on TV where in i saw that person on &#39;Peace&#39; Channel. He was lec=\r\nturing in front of a gathering and he used a word &#39;Veda&#39; which interested m=\r\ne to go through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t remember the topic but i felt so much=\r\n saddened by his lecture. The reason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hin=\r\nduism and Christianity for proving his points. Immediately in my mind came =\r\nchannels like &#39;Sanskaar&#39; and &#39;Ashta&#39; where a lot of religious pundits (most=\r\n of them are Hindus) come for discourses. and i do not remember any instanc=\r\ne where in they have attacked any religious sentiments of other faiths to u=\r\nphold values of Sanatan Dharma. there is such an obvious contrast.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; af=\r\nter that first lecture, i watched Zakir&#39;s other lectures and was convinced =\r\nthat this person is not a true spiritual leader but a polished intellectual=\r\n who essentially is a fanatic and then never stopped to see him further. I =\r\nremember having a debate at the same site (at Oman) with a Young person of =\r\nIslamic faith. we debated on the issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. =\r\nNaik, an email, asking him that does he really believe that other religions=\r\n and faith are also true. I must say that, i found that young Muslim engine=\r\ner had much more tolerance and understanding than Dr Zakir Naik.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nunfortunate part is that the broad minded people of today&#39;s generations are=\r\n getting corrupted by such fanatic leaders.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As i hav=\r\ne many Muslim, Chrisitan Friends (Really good friends), i never loose a cha=\r\nnce to advocate my views -&quot;The time has come when we must not only &#39;respect=\r\n&#39; the other religious faiths but also we must belive in our heart of hearts=\r\n that every faith/religion is true and we must never try to convert people =\r\nof other religion to our religion but on the contrary we must discourage a =\r\nperson who wants to formally convert by telling him/her that yours is also =\r\nright and don&#39;t get in to such theatrics.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I absolutely echo Th=\r\nakur Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are paths, as many opinion are there&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; About Sri Sri, i must say that i believe him as a great spiritual le=\r\nader. i&#39;ve some past experiences which makes me believe that. Now that is t=\r\nhe reason i wish to know his views on this particular debate episode. I kno=\r\nw he has a great knowledge and he also is a scholar but then why he did not=\r\n counter Dr. Zakir?. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Siva wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some clues - A=\r\nOL silver jubilee with over 2 million people meditating and doing Sudarshan=\r\n Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006.

The actions of =\r\nan englightened master established in Sahaja Samadhi does not need to satis=\r\nfy our mental concepts of how things should be. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For examp=\r\nle, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of the highest order, ran away from the ba=\r\nttlefield when Jarasandh attacked Mathura instead of fighting and defeating=\r\n Jarasandh.

Can we give a satisfying intellectual answer to it i=\r\nf people raise questions?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Aurobindo gave a beautiful e=\r\nxplanation about it. It was something like: If Krishna were constrained to =\r\nwin all times, that would be a limitation in itself! An Avatar chooses even=\r\n defeat if it is necessary for a larger and more complete victory in the sc=\r\nheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read the original to get his exact w=\r\nords.. I read it long ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another instance that comes to =\r\nmind - Some thieves came and beat up Ramana Maharishi and made a big nuisan=\r\nce in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with equanimity. Sri Ramana was =\r\nthe Spiritual head of the Ashram and one can intellectually argue that it w=\r\nas his dharma to protect the ashram and inmates from the thieves. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, there were certain things that I did not want to put in a=\r\nn public email. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silverjubilee with over =\r\n2 million people meditating and doing sudarhsn Kriya together happened arou=\r\nnd Feb 16, 2006.

Sometimes he attends some events which cannot be explained l=\r\nogically by his disciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty ab=\r\nout an enlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contai=\r\nn them in our mind.

It was a judgement of those without any k=\r\nnowledge or understanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does not understa=\r\nnd Sri Krishna might judge him differently for several of His acts which co=\r\nuld not be intellectually explained.

In fact, this is a question that w=\r\nas raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know him. In fact, i=\r\nf one looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like =\r\nSri Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an au=\r\nthority on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learning, who recited =\r\nthe Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody teaching him, and=\r\n who gives impromptu discourses in various forums across the world on all t=\r\nopics under the sun shy away from explaining some simple questions that are=\r\n about his home turf?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri Sri d=\r\nid not debate. He never debates on Truth! To him Truth / God is not an arti=\r\ncle of debate. He can show the way to Realization of Truth to those that ar=\r\ne ready. He is not interested in anything else. He answers only when there =\r\nis sincerity in the heart of the questioner. Otherwise he would say some po=\r\nlite words and let it pass, however big the occasion may be. Most of the qu=\r\nestions that were raised in that meeting were answered elaborately by Sri S=\r\nri in his various commentaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; One may ask why then did he go to this meeting or whatever it was? The =\r\ntopic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Isl=\r\nam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the=\r\n very thing that was supposedly the topic of discussion. Those that were re=\r\nady to benefit from it from the audience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The below part is not f=\r\nor Rajarshi but may be of interest to everyone, especially those among us t=\r\nhat are intellectually curious about spirituality than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;experience first and explana=\r\ntion and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in AOL, there will be big co=\r\nngregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri will only say very simple thi=\r\nngs or share some simple jokes and laughs, but his presence would convey wh=\r\nat needs to be conveyed for those that are receptive. A Master may not be i=\r\nnterested in getting 100,000 people trading one mental concept for another,=\r\n but prefers one sincere person opening up to Truth in silence. A Masters m=\r\nere presence is enough for that to happen. Words are secondary and optional=\r\n. In spiritual discussions, the point of words is to create inner silence o=\r\nr illumination and if that is not created, there is no point in talking! \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a great privilege and an immense blessing to =\r\nbe in the presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri or someone else=\r\n. We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Being instead of our mind=\r\n. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39; s life, there are innumerable examples of very simple=\r\n people benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big intellectuals w=\r\nould debate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes when=\r\n he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance and =\r\nsay what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it would have b=\r\neen for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an illiterate and i=\r\ngnoramus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Without an accompanying experience (at l=\r\neast a small glimpse or even a fragment of an experience) accumulating know=\r\nledge can be very dangerous as it will become yet another mental concept an=\r\nd will actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and d=\r\nangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;=\r\ns empty concepts of spirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, e=\r\ntc., stand out conspicuously and are in that way less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.

I occasional=\r\nly visit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the bel=\r\now email from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiri=\r\ntual practices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want=\r\n to clarify a few things to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination o=\r\nf Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use dev=\r\notion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That d=\r\noes not make it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobin=\r\ndo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly=\r\n emerge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed sl=\r\nowly and the sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend =\r\nof Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in =\r\nAOL is not just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)under=\r\nstood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of=\r\n the mind and preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual practices =\r\nof contemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude.

Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate co=\r\nmmentary on all of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or=\r\n so tapes and the publicly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to =\r\nover 33 DVD episodes! Besides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is manda=\r\ntory for those that strive to become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru p=\r\nuja to Guru parampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature o=\r\nf AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL charge=\r\ns for these courses and some wonder about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my personal experien=\r\nces that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj =\r\nSamadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotees in every s=\r\ntep of the sadhana without having to be near them in person. Several get ne=\r\ncessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), some in pe=\r\nrson and several via various other ways. However, to get these guidance, an=\r\n inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, the vario=\r\nus AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on various Kn=\r\nowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where conscious =\r\ninner communion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis=\r\n of a very high order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at wi=\r\nll during meditation. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri,=\r\n but act as channels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as a=\r\nnd when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept =\r\nthose that left their body as having achieved highest realization such as S=\r\nri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human =\r\ntendency to doubt them when they are in physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AOL is world&#39;s l=\r\nargest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor its founder Sri=\r\n Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go to the charitab=\r\nle activities again run by volunteers. Many of the full time teachers have =\r\ngiven up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in property to become te=\r\nachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all the money.=\r\n All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went through very bad and s=\r\nometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge to the masses. Th=\r\nis is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum num=\r\nber of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers have fa=\r\nced danger to their lives by going without any help or guidance to areas in=\r\nfested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, =\r\nPakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as their ai=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in A=\r\nOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experi=\r\nence showed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow the practic=\r\nes more diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person shoul=\r\nd be denied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I w=\r\nas part of organizing several AOL courses and know first hand many cases wh=\r\nere people took courses for free and were also provided free accommodation,=\r\n etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from =\r\ntheir own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide healing t=\r\no the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl position. It r=\r\nemoves the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who still may hav=\r\ne some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Sri Sri =\r\nis only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and express the love, j=\r\noy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one follows a path, a=\r\nny path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The INTERNET now has a personality.

Swami Saradanan=\r\nda takes so my pains to beautifully explain various aspects of Ramakrishna&#39;=\r\ns spiritual behaviour and general explanations of spiritual things as well.=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For example it is from this book that I=\r\n first understood why an Avatar like Ramakrishna had to perform such severe=\r\n sadhana. Also thiis book gives a detailed recording of Ramakrishna&#39;s Tantr=\r\nic sadhanas, how he completed all the 64 kriyas.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;There is one point I have observed with Ramakrishna&#39;s teachings.His advi=\r\nses are often specific to the person he was advising. For someone he may sa=\r\ny&nbsp;study the Adhyatma Ramayana, for another he advised never to touch t=\r\nhe Adhyatma Ramayana! Like a perfect teacher he advised the specific medici=\r\nne for the specific problem&nbsp;in the path of spirituality that the speci=\r\nfic person was facing.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Second is his &nbsp;fan=\r\ntastic razor sharp intellect. No one gives better examples to explain some =\r\naspect of spirituality than&nbsp;Ramakrishna. Simple yet perfect. He uses t=\r\nhe intellect to explain yet does not get caught up in the mazes of words. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Third and most important, the range of spiritu=\r\nal moods he expressed was staggering. With all due to respect to every grea=\r\nt master who has walked on this planet, I can&#39;t recall another name who has=\r\n expressed/manifested such diverse spiritual moods. His spiritual journey i=\r\ns not like a bicycle race but rather a seven course meal where he relishes =\r\nevery dish to the core.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Juding purely from an =\r\nintellectual perspective, I believe there are&nbsp;some possibility of corr=\r\nuption in the teachings of almost all masters starting from Jesus to Buddha=\r\n to Shanakara to Guru Nanak to Chaitanya to Vivekanada to&nbsp;Aurobindo . =\r\nCorruptions not in the teaching per se&nbsp;but corruption arising out of m=\r\nisinterpretation of the words over time. One cannot really blame them for t=\r\nhis because it is almost impossible to forsee what turn of events lead to w=\r\nhat kind of mindsets which can make their statements/advises defuct or even=\r\n dangerous over time.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For example, Jesus says =\r\nI am the path. Obviously Christians have mistook this to understand that Je=\r\nsus is the only path. What he ment by I may not be Jesus the man, but Jesus=\r\n the idea - of purity and of love.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Buddha gave=\r\n a practical advise that Nirvana is sunya and practical spirituality is mor=\r\ne important than spiritual discussion. People mistook that to understand Bu=\r\ndha was as atheist.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Shanakara, the great man t=\r\nhat he was, would have died of a heart attack if he saw the flippant way in=\r\n which we later day college educated Indians use the phrases like&nbsp;Aham=\r\n Brahmasmi and everything is Brahman as if we are speaking about the latest=\r\n movie in town. &nbsp;Also I feel his misjudged certain paths like Tantra.&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Guru Nanak in order to infuse more life into s=\r\npirituality of Hindus as well as Muslims and bring a comprise in the two id=\r\neas decried practises like idol worship and pitri tarpan.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Chaitanya was the emotional pinnacle of spirituality. He was ca=\r\npable. Others less capable misunderstood the path to feel that without shed=\r\nding bucket full of tears you wont land at God&#39;s doorsteps. Emotions are go=\r\nod, but they can mislead too.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Vivekananda - ab=\r\nsolute leader. Like all leaders, he does make some statements at times whic=\r\nh are not well deliberated upon, which results in misinterpretations later =\r\non. Of course a leader cannot be expected to think for ten days before spea=\r\nking one&nbsp; sentence. A leader has to be spontaneous, just like Vivekana=\r\nda, but the price of spontaneity is misrepresentation at a later date speci=\r\nally if you are fantastic.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Aurobindo, brillian=\r\nt and rare analysis of spiritual steps/stages. One that I have never found =\r\nin any other writing. However the problem is exactly the same. Often people=\r\n wrongly believe that only by reading and intellectually comprehending Auro=\r\nbindo;s writings one can make spiritual progress. There is no substitute fo=\r\nr raw old fashioned sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Please note all t=\r\nhese are great men were&nbsp;without question, spiritually much realized. I=\r\n am merely doing an intellectual analysis from a historial perspective.&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;And then Ramakrishna, such a vast range of emotio=\r\nns and practices coupled with simple and pointed examples&nbsp;and advises,=\r\n it is hardly possible for him to get misinterpreted. He uses Shanakra&#39;s ph=\r\nrase &quot;Brahma satya jagat mithya&quot; but he also teaches Totapuri why Mahamaya =\r\nis so powerful. He seems like a perfect assimilation of all ideas.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Just my two cents. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Rega=\r\nrds&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DC=\r\nourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of consc=\r\niousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/ST=\r\nRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 20/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;vedic_=\r\npathak@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: =\r\n5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: ved=\r\nic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How=\r\n Ramakrishna deals with a debater.&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;D=\r\nate: Friday, 20 November, 2009, 9:17 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1162063427&gt;&lt;SP=\r\nAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste=\r\n Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;That is the effect of Ramakrishna, who was born and b=\r\nrought up in a &gt;village in west bengal, who probably could not even sign=\r\n his own &gt;name.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna, whom i lovingly address as &#39;Thakur&#39; =\r\nis simply Rama and Krishna and no less......&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And Kathamruta is THE b=\r\nook which has given answers and confirmations to my queries and understandi=\r\nngs which haunted me from childhood.

The bra=\r\nhmani - who was Thakur&#39;s guru - had called Gauri for a session of discussio=\r\nn on the spiritual abilities etc of Thakur. Now Gauri was a very famous deb=\r\nater and a sadhaka=C3=82&nbsp;who never lost any debate. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Plus Thak=\r\nur used to say that Gauri had remakrable siddhis. He used to perform a homa=\r\n of Ma Kali by stretching out his left hand, piling wood on the bare=C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;arm, lighting it and then using his right hand to pour ghee! And the h=\r\noma would last for an hour or more and he would keep his left hand perfectl=\r\ny still all this while. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He had a certain sidd=\r\nhi in the use of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtue of which one could never win=\r\n in a debate=C3=82&nbsp;against him. Plus he had a deep, resounding voice w=\r\nhich Ramakrishna described as the &quot;rumbling of clouds&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n When Gauri entered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw the=\r\n Kali temple, he started repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that time=\r\n was coming out of the temple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna started=\r\n saying that specific mantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that Ga=\r\nuri could hear. Gauri, on being thus challanged=C3=82&nbsp;started shouting=\r\n the mantra even louded. To this Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just gi=\r\nven him a divine voice and he too thundered back. Gauri was even more amaze=\r\nd. He roared again=C3=82&nbsp;but Ramakrishna roared louder. Finally, sudde=\r\nnly Gauri realized he has lost his voice. And his siddhi too! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; At first he was furious with anger and ego but soon he be=\r\ncame friends with Ramakrishna. Finally he proclaimed that Ramakrishna was H=\r\ne by a fraction of whose power do Avatars come down on earth. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Later one day Gauri came to Ramakrishna asking for his bl=\r\nessing to take\n sanyasa. He quit debating and went away from that place, pr=\r\nomising that he would not return untill he realized the Self. Thakur also b=\r\nlessed him according.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tha=\r\nt is the effect of Ramakrishna, who was born and brought up in a village in=\r\n west bengal, who probably could not even sign his own name.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) i=\r\ns Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Fri, 20/11/09, vedic_patha=\r\nk &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: vedic_pa=\r\nthak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Seamless=\r\n blend - To Narasimha, Siva and others !!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in=\r\n.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Friday, 20 November, 2009=\r\n, 2:54 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Kishnendu,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I beg pardon for my reply to you=\r\nr message addressed to Siva.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One more thing friend sp=\r\nirituality is not a subject of debate or &gt;discussion but OF REALISATION =\r\nas i feel.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is not inappropriate to debate and discuss e=\r\nven in the matter of Spirituality occasionally.

Adi Sh=\r\nankaracharya and Swami Vivekananda, for instance, debated a lot on the subj=\r\nect.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;If you want to hear and see from someone let that=\r\n be ONLY and ONLY &gt;your GURU.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; That unshakable and blind=\r\n faith without complete\n understanding of GURU&#39;s motives or anybody or any =\r\nbook or anything is NO FAITH really but source of the mass production of Fa=\r\nnatics.

Sardar Patel is the one for whom i=\r\n\n have same love and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda or Na=\r\nrasimha. Why? Because all the 3 were the ideal statesman who did us proud n=\r\not only by effectively countering religious fanaticism but also BECAUSE THE=\r\nY OPERATED IN THE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA&#39;. BIGOTRY CAN NEVER BE =\r\nATTACHED TO THEM. And for me this is fantastic and fitting to the ideals of=\r\n Sanatan Dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Regarding Dr. Zakir Naik: I did not know about him initially. a year and h=\r\nalf back, i visited Oman and there once i switched on TV where in i saw tha=\r\nt person on &#39;Peace&#39; Channel. He was lecturing in front of a gathering and h=\r\ne used a word &#39;Veda&#39; which interested me to go through.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t remember the topic but i felt so much saddened by=\r\n his lecture. The reason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Ch=\r\nristianity for proving his points. Immediately in my mind came\n channels li=\r\nke &#39;Sanskaar&#39; and &#39;Ashta&#39; where a lot of religious pundits (most of them ar=\r\ne Hindus) come for discourses. and i do not remember any instance where in =\r\nthey have attacked any religious sentiments of other faiths to uphold value=\r\ns of Sanatan Dharma. there is such an obvious contrast.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nfter that first lecture, i watched Zakir&#39;s other lectures and was convinced=\r\n that this person is not a true spiritual leader but a polished intellectua=\r\nl who essentially is a fanatic and then never stopped to see him further. I=\r\n remember having a debate at the same site (at Oman) with a Young person of=\r\n Islamic faith. we debated on the issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr.=\r\n Naik, an email, asking him that does he really believe that other religion=\r\ns and faith are also true. I must say that, i found that young Muslim engin=\r\neer had much more tolerance and understanding than Dr Zakir Naik.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; The unfortunate part is that the broad minded\n people of today&#39;s g=\r\nenerations are getting corrupted by such fanatic leaders.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As i have many Muslim, Chrisitan =\r\nFriends (Really good friends), i never loose a chance to advocate my views =\r\n-&quot;The time has come when we must not only &#39;respect&#39; the other religious fai=\r\nths but also we must belive in our heart of hearts that every faith/religio=\r\nn is true and we must never try to convert people of other religion to our =\r\nreligion but on the contrary we must discourage a person who wants to forma=\r\nlly convert by telling him/her that yours is also right and don&#39;t get in to=\r\n such theatrics.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I absolutely echo Tha=\r\nkur Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are paths, as many opinion are there&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; About Sri Sri, i must say that i believe him =\r\nas a great spiritual leader. i&#39;ve some past experiences which makes me beli=\r\neve that. Now that is the reason i wish to know\n his views on this particul=\r\nar debate episode. I know he has a great knowledge and he also is a scholar=\r\n but then why he did not counter Dr. Zakir?. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Siva wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; [&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL =\r\nsilver jubilee with over 2 million people meditating and doing Sudarshan Kr=\r\niya together happened around Feb 16, 2006.

The actions of an englightened master esta=\r\nblished in Sahaja Samadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concepts of h=\r\now things should be. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For ex=\r\nample, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of the highest order, ran away from the=\r\n battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Mathura instead of fighting and defeat=\r\ning Jarasandh.

Can we give a satisfying intellectual answer to =\r\nit if people raise questions?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Sri Aurobindo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was something lik=\r\ne: If Krishna were constrained to win all times, that would be a limitation=\r\n in itself! An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is necessary for a larger a=\r\nnd more complete victory in the scheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to re=\r\nad the original to get his exact words.. I read it long ago.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another instance that comes to mind - Some=\r\n thieves came and beat up Ramana Maharishi and made a big nuisance in his A=\r\nshram. Ramana Maharishi bore it with equanimity.
