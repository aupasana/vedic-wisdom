May his soul rest in peace.\n \nElectricity too is a form of fire. Burning by normal fire is better, but electric cremation is not too bad. It is far better than burial, where the gross body remains intact and decays slowly.\n \nIf one is evicted from the house one has lived in for decades and has an attachment to, one may camp outside the house in the hope that one will be allowed back into the house. If the house is bulldozed, one will have to accept it and move on. Moving on to other non-physical realms of being or to another physical body is easier if body is reduced to ashes than if it is buried.\n \nSome people put a small lamp inside a dry coconut and place it along with the body in the electric cremation chamber. If that is allowed, that may be considered.\n \nAfter being forced out of a body, soul may hang around for a variable amount of time. It can range from hours to days or even months or years. It is better to burn as soon as possible. However, 48 hours is not too bad.\n \nAs in the analogy, soul is like a person evicted from a house he lived in for decades. One may hang around the house (body) in the hope that one may get back in. If the house is destroyed, one will be forced to deal with it and leave the town and go to another town (different loka) or find another house in the same town (another physical body to be born in).\n \nIf the soul has already moved on before cremation, it is not a bad thing. You are fixing a non-problem then. If the soul has not moved on before cremation, cremation will hopefully help. So, in either case, cremation is a good idea, either by fire or electricity.\n \nI will write more things about things you should consider, in the next day or two. First, good luck with the cremation. Think as much as you can and make the decision. Once you make a decision, do not think further or listen to what others say.\n \nIf you have the guts and people around you can reconcile with it, burning the body on real fire, calling the divine Mother or Shiva in the fire and doing a homam is not a bad idea. If one does it, one can skip the &quot;kravyaadamagnim&quot; mantra after starting fire. If you can visusalize that god has come in the fire and pray to god to take care of the soul, it can give a good push (depending on how good your visualization is and how pure you are). Even if one does no such ritual, one can sit in front of the funeral pyre (at a safe distance) with an erect back and closed eyes and meditate. One can meditate for god to come in fire and show direction to the soul of the departed.\n \nMore later..\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji (or other wise people on this group),\n&gt; \n&gt; My father passed away a few hours ago, and I am in shock. I am in the US and will be travelling to India within the next few hours. My father&#39;s last wish as communicated tro my mother was to be cremated in an electric crematorium. I have to make the decision. It doesnt sound right to me. What do I do so that his soul truly rests in peace. I very desperately want to make the right decision. Should I honor his wish? An additional question - when does the soul leave the body: 48 hours will have passed by the time I get there?\n&gt; \n&gt; Please reply quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Details of the time etc: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sohamsa/message/23764\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n\n\n"}}
