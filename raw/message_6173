There is no other consciousness. Therefore, this\n=\r\nsoul is not consciousness.\n\n374 But the soul is taken as being conscious, d=\r\nue to the admixture of the\nconsciousness of the real Self. Therefore Vedant=\r\nins call this unreal soul\n=E2=80=98the illusory consciousness=E2=80=99.\n\n37=\r\n5 Just as someone, coming in uninvited at a marriage, claiming to be a\ncomr=\r\nade of the bridegroom, obtains an honourable reception from the bride=E2=80=\r\n=99s\nfamily, so this soul is accepted at its face value by the ignorant.\n\n3=\r\n76 The pretend bridegroom=E2=80=99s comrade runs away of his own accord as =\r\nsoon as\nan enquiry is started by the bride=E2=80=99s party, questioning =E2=\r\n=80=98Who is he? Whence\ndid he come?=E2=80=99 In the same way, this soul fl=\r\nees of his own accord when an\nenquiry is made as to who he is, or whence he=\r\n has come.\n\n377 This soul has really no form of its own. It is like a ghost=\r\n haunting a\nhouse, this body. Therefore, [our] Guru says that it [the soul]=\r\n is just a\nghost appointed to guard the body.\n\n378 Bhagavan, our Guru, make=\r\ns clear the unreality of this soul, saying that\nwhen the supreme state is w=\r\non by the quest [of the Self], there is no form\nof this soul found survivin=\r\ng.\n\n379 The first thought of the mind is this ego-sense. From it arise all =\r\nother\nthoughts. Hence this soul is itself mind, the subtle body, the world,=\r\n\nworldly life, and bondage =E2=80=93 nothing else.\n\n380 Both bondage and th=\r\ne bound one are only this soul. There is no other who\ncan be said to be bou=\r\nnd. The real Self is ever-free, and the sole reality.\nHow can it be said th=\r\nat he became bound?\n\n381 As soon as this one named =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is b=\r\norn, there is born also along with it\nthe whole world. When it becomes late=\r\nnt, the world also vanishes. Hence the\nworld is said to be its form.\n\n382 T=\r\nhough this great being, the real Self, is dearest to all and of great\nsplen=\r\ndour, it does not shine unmistakably, for its light appears to be\nstolen by=\r\n this evil one who has the form of the ego.\n\n383 Though unreal, this one na=\r\nmed jiva [individual self] covers up the truth\nof the Self. So, the Self, b=\r\neing wrongly conceived through a variety of\nfalse imaginations, is as good =\r\nas lost for the ignorant man.\n\n384 The mass of clouds, generated by the lig=\r\nht of the sun, conceals the form\nof the sun. In the same way, this jiva, bo=\r\nrn as it is by the light of\nconsciousness of the Self, conceals the Self.\n\n=\r\nThis explains why the real Self remains unknown.\n\n385 Revelation accuses hi=\r\nm, who by his ego-sense has stolen the real Self,\nand who suffers for that =\r\nsin, saying: =E2=80=98What sin is there that has not been\ncommitted by that=\r\n thief of the Self?=E2=80=99\n\n386 The Master says =E2=80=98original sin=E2=\r\n=80=99, affirmed to be the cause of death by the\nChristians, is not an act =\r\ndone by the first man, but only the sense =E2=80=98I am\nthe body=E2=80=99.\n=\r\n\n387 This sin is said to pertain to man, but men are not men in deep sleep.=\r\n\nThe sense of being a man is due to the identification of oneself with the\n=\r\nbody. Consequently, the original sin is only this identification of oneself=\r\n\nas the body.\n\n388 All loss, all vice, and all suffering are only due to th=\r\ne sense of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.\nAll gain, all virtue and all happiness come=\r\n from the extinction of the ego.\n\n389 To the ignorant one the Self is lost =\r\non account of his ego sense.\nTherefore, even if he gains all things, he is =\r\nstill poor. On the other hand\nthe sage, who has gained his Self by the exti=\r\nnction of the ego, sees nothing\nelse to be gained.\n\nNow the question whethe=\r\nr there are many selves is considered.\n\n390 Those who think that the body i=\r\ns real and consequently come to believe\nthat the soul itself is the real Se=\r\nlf, affirm the plurality of selves,\nmisconceiving the meaning of the texts =\r\nof the Vedanta.\n\n391 Deluded men who have not heard the truth of the suprem=\r\ne state argue in\nvain, saying that if there is only one Self, then there is=\r\n a dilemma: either\nby the deliverance of one all will be delivered, or none=\r\n will attain\ndeliverance.\n\n392 There is no objection to jivas being conceiv=\r\ned as many, but the view of\nthe plurality of the real Self is unacceptable.=\r\n The jivas are many and\nunreal, but the Self is real, auspicious and only o=\r\nne.\n\nSome of those that affirm the manyness of the Self also say that the s=\r\nelves\n(jivas) are fractions of the Supreme Being, the Self of all. This is =\r\nnext\ndealt with.\n\n393 There are no real fragments of the one supreme consci=\r\nousness. The\nfragments appear only because of ignorance. To the sage in the=\r\n supreme\nstate, that consciousness shines as one whole, not divided into pa=\r\nrts.\n\nThe experience of the sage is conclusive on all points. Here is given=\r\n an\nutterance of Bhagavan on this point.\n\n394 Consciousness is one, omnipre=\r\nsent and equal. Its unequal distribution is\nonly an illusion. And because s=\r\npace is unreal, its equal distribution is\nalso unreal.\n\n=E2=80=98One consci=\r\nousness, equally distributed everywhere; you through illusion\ngive it unequ=\r\nal distribution; no distribution, no everywhere=E2=80=9D. These were\nthe wo=\r\nrds uttered by Bhagavan to an earnest American sadhaka, Mr Hague.\n\nIt shoul=\r\nd be remembered that the supreme reality which is the Self has three\nunique=\r\n names, namely sat, chit and ananda, and is referred to by one, or\ntwo, or =\r\nall the three names together. These names, it is explained by\nBhagavan, mus=\r\nt be understood as denying their opposites, and not giving a\npositive descr=\r\niption of the indescribable. Thus, sat means not asat\n(non-being); chit mea=\r\nns not achit (unconsciousness); and ananda means not\nunhappiness.\n\n395 It h=\r\nas been clearly taught by the Master that the supreme consciousness\nremains=\r\n whole, not divided into parts. Let disciples of non-sages be\ndeluded. How =\r\ncan there be delusion for us on this point?\n\n396 Since it is settled that t=\r\nhe one named jiva does not exist, how can we\nthink of its bondage or delive=\r\nrance? There is neither bondage nor\ndeliverance for the real Self, who rema=\r\nins unswervingly whole and solitary.\n\nThis point will be dealt with later.\n=\r\n\n397 The soul comes to be taken as real by the failure to discriminate\nrigh=\r\ntly. This occurs when there is false identification between the body,\nwhich=\r\n is limited in space and time, and the Self, which is only\nconsciousness, u=\r\nnlimited by space and time.\n\n398 First one assumes that one particular body=\r\n is =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. Then one assumes that\nthe body is real. Once this =\r\nhappens, the ignorant man sees other bodies as\nbeing real, and sees differe=\r\nnt jivas in them.\n\n399 The one real Self, being really undivided, is taken =\r\nas being divided\ninto parts in many bodies, which are all unreal. The ignor=\r\nant one looks upon\nthat whole, formless Self as having form and therefore a=\r\nlso as being many.\n\n400 As a seer of a cinema-show, seeing a new picture ev=\r\nery moment, thinks\nthem all to be one, so the ignorant man seeing a new bod=\r\ny every moment,\nthinks that all of them are one and the same.\n\nIn a cinema-=\r\nshow there is a long roll of small pictures that pass\nsuccessively at a rap=\r\nid rate between the light inside and the magnifying\nlens, about thirty-two =\r\npictures being thus projected on the screen\nsuccessively each second. But t=\r\nhe seer thinks he is seeing one single\npicture all the time, but one that i=\r\ns slowly changing. The world picture is\nalso made up of a successive stream=\r\n of separate pictures on the retina\ninside the eye; but people think it is =\r\nall one continuous spectacle.\n\n401 All the time, at every moment, his mind =\r\nis imagining a new soul in a new\nbody. Hence, the sages say that this soul =\r\nis both momentary and unreal.\n\n402 The man who has not experienced his own =\r\nreal Self, thinking =E2=80=98I am this\nbody=E2=80=99, sees himself as =E2=\r\n=80=98I=E2=80=99, the first person of grammar. He sees another\nperson whom =\r\nhe calls =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99, and refers to third persons as =E2=80=98he=\r\n=E2=80=99.\n\nThus the one real Self becomes =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in one body,=\r\n =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99 in another body and\n=E2=80=98he=E2=80=99 in a third =\r\nbody. It follows that these distinctions arise from the\nprimary ignorance.\n=\r\n\n403 These three distinct persons are not real. They are seen on account of=\r\n\nthe false notion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. When the ego-soul is los=\r\nt as a result of\nthe quest of the real Self, only that Self, consciousness =\r\nalone, will shine.\n\n404 To one who thinks himself to be a jiva or a body, a=\r\n plurality of jivas\nwill appear. But to the sage who is freed from this ign=\r\norance, no jiva will\nappear.\nThis is next illustrated by the simile of the =\r\ncinema show.\n\n405 On the lighted screen there pass women and men in great n=\r\number, who are\nonly pictures. So too on the screen of consciousness, which =\r\nis the real\nSelf, there pass a great many souls, who are only mental projec=\r\ntions.\n\n406 The lighted screen is similar to the Self, and the pictures pro=\r\njected\nonto it are like the jivas. The appearance of a plurality of jivas d=\r\noes not\naffect the final truth of experience, the oneness of the Self.\n\n407=\r\n A person believes in the plurality of jivas by believing that the jiva\nis =\r\nthe real Self. He does not know the experience of the real Self because\nhe =\r\nhas been misled by his belief in multiplicity.\n\nAnother simile is next empl=\r\noyed to clarify this truth, the plurality of\nreflections of a single object=\r\n.\n\n408 In the waters of separate vessels there appear many different images=\r\n of\nthe one moon. Similarly, in the minds that inhabit bodies there appear =\r\nmany\njivas, which are only reflected images of the one real Self.\n\n409 As t=\r\nhe real moon is only one, so the real Self is only one. As there are\nmany r=\r\neflections of the moon, so there are seen a great many jivas.\n\nNow the ridd=\r\nle of deliverance is solved.\n\n410 When one reflected image of the moon is l=\r\nost, the other images go on\nappearing as before. Similarly, when one pseudo=\r\n-consciousness dies, the\nothers continue to appear as before, even though t=\r\nhey are unreal.\n\n411 Whoever obtains awareness of the real Self, for him th=\r\nis worldly life\ncomes to an end. The others continue to wander here as befo=\r\nre, remaining\nwithout awareness of the real Self.\n\n412 This illustration ha=\r\ns been vouchsafed by sages to men of immature minds,\nwho have false knowled=\r\nge. But this discussion can have no meaning at all for\nthose who realise th=\r\ne unreality of the individual soul.\n\n413 In dreams a multitude of jivas cre=\r\nated by mental delusion appear. In\njust the same way, a multitude of these =\r\njivas appear in the waking state.\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteac=\r\nh/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=\r\n=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00163646c31e6f3e4a04a09d35eb\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n373 One self-shining consciousness, independent of all else, whi=\r\nch is the real Self, is alone real.

It is like a =\r\nghost haunting a house, this body. Therefore, [our] Guru says that it [the =\r\nsoul] is just a ghost appointed to guard the body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;378 Bhagavan, our=\r\n Guru, makes clear the unreality of this soul, saying that when the supreme=\r\n state is won by the quest [of the Self], there is no form of this soul fou=\r\nnd surviving.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;379 The first thoug=\r\nht of the mind is this ego-sense.

Hence t=\r\nhis soul is itself mind, the subtle body, the world, worldly life, and bond=\r\nage =E2=80=93 nothing else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;380 Both bondage and the bound =\r\none are only this soul. There is no other who can be said to be bound. The =\r\nreal Self is ever-free, and the sole reality. How can it be said that he be=\r\ncame bound?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;381 As soon as this one named =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is bor=\r\nn, there is born also along with it the whole world.

So,=\r\n the Self, being wrongly conceived through a variety of false imaginations,=\r\n is as good as lost for the ignorant man.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;384 The mass of clouds, =\r\ngenerated by the light of the sun, conceals the form of the sun. In the sam=\r\ne way, this jiva, born as it is by the light of consciousness of the Self, =\r\nconceals the Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This explains why the real Self remains unknown.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;385 Revelation accuses him, who by his ego-sense has stolen the re=\r\nal Self, and who suffers for that sin, saying: =E2=80=98What sin is there t=\r\nhat has not been committed by that thief of the Self?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;386 T=\r\nhe Master says =E2=80=98original sin=E2=80=99, affirmed to be the cause of =\r\ndeath by the Christians, is not an act done by the first man, but only the =\r\nsense =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;387 This sin is said to per=\r\ntain to man, but men are not men in deep sleep. The sense of being a man is=\r\n due to the identification of oneself with the body. Consequently, the orig=\r\ninal sin is only this identification of oneself as the body.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;388 A=\r\nll loss, all vice, and all suffering are only due to the sense of =E2=80=98=\r\nI=E2=80=99. All gain, all virtue and all happiness come from the extinction=\r\n of the ego.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;389 To the ignorant one the Self is lost on account of =\r\nhis ego sense. Therefore, even if he gains all things, he is still poor. On=\r\n the other hand the sage, who has gained his Self by the extinction of the =\r\nego, sees nothing else to be gained.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Now the question whether ther=\r\ne are many selves is considered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;390 Those who think that the body i=\r\ns real and consequently come to believe that the soul itself is the real Se=\r\nlf, affirm the plurality of selves, misconceiving the meaning of the texts =\r\nof the Vedanta.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;391 Deluded men who have not heard the truth of th=\r\ne supreme state argue in vain, saying that if there is only one Self, then =\r\nthere is a dilemma: either by the deliverance of one all will be delivered,=\r\n or none will attain deliverance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;392 There is no objection to jiv=\r\nas being conceived as many, but the view of the plurality of the real Self =\r\nis unacceptable. The jivas are many and unreal, but the Self is real, auspi=\r\ncious and only one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of those that affirm the manyness of the Se=\r\nlf also say that the selves (jivas) are fractions of the Supreme Being, the=\r\n Self of all. This is next dealt with.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;393 There are no real fragm=\r\nents of the one supreme consciousness. The fragments appear only because of=\r\n ignorance. To the sage in the supreme state, that consciousness shines as =\r\none whole, not divided into parts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe experience of the sage is c=\r\nonclusive on all points. Here is given an utterance of Bhagavan on this poi=\r\nnt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;394 Consciousness is one, omnip=\r\nresent and equal. Its unequal distribution is only an illusion.

These were the words uttered by Bhagavan t=\r\no an earnest American sadhaka, Mr Hague.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It should be remem=\r\nbered that the supreme reality which is the Self has three unique names, na=\r\nmely sat, chit and ananda, and is referred to by one, or two, or all the th=\r\nree names together. These names, it is explained by Bhagavan, must be under=\r\nstood as denying their opposites, and not giving a positive description of =\r\nthe indescribable. Thus, sat means not asat (non-being); chit means not ach=\r\nit (unconsciousness); and ananda means not unhappiness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;395 It has=\r\n been clearly taught by the Master that the supreme consciousness remains w=\r\nhole, not divided into parts. Let disciples of non-sages be deluded. How ca=\r\nn there be delusion for us on this point?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;396 Since it is settled th=\r\nat the one named jiva does not exist, how can we think of its bondage or de=\r\nliverance? There is neither bondage nor deliverance for the real Self, who =\r\nremains unswervingly whole and solitary.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This point will be dealt =\r\nwith later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;397 The soul comes to be taken as real by the failure to=\r\n discriminate rightly. This occurs when there is false identification betwe=\r\nen the body, which is limited in space and time, and the Self, which is onl=\r\ny consciousness, unlimited by space and time.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;398 First one assume=\r\ns that one particular body is =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. Then one assumes that th=\r\ne body is real. Once this happens, the ignorant man sees other bodies as be=\r\ning real, and sees different jivas in them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;399 The one real Self, b=\r\neing really undivided, is taken as being divided into parts in many bodies,=\r\n which are all unreal. The ignorant one looks upon that whole, formless Sel=\r\nf as having form and therefore also as being many.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;400 As a seer of a cinema-show, seeing a new picture ever=\r\ny moment, thinks them all to be one, so the ignorant man seeing a new body =\r\nevery moment, thinks that all of them are one and the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;In a cinema-show there is a long roll of small pictures that pass successi=\r\nvely at a rapid rate between the light inside and the magnifying lens, abou=\r\nt thirty-two pictures being thus projected on the screen successively each =\r\nsecond. But the seer thinks he is seeing one single picture all the time, b=\r\nut one that is slowly changing. The world picture is also made up of a succ=\r\nessive stream of separate pictures on the retina inside the eye; but people=\r\n think it is all one continuous spectacle.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;401 All the time, at ev=\r\nery moment, his mind is imagining a new soul in a new body. Hence, the sage=\r\ns say that this soul is both momentary and unreal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;402 The man who h=\r\nas not experienced his own real Self, thinking =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=\r\n=80=99, sees himself as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, the first person of grammar. H=\r\ne sees another person whom he calls =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99, and refers to th=\r\nird persons as =E2=80=98he=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Thus the one real Self become=\r\ns =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in one body, =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99 in another body an=\r\nd =E2=80=98he=E2=80=99 in a third body. It follows that these distinctions =\r\narise from the primary ignorance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;403 These three distinct persons a=\r\nre not real. They are seen on account of the false notion =E2=80=98I am the=\r\n body=E2=80=99. When the ego-soul is lost as a result of the quest of the r=\r\neal Self, only that Self, consciousness alone, will shine.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;404 To =\r\none who thinks himself to be a jiva or a body, a plurality of jivas will ap=\r\npear. But to the sage who is freed from this ignorance, no jiva will appear=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;This is next illustrated by the simile of the cinema show.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;405 On the lighted screen there pass women a=\r\nnd men in great number, who are only pictures. So too on the screen of cons=\r\nciousness, which is the real Self, there pass a great many souls, who are o=\r\nnly mental projections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;406 The lighted screen is similar t=\r\no the Self, and the pictures projected onto it are like the jivas. The appe=\r\narance of a plurality of jivas does not affect the final truth of experienc=\r\ne, the oneness of the Self.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n407 A person believes in the plurality=\r\n of jivas by believing that the jiva is the real Self. He does not know the=\r\n experience of the real Self because he has been misled by his belief in mu=\r\nltiplicity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another simile is next employed to clarify this truth, t=\r\nhe plurality of reflections of a single object.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;408 In the waters =\r\nof separate vessels there appear many different images of the one moon. Sim=\r\nilarly, in the minds that inhabit bodies there appear many jivas, which are=\r\n only reflected images of the one real Self.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n409 As the real moon =\r\nis only one, so the real Self is only one. As there are many reflections of=\r\n the moon, so there are seen a great many jivas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the riddle of d=\r\neliverance is solved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;410 When one reflected image of the moon is lo=\r\nst, the other images go on appearing as before. Similarly, when one pseudo-=\r\nconsciousness dies, the others continue to appear as before, even though th=\r\ney are unreal.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;411 Whoever obtains awareness of the real Self, for=\r\n him this worldly life comes to an end. The others continue to wander here =\r\nas before, remaining without awareness of the real Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;412 This il=\r\nlustration has been vouchsafed by sages to men of immature minds, who have =\r\nfalse knowledge. But this discussion can have no meaning at all for those w=\r\nho realise the unreality of the individual soul.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;413 In dreams a m=\r\nultitude of jivas created by mental delusion appear. In just the same way, =\r\na multitude of these jivas appear in the waking state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/=\r\nrteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach=\r\n/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0p=\r\nx;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:=\r\n0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=\r\n=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--00163646c31e6f3e4a04a09d35eb--\r\n\n"}}
