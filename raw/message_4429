Bhagavan also composed the following introductory verse and\nintroduction=\r\n.\n\nOh thou divine Shankara,\nThou art the Subject\nThat has knowledge\nOf subj=\r\nect and object.\nLet the subject in me be destroyed\nAs subject and object.\nF=\r\nor thus in my mind arises\nThe light as the single Siva.\n\nIntroduction\n\n=E2=\r\n=80=98Brahman is only one and non-dual=E2=80=99 declare the Srutis.Since Br=\r\nahman is the\nsole reality, according to advaita, how is it that Brahman is =\r\nnot apparent\nto us, whereas the prapancha (world, i.e., non-Brahman) is so =\r\nvivid? Thus\nquestions the advanced sadhaka.\n\nIn one=E2=80=99s own Self, whi=\r\nch is no other than Brahman, there is a mysterious\npower known as avidya (i=\r\ngnorance) which is beginningless and not separate\nfrom the Self. Its charac=\r\nteristics are veiling and presentation of\ndiversity.\n\nJust as the pictures =\r\nin a cinema, though not visible either in sunlight or\nin darkness,become vi=\r\nsible in a spot of light in the midst of darkness, so\nin the darkness of ig=\r\nnorance there appears the reflected light of the Self,\nillusory and scatter=\r\ned, taking the form of thought.\n\nThis is the primal thought known as the eg=\r\no, jiva or karta (doer), having\nthe mind as the medium of its perceptions.T=\r\nhe mind has a store of latent\ntendencies which it projects as the object of=\r\n a shadow-show in the waking\nand dream states.This show, however, is mistak=\r\nen for real by the jiva. The\nveiling aspect of the mind first hides the rea=\r\nl nature of the Self and then\npresents the objective world to view.\n\nJust a=\r\ns the waters of the ocean do not seem different from the waves, so\nalso for=\r\n the duration of objective phenomena, the Self, though itself the\nsole bein=\r\ng, is made to appear not different from them. Turn away from the\ndelusion c=\r\naused by latent tendencies and false notions of interior and\nexterior. By s=\r\nuch constant practice of sahaja samadhi, the veiling power\nvanishes and the=\r\n non-dual Self is left over to shine forth as Brahman\nitself.\n\nThis is the =\r\nwhole secret of the advaita doctrine as taught by the master to\nthe advance=\r\nd sadhaka. Here the same teaching is contained, which Sri\nShankaracharya ha=\r\ns expounded concisely without any elaboration, in the\nfollowing text.\n\nThe =\r\nText\n\nAll our perception pertains to the non-Self. The immutable Seer is in=\r\ndeed\nthe Self. All the countless scriptures proclaim only discrimination be=\r\ntween\nSelf and non-Self.\n\nThe world we see, being seen by the eye, is drisy=\r\na (object);the eye which\nsees it is drik (subject). But the eye, being perc=\r\neived by the mind is\ndrisya (object) and the mind which sees it is drik (su=\r\nbject). The mind, with\nits thoughts perceived by the Self, is drisya (objec=\r\nt) and the Self is drik\n(subject).The Self cannot be drisya (object), not b=\r\neing perceived by\nanything else. The forms perceived are various, blue and =\r\nyellow, gross and\nsubtle, tall and short, and so on; but the eye that sees =\r\nthem remains one\nand the same. Similarly, the varying qualities of the eye,=\r\n such as\nblindness, dullness and keenness and of the ears and other organs,=\r\n are\nperceived by the mind singly. So, too, the various characteristics of =\r\nthe\nmind, such as desire, determination, doubt, faith, want of faith,\ncoura=\r\nge,want of courage, fear, shyness, discrimination, good and bad,are all\nper=\r\nceived by the Self singly. This Self neither rises nor sets, neither\nincrea=\r\nses nor decays. It shines of its own luminosity. It illumines\neverything el=\r\nse without the need for aid from other sources.\n\nBuddhi, as the sum total o=\r\nf the inner organs, in contact with the reflected\nconsciousness has two asp=\r\nects. One is called egoity and the other mind. This\ncontact of the buddhi w=\r\nith the reflected consciousness is like the identity\nof a red-hot iron ball=\r\n with fire. Hence the gross body passes for a\nconscious entity. The contact=\r\n establishing identity between the ego and the\nreflected Consciousness, is =\r\nof three kinds.\n\n1. The identification of the ego with the reflected Consci=\r\nousness is natural\nor innate.\n\n2. The identification of the ego with the bo=\r\ndy is due to past karma.\n\n3. The identification of the ego with the witness=\r\n is due to ignorance.\n\nThe natural or innate contact continues as long as t=\r\nhe buddhi, but on\nrealization of the Self it proves to be false. The third =\r\nmentioned contact\nis broken when it is discovered by experience that there =\r\nis no sort of\ncontact of anything at all with the Self, which is Being. The=\r\n second\nmentioned contact,that born of past karma, ceases to exist on the\nd=\r\nestruction of innate tendencies (vasanas).\n\nIn the deep sleep state, when t=\r\nhe body is inert, the ego is fully merged (in\nthe causal ignorance).The ego=\r\n is half manifest in the dream state, and its\nbeing fully manifest is the w=\r\naking state. It is the mode or modification of\nthought (with its latent ten=\r\ndencies) that creates the inner world of dreams\nin the dream state and the =\r\nouter world in the waking state. The subtle body,\nwhich is the material cau=\r\nse of mind and ego, experiences the three states\nand also birth and death.\n=\r\n\nMaya of the causal body has its powers of projecting (rajas) and veiling\n(=\r\ntamas). It is the projecting power that creates everything from the subtle\n=\r\nbody to the gross universe of names and forms. These are produced in the\nSa=\r\nt-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss) like foam in the ocean. The\nveili=\r\nng power operates in such a way that internally the distinction between\nsub=\r\nject and object cannot be perceived,and externally that between Brahman\nand=\r\n the phenomenal world. This indeed is the cause of samsara. The\nindividual =\r\nwith his reflected light of Consciousness is the subtle\nbody existing in cl=\r\nose proximity with the Self that is the vyavaharika (the\nempirical Self). T=\r\nhis individual character of the empirical Self appears in\nthe witness or sa=\r\nkshi also through false superimposition. But on the\nextinction of the veili=\r\nng power (tamas), the distinction between witness and\nthe empirical Self be=\r\ncomes clear; and the superimposition also drops away.\n\nSimilarly, Brahman s=\r\nhines as the phenomenal world of names and forms only\nthrough the effect of=\r\n the veiling power which conceals the distinction\nbetween them. When the ve=\r\niling ends,the distinction between the two is\nperceived, for none of the ac=\r\ntivities of the phenomenal world exist in\nBrahman.\n\nOf the five characteris=\r\ntics, Being, Consciousness, Bliss,name and form, the\nfirst three pertain to=\r\n Brahman and name and form to the world. The three\naspects of Being,Conscio=\r\nusness and Bliss exist equally in the five elements\nof ether, air, fire, wa=\r\nter and earth and in devas (gods), animals,men, etc.,\nwhereas the names and=\r\n forms are different.\n\nTherefore, be indifferent to names and forms, concen=\r\ntrate on\nBeing-Consciousness-Bliss and constantly practise samadhi (identit=\r\ny with\nBrahman) within the Heart or outside.\n\nThis practice of samadhi (ide=\r\nntity with Brahman) is of two kinds: savikalpa\n(in which the distinction be=\r\ntween knower,knowledge and known is not lost)\nand nirvikalpa (in which the =\r\nabove distinction is lost). Savikalpa samadhi\nagain is of two kinds: that w=\r\nhich is associated with words (sound), and\nmeditation on one=E2=80=99s own =\r\nconsciousness as the witness of thought forms such\nas desire, which is savi=\r\nkalpa samadhi (internal), associated with\n(cognizable) objects. Realizing o=\r\nne=E2=80=99s Self as =E2=80=98I am\nBeing-Consciousness-Bliss without dualit=\r\ny,unattached, self-effulgent=E2=80=99, is\nsavikalpa samadhi (internal) asso=\r\nciated with words (sound).\n\nGiving up both objects and sound forms of the a=\r\nforesaid two modes of samadhi\nand being completely absorbed in the Bliss ex=\r\nperienced by the realization of\nthe Self is nirvikalpa samadhi (internal). =\r\nIn this state steady abidance is\nobtained, like the unflickering flame of a=\r\n light kept in a place free from\nwind. So also, in the Heart, becoming indi=\r\nfferent to external objects of\nname and form and perceiving only Being of (=\r\nor as) Sat, is savikalpa samadhi\n(external) associated with objects; and be=\r\ning aware continually of that Sat\n(true existence) as the unbroken single e=\r\nssence of Brahman is savikalpa\nsamadhi (external) associated with words (so=\r\nund).After these two\nexperiences, Being, which is uninterrupted like the wa=\r\nveless ocean, is\nnirvikalpa samadhi (external). One who meditates should sp=\r\nend his time\nperpetually in these six kinds of samadhi. By these, the attac=\r\nhment to the\nbody is destroyed and the mind that perpetually abides in the =\r\nSupreme Self\n(paramatman) wherever it may wander, is everywhere spontaneous=\r\nly in samadhi.\n\nBy this constant practice of samadhi, the supreme Self, who=\r\n is both highest\nand lowliest,who encompasses Paramatman as well as jivatma=\r\nn is directly\nexperienced, and then the knot of the Heart is loosened; all =\r\ndoubts are\ndestroyed and all karmas (activities) cease too.\n\nOf the three m=\r\nodes of individual being, the limited self (as in deep sleep),\nthe empirica=\r\nl self (as in the waking state) and the dreaming self, only the\nindividual =\r\nlimited by the deep sleep state is the true Self (paramarthika).\nEven he is=\r\n but an idea. The Absolute alone is the true Self.\n\nIn reality and by natur=\r\ne he is Brahman itself, only superimposition creates\nthe\nlimitations of ind=\r\nividuality in the Absolute. It is to the paramarthika jiva\nthat the identit=\r\ny of Tat-tvam-asi (That thou art) and other great texts of\nthe Upanishads a=\r\npplies, and not to any other. The great maya (the\nsuperimposition without b=\r\neginning) with her veiling and projecting power\n(tamas and rajas) veils the=\r\n single indivisible Brahman and, in that Brahman,\ncreates the world and ind=\r\nividuals. The individual (jiva), a concept of the\nempirical self in the bud=\r\ndhi, is indeed the actor and enjoyer and the entire\nphenomenal world is its=\r\n object of enjoyment.\n\nFrom time without beginning, till the attainment of =\r\nliberation, individual\nand world have an empirical existence. They are both=\r\n empirical. The\nempirical individual appears to have the power of sleep in =\r\nthe shape of the\nveiling and projecting powers. It is associated with Consc=\r\niousness. The\npower covers first the individual empirical self and the cogn=\r\nized universe,\nand then these are imagined in dream.\n\nThese dream perceptio=\r\nns and the individual who perceives them are illusory,\nbecause they exist o=\r\nnly during the period of dream experience.We affirm\ntheir illusory nature,b=\r\necause on waking up from dream no one sees the\ndream,no one sees the dream =\r\nobjects. The dreaming self experiences the dream\nworld as real, while the e=\r\nmpirical self experiences the empirical world as\nreal but, when the paramar=\r\nthika jiva is realized, knows it to be unreal.\n\nThe paramarthika jiva, as d=\r\nistinguished from those of the waking and dream\nexperiences,is identical wi=\r\nth Brahman. He has no =E2=80=98other=E2=80=99. If he does see any\n=E2=80=98=\r\nother=E2=80=99, he knows it to be illusory.\n\nThe sweetness, liquidity, and =\r\ncoldness of water are characteristics present\nequally in waves and foam. So=\r\n, too,the Being-Consciousness-Bliss character\nof the Self (the paramarthika=\r\n) is present in the empirical self and through\nhim in the dream self also, =\r\nbecause of their being only illusory creations\nin the Self. The foam with i=\r\nts qualities, such as coldness, subsides in the\nwaves, the waves with their=\r\n characteristics, such as liquidity, subside in\nthe water, and the ocean al=\r\none exists as at first. Similarly, the dream self\nand its objects are absor=\r\nbed in the empirical self; then the empirical world\nwith its characteristic=\r\ns is absorbed in the paramarthika and, as at first,\nBeing-Consciousness-Bli=\r\nss which is Brahman shines alone.\n\nSource: The Collected Works Of Sri Raman=\r\na Maharshi\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=\r\n=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =\r\n =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001485f7d8e254c23d04886ba8c8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nThis composition of Shankaracharya was translated into Tamil by Sri Bhagava=\r\nn.

But the eye, being perceived by the mind is drisy=\r\na (object) and the mind which sees it is drik (subject). The mind, with its=\r\n thoughts perceived by the Self, is drisya (object) and the Self is drik (s=\r\nubject).The Self cannot be drisya (object), not being perceived by anything=\r\n else. The forms perceived are various, blue and yellow, gross and subtle, =\r\ntall and short, and so on; but the eye that sees them remains one and the s=\r\name. Similarly, the varying qualities of the eye, such as blindness, dullne=\r\nss and keenness and of the ears and other organs, are perceived by the mind=\r\n singly. So, too, the various characteristics of the mind, such as desire, =\r\ndetermination, doubt, faith, want of faith, courage,want of courage, fear, =\r\nshyness, discrimination, good and bad,are all perceived by the Self singly.=\r\n This Self neither rises nor sets, neither increases nor decays. It shines =\r\nof its own luminosity. It illumines everything else without the need for ai=\r\nd from other sources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Buddhi, as the sum total of the inner=\r\n organs, in contact with the reflected consciousness has two aspects. One i=\r\ns called egoity and the other mind. This contact of the buddhi with the ref=\r\nlected consciousness is like the identity of a red-hot=C2=A0iron ball with =\r\nfire. Hence the gross body passes for a conscious entity. The contact estab=\r\nlishing identity between the ego and the reflected Consciousness, is of thr=\r\nee kinds.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;1. The identification of the ego with the reflected Consc=\r\niousness is natural or innate.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;2. The identification of the ego wit=\r\nh the body is due to past karma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. The identification of the ego wi=\r\nth the witness is due to ignorance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The natural or innate contact co=\r\nntinues as long as the buddhi, but on realization of the Self it proves to =\r\nbe false. The third mentioned contact is broken when it is discovered by ex=\r\nperience that there is no sort of contact of anything at all with the Self,=\r\n which is Being.

When the veiling ends,the distinction between the two =\r\nis perceived, for none of the=C2=A0activities of the phenomenal world exist=\r\n in Brahman.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Of the five characteristics, Being, Consciousness, Bli=\r\nss,name and form, the first three pertain to Brahman and name and form to t=\r\nhe world. The three aspects of Being,Consciousness and Bliss exist equally =\r\nin the five elements of ether, air, fire, water and earth and in devas (god=\r\ns), animals,men, etc., whereas the names and forms are different.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Therefore, be indifferent to names and form=\r\ns, concentrate on Being-Consciousness-Bliss and constantly practise samadhi=\r\n (identity with Brahman) within the Heart or outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;This p=\r\nractice of samadhi (identity with Brahman) is of two kinds: savikalpa (in w=\r\nhich the distinction between knower,knowledge and known is not lost) and ni=\r\nrvikalpa (in which the above distinction is lost). Savikalpa samadhi again =\r\nis of two kinds: that which is associated with words (sound), and meditatio=\r\nn on one=E2=80=99s own consciousness as the witness of thought forms such a=\r\ns desire, which is savikalpa samadhi (internal), associated with (cognizabl=\r\ne) objects. Realizing one=E2=80=99s Self as =E2=80=98I am Being-Consciousne=\r\nss-Bliss without duality,unattached, self-effulgent=E2=80=99, is savikalpa =\r\nsamadhi (internal) associated with words (sound).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Giving up both o=\r\nbjects and sound forms of the aforesaid two modes of samadhi and being comp=\r\nletely absorbed in the Bliss experienced by the realization of the Self is =\r\nnirvikalpa samadhi (internal). In this state steady abidance is obtained, l=\r\nike the unflickering flame of a light kept in a place free from wind. So al=\r\nso, in the Heart, becoming indifferent to external objects of name and form=\r\n and perceiving only Being of (or as) Sat, is savikalpa samadhi (external) =\r\nassociated with objects; and being aware continually of that Sat (true exis=\r\ntence) as the unbroken single essence of Brahman is savikalpa samadhi (exte=\r\nrnal) associated with words (sound).After these two experiences, Being, whi=\r\nch is uninterrupted like the waveless ocean, is nirvikalpa samadhi (externa=\r\nl). One who meditates should spend his time perpetually in these six=C2=A0k=\r\ninds of samadhi. By these, the attachment to the body is destroyed and the =\r\nmind that perpetually abides in the Supreme Self (paramatman) wherever it m=\r\nay wander, is everywhere spontaneously in samadhi.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;By this constant=\r\n practice of samadhi, the supreme Self, who is both highest and lowliest,wh=\r\no encompasses Paramatman as well as jivatman is directly experienced, and t=\r\nhen the knot of the Heart is loosened; all doubts are destroyed and all kar=\r\nmas (activities) cease too.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Of the three modes of individual being=\r\n, the limited self (as in deep sleep), the empirical self (as in the waking=\r\n state) and the dreaming self,=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;only t=\r\nhe individual limited by the deep sleep state is the true Self (paramarthik=\r\na)&lt;/span&gt;. Even he is but an idea. The Absolute alone is the true Self.=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In reality and by nature he is Brahman itself, only superimpos=\r\nition creates the&lt;br&gt;limitations of individuality in the Absolute. It is to=\r\n the paramarthika jiva that the identity of Tat-tvam-asi (That thou art) an=\r\nd other great texts of the Upanishads applies, and not to any other. The gr=\r\neat maya (the superimposition without beginning) with her veiling and proje=\r\ncting power (tamas and rajas) veils the single indivisible Brahman and, in =\r\nthat Brahman, creates the world and individuals. The individual=C2=A0(jiva)=\r\n, a concept of the empirical self in the buddhi, is indeed the actor and en=\r\njoyer and the entire phenomenal world is its object of enjoyment.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;From time without beginning, till the attainment of liberation, indivi=\r\ndual and world have an empirical existence. They are both empirical. The em=\r\npirical individual appears to have the power of sleep in the shape of the v=\r\neiling and projecting powers. It is associated with Consciousness. The powe=\r\nr covers first the individual empirical=C2=A0self and the cognized universe=\r\n, and then these are imagined in dream.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;These dream perceptions and the individual who perceives them a=\r\nre illusory, because they exist only during the period of dream experience.=\r\nWe affirm their illusory nature,because on waking up from dream no one sees=\r\n the dream,no one sees the dream objects. The dreaming self experiences the=\r\n dream world as real, while the empirical self experiences the empirical wo=\r\nrld as real but, when the paramarthika jiva is realized, knows it to be unr=\r\neal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The paramarthika jiva=\r\n, as distinguished from those of the waking and dream experiences,is identi=\r\ncal with Brahman.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;He has no =E2=80=98other=E2=80=99. If he does=\r\n see any =E2=80=98other=E2=80=99, he knows it to be illusory.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The =\r\nsweetness, liquidity, and coldness of water are characteristics present equ=\r\nally in waves and foam. So, too,the Being-Consciousness-Bliss character of =\r\nthe Self (the=C2=A0paramarthika) is present in the empirical self and throu=\r\ngh him in the dream self also, because of their being only illusory creatio=\r\nns in the Self. The foam with its qualities, such as coldness, subsides in =\r\nthe waves, the waves with their characteristics, such as liquidity, subside=\r\n in the water, and the ocean alone exists as at first. Similarly, the dream=\r\n self and its objects are absorbed in the empirical self; then the empirica=\r\nl world with its characteristics is absorbed in the paramarthika and, as at=\r\n first, Being-Consciousness-Bliss which is Brahman shines alone.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: The Collected Works Of Sri R=\r\namana Maharshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--001485f7d8e254c23d04886ba8c8--\r\n\n"}}
