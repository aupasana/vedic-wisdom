If your neighbors know you perform the ritual, they are bound to mak=\r\ne some noise. The smell from the ghee burning is much much milder than thei=\r\nr barbeque sessions!!  So, just ignore them. Use incense sticks liberally, =\r\nwhich helps in spreading the pleasant smell. I sprinkly sambrani powder on =\r\nthe embers in the kundam. You can also use the pleasant smelling jawar, whi=\r\nch have an awesome aroma, and serves as a room freshener when sprinkled on =\r\nthe embers.\n\nHope this helps\nRegards\nNarayan\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;mahalakshmi_gorla&quot; &lt;mahalakshmi_gorla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasi=\r\nmha garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it okay to close the homakundam once the fire goes off,\n&gt;=\r\n to avoid the smoke spreading in the house?
