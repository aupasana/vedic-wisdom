Nothing pa=\r\nrticularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and tw=\r\no children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you,=\r\n but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, t=\r\nrust me.\n\nAnd that&#39;s when you met me.\n&quot;What=85 what happened?&quot; You asked. &quot;=\r\nWhere am I?&quot;\n&quot;You died,&quot; I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing word=\r\ns.\n&quot;There was a=85 a truck and it was skidding=85&quot;\n&quot;Yup,&quot; I said.\n&quot;I=85 I d=\r\nied?&quot;\n&quot;Yup. But don&#39;t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,&quot; I said.\nYou looked=\r\n around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. &quot;What is this place?&quot; You =\r\nasked. &quot;Is this the afterlife?&quot;\n&quot;More or less,&quot; I said.\n&quot;Are you god?&quot; You =\r\nasked.\n&quot;Yup,&quot; I replied. &quot;I&#39;m God.&quot;\n&quot;My kids=85 my wife,&quot; you said.\n&quot;What a=\r\nbout them?&quot;\n&quot;Will they be all right?&quot;\n&quot;That&#39;s what I like to see,&quot; I said. =\r\n&quot;You just died and your main concern is for your family. That&#39;s good stuff =\r\nright there.&quot;\n\nYou looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn&#39;t look lik=\r\ne God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authori=\r\nty figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.\n&quot;Don&#39;=\r\nt worry,&quot; I said. &quot;They&#39;ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect =\r\nin every way. They didn&#39;t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife wil=\r\nl cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marri=\r\nage was falling apart. If it&#39;s any consolation, she&#39;ll feel very guilty for=\r\n feeling relieved.&quot;\n&quot;Oh,&quot; you said. &quot;So what happens now? Do I go to heaven=\r\n or hell or something?&quot;\n&quot;Neither,&quot; I said. &quot;You&#39;ll be reincarnated.&quot;\n&quot;Ah,&quot; =\r\nyou said. &quot;So the Hindus were right,&quot;\n&quot;All religions are right in their own=\r\n way,&quot; I said. &quot;Walk with me.&quot;\n\nYou followed along as we strode through the=\r\n void. &quot;Where are we going?&quot;\n&quot;Nowhere in particular,&quot; I said. &quot;It&#39;s just ni=\r\nce to walk while we talk.&quot;\n&quot;So what&#39;s the point, then?&quot; You asked. &quot;When I =\r\nget reborn, I&#39;ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experience=\r\ns and everything I did in this life won&#39;t matter.&quot;\n&quot;Not so!&quot; I said. &quot;You h=\r\nave within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. Yo=\r\nu just don&#39;t remember them right now.&quot;\nI stopped walking and took you by th=\r\ne shoulders. &quot;Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than y=\r\nou can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of w=\r\nhat you are. It&#39;s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if i=\r\nt&#39;s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when =\r\nyou bring it back out, you&#39;ve gained all the experiences it had.\n&quot;You&#39;ve be=\r\nen in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven&#39;t stretched out yet and f=\r\nelt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long en=\r\nough, you&#39;d start remembering everything. But there&#39;s no point to doing tha=\r\nt between each life.&quot;\n&quot;How many times have I been reincarnated, then?&quot;\n&quot;Oh =\r\nlots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.&quot; I said. &quot;This time =\r\naround, you&#39;ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.&quot;\n&quot;Wait, what?&quot; You stam=\r\nmered. &quot;You&#39;re sending me back in time?&quot;\n&quot;Well, I guess technically. Time, =\r\nas you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I =\r\ncome from.&quot;\n&quot;Where you come from?&quot; You said.\n&quot;Oh sure,&quot; I explained &quot;I come=\r\n from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you&#39;l=\r\nl want to know what it&#39;s like there, but honestly you wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot;=\r\n\n&quot;Oh,&quot; you said, a little let down. &quot;But wait. If I get reincarnated to oth=\r\ner places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.&quot;\n&quot;Sur=\r\ne. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifesp=\r\nan you don&#39;t even know it&#39;s happening.&quot;\n&quot;So what&#39;s the point of it all?&quot;\n&quot;S=\r\neriously?&quot; I asked. &quot;Seriously? You&#39;re asking me for the meaning of life? I=\r\nsn&#39;t that a little stereotypical?&quot;\n&quot;Well it&#39;s a reasonable question,&quot; you p=\r\nersisted.\n\nI looked you in the eye. &quot;The meaning of life, the reason I made=\r\n this whole universe, is for you to mature.&quot;\n&quot;You mean mankind? You want us=\r\n to mature?&quot;\n&quot;No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each n=\r\new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.&quot;\n&quot;Ju=\r\nst me? What about everyone else?&quot;\n&quot;There is no one else,&quot; I said. &quot;In this =\r\nuniverse, there&#39;s just you and me.&quot;\nYou stared blankly at me. &quot;But all the =\r\npeople on earth=85&quot;\n&quot;All you. Different incarnations of you.&quot;\n&quot;Wait. I&#39;m ev=\r\neryone!?&quot;\n&quot;Now you&#39;re getting it,&quot; I said, with a congratulatory slap on th=\r\ne back.\n&quot;I&#39;m every human being who ever lived?&quot;\n&quot;Or who will ever live, yes=\r\n.&quot;\n&quot;I&#39;m Abraham Lincoln?&quot;\n&quot;And you&#39;re John Wilkes Booth, too,&quot; I added.\n&quot;I&#39;=\r\nm Hitler?&quot; You said, appalled.\n&quot;And you&#39;re the millions he killed.&quot;\n&quot;I&#39;m Je=\r\nsus?&quot;\n&quot;And you&#39;re everyone who followed him.&quot;\nYou fell silent.\n\n&quot;Every time=\r\n you victimized someone,&quot; I said, &quot;you were victimizing yourself. Every act=\r\n of kindness you&#39;ve done, you&#39;ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad mome=\r\nnt ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.&quot;\nYou =\r\nthought for a long time.\n&quot;Why?&quot; You asked me. &quot;Why do all this?&quot;\n&quot;Because s=\r\nomeday, you will become like me. Because that&#39;s what you are. You&#39;re one of=\r\n my kind. You&#39;re my child.&quot;\n&quot;Whoa,&quot; you said, incredulous. &quot;You mean I&#39;m a =\r\ngod?&quot;\n&quot;No. Not yet. You&#39;re a fetus. You&#39;re still growing. Once you&#39;ve lived=\r\n every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be bor=\r\nn.&quot;\n&quot;So the whole universe,&quot; you said, &quot;it&#39;s just=85&quot;\n&quot;An egg.&quot; I answered.=\r\n &quot;Now it&#39;s time for you to move on to your next life.&quot;\nAnd I sent you on yo=\r\nur way.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
