Your f=\r\nriend is correct on that. However, why should that imply that aakaasa and a=\r\nir are better elements for spiritual growth than fire? Why should spiritual=\r\n importance be decided by numbers and pre-dominance?\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; There may be o=\r\nnly a handful of elevated yogis in the world and millions of greedy people.=\r\n Should we say that association with greedy people is better for spiritual =\r\ngrowth than association with elevated yogis?\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Numbers and predominan=\r\nce do not decide what is more useful in spiritual growth!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Fire is pure. One of the n=\r\names for fire is paavaka and means &quot;purifier&quot;. Fire purifies whatever it co=\r\nmes in contact with.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Air can be pure or impure. If you are able to =\r\nperceive the underlying Brahman in air, then it is ever pure. But, the prob=\r\nlem is that you are not able to perceive the underlying Brahman and you are=\r\n perceiving a specific object with certain properties in the field of duali=\r\nty. That is why you need to do sadhana in first place.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Then why not=\r\n use something that has good and purifying properties even in the field of =\r\nduality?

Aakaasa (ether/space) is an element present in everything and yet impe=\r\nrceptible. Similarly, Brahman is present in every object we perceive and ye=\r\nt we do not perceive Brahman - we only perceive various objects. A vedanti =\r\ntells oneself that everything is Brahman. Perception of various objects as =\r\nvarious objects with properties is an illusion, one keeps telling oneself. =\r\nOne tries to see everything as Brahman.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; When one feels attraction o=\r\nr repulsion for something, one reminds oneself &quot;what I am doing? All is Bra=\r\nhman. There is no X and Y.&quot; When one feels pride or depression, one reminds=\r\n oneself &quot;what I am doing? All is Brahman. There is no I or others. There i=\r\ns no good or bad.&quot; With persistent contemplation and self-control exerted l=\r\nike that for a long time, one finally overcomes the very seed of such thoug=\r\nhts that need to be countered with &quot;everything is Brahman&quot; logoc. One&#39;s min=\r\nd is established in Brahman and one does not perceive objectification. That=\r\n is moksha.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; This path needs tremendous patience, perseverance and d=\r\niscipline.
