Mala is part of external practice \nand is of less =\r\nimportance than the intention itself.\n\nIn your case keeping the tradition l=\r\nimit to session is the simplest \nsolution. I suggest you to not to complica=\r\nte. Don&#39;t force yourself to \ndo it even number of times.\n\nIf you ask techni=\r\ncally, if there is a way to mark the first beed, then \nyou can note down wh=\r\nich direction you ended in a session and then \nresume the reverse in the ne=\r\nxt session. This how ever, is a overhead \nwhich you may not really want.\n\nB=\r\nest regards,\nVijay\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_=\r\nsharma@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaskar.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for s=\r\no patiently and eloquently answering all of my \n&gt; questions. As per your su=\r\nggestion I have moved the Puja room out of \n&gt; my basement.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have=\r\n a free moment I do have a technical question for you:\n&gt; \n&gt; Does the injunc=\r\ntion not to cross the Meru bead when doing Japa apply \n&gt; to just one &quot;sessi=\r\non&quot; ? Say a person does 3 malas of a certain \nmantra \n&gt; every day. After th=\r\ne first round the person must turn back and so \non. \n&gt; I understand this. B=\r\nut does one have to remember on which side of \nthe \n&gt; mala he finished so h=\r\ne can start on that side of the mala on the \nnext \n&gt; day? \n&gt; \n&gt; If yes, wha=\r\nt is the best way of remembering? I myself attach a paper \n&gt; clip on the si=\r\nde I finish with so I know to start on that side the \n&gt; very next day or fo=\r\nr a different session on the same day. \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope I am being at least som=\r\newhat clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
