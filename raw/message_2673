Seeing this he asked her, &#39;Mother, low did you get\nthis ugly scratch on your cheek?&#39; The mother of the universe replied,&#39;This\nis the work of your own hand; it is the scratch of your nail.&#39; Kartikeya\nasked in wonder: &#39;How is it, Mother? I do not remember to have scratched you\nat any time. The Mother replied, &#39;Darling, have you forgotten the fact of\nyour laving scratched a cat this morning?&#39; Kartikeya said, Yes, I did\nscratch a cat, but how did your cheek get the scar?&#39;\n\nThe Mother replied, &#39;Dear child, nothing exists in this world but Myself.\nThe whole creation is Myself; whomsoever you may hurt, you only hurt me.&#39;\n\nKartikeya was greatly surprised to hear this; and then he determined never\nto marry. For, whom could he marry? Every woman was mother to him.\n\nRealizing thus the motherhood of woman, he gave up marriage. I am like\nKartikeya.
