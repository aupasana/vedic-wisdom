I=\r\n don&#39;t \nknow Gujarati.

Sri Yogeshwar was a very \nhighly\n&gt; realized saint. His book is very goo=\r\nd. He does mention about his\n&gt; prevoius birth and also mentions that Saccha=\r\n Baba had also confirmed\n&gt; the same thing. Saccha Baba was another very hig=\r\nhly realized saint \ntoo.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Yogeshwar had many times visions of Sai B=\r\naba of shirdi and \nNaamdev\n&gt; and also many other saints too. The initiation=\r\n he got on the bank of\n&gt; river Narmada awakened his kundalini and he has de=\r\nscribed very\n&gt; accurately the state and symptoms after awekaning of kunalin=\r\ni. He \nhad\n&gt; very good command on all aspects of sprituality and was a fant=\r\nastic\n&gt; orator. His followers have done a very good job of putting up the \n=\r\nweb\n&gt; site and sharing the information for free both audio and books.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nChiti Leela or the play of Shakti or God is very complex, \nRamakrishna\n&gt; ma=\r\ny have taken birth as more than one person and in future may take\n&gt; more bi=\r\nrths.\n&gt; \n&gt; His comsic body (karan sharir) or whatever name others use pardo=\r\nn my\n&gt; lack of appropriate word, is also alive and manifest from time to \nt=\r\nime\n&gt; After reading this and other books, I feel that each one of us has a\n=\r\n&gt; inner guru along with our atma and this inner guru in conjunction \nwith\n&gt;=\r\n our accumulated or sanchit sankaras give us visions of these \nmahatmas\n&gt; o=\r\nr help us attach or attract to a Saint or some aspects of the saint\n&gt; more =\r\nthan others. This inner guru is the same in all humam beings \nbut\n&gt; manifes=\r\nts uniquely based on each person. \n&gt; \n&gt; I also believe that one needs to ge=\r\nt initiated by a Guru who is\n&gt; present in physical form and seek guidance f=\r\nrom him time to time.\n&gt; There are many instances of other forms of inititat=\r\nions like\n&gt; initiation in dream or inititation by cosmic forms, these forms=\r\n of\n&gt; initiations though very important are very rare or uncommon.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAfter reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I had some questions pop up in my\n&gt; mind=\r\n about him.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) What was the purpose of his birth? Yes he may have guid=\r\ned many\n&gt; spiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique.\n&gt;=\r\n 2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book\n&gt; abo=\r\nut it in many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after \nthat?\n&gt; 3) H=\r\ne did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of giving\n&gt; spirtual=\r\n talks? It seems unusual.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have also read somewhere that once a perso=\r\nn reaches a spiritual\n&gt; state, he cannot remain in human body for more than=\r\n few days, was \nthis\n&gt; the case?\n&gt; \n&gt; May be others who have read this book=\r\n can share more light.\n&gt; I do recommend to seekers of spirutuality to read =\r\nthis book if one \nhas\n&gt; time, it is available for free to download as a pdf=\r\n book on his web \nsite.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for=\r\n the betterment and\n&gt; upliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown. He=\r\n spread the \nDevi\n&gt; Gayatri mantra/homa and other things in a big way all a=\r\nround india.\n&gt; \n&gt; I feel like I have not even begun my spiritual journey wh=\r\nich is very\n&gt; very long too and many obstacles in the path.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;ve=\r\ndic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; one Gayatri Upaasaka told m=\r\ne many years back that Shri Ram Sharma \n&gt; &gt; Acharya was born as Thakur Ramk=\r\nrishna in previous life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another as intresting as well as equally =\r\nconfusing thing is that \n&gt; &gt; Late Shri Yogeshwarji (A Gujarati yogi) had al=\r\nso revealtion about \n&gt; &gt; his past life and he also indirectly indicated in =\r\nhis biography \nthat \n&gt; &gt; he was Thakur Ramkrishna in the previous birth.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblisswithin@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Resp=\r\nected Ashwinji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wou=\r\nld like to mention something that may be an interesting \n&gt; &gt; insight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya.

This is an unbelievable experience=\r\n \nthat I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writin=\r\ng \n&gt; &gt; exactly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to the per=\r\niod of \n&gt; &gt; 1973/74.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you are in religious =\r\nmood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Pos=\r\nt office near \n&gt; &gt; Dwarka.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was ge=\r\ntting late fee \nallowance \n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone =\r\nexchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; =\r\nI had friendship with some \n&gt; &gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbha=\r\ni Patel, (we will call him as Mr. \nPatel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He=\r\n was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whene=\r\nver I was meeting him he was always talking \n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. W=\r\ne came close day by day. There was a weekly \n&gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his hom=\r\ne called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs \ncreated \n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nim and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrit=\r\na. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly \n&gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on =\r\nSaturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of \n30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then.=\r\n We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty \nhours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and w=\r\nere talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he=\r\n suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to m=\r\ny home and my wife is remembering me. \nMy \n&gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few=\r\n minutes to call me. I shall have to go \nnow=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And wi=\r\nth my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one anothe=\r\nr incident he told me that there will be a plane \n&gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow =\r\nand that also happened. I was very much impressed \nabout \n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He=\r\n could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by \nBus, \n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. \nYet I\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was \n&gt; &gt; punct=\r\nured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made=\r\n me to believe that he had some super \n&gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to =\r\nRamkrishandev worship only. I was attracted \nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day =\r\nI thought, I should also be disciple of \nshri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came=\r\n. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered \n&gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr.=\r\n Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I \nprayed \n&gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deep=\r\nly from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow \nhis \n&gt; &gt; grace. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 \nmorning\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was \n&gt; &gt; wak=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed \nand \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you take suc=\r\nh a hasty \n&gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa K=\r\nali at Calcutta. He \n&gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be liv=\r\ning one, who can guide \nus, \n&gt; &gt; give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you =\r\ntake Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma \n&gt; &gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayat=\r\nri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as peop=\r\nle in general \nnot \n&gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I =\r\nthought-- yes I have \ntaken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of=\r\n Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thaku=\r\nr was \ntelling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I al=\r\nso \ndecided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2=80&quot;=\r\n=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. \nPatel \n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have al=\r\nso not seen him. He has \nnever \n&gt; &gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppo=\r\nse Mr. Patel is coming to our house \n&gt; &gt; within\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, wou=\r\nld you believe that my selection for \nThakur is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t=\r\n \nbelieve.=E2=80=9D-\n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel i=\r\nmmediately to justify \nmy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I w=\r\nant to test your existence \n&gt; &gt; even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; today.=E2=80=99\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To our g=\r\nreat surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; morning with=\r\n angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this =\r\nway?
