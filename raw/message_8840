Of course the analogy of Sun and =\r\nSunlight is valid, but the more interesting question remains why was there =\r\na clear thrust on the Sun in the spiritual literature in Gita while the ter=\r\nminology shifted to Sunlight in Tantras. One can adopt the mystics attitude=\r\n and welcome, without analysing, all variations of spiritual experience. Or=\r\n one can adopt the philosophical-spiritual attitude and try to find a flow =\r\nof how and why this shift happened. In India we have a solid tradition of b=\r\noth these two manners of treating Divine knowledge and experience. A more f=\r\nundamental query also comes up, and which holds the key to this question (I=\r\nMHO), is why does Sri Krishna never mention the word Kundalini in the Gita.=\r\n\n\n2. To understand this we must start with acknowledging certain obvious fa=\r\ncts as they come to us. The Gita (Upanishadic tradition) does not look at s=\r\npirituality from the fulcrum of Kundalini. Neither is it the first experien=\r\nce, nor a sufficient parameter for judgement. It is rather an inevitable pr=\r\nocess in the journey, which can happen in day one, or the very last day. By=\r\n itself, just by an awakening of the K shakti, one does not become spiritua=\r\nl, neither can it be said that if one has not had an experience of the K sh=\r\nakti yet, one is not making progress spiritually. But by the time of the Ha=\r\ntha Yogic traditions, Nath Yogis, and Tantra, the understanding of spiritua=\r\nlity became entirely Kundalini centric.\n\n3. Kundalini as we read and hear o=\r\nf it today, IMO, is insufficiently understood. The maximum that books or pe=\r\nople speak of is the standard diagramAtic knowledge of chakras and Shakti r=\r\nising up. Some correlation of this can be felt, but it is in greatest depth=\r\n still a mental concept and at times pretty vague and speculative. That is =\r\nbecause this knowledge was passed down from capable gurus to capable discip=\r\nles, and it needed a blind adherence to the words of a physical Guru for th=\r\ne process of kundalinI sadhana to change a person into someone truly spirit=\r\nual. Hence the primacy of hanging on blindly to the Guru. The diagramtic li=\r\nnear understanding that we have of the K process has gaps, and can very oft=\r\nen give a lopsided view of things. For example the diagram of a man sitting=\r\n with chakras and Shakti rising up is actual a two-dimensional representati=\r\non of a multidimensional phenomenon, highly prone to misunderstanding. The =\r\ninfluence of each of the chakras\n pervade the whole life of a person. They =\r\noverlap each other. Each represent psychological functions of the human org=\r\nanism. Activating or deactiving specific petals of each chakra is important=\r\n and vital for sadhana of each speicifc individual, which a Guru can decide=\r\n accurately. The diagramatic centers only represent the focal point of that=\r\n range of pyschological functions, but the sphere of influence of each chak=\r\nra can permeate into the whole system and consequently into life in general=\r\n. It is impossible for any sadhaka to navigate the path, with a K centric v=\r\niew of spirituality, unless guided constantly by a physical guru of great d=\r\nepth, knowledge and wisdom abouit Kundalini Yoga. Otherwise, like Columbus,=\r\n one will start for India and end up reaching America.\n\n4. The concept of G=\r\nuru and Shishya was always there, but in the Gita and Upanishads, Guru was =\r\nthe Guru tattwa, which can manifest from an individual, or through anything=\r\n provided the disciple is ready. Like Dattatreya had 24 non-human gurus. Bu=\r\nt this kind of concept of Guru is impractical when it comes to Kundalini Yo=\r\nga. One can become genuinely spiritual by contemplating and trying to imbib=\r\ne the advice of Krishna in the Gita without a physical Guru. Same cannot be=\r\n done in Kundalini centric view of sadhana.\n\n5. In the Gita tradition, or f=\r\nor that matter any spiritual tradition, Kundalini will awaken for sure, but=\r\n since spirituality is not looked at from that prism, therefore this proces=\r\ns is left to Nature to happen on its own, when a sadhaka is ready internall=\r\ny. Moreover, the judgement of spirituality - whether a person is spiritual =\r\nor non-spiritual - cannot be made based merely on an experience of Kundalin=\r\ni itself. Until the K shakti rises up to meet the higher spiritual realms a=\r\nnd brings down those energies into life, and then those energies settle dow=\r\nn into the system, actual spiritual effects may not be visible.\n\n6. The Kun=\r\ndalini is the force of the pranamayakosha which holds the external personal=\r\nity together. The aim is to liberate it from its mundane function and make =\r\nit shoot-up to purify itself. Every time it comes into contact with the hig=\r\nher planes, it imbibes the energies and bring them down into life. The pran=\r\namayakosha is pure shakti, constantly in motion. This is a tremendous force=\r\n. Because Force in its original nature is the domain of the Mother, the dyn=\r\namic aspect of Sat-Chit-Ananda, therefore Kundalini is called Shakti sadhan=\r\na or Mother Kundalini.\n\n7. In the light of the above points, it can be fair=\r\nly understood why the Gita puts its trust on Purushottama, while the Tantra=\r\ns - whose spiritual prism was Kundalini centric - puts the focus on Adya Sh=\r\nakti.\n\n8. In this age when Guurus are rare, genuine paramparas are rarer st=\r\nill, and capable sadhaks are negligible, a Kundalini centric view of sadhan=\r\na can be detrimental for most people.\n\n9. Of course, these are my view-poin=\r\nt as I see it. Feel free to disagree.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\naw=\r\naktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyay=\r\namanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Narasimha P.=\r\nV.R.

At the same time, there are no rays without Sun. Sun and rays go tog=\r\nether.

A=\r\n suppressed spring has potential energy. When it is released, some potentia=\r\nl energy is\n *converted* into kinetic energy. But potential energy and kine=\r\ntic energy are not really two different things. They are two aspects of the=\r\n same and converted from one to another. Similarly, Purusha is the potentia=\r\nl energy and Shakti is the kinetic energy.\n=C2=A0\nPurushottama is like the =\r\ncumulative [spiritual] potential energy of the cosmos that is about to go t=\r\nhrough the big bang. Adya shakti is like the cumulative [spiritual] kinetic=\r\n energy of the cosmos after the big bang. Purushottama and Adya Shakti are =\r\nnot really different and two aspects of the same. When something needs to b=\r\ne done in the cosmos, Purushottama projects himself as his Shakti and thing=\r\ns happen.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nQuestion 2:\n=C2=A0\nThis is a great =\r\nquestion and I never thought of it before.

Th=\r\nese three aspects are represented by Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswat=\r\ni, the deities of the 3 charitras of Saptashati or Chandipath or Devi Mahat=\r\nmyam.\n=C2=A0\nVarious higher beings emanate from these three basic types of =\r\nhigher kinetic energy to aid in the respective high level processes. Please=\r\n bear in mind that different male deities represents different types of pot=\r\nential energy of consciousness, playing specific roles based on the combina=\r\ntion of gunas, and different\n female deities represent different types of k=\r\ninetic energy within consciousness, again playing specific roles based on t=\r\nhe combination of gunas. It is all play of energies in the end.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nTo cause objectification in consciousness, the kinetic e=\r\nnergy of consciousness needs to be stirred and rajas-ified and the potentia=\r\nl energy of consciousness needs to be withdrawn/reduced, stopped and tamas-=\r\nified. These two energies are represented by Saraswati and Rudra.\n=C2=A0\nTo=\r\n sustain objectification already present in consciousness, the kinetic ener=\r\ngy of consciousness needs to be in a stable and clear equilibrium and sattv=\r\n-ified and the potential energy of consciousness needs to be stirred and ra=\r\njas-ified. These two energies are represented by Lakshmi and Brahma.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nTo end objectification already present in consciousness, the kinetic\n ener=\r\ngy of consciousness needs to be withdrawn/reduced, stopped and tamas-ified =\r\nand the potential energy of consciousness needs to be in a stable and clear=\r\n equilibrium and sattv-ified.

She is not the same as Mahalakshmi of the 3 Mahadevis just bec=\r\nause of the name. She could as well have been called Aadyaa Shakti or Naara=\r\nayani. To remove confusion, we may call her Aadyaadi Mahalakshmi (in the te=\r\nrminology of Lakshmi Hridayam from &quot;Atharva Rahasyam&quot;, which is one of my f=\r\navorite prayers). Aadyaadi Mahalakshmi personifies the entire kinetic energ=\r\ny of\n cosmos.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThis reminds me of an incident. =\r\nOne person was doing daily Chandi homam and invoking Mahalakshmi as the mai=\r\nn deity. He was using the dhyana shloka for Mahalakshmi from &quot;Vaikritika Ra=\r\nhasyam&quot; (shvetAnanA nIlabhujA sushveta stana maNDalA...). He later switched=\r\n to a different dhyana shloka - the one for Adyadi Mahalakshmi from whom Ma=\r\nhakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati came - from &quot;Pradhanika Rahasyam&quot; (sa=\r\nrvasyAdyA mahAlakShmIH trigunA parameshvarI...), thinking that it was super=\r\nior.\n=C2=A0\nHis guru told him after a few months, &quot;whatever dhyana shloka y=\r\nou use, know its meaning and physically imagine someone in that form&quot;. He c=\r\name and asked me for the meaning. I discouraged him, &quot;I don&#39;t think you rea=\r\nlly want to know the meaning and physically imagine someone in that form&quot;. =\r\nWhen he insisted, I told him the\n meaning.\n=C2=A0\nThe verses describe Mahal=\r\nakshmi who is the &quot;First among all&quot; (sarvasya AdyA) and having all 3 gunas.=\r\n She is described as holding in her hands a liquor bowl, snake, male genita=\r\nl, female genital, king&#39;s head etc. Of course, if one starts imagining such=\r\n a form, it may distract one&#39;s mind based on one&#39;s conditioning!\n=C2=A0\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe thing here is that these symbols represent some s=\r\nubtle things. The &quot;Initial Kinetic Energy&quot; from which whole creation came a=\r\nbout obviously works by intoxicating parts of consciousness with notions (l=\r\niquor bowl), giving rise to notions of gender and identity (male and female=\r\n genitals), self-awareness/Kundalini (snake), egosense (king&#39;s head) etc. W=\r\nhen one is dealing with such Initial or high level energies, concepts becom=\r\ne subtle/abstract. If one wants an explicit outer form, it is better to ima=\r\ngine\n slightly lower level manifestations with specific gunas and purposes.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nLet me say it in different words. The Kinetic energy of Purushottam=\r\na is beyond our thoughts, perception and imagination. Various descriptions =\r\nand imagery in various scriptures are very likely to be misunderstood by us=\r\n based on our conditioning.

To understand this we must start with acknowledging certa=\r\nin obvious facts as they come to us. The Gita (Upanishadic tradition) does =\r\nnot look at spirituality from the fulcrum of Kundalini. Neither is it the f=\r\nirst experience, nor a sufficient parameter for judgement. It is rather an =\r\ninevitable process in the journey, which can happen in day one, or the very=\r\n last day. By itself, just by an awakening of the K shakti, one does not be=\r\ncome spiritual, neither can it be said that if one has not had an experienc=\r\ne of the K shakti yet, one is not making progress spiritually. But by the t=\r\nime of the Hatha Yogic traditions, Nath Yogis, and Tantra, the understandin=\r\ng of spirituality became entirely Kundalini centric.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Kundalini as=\r\n we read and hear of it today, IMO, is insufficiently understood. The maxim=\r\num that books or people speak of is the standard diagramAtic knowledge of c=\r\nhakras and Shakti rising up. Some correlation of this can be\n felt, but it =\r\nis in greatest depth still a mental concept and at times pretty vague and s=\r\npeculative. That is because this knowledge was passed down from capable gur=\r\nus to capable disciples, and it needed a blind adherence to the words of a =\r\nphysical Guru for the process of kundalinI sadhana to change a person into =\r\nsomeone truly spiritual. Hence the primacy of hanging on blindly to the Gur=\r\nu. The diagramtic linear understanding that we have of the K process has ga=\r\nps, and can very often give a lopsided view of things. For example the diag=\r\nram of a man sitting with chakras and Shakti rising up is actual a two-dime=\r\nnsional representation of a multidimensional phenomenon, highly prone to mi=\r\nsunderstanding. The influence of each of the chakras pervade the whole life=\r\n of a person. They overlap each other. Each represent psychological functio=\r\nns of the human organism. Activating or deactiving specific petals of each =\r\nchakra is important and vital for sadhana of each\n speicifc individual, whi=\r\nch a Guru can decide accurately. The diagramatic centers only represent the=\r\n focal point of that range of pyschological functions, but the sphere of in=\r\nfluence of each chakra can permeate into the whole system and consequently =\r\ninto life in general. It is impossible for any sadhaka to navigate the path=\r\n, with a K centric view of spirituality, unless guided constantly by a phys=\r\nical guru of great depth, knowledge and wisdom abouit Kundalini Yoga. Other=\r\nwise, like Columbus, one will start for India and end up reaching America.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The concept of Guru and Shishya was always there, but in the Gita=\r\n and Upanishads, Guru was the Guru tattwa, which can manifest from an indiv=\r\nidual, or through anything provided the disciple is ready. Like Dattatreya =\r\nhad 24 non-human gurus. But this kind of concept of Guru is impractical whe=\r\nn it comes to Kundalini Yoga. One can become genuinely spiritual by contemp=\r\nlating and trying to imbibe the advice of\n Krishna in the Gita without a ph=\r\nysical Guru. Same cannot be done in Kundalini centric view of sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;5. In the Gita tradition, or for that matter any spiritual tradition, Ku=\r\nndalini will awaken for sure, but since spirituality is not looked at from =\r\nthat prism, therefore this process is left to Nature to happen on its own, =\r\nwhen a sadhaka is ready internally. Moreover, the judgement of spirituality=\r\n - whether a person is spiritual or non-spiritual - cannot be made based me=\r\nrely on an experience of Kundalini itself. Until the K shakti rises up to m=\r\neet the higher spiritual realms and brings down those energies into life, a=\r\nnd then those energies settle down into the system, actual spiritual effect=\r\ns may not be visible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. The Kundalini is the force of the pranamaya=\r\nkosha which holds the external personality together. The aim is to liberate=\r\n it from its mundane function and make it shoot-up to purify itself. Every =\r\ntime it comes into contact with the\n higher planes, it imbibes the energies=\r\n and bring them down into life. The pranamayakosha is pure shakti, constant=\r\nly in motion. This is a tremendous force. Because Force in its original nat=\r\nure is the domain of the Mother, the dynamic aspect of Sat-Chit-Ananda, the=\r\nrefore Kundalini is called Shakti sadhana or Mother Kundalini.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. In=\r\n the light of the above points, it can be fairly understood why the Gita pu=\r\nts its trust on Purushottama, while the Tantras - whose spiritual prism was=\r\n Kundalini centric - puts the focus on Adya Shakti.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. In this age w=\r\nhen Guurus are rare, genuine paramparas are rarer still, and capable sadhak=\r\ns are negligible, a Kundalini centric view of sadhana can be detrimental fo=\r\nr most people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9. Of course, these are my view-point as I see it. Fe=\r\nel free to disagree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNorm=\r\nal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span\n class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span=\r\n class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family=\r\n:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE =\r\nmAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yui=\r\n_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yui_3_7_2_27_1353650678498_67&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:=\r\n10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times=\r\n New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; font-=\r\nsize: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, times, =\r\nserif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;=\r\n&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Na=\r\nrasimha P.V.R.

At the same time, there are no =\r\nrays without Sun. Sun and rays go together. Whether they are one or differe=\r\nnt is a matter of perspective and semantics.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I may also give a different analogy. A suppressed spring has pot=\r\nential energy. When it is released, some potential energy is\n *converted* i=\r\nnto kinetic energy. But potential energy and kinetic energy are not really =\r\ntwo different things. They are two aspects of the same and converted from o=\r\nne to another. Similarly, Purusha is the potential energy and Shakti is the=\r\n kinetic energy.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Purushottama is like the cumulative [spiritua=\r\nl] potential energy of the cosmos that is about to go through the big bang.=\r\n Adya shakti is like the cumulative [spiritual] kinetic energy of the cosmo=\r\ns after the big bang. Purushottama and Adya Shakti are not really different=\r\n and two aspects of the same. When something needs to be done in the cosmos=\r\n, Purushottama projects himself as his Shakti and things happen.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Question 2:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This is a great que=\r\nstion and I never thought of it before. Thanks for asking and making me thi=\r\nnk. Please note that I too do not have &quot;eyes of gyana&quot;\n and just speculatin=\r\ng based on my intuition and sharing my thoughts unfiltered. If it makes no =\r\nsense, please feel free to ignore. &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;The supreme kinetic energy (feminine element) of cosmos is of three types=\r\n - one that causes objectification in consciousness, one that sustains obje=\r\nctification in consciousness and one that ends objectification in conscious=\r\nness. These three aspects are represented by Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Maha=\r\nsaraswati, the deities of the 3 charitras of Saptashati or Chandipath or De=\r\nvi Mahatmyam.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Various higher beings emanate from these three b=\r\nasic types of higher kinetic energy to aid in the respective high level pro=\r\ncesses. Please bear in mind that different male deities represents differen=\r\nt types of potential energy of consciousness, playing specific roles based =\r\non the combination of gunas, and different\n female deities represent differ=\r\nent types of kinetic energy within consciousness, again playing specific ro=\r\nles based on the combination of gunas. It is all play of energies in the en=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;To cause objectification in con=\r\nsciousness, the kinetic energy of consciousness needs to be stirred and raj=\r\nas-ified and the potential energy of consciousness needs to be withdrawn/re=\r\nduced, stopped and tamas-ified. These two energies are represented by Saras=\r\nwati and Rudra.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;To sustain objectification already present in =\r\nconsciousness, the kinetic energy of consciousness needs to be in a stable =\r\nand clear equilibrium and sattv-ified and the potential energy of conscious=\r\nness needs to be stirred and rajas-ified. These two energies are represente=\r\nd by Lakshmi and Brahma.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;To end objectification already presen=\r\nt in consciousness, the kinetic\n energy of consciousness needs to be withdr=\r\nawn/reduced, stopped and tamas-ified and the potential energy of consciousn=\r\ness needs to be in a stable and clear equilibrium and sattv-ified. These tw=\r\no energies are represented by Gouri and Vishnu.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;BTW, Narayana or Purushottama is the absolute potential energ=\r\ny of cosmos. The initial Mahalakshmi is the projection of that potential en=\r\nergy as kinetic energy. Don&#39;t worry too much about the names. She is not th=\r\ne same as Mahalakshmi of the 3 Mahadevis just because of the name. She coul=\r\nd as well have been called Aadyaa Shakti or Naaraayani. To remove confusion=\r\n, we may call her Aadyaadi Mahalakshmi (in the terminology of Lakshmi Hrida=\r\nyam from &quot;Atharva Rahasyam&quot;, which is one of my favorite prayers). Aadyaadi=\r\n Mahalakshmi personifies the entire kinetic energy of\n cosmos.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This reminds me of an incident. One person was=\r\n doing daily Chandi homam and invoking Mahalakshmi as the main deity. He wa=\r\ns using the dhyana shloka for Mahalakshmi from &quot;Vaikritika Rahasyam&quot; (shvet=\r\nAnanA nIlabhujA sushveta stana maNDalA...). He later switched to a differen=\r\nt dhyana shloka - the one for Adyadi Mahalakshmi from whom Mahakali, Mahala=\r\nkshmi and Mahasaraswati came - from &quot;Pradhanika Rahasyam&quot; (sarvasyAdyA mahA=\r\nlakShmIH trigunA parameshvarI...), thinking that it was superior.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;His guru told him after a few months, &quot;whatever dhyana shloka you use, =\r\nknow its meaning and physically imagine someone in that form&quot;. He came and =\r\nasked me for the meaning. I discouraged him, &quot;I don&#39;t think you really want=\r\n to know the meaning and physically imagine someone in that form&quot;. When he =\r\ninsisted, I told him the\n meaning.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The verses describe Mahalak=\r\nshmi who is the &quot;First among all&quot; (sarvasya AdyA) and having all 3 gunas. S=\r\nhe is described as holding in her hands a liquor bowl, snake, male genital,=\r\n female genital, king&#39;s head etc. Of course, if one starts imagining such a=\r\n form, it may distract one&#39;s mind based on one&#39;s conditioning!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The thing here is that these symbols represent=\r\n some subtle things. The &quot;Initial Kinetic Energy&quot; from which whole creation=\r\n came about obviously works by intoxicating parts of consciousness with not=\r\nions (liquor bowl), giving rise to notions of gender and identity (male and=\r\n female genitals), self-awareness/Kundalini (snake), egosense (king&#39;s head)=\r\n etc. When one is dealing with such Initial or high level energies, concept=\r\ns become subtle/abstract. If one wants an explicit outer form, it is better=\r\n to imagine\n slightly lower level manifestations with specific gunas and pu=\r\nrposes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let me say it in different words. The Kinetic energy o=\r\nf Purushottama is beyond our thoughts, perception and imagination. Various =\r\ndescriptions and imagery in various scriptures are very likely to be misund=\r\nerstood by us based on our conditioning. It&#39;s just too hi-fi for foolish an=\r\nd egoistic ignoramuses of Kali yuga, like us.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On Mon, Oc=\r\nt 1, 2012 at 5:06 PM, &lt;deleted&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I had two questions on which I wanted you views.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;1=\r\n - In the Gita we find a philosophy which focuses on Purushottama&nbsp; as =\r\nthe ultimate. In the Tantras we find the focus on Divine Mother as ultimate=\r\n. Are these\n two - Adya Shakti and\n Purushottama - the same Being, but refe=\r\nrred to in different terms? And why this sudden difference in the expressio=\r\nn found?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;2 - This question is more complex. I read and re-read=\r\n the Pradhanika Rahasya of the Sri Chandi. I could not understand it to my =\r\nheart&#39;s satisfaction, I mean I understood what was being said but always ha=\r\nd the feeling that here is description of reality far deeper than what mean=\r\ning I can derive from the surface. Why did Makalakshami - the Supreme Mothe=\r\nr - come first among&nbsp; Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati. Further=\r\n, from Mahakali comes out Shiva and Saraswati, from Mahalakshmi comes Brahm=\r\na and Lakshmi and from Mahasaraswati comes Vishnu and Parvati!
