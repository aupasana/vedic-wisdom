Spirituality is related too, as spiritual sadhana improves free will and =\r\nmakes one freer to do the right things.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some karmas are &quot;dridha&quot; (fir=\r\nm or mandatory) and their results MUST be experienced, no matter what. Thro=\r\nat cancer of Ramakrishna and skin cancer of Ramana Maharshi are examples. H=\r\nowever, many karmas are not dridha and are flexible/optional. Their results=\r\n can be avoided by the application of free will.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A regular person&#39;s f=\r\nree will is not strong enough to bend the curve of habit resulting from pre=\r\nvious actions and change the course. One goes with the flow, keeps on accum=\r\nulating newer karmas and reaping the good and bad fruits. One remains a sla=\r\nve of bad habits and those habits get reinforced further and further with t=\r\nime.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One making spiritual progress develops stronger free will. One s=\r\ntarts to show better judgment and stronger will power and does the right th=\r\nings despite strong obstcles. Thus, one avoids payback for a lot of undesir=\r\nable karmas that are not dridha. One also stops accumulating too many new u=\r\nndesirable karmas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Destiny is the sum total=\r\n of karmas that one&#39;s free will performed in the past (including previous l=\r\nives). Astrology captures one&#39;s destiny. Destiny restrains one&#39;s free will =\r\nand tries to compel free will to act in some patterns, but free will need n=\r\not obey. One always has many options, though *tends to* select the option t=\r\nhat is favored by destiny. But one *can* select another option. Strengtheni=\r\nng judgment, wisdom and breaking from bad haits is what is needed. Spiritua=\r\nl practices do help in that process.\n&gt;  \n&gt; An astrologer focuses on destiny=\r\n, but a spiritualist may focus on free will. Destiny is water under the bri=\r\ndge, while free will is the new stream that can flow in many ways. If some =\r\nyogis downplayed astrology and emphasized free will, it is not without reas=\r\non. Swami Vivekananda once famously said astrology is for the weak-minded p=\r\neople and emphasized free will.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ahamkaara=\r\n makes decisions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Buddhi makes decisions, controlled by ahamkaara and=\r\n aided by chitta. Ahamkara, chitta and buddhi work closely. In computer tec=\r\nhnology terms, look at ahamkaara as a CPU, chitta as DRAM that stores all d=\r\nata and buddhi as an ALU or a logic co-processor that runs logical algrithm=\r\ns. Manas is an I/O controller. The five jnanendriyas are input channels, th=\r\ne five karmendriyas are output channels; and, the five praanas are the elec=\r\ntricity flowing in the computer. When the electricity stops flowing, CPU wo=\r\nrks in a minimal mode based on an internal battery until electricity is tur=\r\nned on again and some important data in DRAM remains and some is lost by th=\r\ne time electricity is turned on again. Similarly, some experiences from pas=\r\nt lives remain in chitta as subconscious memories that influence our thinki=\r\nng in future lives, but many specific memories are lost.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt;  \n&gt; When buddhi makes decisions, it may have to process many prev=\r\nious memories that may be leading it in different directions. Some memories=\r\n may be conscious memories of things from this life. Some memories may be s=\r\nubconscious memories of things from past lives.\n&gt;  \n&gt; For example, one&#39;s gu=\r\nru may have told one &quot;never keep anything in mind; forgive and forget&quot; in a=\r\n previous life and one may have lived whole life following it. That ideal m=\r\nay be a sub-conscious memory influencing thinking now. If someone did terri=\r\nble things to one in this life, that may be a conscious memory now. When on=\r\ne is in a position to take revenge, there may be a clash between the two me=\r\nmories.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As another example, one may have spent a whole life trying to=\r\n become a millionnaire and failed. That desire may be a sub-conscious memor=\r\ny influencing thinking now. If one may be under the influence of a spiritua=\r\nl teacher and living a simple life of contentment now. But the sub-consciou=\r\ns memory may be clashing now and then with the ideals taught by guru in thi=\r\ns life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Memories accumulated and retained in chitta over lives may be=\r\n guiding one in conflicting directions. A subjective algorithm of weighted =\r\njudgment runs in buddhi. The weights are constantly adjusted based on the h=\r\nistory of how information is stored in or retrieved from chitta. Free will =\r\nis essentially the subjective element of buddhi, that controls this algorit=\r\nhm of weighted judgment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; By engaging in spiritual practices, by readi=\r\nng scriptures and spiritual teachings of great masters and by contemplating=\r\n, we store some new useful information in chitta, slowly affect how informa=\r\ntion is stored to or retrieved from chitta, and modify the relative weights=\r\n of various information in chitta. When the free will is strong, it is poss=\r\nible to overcome latent tendencies by storing new information in chitta and=\r\n marking it as high priority.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Everybody in =\r\nthe spiritual path knows what are good tendencies and what are not. Feeling=\r\n lust or desire when one sees a beautiful person or object is bad. Feeling =\r\nanger when someone says bad things about one is bad. Feeling proud about wh=\r\nat one did or has is bad. Hanging on to emotions is bad. And so on. Everybo=\r\ndy knows these things. But knowing is not enough and one needs to act on th=\r\nat knowledge! The problem is that these things are stored in chitta with a =\r\nlow weight and there are overriding memories stored chitta with much strong=\r\n weights. So it is difficult or even impossible for the subjective portion =\r\nof one&#39;s buddhi to make them win in the final decision-making process.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Rising above firm latent tendencies is possible only by continuing to exe=\r\nrt whatever little free will one has over and over again. Slowly, free will=\r\n becomes stronger and stronger and latent tendencies become weaker and weak=\r\ner. Once one breaks through the barriers, progress is accelerated.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Pr=\r\nactice and persistence have no substitutes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha=\r\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality=\r\n writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- Kishore Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namast=\r\ne Narasimha & Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Assuming perfect astrological predictions,=\r\n one&#39;s life should be read\n&gt; &gt; from the chart almost like a biography with =\r\nno elaborate details in it.\n&gt; &gt; If this is correct and the backdrop is set =\r\nfor a person, how\n&gt; &gt; does spirituality\n&gt; &gt; effect one&#39;s life?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Her=\r\ne is a line of thought based on this mail:\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom/message/2733\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A person&#39;s birth time is based on that=\r\n person&#39;s chitta baggage.\n&gt; &gt; Astrology gives hints on person&#39;s chitta to t=\r\nell the person&#39;s tendencies\n&gt; &gt; to react in certain conditions also a path =\r\nwith a set of life events like\n&gt; &gt; birth, graduation, marriage, children, h=\r\nappy and sad occassions etc..\n&gt; &gt; As every step towards next event life is =\r\na natural result of decisions\n&gt; &gt; made during previous steps, the decisions=\r\n to chose a path are heavily\n&gt; &gt; influenced by chitta.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ahamkaara m=\r\nakes decisions.
