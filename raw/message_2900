Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1] Rahu homam manual will be created in time. Homam with the veda mantra \n&gt; &gt; &quot;kayaanschitra&quot; was suggested by Maharshi Parasara for relief from problems \n&gt; &gt; with Rahu. Some people also use Vyaasa&#39;s pouraanika mantra &quot;ardha kaayam&quot;. I \n&gt; &gt; will try to create Rahu and Ketu homam manuals soon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2] Apart from doing Rahu homam or japam of Rahu mantra, one can pray to \n&gt; &gt; Chandi or Durga. The 700 verses known as &quot;Devi Maahaatmyam&quot; (glory of the \n&gt; &gt; goddess) or &quot;Durga saptashati&quot; (Durga&#39;s 700) or &quot;Chandipath&quot; (chanting of \n&gt; &gt; Chandi) are ideal. Those who are not fluent in Sanskrit and not willing to \n&gt; &gt; try at all can try Durga/Chandi saptashloki, which is a collection of 7 \n&gt; &gt; representative verses out of those 700.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is possible to do a simple homam by using the Chandi homam manual on the \n&gt; &gt; website below and use just the saptashloki (7 verse) for pradhaana homam. \n&gt; &gt; Just invoke the goddess in fire, offer 5 upachaaras, offer one aahuti to her \n&gt; &gt; parivaara devatas and then keep offering these 7 verses over and over, as \n&gt; &gt; many times as you can.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One can also pray to Lord Venkaeswara or Balaji for relief from Rahu \n&gt; &gt; problems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;rakesh.behal&quot; &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 14, 2009 4:31 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] query\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear guru ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   charan saparsh\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1] Pls design homa for rahu\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2] pls also suggest which sadhna are best to control rahu and avoid its \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bad effects\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rakesh\n\n\n"}}
