Sant Tulsidas&#39;s=A0 broader dharm=\r\na may have been realizing Rama, but as a husband, his dharma should have be=\r\nen to keep his wife happy. So ideally, I don&#39;t think we can ever full perfo=\r\nrm every dharma that is expected of us. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I believe the reason this =\r\nidea of Dharma was existent in ancient times, was mostly because nature has=\r\n created various kinds of people, each with varying tendencies. This idea o=\r\nf Dharma was sort of approxiamtion, or the best way to tell men that we are=\r\n all different and yet we are not incorrect in anyway. This is much better =\r\nthan the new ages philosophies which outright deny reality and claim everyt=\r\nhing and everyone is born equal.

Krishna clearly says in \n&gt; &gt; Bhag=\r\navad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nelse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Following the path of dharma basically means engag=\r\ning in the right \n&gt; &gt; action/duty. Right action varies from person to perso=\r\nn, from time to time \n&gt; &gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on what =\r\nnature expects from you, \n&gt; &gt; which in turn is based on who you have been i=\r\nn the past, what actions you \n&gt; &gt; did in the past while identifying with th=\r\ne action, who you affected in the \n&gt; &gt; past (and how) with the actions that=\r\n you identified with, what debts you \n&gt; &gt; created in the process, and what =\r\nmental tendencies you accumulated until \n&gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If, based on one=\r\n&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \n&gt; &gt; to kill e=\r\nvil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \n&gt; &gt; tend=\r\nencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based=\r\n on one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to=\r\n make a lot of \n&gt; &gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The dha=\r\nrma of a being may change from one life to another.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the time of=\r\n Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, \n&gt; &gt; elders and=\r\n relatives. The time then was such that there was too much weight \n&gt; &gt; on e=\r\narth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great w=\r\narrior, \n&gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply lo=\r\nved and \n&gt; &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill=\r\n them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as =\r\none of \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Ar=\r\njuna in a \n&gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was di=\r\nfferent in this \n&gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce material l=\r\nife despite his \n&gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a =\r\nmonk and inspire \n&gt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detach=\r\nment and service to \n&gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, as=\r\n per what Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place ma=\r\ny be something else.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharm=\r\na?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow you=\r\nr own dharma \n&gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. T=\r\nhough the concept \n&gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a lo=\r\nng time, the concept of \n&gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki wa=\r\ns a shudra who lived by \n&gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maha=\r\nrshi later. Vishwamitra was a \n&gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became=\r\n a brahmana and and a maharshi \n&gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s apti=\r\ntude. One starts off with the varna \n&gt; &gt; of father, because that is what on=\r\ne is exposed to in childhood. As one \n&gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s =\r\nown varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of K=\r\nrishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \n&gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is =\r\nwrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \n&gt; &gt; the world. Each perso=\r\nn has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very=\r\n very difficult. If one is pure \n&gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. =\r\nIn fact, all of us have a part of our \n&gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dhar=\r\nma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \n&gt; &gt; noise from other parts of our =\r\nminds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n&gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We shou=\r\nld make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and \n&gt; &gt; d=\r\necide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, but doing \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; More than following dharm=\r\na, what is of utmost importance is to engage in \n&gt; &gt; actions without identi=\r\nfication. *That* alone ensures that we are not \n&gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas=\r\n, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build \n&gt; &gt; too much attachmen=\r\nt to what we are doing. We should engage in the best \n&gt; &gt; possible actions =\r\n(based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given \n&gt; &gt; situation =\r\nis), with as little attachment and self-identification with the \n&gt; &gt; action=\r\n as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nto god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slo=\r\nwly. \n&gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharm=\r\na clearer. \n&gt; &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable =\r\nus to see our \n&gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karma=\r\ns. This is not easy, \n&gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action wi=\r\nth \n&gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition a=\r\nre the inputs. \n&gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and l=\r\nearned men. One can \n&gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is =\r\ngiven to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual mast=\r\ner, one can take the words of \n&gt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and=\r\n follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dhar=\r\nma was and thought killing gurus \n&gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had =\r\na guru in Krishna who clarified his \n&gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami V=\r\nivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n&gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the w=\r\norld and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=\r\n cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n&gt; &gt; world and do the=\r\n work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and do=\r\nes not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects f=\r\nrom one can err in the judgment of what \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru=\r\n is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such =\r\na guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline=\r\n a set of principles and \n&gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma change=\r\ns from person to person, from \n&gt; &gt; time to time and from place to place. Al=\r\nso, there are no thumbrules to find \n&gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one=\r\n can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal=\r\n purity.

Or more impo=\r\nrtant vs&nbsp;less important dharma? Swadharma should be situational. Sant =\r\nTulsidas&#39;s&nbsp; broader dharma may have been realizing Rama, but as a husb=\r\nand, his dharma should have been to keep his wife happy. So ideally, I don&#39;=\r\nt think we can ever full perform every dharma that is expected of us. &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I believe the reason this idea of Dharma was existent in=\r\n ancient times, was mostly because nature has created various kinds of peop=\r\nle, each with varying tendencies. This idea of Dharma was sort of approxiam=\r\ntion, or the best way to tell men that we are all different and yet we are =\r\nnot incorrect in anyway. This is much better than\n the new ages philosophie=\r\ns which outright deny reality and claim everything and everyone is born equ=\r\nal. It is not so.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The word religion is a 13 century =\r\ninvention and, etymologically, and inherently competitive in nature. Unlike=\r\n Dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, as Narasimhaji&#39; s mail shows correctl=\r\ny, following Dharma is no gaurantee of anything, least of all Moksha. It ju=\r\nst continues the cycle. But what is the big deal in continuinng the cycle, =\r\nit would any way continue which ever path one choses, dharma or adharma. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A much better way of conduction life, I feel, is makn=\r\nig a mental note of Karma. To know teh simple truth that that which goes ou=\r\nt will come back to you and that, if you had not been bad at some point, no=\r\nthing bad will ever come to you. For an otherwise ordinary person, followin=\r\ng a life based on and being on the right side of&nbsp;karma, is much easier=\r\n and profitable&nbsp; than trying to find\n that elusive dharma which anyway=\r\n won&#39;t help one in the long run.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Just my feeling on =\r\nthe subject.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Much better option&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of cons=\r\nciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Tue, 7/4/09, N=\r\narasimha P.V.R.

Some people he deeply loved and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th =\r\ncentury as one of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Y=\r\nogananda had been Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ram=\r\nakrishna) , his dharma was different in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; new time and pla=\r\nce. He was born to renounce material life despite his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; aristoc=\r\nratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and\n inspire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service t=\r\no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what=\r\n Ramakrishna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place ma=\r\ny be something else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dh=\r\narma?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s wor=\r\nds saying &quot;follow your own dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dhar=\r\nma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of caste (var=\r\nna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwa=\r\nmitra was a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; kshatrita and a\n powerful king. He became a brahm=\r\nana and and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s apt=\r\nitude. One starts off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of father, because that =\r\nis what one is exposed to in childhood. As one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; develops in li=\r\nfe, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know=\r\n your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are no=\r\nt just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the world. Each person has individual dha=\r\nrma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very v=\r\nery difficult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s d=\r\nharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind that tells =\r\nus what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; noise=\r\n from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; confused.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; We should make the best judgm=\r\nent combining discrimination and intuition and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; decide what is=\r\n our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, but doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne best we can is all that we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; More than f=\r\nollowing dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should n=\r\not build &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should =\r\nengage in the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgme=\r\nnt on what our dharma in the given &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; situation is), with as lit=\r\ntle attachment and self-identification with the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; action as pos=\r\nsible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; work&quot; etc.\n Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication=\r\n through &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify =\r\nour consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will w=\r\nork sharper and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There is a positive =\r\nfeedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma c=\r\nlearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in =\r\naction with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; little attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s inte=\r\nllect and intuition are the inputs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Another external input is=\r\n the words of\n scriptures and learned men. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; derive one=\r\n&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words=\r\n of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincer=\r\nely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dha=\r\nrma was and thought killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharm=\r\na, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma. When Na=\r\nrendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nand wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay =\r\nin the material &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know=\r\n who one is, what one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects fro=\r\nm one\n can err in the judgment of what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If on=\r\ne&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s =\r\ninner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybo=\r\ndy) cannot outline a set of principles and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; declare that as th=\r\ne dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time=\r\n to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understandin=\r\ng of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing var=\r\nious kinds of spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and e=\r\nngaging in actions without much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly pu=\r\nrify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n individ=\r\nual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.v=\r\nedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.or=\r\ng/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ved=\r\nicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/=\r\n tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;da=\r\nhiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wis=\r\ndom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8=\r\n:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; i just finished my =\r\nAghora series&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vima=\r\nlanda says path of dharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Can somebody s=\r\nhare views on that and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; towards it&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jitender&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From Chandig=\r\narh to Chennai - find friends all over India.
