Bhalo na ki?\n\nWelcome to God through Homa(m). My hearty co=\r\nngratulations for Homam, Varanasi trip, Financial success, spiritual awaken=\r\ning of parents and guidance of a friend as good as Rajarashi. I read your q=\r\nuite an emotional message just as i finished my Ganapati Homam. thought of =\r\nwriting few things as i remembered my situation some One and Half year back=\r\n.\n\nI wrote this line in an email to my Guru:\n&quot;I am caught up in a dilemma f=\r\nor starting Homa. The reasons seem to be formidable as described below....&quot;=\r\n\n\nI did start The Homam shortly after i wrote the above message. The first =\r\nHomam was on the First day of Navaratri of 2008.\n\nWhat i wish to emphasize =\r\nis that, I also went through several miraculous events. I distinctly rememb=\r\ner that once i wondered as to even one Homam per Month is also possible by =\r\nme? and if you ask any Sadhaka, He or she will have something to share in t=\r\nhis regard (Not only Homam but for any Sadhana done for God. Looking back n=\r\now i have started realizing that it is all DONE - by some power which is be=\r\nhind the scene.\nI sometime feel that My Guru&#39;s will is working in backgroun=\r\nd.\n\n***\nFor the questions you asked at the end of your message, i would say=\r\n that why worry if Monetary problems are getting solved fast and why worry =\r\nif they are Not. However i would say that MahaGanapati is a fantastic God. =\r\nHE&#39;ll not allow you or anybody to suffer on the contrary HE will ease the b=\r\nurden of mundane trouble so that one performs the Saadhana quite comfortabl=\r\ny. this is my experience. HE saves from many potential troubles. I suggest =\r\nnot to worry and just go ahead with Homam on DAILY Basis and also read Chan=\r\ndi Paath daily. Time is running out...Abhi nahi karega to saalaa Kabhi kare=\r\nga humlog. Pata nahi kab ye Diye ka tel khatm ho jaye?\n\nAnd i would dare to=\r\n share one more phrase which i like very much and that is &quot;Aisi ki Taisi&quot;. =\r\nHave this attitude when you are cornered, challenged by hurdles that come i=\r\nn your way of spiritual saadhana or when you feel very low...\n\nStart relyin=\r\ng on Mother, the Jagadamba...she will not let you down...\n\nDurga Bhagavati =\r\nBhadra, Yayedam Dharyate Jagat\n\nYour respected or otherwise senior :)\n\nUtpa=\r\nl\nPS: Sorry for the lecture\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, sayantan =\r\nbose &lt;sayantan.bose@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranam Guruji,\n&gt; and to all my seniors,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; i just want to share few of my experiences that i am undergoing and w=\r\nish to share it with all of my respected fellow friends in here.. i with th=\r\nree other friends of mine have visited Venaras (kashi) during the last week=\r\n of January 2010. we visited the Manikarnika shamshan and all possible temp=\r\nles that we had planned to visit.. just before going there i had a set fram=\r\ne of mind=A0 that when i will come back to home .. in Kolkata (Calcutta) i&#39;=\r\nll be starting Maha Ganapati=A0 homam.. atleast in the weekends if not .. r=\r\negularly as i was having a very bad situation both financially and in the h=\r\nome front as well .. i brought a Baneshwar from there as well. while coming=\r\n back to home i was severely ill and was having Fever with stomach upset as=\r\n well... i didnt bother much about my health as i had a feeling may be its =\r\ncoz of the past bad karmas i am facing it ..since i have been lucky enough =\r\nin getting guidance from two of Manish ji&#39;s direct disciples.. my friend wh=\r\no\n&gt;  have been doing Ganapati homam for quite a long time and now he is doi=\r\nng Chandi homam.. showed me how to do it ,,and there again i met another fr=\r\niend of mine who is regular in doing Chandi homams who inspired me to start=\r\n as well... i was very tensed to start off as i didnt had even that much of=\r\n money to start off regularly.. and there again i was a bit tensed about ho=\r\nw my parents would react to the things like .. i am turning out to be a veg=\r\n and will be doing homams on a regular basis.. where as my income was nil a=\r\nt that time .. !!\n&gt; \n&gt; now comes the suprises as follows:-\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Manish j=\r\ni=A0 called up my friend who was staying in my home ,who was staying in my =\r\nhome .. after we had returned .. from Venaras..\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) I was so happy and =\r\nexcited about the fact that without even knowing .. how .. i just took the =\r\ndecision .. that i am going to start ..my Homams DAILY.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) To my=A0 ve=\r\nry surprise.. my parents did not objected, to my decision of doing Homams o=\r\nn a regular basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The very 1st day i did my homam.. i got a call f=\r\nor regular work.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) By profession i am an Actor / Anchor .. so i dont =\r\nhave any permanent salaried job..it implies of a inconsistent income .. now=\r\n .. i get calls for a lot works regularly .. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6) My mom started to rec=\r\nite Chandi ..path regularly and the biggest of all suprises.. my Dad who ne=\r\nver was so much into spirituality is starting Saptashloki Chandi path .,,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 7) In total.. i got very fast results ..of my homams..and was lucky and=\r\n blessed enough to help two others to start Ganapati homams regularly ..all=\r\n the problems that i have been facing for a long time .. does not exists ri=\r\nght now .. at all... \n&gt; \n&gt; Right now .. i am preparing . for Chandi homam..=\r\n and trying to my best of possibilities.. to read the 13 chapters of Chandi=\r\n fluently ..\n&gt; \n&gt; now i have a question to my respected seniors...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) =\r\ni am happy that my monetary problem .. is solving very fast .. but in no wa=\r\ny i was, nor am i now .. attached to the mundane.. and earthly materialisti=\r\nc desires...so i am a bit confused.. that getting earthly benefits ..withou=\r\nt even asking for it.. in the homam.. hope is not a way or a procedure.. to=\r\n deviate me .. from.. the sadhana.. i mean getting very fast results from .=\r\n. the homam.. is it a way God is testing me ????\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) plz do correct me =\r\n,.., if at any place .. i am wrong and incorrect ,., \n&gt; \n&gt; i beg of mercy .=\r\n. if i have said anything wrong .. i dont know much . and just a beginner..=\r\n its just my devotion and faith are all that i have.. while doing my homams=\r\n..and i am sure .. i do a plenty of mistakes in my steps.. while doing the =\r\nhomam..but i am thankful that God has been merciful enough to forgive me an=\r\nd bless...i am enjoying my state of bliss..and after a very long search .. =\r\ni think this is=A0 the right way meant for ..me .. my life has changed..and=\r\n i hope it will be the same or even more.. for the new friends who are yet =\r\nto come.. i did three homams at a stretch today for the 1st time and i am h=\r\nappy for that fact very much ,, \n&gt; Despite of the factor. that i havent bee=\r\nn lucky enough . to meet or even to interact with =A0 Manish ji ..=A0 i thi=\r\nnk of him as my Guru .. and i feel blessed at all times..\n&gt; and a special t=\r\nhanks to Rajarshi da and Arnab ,, \n&gt;
