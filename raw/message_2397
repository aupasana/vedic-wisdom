It is the Lord&#39;s world. It is beyond\nboth good and evil, perfect in itself. His will is going on, showing all\nthese different pictures; and it will go on without beginning and without\nend. It is a great gymnasium in which you and I, and millions of souls must\ncome and get exercises, and make ourselves strong and perfect. This is what\nit is for.\n\nNot that God could not make a perfect universe; not that He could not help\nthe misery of the world. You remember the story of the young lady and the\nclergyman, who were both looking at the moon through the telescope, and\nfound the moon spots. And the clergyman said, &quot;I am sure they are the spires\nof some churches.&quot; &quot;Nonsense,&quot; said the young lady, &quot;I am sure they are the\nyoung lovers kissing each other.&quot; So we are doing with this world. When we\nare inside, we think we are seeing the inside. According to the plane of\nexistence in which we are, we see the universe. Fire in the kitchen is\nneither good nor bad. When it cooks a meal for you, you bless the fire, and\nsay, &quot;How good it is!&quot; And when it burns your finger, you say, &quot;What a\nnuisance it is!&quot; It would be equally correct and logical to say: This\nuniverse is neither good nor evil. The world is the world, and will be\nalways so. If we open ourselves to it in such a manner that the action of\nthe world is beneficial to us, we call it good.\n\nWhat again is the goal of mankind? Is it happiness, sensuous pleasure? They\nused to say in the olden time that in heaven they will play on trumpets and\nlive round a throne; in modern time I find that they think this ideal is\nvery weak, and they have improved upon it and say that they will have\nmarriages and all these things there. If there is any improvement in these\ntwo things, the second is an improvement for the worse. All these various\ntheories of heaven that are being put forward show weakness in the mind. And\nthat weakness is here: First, they think that sense happiness is the goal of\nlife. Secondly they cannot conceive of anything that is beyond the five\nsenses.\n\nNow comes the question: Can religion really do anything? It can.\n\nBabies think that the happiness of the senses is the highest thing they can\nhave. Most of you know that there is a keener enjoyment in man in the\nintellect than in the senses. No one of you can feel the same pleasure in\neating as a dog does. You can mark that. Where does the pleasure come from\nin man? Not that whole-souled enjoyment of eating that the pig or the dog\nhas. See how the pig eats. It is unconscious of the universe while it is\neating; its whole soul is bound up in the food. It may be killed but it does\nnot care when it has food. Think of the intense enjoyment that the pig has!\nNo man has that. Where is it gone? Man has changed it into intellectual\nenjoyment. The pig cannot enjoy religious lectures. That is one step higher\nand keener yet than intellectual pleasures, and that is the spiritual plane,\nspiritual enjoyment of things divine, soaring beyond reason and intellect.\nTo procure that we shall have to lose all these sense-enjoyments. This is\nthe highest utility. Utility is what I enjoy, and what everyone enjoys, and\nwe run for that.\n\nWe find that man enjoys his intellect much more than an animal enjoys his\nsenses, and we see that man enjoys his spiritual nature even more than his\nrational nature. So the highest wisdom must be this spiritual knowledge. With\nthis knowledge will come bliss. All these things of this world are but the\nshadows, the manifestations in the third or fourth degree of the real\nKnowledge and Bliss.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_4/Lectures_and_Discourses/The_Claims_of_Religion\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--001636025e7dfe2bf604726a2b34\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family=\r\n:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75e=\r\nm;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;THE C=\r\nLAIMS OF RELIGION (Sunday, 5th January)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-styl=\r\ne:italic&quot;&gt;Volume 4, Lectures and Discourses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This world is nei=\r\nther good nor evil.
