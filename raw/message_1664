Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I can suggest the following bare mini=\r\nmum homam procedure to those who have a problem with Sanskrit and find the =\r\nhomam manuals daunting. This is the absolute minimum one can do. If done si=\r\nncerely everyday for 20 min or more, even this procedure can have a very go=\r\nod impact on one&#39;s spiritual pursuit.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mater=\r\nials needed: Homa kundam, wooden/copper/silver spoon/ladle, melted ghee and=\r\n pieces of dried coconut (or wood or dried cowdung cakes).\n&gt;  \n&gt; (0) Sit fa=\r\ncing east and place homa kundam in front of you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) Place some dried=\r\n coconut pieces or wood or dried cowdung cake pieces in homa kundam (fire p=\r\nit).\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) Light a camphor and place it in the homa kundam while saying=\r\n &quot;om bhuurbhuvassuvarom&quot; and make sure that the pieces placed in homa kunda=\r\nm catch fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (3) Pour ghee drops with a wooden/copper/silver spoon/l=\r\nadle in the fire while saying the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; om prajaapataye svaahaa\n=\r\n&gt; om indraaya svaahaa\n&gt; om agnaye svaahaa\n&gt; om somaaya svaahaa\n&gt; om bhuurbh=\r\nuvassuvaH svaahaa\n&gt;  \n&gt; (4) Thinking of Ganesha in your mind, pour ghee dro=\r\nps in fire while saying the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; om gam gaNapataye namaH svaaha=\r\na\n&gt; om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\n&gt; om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\n&gt; om =\r\ngam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\n&gt;  \n&gt; (5) Pick any deity and any mantra. Think=\r\ning of the deity of the mantra, pour ghee drops (or any other valid offerin=\r\ng - see manual) while saying the mantra. Just add svaahaa at the end of the=\r\n mantra. If the mantra already has a svaahaa at the end, there is no need t=\r\no add one more svaahaa.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is also fine to pick a collection of verse=\r\ns (e.g. Vishnu sahasra naama stotram, Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama stotram=\r\n, Lalita sahasra naama stotram, Aditya hridayam, Subrahmanyashtakam etc). A=\r\nt the end of each verse, add svaahaa and make an offering in fire. When the=\r\n stotram ends, you can go back to the beginning and repeat.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do this f=\r\nor as much time as you want to. But make sure that you do this step for atl=\r\neast 10-15 minutes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (6) When you are done, pour ghee drops in fire wh=\r\nile saying the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; om bhuuH svaahaa\n&gt; om bhuvaH svaahaa\n&gt; om s=\r\nuvaH svaahaa\n&gt; om bhuurbhuvassuvaH svaahaa\n&gt; om shrii viShNave svaahaa\n&gt; om=\r\n namo rudraaya pashupataye svaahaa\n&gt;  \n&gt; (7) Try to surrender your mind as =\r\ncompletely to god as you can. Sit absolutely still and meditate for a few m=\r\ninutes with any mantra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Done!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short =\r\nHomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicas=\r\ntro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.o=\r\nrg\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
