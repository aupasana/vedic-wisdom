So it becomes His duty to protect the earth, His devotees or the other Gods against the various demonic forces. He has to take several avataras depending on what the situation is and how to vanquish the demonic forces (that also depends on what boons those Rakshasas had obtained from other deities).\n\nLord Shiva is the final truth. He annihilates the Universe and assimilates everything unto Himself. He does not need to come in any avataras to vanquish any demonic forces. Most creatures, even Rakshasas, worship Lord Shiva and no one dares to go against Him, except for some creatures like Bhasmasura, Tripurasura, etc. In those cases, Lord Shiva comes as Himself to vanquish those Rakshasas.\n\nThis is my understanding.\n\nRegards,\nDr. Narasimhaswamy Banavara\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Vijaya Kumara Lakshmi Narayana Rao Pingali &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, May 21, 2009 6:55:07 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Why only avatara of Vishnu\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not an authoirty on this subject, but dwelling on to the topic nevertheless.\n\nPuranas do talk about avataras of Shiva as well.
