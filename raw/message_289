Anyone who has ever tried even a minutest fraction of \nsadhana no=\r\nt to gain a better happy life but to get that one small \nfraction of an inc=\r\nh closer to God will know the millions of troubles \nand frustation that com=\r\ne in the path. It was on one such moment when \nI came across this writing a=\r\nnd felt humbled. Ganapati Muni was known \nas a siddha who had done terrific=\r\n, i repeat terrific amount of \npenances, even before he met Sri Ramana Maha=\r\nrishi. If such a man \ncould be troubled by doubts and frustation, what to s=\r\npeak of us \nordinary men whos minds are overcrowded with multiple weaknesse=\r\nss. \nAlso the followinf conversation shows how a real understanding of \nthe=\r\n shastra is possible ONLY for a man who is that spiritually \nelevated. Like=\r\n Lahiri Mahasaya used to say to his disciples, only a \ntrue yogi will under=\r\nstand the spriptures. Others will only get a \nincomplete surface view of th=\r\nings. And based on our incomplete \ninefficient understand of shatras we kee=\r\np fighting with others \nclaiming our path our tradition our understading is=\r\n the only true \none.\n\n&quot;Ganapati Muni had met the yet-to-be-called Sri Raman=\r\na on the \nsouthern slopes of Arunachala. One day he was assailed by pains, =\r\n\ntroubles, doubts. He remembered that the young Swami was on the \nhill, and=\r\n at midday, a little after noon, he climbed and found him \nsitting outside =\r\nVirupaksha cave, alone. He prostrated and said, &quot;All \nthe scriptures that h=\r\nave to be read, I have read. All the mantras \nand japa that have to be done=\r\n, I have done. Still I have no peace. \nPlease save me.&quot; The young Swami too=\r\nk a little time. For at least \nfifteen minutes he silently gazed at him. Th=\r\nen in Tamil, he spoke. \nThe English translation is simple:\n\n&quot;If one watches=\r\n whence the notion &#39;I&#39; arises, the mind is absorbed \nin That; that is tapas=\r\n. When you recite a mantra, watch where the \nsound is coming from, within y=\r\nou; when you sing a song or prayer, \nwatch where it is emanating from: your=\r\n Heart. Put your attention on \nThat. That is tyaga, that is TAPASYA, that i=\r\ns all.&quot; \nAll his doubts and delusions were washed away that day. &quot;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
