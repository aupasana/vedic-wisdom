That is why we use it frequently in our ritua=\r\nls. But as Narasimha somewhere pointed out recently and I would extend that=\r\n to this particular issue, Betel Nut Gross body affects our gross bodies. W=\r\nhat I spoke about is for the subtle effects of betel nut.\nI again reiterate=\r\n that these are entirely my personal views based on my *Own* experience so =\r\none need not rely entirely on that but one can experiment and see for onese=\r\nlf.\n\n[\n&gt; Doing homam for gods will bring only good. All pervading god is no=\r\nt &gt;waiting for a chance to break your ego. He will guide you by &gt;providing =\r\nbetter sense of discrimination and wisdom. \n]\n\nI wish to stress that doing =\r\nHomam for God does not mean that only pleasant thing at material level/Ment=\r\nal level will happen. There are all the chances that one may experience fru=\r\nits of past bad Karma at the various stages of the Sadhana depending upon o=\r\nne&#39;s quality of stock of past Karmas and quality of mental focus. \nUnless o=\r\nne is faced with situations which strongly challenges ones patterns/habits,=\r\n some hard habits/patterns will not be broken. So God also needs to do that=\r\n for the Spiritual progress of an aspirant.\nI agree that God will guide you=\r\n by providing better sense and discrimination but these qualities are dawn =\r\nand perfectly established only after some struggles. But ultimately I found=\r\n Homam as a Sadhana which will take good care of the Sadhaka, at all level.=\r\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\nUtpal\n\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Akshaya&quot; =\r\n&lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; you wrote \n&gt; &quot;Supari is Symbolic=\r\nal of our false Ego and Pride. our patterns & Habits.

Supari is considered auspious otherwise also.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would r=\r\nequest Narasimha to guide us on this. I am sure lot of people would like to=\r\n know substance we can offer in homam and their possible benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; Akshaya\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot;=\r\n &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just finished a pleasant =\r\nMaha Ganapati Homam. Since it is relevant to the topic, wish to add my 2 ce=\r\nnt...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sopari&quot; (Betel Nut) is one good item to offer as a Purnaahu=\r\nti. Especially for those, who are doing homam in close apartment with dry c=\r\noconut pieces. Somebody suggested me to offer it in Homam long back and sin=\r\nce then I usually offer it every time along with a Dry Coconut Half. I did =\r\nnot realize initially the purport of the suggestion but after more than a y=\r\near of offering, i understood the meaning. Sopari is an extremely hard subs=\r\ntance-Very difficult to break. Symbolical of our false Ego and Pride. our p=\r\natterns & Habits. However one caution! If one starts offering it as purnaah=\r\nuti then one may need to be ready to face situations where in Ego is hurt, =\r\nInsults are mounted, feathers are ruffled.
