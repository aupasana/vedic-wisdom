And before he vanished he also told me that\nhe=\r\n wanted a note-book. I said I had only one readily available and that it\nwa=\r\ns of the octavo pocket-size. He said it was enough. I woke up with a\npleasa=\r\nnt thrill.\n\nThe dream or vision, whatever one may call it, made such a deep=\r\n impression\non my mind that I could not delay carrying out the behest, howe=\r\nver strange\nit might seem. After early bath and ablutions I traced out the =\r\npocket\nnote-book and hurried to the Ashram. Prostrating myself before Sri B=\r\nhagavan\nas usual, I handed over the note-book to him. He received it smilin=\r\ng, and\nasked me why I took it to him, when I related to him, in a whisper, =\r\nall\nabout my dream.\n\nImmediately he called his personal attendant, the late=\r\n Madhavaswami, and\nremarked to him =E2=80=9CDid I not ask you last evening =\r\nto fetch a good notebook to\nwrite down a Malayalam translation of the Sansk=\r\nrit text of Sri Ramana Gita?\nYou didn=E2=80=99t bring one. Here is Nambiar =\r\nwho has brought it for me. It seems he\nhad a dream in which I asked him for=\r\n the book, and he has brought it.=E2=80=9D This\nincident aroused a great de=\r\nal of interest among the devotees.\n\nOn another occasion in the same year I =\r\ndreamt of Maharshi as seated on his\ncouch as usual, surrounded by a number =\r\nof devotees seated on the floor and\nengaged in meditation. Among them I rec=\r\nognised a young devotee from Goa,\nseated in padmasana performing pranayama.=\r\n I think he was known by the name,\nSridhar. While he was doing pranayama, I=\r\n saw, in the dream, sparks of fire\nrising from the base of his vertebral co=\r\nlumn up to his head. Bhagavan,who\nwas watching this practicant, interjected=\r\n =E2=80=9CThere is no need for all this\ngymnastics with breath-control. It =\r\nis easier and safer to follow the method\nof Self-enquiry as enunciated by m=\r\ne.=E2=80=9D That is the sum and substance of the\ndream I had.Next day, when=\r\n I went to the Ashram, I sought out this young\nGoanese Swami. I had no prev=\r\nious acquaintance with him and no occasion even\nto speak to him before. I g=\r\nave him a full description of the dream I had. He\nwas visibly moved and, so=\r\nmewhat to my embarrassment, embraced me with\ndelight in the North Indian fa=\r\nshion.\n\nHe said =E2=80=9CBrother, I was all the while waiting for an opport=\r\nunity to ask\nBhagavan whether I should continue or give up this practice of=\r\n pranayama\nwhich I have been steadily carrying on for the past several year=\r\ns. Indeed,\nlast night while sitting in the presence of Sri Bhagavan I eager=\r\nly awaited\nan opportunity to put him the question but I couldn=E2=80=99t fi=\r\nnd a suitable\noccasion for the purpose. Now, there is no need for me to ask=\r\n him about it.\nBhagavan answered it through you.=E2=80=9D\n\nWhen I was in En=\r\ngland last year, I went to see a venerable, old lady, by\nname Mrs. Victoria=\r\n Doe. She must be nearing 80 and lives in a quiet house at\n17. St. Martin=\r\n=E2=80=99s Avenue, Epsom, Surrey, with her only daughter, Miss. Leena\nDoe. =\r\nShe has never come to India, never seen Bhagavan Sri Ramana in flesh\nand bl=\r\nood. Yet, I was deeply moved by her devotion to him. She had read\nabout him=\r\n, prayed to him,meditated on him, and lives in him day in and day\nout.\n\nShe=\r\n showed me sheaves of letters she took from a corner of a shelf, and\nkissed=\r\n them with great reverence before handing them to me. All the letters\nwere =\r\nfrom the Ashram and were meticulously preserved for the past several\nyears.=\r\n She had also with her all the English publications of Sri\nRamanasramam. Sh=\r\ne opened one of the books and, running her shaky finger\nalong the writing o=\r\nn the first page =E2=80=9CWith Gracious Blessings from Sri\nBhagavan=E2=80=\r\n=9D burst into tears of joy and devotion. She said =E2=80=9CMr. Nambiar,how=\r\n\nlucky you are to have been able to be with him, to see him and hear him\nsp=\r\neak. Here, we treasure these books and letters as representing him. Now he\n=\r\nhas sent you here. I feel that he is with us now.=E2=80=9D Such love, such =\r\ndevotion\nto the Sage, so tenderly expressed to me, a total stranger to her =\r\ntill the\nother day, moved me to the depths of my being.\n\nI do not profess c=\r\nompetence to interpret Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s philosophy and\nteachings. The=\r\n first publication I remember to have read on his teachings is\nthe booklet =\r\nentitled =E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D. Having read it, I felt no need to rea=\r\nd\nother books propounding some different approach to the realisation of the=\r\n\nEternal Truth. I am convinced that the method of Selfenquiry suggested in\n=\r\nthat great little book is all that is needed for the highest achievement in=\r\n\nlife, namely, Self-realisation.\n\nSource: Golden Jubilee Souvenir\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000feaf226775daf80048b7bf5d5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;It was in the year 1933 that a =\r\nfriend of mine spoke to me about Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and suggested=\r\n that I should meet him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On reaching Sri Ramanasramam,I went =\r\ndirect to where Sri Bhagavan was seated, prostrated myself before him and s=\r\nat down on the floor at some distance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:=\r\nbold&quot;&gt;One or two incidents during this period may be recounted here, miracl=\r\nes to the faithful, but casual coincidences to the sceptics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;One evening in the year 1936 when I visite=\r\nd the Ashram I decided to ask an important question of Sri Bhagavan concern=\r\ning certain spiritual practices.
