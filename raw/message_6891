But do not think in terms of deity X and deity Y not li=\r\nking each \n&gt; other and doing their mantras together making them angry with =\r\nyou, etc. \n&gt; Deities are far more subtle than us.\n&gt; \n&gt; If my son asks me ho=\r\nw to study math, I may tell him to study for half \n&gt; hour, take some rest, =\r\nhave a snack, and study again. If he asks my wife \n&gt; the same thing, she ma=\r\ny tell him sternly to study for 4 hours, before \n&gt; breaking. He better ask =\r\none of us and stick to what that person says. If \n&gt; he asks both and we giv=\r\ne different directions, he will be confused. It \n&gt; is not that I and my wif=\r\ne dislike each other for giving a different \n&gt; advice. I know her and I am =\r\nnot surprised by her advice. Similarly, she \n&gt; knows me and she is not surp=\r\nrised by my advice. But it is better for my \n&gt; son to follow one approach.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, approach of savitA and kALI may be different.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of cours=\r\ne, it is not just deity&#39;s name or mantra. It is in your attitude \n&gt; and how=\r\n you visualize/imagine the deity (consciously or even \n&gt; sub-consciously). =\r\nI, for example, do a Chandi homam every morning. After \n&gt; the homam, as the=\r\n poornaahuti burns, I meditate for half hour with \n&gt; savitR^i gAyatrI mantr=\r\na. I do not feel weird about mixing chanDIpAtha \n&gt; (durgA saptashati) and g=\r\nAyatrI mantra. Even as I invoke Chandi in fire \n&gt; and read durgAsaptashati,=\r\n I visualize Aadyaa Mahalakshmi, the shakti of \n&gt; the supreme cosmic being,=\r\n who divided herself into Mahalakshmi, Mahakali \n&gt; and Mahasaraswati. The d=\r\nhyana shloka I use for invocation is \n&gt; &quot;sarvasyAdyA mahAlakShmI triguNA pa=\r\nrameshvarI lakShyAlakShyasvarUpA yA \n&gt; vyApya kR^itsnaM vyavasthitA...&quot; So =\r\nmy visualization of the devata is \n&gt; highly saattwik and close to that of s=\r\navitA and sAvitrI!\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone else may be visualizing Chandi as someone f=\r\nierce and angry and \n&gt; cutting off heads with umpteen weapons etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eac=\r\nh devatA and mantra has a range of possibilities. Depending on how \n&gt; you v=\r\nisualize a devatA and mantra and with what attitude, it works on \n&gt; you acc=\r\nordingly, within that range of possibilities. It is always better \n&gt; to sti=\r\nck to one mantra for a few months or years. Of course, people who \n&gt; have s=\r\nuch dense conditioning that mantras do not really have any \n&gt; immediately v=\r\nisible impact on their consciousness, may do as many \n&gt; mantras as they wan=\r\nt. If you see that some mantras are having a visible \n&gt; impact on you, it i=\r\ns a good sign. But it is better then to use the \n&gt; feedback and stick to on=\r\ne mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; You may want to experiment with homam with the Kali mantra t=\r\nhat is \n&gt; helping you deal with your problems better.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Kali yuga, Vi=\r\nshnu sahasra naama stotra and Chandipath are two stotras \n&gt; that are said t=\r\no work effectively. Consider experimenting with \n&gt; Chandipath, perhaps one =\r\nchapter a day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free J=\r\nyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sho=\r\nrt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;     =\r\n  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish wri=\r\ntings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                     =\r\n  Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jul 14, 2011 at 1:13 AM, vedicastrostude=\r\nnt wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Dear Narasimhaji and others,\n&gt; \n&gt; I used to meditatively=\r\n listen to/chant the Savitur Gayatri every \n&gt; morning, and on the weekends,=\r\n I did a homam also (doing the Savitur \n&gt; Gayatri). Gayatri, especially in =\r\nHoman seems to make things awaken in \n&gt; me, even with a tinge of sexual des=\r\nire, yet still making me more \n&gt; spiritual. Separately, for the past few mo=\r\nnths, I have been having this \n&gt; heavy weight of a depressive feeling (due =\r\nto several events/situations \n&gt; in my life) which just hasnt left me, and e=\r\nven the Gayatri/Homam doesnt \n&gt; relieve except immediately after a Homam fo=\r\nr less than a day. After some \n&gt; reading around and doing some astrology, I=\r\n finally arrived at a Kali \n&gt; mantra - Om Kreem Kalikaye namah, and I have =\r\nstarted meditating on that \n&gt; every morning, but I still do weekend homams =\r\nwith Savitur Gayatri. But \n&gt; things have changed now. The Kali mantra is ve=\r\nry punishing in a mental \n&gt; tightness kind of way, yet still helps me deal =\r\nwith mental hardship \n&gt; without completely giving up/getting angry/stressed=\r\n. So I have continued \n&gt; it. Yet the day I do Savitur Gayatri homam, the Ga=\r\nyatri results seems a \n&gt; bit weaker - I have no idea why. Also, if I dont m=\r\neditate on the Kali \n&gt; mantra later on in the same day (i.e. if I try to dr=\r\nop a day of doing \n&gt; Kali mantra), I get into conflicts much more easily. I=\r\ns there some kind \n&gt; of conflict between the two?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundee=\r\np\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
