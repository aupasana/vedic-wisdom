Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away fro=\r\nm internet forums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I=\r\n interacted on an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a =\r\ncopy of the original post with my write up to my inbox, I visited this foru=\r\nm and quickly browsed through some posts. I am happy to note that the gener=\r\nal atmosphere here is far better and more sincere than a lot of other forum=\r\ns. Having quickly browsed through this particular thread, I thought that I =\r\nmight reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an importa=\r\nnt question regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after =\r\nsummarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand=\r\n the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a =\r\ngeneral or specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether init=\r\niation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answe=\r\nr is- NO. However if the question is about the necessity of being initiated=\r\n for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82=E2=\r\n=80=93YES.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; t=\r\nhereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arise=\r\ns the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context the=\r\nre are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question =\r\nI will restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussion=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spi=\r\nritual)\n&gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sp=\r\niritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract Trut=\r\nhs of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and=\r\n techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experi=\r\nential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques em=\r\nployed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented=\r\n to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessar=\r\ny, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genui=\r\nne teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Di=\r\nscernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmi=\r\nnation of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhya=\r\nya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of thes=\r\ne practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for extern=\r\nal practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by cons=\r\nistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu sch=\r\nools of Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself t=\r\nowards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga =\r\nemphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nBhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;=\r\ns will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis=\r\n in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in=\r\n actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga o=\r\nf the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadh=\r\nana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the nece=\r\nssity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of cer=\r\ntain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Va=\r\nk. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereb=\r\ny certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that exce=\r\npt Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bha=\r\nkti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-=\r\nSomeeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the =\r\nfire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of aust=\r\nerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nTantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab=\r\n-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniqu=\r\nes that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhi=\r\nkara is not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a=\r\n child to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor=\r\n need experience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper =\r\ntraining and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety=\r\n measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one&#39;s own =\r\nconsciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the indiv=\r\nidual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a=\r\n topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion=\r\n on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will j=\r\nust elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since we are talki=\r\nng about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tant=\r\nric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric contex=\r\nt. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. H=\r\nowever there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living =\r\ntraditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri S=\r\nri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to S=\r\nrikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Bud=\r\ndhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan B=\r\nuddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajraya=\r\nna shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its ap=\r\nproach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not tha=\r\nt Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at=\r\n least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantr=\r\na, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of sy=\r\nnchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation is the=\r\n full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage=\r\n of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TRE=\r\nE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch an=\r\nd sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individ=\r\nual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another mo=\r\ndern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Ta=\r\nntric advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for=\r\n the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many b=\r\neautiful\n bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, w=\r\nhere there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the =\r\nway up till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Soun=\r\nd (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sad=\r\nhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an i=\r\nntegrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Jap=\r\na and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehens=\r\nive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the =\r\nOne. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it=\r\n is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is a=\r\nlso simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The questi=\r\non of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and th=\r\nus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text=\r\n as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covere=\r\nd extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Adv=\r\naitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful refl=\r\nections through its central message\n of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crown=\r\ning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims i=\r\nn full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying=\r\n &quot;I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Co=\r\nmpare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the cen=\r\ntral truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to re=\r\nad in English or any other regional language is because understanding the m=\r\neaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads =\r\nthe text in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the wri=\r\nteup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from it=\r\ns obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally reg=\r\narded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that=\r\n regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equall=\r\ny possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*. An=\r\nyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway ide=\r\nntify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship o=\r\nf the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a one =\r\non one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just a=\r\ns some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sad=\r\nhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to t=\r\nhe Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this =\r\nparticular approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initia=\r\ntion is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara=\r\n, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach =\r\nof reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not requ=\r\nired if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/=\r\nYagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chan=\r\ndi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing tradition=\r\ns of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various pa=\r\nrts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hen=\r\nce the importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri\n Sri Chandi or S=\r\nri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any =\r\nof the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara,=\r\n Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc=\r\n are all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitu=\r\nde etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different prac=\r\ntitioners. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods i=\r\nn spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKUL=\r\nA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answ=\r\ner to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally one last word=\r\n. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most=\r\n effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts =\r\nfollowed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is best d=\r\none in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is=\r\n the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate me=\r\nthod (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsan=\r\ngha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritua=\r\nl life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of servin=\r\ng, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his=\r\n younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap i=\r\nn their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, N=\r\nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those who complai=\r\nn about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivanan=\r\nda:\n&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there =\r\nare no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a que=\r\nstion of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will c=\r\nome at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirst=\r\ny, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky l=\r\nife, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit=\r\n for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, wo=\r\nrldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name a=\r\nnd fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourse=\r\nlf a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you to the lot=\r\nus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide you and =\r\nelevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting=\r\n to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty.\n Real =\r\nseekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahat=\r\nmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot;=\r\n //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity f=\r\nor Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a p=\r\notential Satsangha though not comparable to the actual company of the great=\r\n masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside =\r\na study of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, b=\r\ny listening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother,=\r\n by constant remembrance and reflection, by discernment of sat and asat, by=\r\n genuine and sincere discussions on a group such as this, one makes progres=\r\ns truly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly or reply at least for a whil=\r\ne. However I might participate in some discussions on and off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedi=\r\nc_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I read this message of respected Narasimha Garu few times.

I like him as i like T=\r\nhakur and Sachin Tendulkar :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy Vijaya Dasami!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) I do not share Dr Choudhary&#39;s opinion about reading Eng=\r\nlish translation instead of Sanskrit verses if one is not initiated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Initiation serves two purposes:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2a) As in th=\r\ne analogy I gave earlier, a rich father may open a bank account in a son&#39;s =\r\nname with a starting balance of one million dollars. Similarly, a guru with=\r\n some achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disciple. Howeve=\r\nr, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank account wit=\r\nh a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. Simila=\r\nrly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and bu=\r\nild one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as=\r\n a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ah=\r\nead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two pu=\r\nrposes - (i) for getting specific material results and (ii) as tools of inc=\r\nreasing surrender and making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initi=\r\nation is not that important. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls an=\r\nd a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are very few people w=\r\nho can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a r=\r\neason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for inc=\r\nreasing surrender, getting whatever material results god wants to give and =\r\nmaking spiritual progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting *spe=\r\ncific* material results (for oneself or others or society/universe in gener=\r\nal), Nature will make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such=\r\n rituals. But, as one starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual=\r\n or any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires,=\r\n but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give=\r\n any material results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my de=\r\nsires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and=\r\n surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is n=\r\not required. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gen=\r\ntle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce d=\r\neities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave this analog=\r\ny earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit =\r\nbasket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit f=\r\nrom under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently and the spill=\r\nage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is aggress=\r\nive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on =\r\nthe floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retriev=\r\ned faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is try=\r\ning to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit =\r\nto eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu o=\r\nr Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spillage wi=\r\nll be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava\n or Kali or Narasimha=\r\n may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but fr=\r\nuits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of =\r\nthose rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neverthe=\r\nless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better of=\r\nf avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. =\r\nIf initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before start=\r\ning a practice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without ini=\r\ntiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit =\r\nof your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If =\r\nyou are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some pe=\r\nople who never lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are d=\r\noing daily homam now. Some people who took several hours to read Saptashati=\r\n for the first time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with ent=\r\nire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them have transformed a lot an=\r\nd have experienced some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with =\r\nfire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if some=\r\none has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is looking =\r\nfor god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), =\r\nthat person obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person ha=\r\ns done that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s ad=\r\nhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what is wha=\r\nt, how things work, why one should do something, how to do it, what is more=\r\n important and what is less important, that is what initiation is all about=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manual=\r\ns for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_p=\r\nathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nt is my personal opinion that Strong and long standing urge should be consi=\r\ndered as Initiation at least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a person who wan=\r\nted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not able to almost for a year=\r\n.

In this age of Kali, She has become the later and she&#39;ll be=\r\n happy if someone just prays with *slightest* of devotion to her by way of =\r\nrecitation of Chandipaatha. this is a strong conviction developed in me.

Since the las=\r\nt 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to vario=\r\nus reasons. It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet for=\r\num. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with=\r\n my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through =\r\nsome posts. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere here is far bett=\r\ner and more sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed thro=\r\nugh this particular thread, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s ques=\r\ntion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question =\r\nregarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizing =\r\nthe big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE que=\r\nstion and the MANY answers\n possible. Firstly is the question a general or =\r\nspecific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is a=\r\nn absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. H=\r\nowever if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra=\r\n sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82=E2=80=93YES.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage g=\r\noes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus=\r\n arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian conte=\r\nxt there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this que=\r\nstion I will restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the disc=\r\nussion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tant=\r\nric)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; e. Karma mar=\r\nga (Action- Ritual path and/or\n Selfless Actions)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract =\r\nTruths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods=\r\n and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an ex=\r\nperiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ technique=\r\ns employed by each of these paths.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; For those who are predomina=\r\nntly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is=\r\n not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experien=\r\nce of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods =\r\nof Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essent=\r\nially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practic=\r\ne of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice=\r\n. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal ro=\r\nle for external\n practices.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasise=\r\ns Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivi=\r\nty or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswara=\r\npranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddh=\r\na and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they subscr=\r\nibe to nirishwaravada.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devoti=\r\non) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will through total surr=\r\nender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Act=\r\nion as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachme=\r\nnt to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana whe=\r\nre alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity o=\r\nf a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain oc=\r\ncult\n truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It =\r\npresupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby cert=\r\nain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bha=\r\nkti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti pr=\r\nedominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someey=\r\nam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire o=\r\nf the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity,=\r\n and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak thr=\r\nough the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly power=\r\nful techniques that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on ad=\r\nhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about qualification. Would=\r\n you allow a child to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does\n t=\r\nhe supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any other lab exper=\r\niment proper training and experience are part of the procedure apart from c=\r\nertain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab =\r\nis one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti wit=\r\nhin the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As =\r\nthis is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from furth=\r\ner discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless details h=\r\nere, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextu=\r\nalise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major =\r\nriver within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sa=\r\nkta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three major school=\r\ns that are full-fledged living traditions among the\n DashaMahaVidyas- Kalik=\r\nula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whils=\r\nt Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more compl=\r\nete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those=\r\n who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21=\r\n forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well=\r\n as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at =\r\nall) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major miles=\r\ntones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, =\r\netc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies f=\r\nor each of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of th=\r\ne practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The=\r\n Guru parampara can be compared to an\n INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at t=\r\nhe root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs=\r\n spread out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka. It is a bea=\r\nutiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one c=\r\nan use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that init=\r\niation not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electric=\r\nity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful bulbs/lights at=\r\n each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long seri=\r\nes of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himself.=\r\n It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana se=\r\neks to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrat=\r\ned approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and M=\r\nantra. Both Kalikula and\n Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive an=\r\nd integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. S=\r\nri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is al=\r\nso a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also si=\r\nmultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of =\r\ninitiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus emp=\r\nloying the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a =\r\nyogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered exte=\r\nnsively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic =\r\npath, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflection=\r\ns through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glo=\r\nry in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-=\r\nfledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alo=\r\nne exist in this\n universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare =\r\nit with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central t=\r\nruth of Advaita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-in=\r\nitiate to read in English or any other regional language is because underst=\r\nanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repea=\r\ntedly reads the text in a language that they can fully follow. The main ide=\r\na of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too a=\r\npart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also=\r\n equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hy=\r\nmns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhit=\r\na are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi=\r\n *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will stra=\r\nightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even t=\r\nhe worship\n of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVE=\r\nD from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an inte=\r\ngral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, =\r\nthere are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as pe=\r\nr the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation as=\r\n per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Veda=\r\nntic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya,=\r\n or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth.=\r\n Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predomina=\r\nntly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of t=\r\nhese approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the=\r\n living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as\n pr=\r\nacticed originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace th=\r\nemselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those p=\r\naths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In summ=\r\nary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the merthods/practices =\r\nusing Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa=\r\n, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all effective. Howeve=\r\nr depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., some of these met=\r\nhods are more suited relatively to different practitioners. One may progres=\r\ns through a combination of any of these methods in spiritual life. However =\r\nthe *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha t=\r\noo. It is this big picture against which the answer to the question has to =\r\nbe contextualised.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irresp=\r\nective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the\n most effect=\r\nive methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followe=\r\nd by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in =\r\na language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FI=\r\nRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (t=\r\nhough not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and=\r\n satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life.=\r\n Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, list=\r\nening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his younge=\r\nr days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in their=\r\n spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivritti=\r\nnath and Matsyendranath respectively.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; For those =\r\nwho complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Sw=\r\nami Sivananda:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a\n complaint by householders=\r\n nowadays that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The compa=\r\nny of Sadhus is a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere dema=\r\nnd, the supply will come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If =\r\nyou are really thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You le=\r\nad a happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. =\r\nYou do not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle g=\r\nossiping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passi=\r\non, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Sats=\r\nanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shal=\r\nl take you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right=\r\n path, guide you and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or h=\r\nigh souls are waiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas =\r\nare in plenty. Real seekers are few. If\n you bring a charge, &quot;There are no =\r\ngood Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real se=\r\nekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To a certain ext=\r\nent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the app=\r\nropriate bhavana, this group too is a potential Satsangha though not compar=\r\nable to the actual company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas=\r\n such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplif=\r\nting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflect=\r\nion, by discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on =\r\na group such as this, one makes progress truly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nI may not interact regularly or reply at least for a while. However I might=\r\n participate in some discussions on and off.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Reg=\r\nards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Satya\n Prakash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;v=\r\nedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Namaste everybody,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I read this messa=\r\nge of respected Narasimha Garu few times.

Similarly, a guru with some achievement in a mantra can transfe=\r\nr some of it to a disciple. However, one without a rich father is still bet=\r\nter off opening a bank account with a zero balance and building it up slowl=\r\ny with one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do =\r\nsadhana\n with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you =\r\nfind a guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), g=\r\net initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (=\r\ni) for getting specific material results and (ii) as tools of increasing su=\r\nrrender and making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is n=\r\not that important. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru c=\r\nan prepare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there a=\r\nre very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the w=\r\nhole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and =\r\nrituals only for increasing surrender, getting whatever material results go=\r\nd wants to give and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do ritual=\r\ns\n for begetting *specific* material results (for oneself or others or soci=\r\nety/universe in general), Nature will make arrangements for one to get corr=\r\nect knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts, one should start with th=\r\ne attitude of (ii).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If yo=\r\nu want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it wit=\r\nh the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not know how t=\r\no fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any material results or=\r\n spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept wha=\r\ntever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrender and make spir=\r\nitual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitu=\r\nde itself is an initiation!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (=\r\n4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fi=\r\nerce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave\n this=\r\n analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a=\r\n fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good =\r\nfruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently and th=\r\ne spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is =\r\naggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotten fru=\r\nits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be =\r\nretrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity=\r\n is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good=\r\n fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, V=\r\nishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spil=\r\nlage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Nar=\r\nasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember\n that these fru=\r\nits are not deity&#39;s creations, but fruits of your own actions. Without sadh=\r\nana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of those rotten fruits before eating the =\r\ngood fruits!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, on=\r\ne unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoidi=\r\nng fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initi=\r\nation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a pr=\r\nactice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without initiation.=\r\n If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your =\r\nown actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are =\r\nweak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life and were igno=\r\nrant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who took several ho=\r\nurs to read Saptashati for the first time just 2-3\n years back are now doin=\r\ng Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them ha=\r\nve transformed a lot and have experienced some things too. Obviously, they =\r\nhave done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mot=\r\nher in some past lives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) I=\r\nn this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone has even a faint i=\r\ndea that spiritual progress is important, is looking for god and is attract=\r\ned to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person obviously =\r\nhas some good karmas and good vasanas. That person has done that sadhana in=\r\n the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of wha=\r\nt is what, how things work, why one should do something, how to do it, what=\r\n is more important and what is less important, that is what initiation is a=\r\nll about!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Soft=\r\nware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films t=\r\nhat make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spir=\r\nituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_p=\r\nathak@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear\n Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal opinion that S=\r\ntrong and long standing urge should be considered as Initiation at least in=\r\n this age.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a person who wanted to recite=\r\n Chandi paatha regularly but was not able to almost for a year.

In this\n age of Kali, She has become th=\r\ne later and she&#39;ll be happy if someone just prays with *slightest* of devot=\r\nion to her by way of recitation of Chandipaatha. this is a strong convictio=\r\nn developed in me.
