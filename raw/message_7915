Food is what you buy to eat a=\r\nnd consume, but in the end if you do not consume that and throw it away you=\r\nr purpose is defeated, your aim for buying the food has been lost. THAT is =\r\nwastage.\n=C2=A0\nWhen you buy ghree/til/rice for any puja -=C2=A0not just ho=\r\nma -=C2=A0are you buying with the intention of consuming them yourself or f=\r\nor using it in the ritual? If you are using it in the ritual, then=C2=A0it =\r\ncan hardly be called wastage.=C2=A0The ritual provides spiritual sustenance=\r\n which is as important as material sustenance, at least for some people. Se=\r\ncondly, coming to consumable food, does &quot;ghee&quot; - which is the prime ingredi=\r\nent in any homa - feature among the top intensive edible subtance?=C2=A0Rar=\r\nely. For most people ghee is consumed as food in very, very measuerd propor=\r\ntions, if at all it is consumed. Cooked rice, roti,=C2=A0daal, vegetables, =\r\npotato,=C2=A0some cheap non-vegeterian=C2=A0items, yes. But=C2=A0ghee? Rare=\r\nly.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nHowever if one needs to a small ganapati homa and one buys=\r\n 5 kgs of ghee of which maybe 200 gms are used and the rest is thrown away,=\r\n THEN it is a wastage, not of &quot;food&quot;, but of material which was bought with=\r\n a certain intention and left un-used.\n\nWastage in anything is bad. Over co=\r\nnsumption of anything, be it food or clothes, space or time is always bad. =\r\nNature abhors over consumption.=C2=A0One needs a house to stay so buy/rent=\r\n=C2=A0a house, Fine. Now if I think I have excess of money and have nothing=\r\n better to do with it, so I buy 5 houses just for joy of hoarding, that is =\r\nover consumption. I need one dress, I buy five because I like it. Thats ove=\r\nr consumption.=C2=A0This is a disease of the age which drives smaller human=\r\n behaviour patterns to larger economies. It will crash for sure. One day.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nSomeone had once asked me, why spend so much on ghee for homas when =\r\nyou can feed so many people with that money? I replied that since=C2=A0you =\r\nare not=C2=A0doing homas, why can&#39;t I find the free-food service queue for =\r\nthe poor outside your house, from money that you hypothetically saved by no=\r\nt doing any homas? Its all good to lecture from the comfort of a middle-cla=\r\nss life.

Infact, often they=\r\n are contradictory. Why? Because each shastras is powerful and valid for a =\r\nparticular time, place and cultural setting. At one point it was considered=\r\n leaving ones &quot;desh&quot; and crossing an ocean was a terrific sin. What is &quot;des=\r\nh&quot;? India the country did not exist. Ones village was ones desh and everyth=\r\ning around, from the next village to the end of the landmass was all &quot;vides=\r\nh&quot;. So if I apply that logic today, how many people in this forum have alre=\r\nady committed this great &quot;sin&quot;? Nearly everyone. Because the settings have =\r\nchanged. \n=C2=A0\nThe Vedas are considered an eternal book, because the Veda=\r\n samhitas contain descriptions of spiritual states in allegorical form. The=\r\ny are not a book=C2=A0of good ethical living.=C2=A0Apart from the core-veda=\r\n samhitas, all dharmic rulebooks are never ment for eternity. In changed sc=\r\nenarios, they too must undergo change. But based on what? A natural sense o=\r\nf right and wrong, proportion and disproportion, arising out=C2=A0of=C2=A0a=\r\n clear heart. There is no greater rule book for ethical living than ones ow=\r\nn heart. Follow it, and you won&#39;t be disappointed. If you keep following yo=\r\nur heart through thick and thin, the sense of right and wrong (discriminati=\r\non)=C2=A0will develop in such a fashion=C2=A0that you won&#39;t need sanction f=\r\nrom anywhere,=C2=A0but your own self,=C2=A0for your actions. That is creati=\r\nng a Viveka-chudamani.\n=C2=A0\nWasting food anyway is a bad habit. We know i=\r\nt. Feeding the needy whenever possible is always a good habit. That too we =\r\nknow.=C2=A0=C2=A0Feed others, human or animal whenever you can, and when yo=\r\nu can&#39;t; don&#39;t bother. Most important of all, don&#39;t bother about violating =\r\na rulebook and thus committing a &#39;sin&#39;.

Please don&#39;t waste =\r\nfood. This includes:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (1) Cooking more food than you need and throwing =\r\nit away, (2) Serving \n&gt; &gt;&gt; more food than you can eat in your plate and thr=\r\nowing it away (3) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Buying more vegetables/fruits than you need and let=\r\nting them get \n&gt; &gt;&gt; spoiled\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Please treat Mother Annapurna (personifica=\r\ntion of food that sustains \n&gt; &gt;&gt; us) with respect, love and humility (rathe=\r\nr than arrogance, contempt \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and pride).

The notion that gi=\r\nving food to people is good \n&gt; &gt;&gt; karma is based on the assumption that the=\r\ny actually eat it or use \n&gt; &gt;&gt; otherwise.

Such rituals produce no results wh=\r\natsoever. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Blindly adhering to traditions that are doing no good reall=\r\ny, is like \n&gt; &gt;&gt; dressing a corpse in beautiful clothes and jewellery. Use =\r\ncommon \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sense and do *real* good to others and the world, than engagin=\r\ng in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fake *symbols* that in reality harm the world.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry for th=\r\ne strong language, but I do see many people abusing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mother Annapoorna=\r\n and I think this is terrible for the world.

But in =\r\nthe last 4-5 years, I had been consciously avoiding new purchases of these =\r\n- yet I struggle to manage my ward-robe.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I am =\r\nthinking of donating some of them to the needy after seeing your message. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Nagraj&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sat, 2/25/12, rajarshi nan=\r\ndy &lt;I&gt;&lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LE=\r\nFT: 5px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject=\r\n: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Wasting Food&lt;BR&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Date: Saturday, February 25, 2012,=\r\n 3:51 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1655597934&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none=\r\n&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1655597934ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACK=\r\nGROUND-COLOR: #fff; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; C=\r\nOLOR: #000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;VAR id=3Dyiv1655597934yui-ie-curs=\r\nor&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;Namaste,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ho=\r\nw exactly is it determined that it is being &quot;wasted&quot;? Food is what you buy =\r\nto eat and consume, but in the end if you do not consume that and throw it =\r\naway your purpose is defeated, your aim for buying the food has been lost. =\r\nTHAT is wastage.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Whe=\r\nn you buy ghree/til/rice for any puja -&nbsp;not just homa -&nbsp;are you b=\r\nuying with the intention of consuming them yourself or for using it in the =\r\nritual? If you are using it in the ritual, then&nbsp;it can hardly be calle=\r\nd wastage.&nbsp;The ritual provides spiritual sustenance which is as import=\r\nant as material sustenance, at least for some people. Secondly, coming to c=\r\nonsumable food, does &quot;ghee&quot; - which is the prime ingredient in any homa - f=\r\neature among the top intensive edible subtance?&nbsp;Rarely. For most peopl=\r\ne ghee is consumed as food in very, very measuerd proportions, if at all it=\r\n is consumed. Cooked rice, roti,&nbsp;daal, vegetables, potato,&nbsp;some c=\r\nheap non-vegeterian&nbsp;items, yes. But&nbsp;ghee? Rarely.&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;However if one needs to a sma=\r\nll ganapati homa and one buys 5 kgs of ghee of which maybe 200 gms are used=\r\n and the rest is thrown away, THEN it is a wastage, not of &quot;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;fo=\r\nod&quot;, but of material which was bought with a certain intention and left un-=\r\nused.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wastage in anything is bad. Over consumption of anything, be i=\r\nt food or clothes, space or time is always bad. Nature abhors over consumpt=\r\nion.&nbsp;One needs a house to stay so buy/rent&nbsp;a house, Fine. Now if =\r\nI think I have excess of money and have nothing better to do with it, so I =\r\nbuy 5 houses just for joy of hoarding, that is over consumption. I need one=\r\n dress, I buy five because I like it. Thats over consumption.&nbsp;This is =\r\na disease of the age which drives smaller human behaviour patterns to large=\r\nr economies.

This is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; already=\r\n a serious problem according to scientists and I am afraid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; will get much worse in coming decades.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Given this, wasti=\r\nng food is a really really really terrible sin in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; today&#39;s=\r\n times. Please don&#39;t waste food. This includes:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (1) Cookin=\r\ng more food than you need and throwing it away, (2) Serving &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; more food than you can eat in your plate and throwing it away (3) &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; Buying more vegetables/fruits than you need and letting them ge=\r\nt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spoiled&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Please treat Mother Annapurna =\r\n(personification of food that sustains &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; us) with respect, =\r\nlove\n and humility (rather than arrogance, contempt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and p=\r\nride). World (and we) needs her blessings and kindness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; * =\r\n* *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On a similar note, some ladies do rituals where chick =\r\npeas soaked in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; water, fruits etc, sweets etc are distribu=\r\nted to other ladies. I have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; seen so many ladies casually =\r\nget these food items, let them rot and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; then throw them aw=\r\nay. The notion that giving food to people is good &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; karma i=\r\ns based on the assumption that they actually eat it or use &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; otherwise. If they waste it, it is bad karma for both parties.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; Please do not accept any food that you cannot use. Also, don&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; distribute food to people who do not need it. Instead, feed ho=\r\nmeless, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; needy people. Doing rituals with no common sense =\r\nand just for the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; heck of it, is not good. Such rituals\n p=\r\nroduce no results whatsoever. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Blindly adhering to traditi=\r\nons that are doing no good really, is like &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; dressing a cor=\r\npse in beautiful clothes and jewellery. Use common &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sense =\r\nand do *real* good to others and the world, than engaging in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; fake *symbols* that in reality harm the world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry f=\r\nor the strong language, but I do see many people abusing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nMother Annapoorna and I think this is terrible for the world. This &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; needs to change.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards, Narasimha &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------- Free =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,=\r\n &quot;Do It &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;&lt;A\n hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Films that make a differ=\r\nence: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank=\r\n&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://sara=\r\nswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D=\r\n_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter ID: @homam108 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow tar=\r\nget=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_=\r\nblank&gt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n---643335624-423148896-1330167627=:67262--\r\n\n"}}
