Next, the residuum left over\nafter discarding all that is not-self=\r\n is the Self, Sat-Chit-Ananda.\n\n*D.: How is that Self to be known or realis=\r\ned?*\n\nM.: Transcend the present plane of relativity. *A separate being (Sel=\r\nf)\nappears to know something apart from itself (non-Self).

The object is unreal. All drisya (including ego) is\nthe object. Elimin=\r\nating the unreal, the Reality survives.When a rope is\nmistaken for a snake,=\r\n it is enough to remove the\nerroneous perception of the snake for the truth=\r\n to be revealed.Without such\nelimination the truth will not dawn.*\n\n*D.: Wh=\r\nen and how is the disappearance of the objective world (drisya\nvilaya) to b=\r\ne effected?*\n\nM.: *It is complete when the relative subject, namely the min=\r\nd, is\neliminated. The mind is the creator of the subject and the object and=\r\n is the\ncause of the dualistic idea.* Therefore, it is the cause of the wro=\r\nng notion\nof limited self and the misery consequent on such erroneous idea.=\r\n\n\nD.: What is the relation between mind and object? Is the mind contacting\n=\r\nsomething different from it, viz., the world?\n\nM.: The world is =E2=80=98se=\r\nnsed=E2=80=99 in the waking and the dream states or is the\nobject of percep=\r\ntion and thought, both being mental activities.\n\n*If there were no such act=\r\nivities as waking and dreaming thought, there\nwould be no =E2=80=98percepti=\r\non=E2=80=99 or inference of a =E2=80=98world=E2=80=99. In sleep there is no=\r\n\nsuch activity and =E2=80=98objects and world=E2=80=99 do not exist for us =\r\nin sleep.*Hence\n=E2=80=98reality of the world=E2=80=99 may be created by th=\r\ne ego by its act of emergence\nfrom sleep; and that reality may be swallowed=\r\n up or disappear by the soul\nresuming its nature in sleep. *The emergence a=\r\nnd disappearance of the world\nare like the spider producing a gossamer web =\r\nand then withdrawing it.*\n\nThe spider here underlies all the three states -=\r\n waking, dreaming, and\nsleep; such a spider in the person is called Atman (=\r\nSelf), whereas the same\nwith reference to the world (which is considered to=\r\n issue from the sun) is\ncalled Brahman (Supreme Spirit).
