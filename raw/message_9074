I did not mean to say o=\r\ntherwise.\n     \n    But just having an ishta devata is not enough to be &quot;pr=\r\notected&quot; from deep and troublesome instabilities when one&#39;s body-mind compl=\r\nex goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring devotee becomes a =\r\nPrahlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji =\r\ngave below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;, the second lady &quot;did much sadhana =\r\nof Srirama&quot;. Even those who think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up=\r\n with hallucinations, mental and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one=\r\n&#39;s conditioning and desires!) interpretation of internal/external experienc=\r\nes and even madness.\n     \n    True surrender/devotion to ishta devata will=\r\n definitely protect one, but cultivating it is as difficult as cultivating =\r\ndetachment through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment are almos=\r\nt the same.\n     \n    This is why I said that *lightness of conditioning* i=\r\ns the most important thing. One with dense conditioning will find SOME way =\r\nto fail even if a great guru or god are ready to help.\n     \n    *        *=\r\n        *\n     \n    Now, the question is: How do we reduce our conditioning=\r\n? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantra=\r\ns, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by reg=\r\nular introspection and self-improvement.\n     \n    Taking mind away from it=\r\ns current pre-occupations (e.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing good sadhana&quot;, &quot;I=\r\n am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not get what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am better than X&quot;, &quot;=\r\nI must have Y at any cost&quot; etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditi=\r\noning, for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning!\n     \n    To=\r\n reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualizatio=\r\nn may work better for some people.\n     \n    One approach is to contemplate=\r\n god whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can imagine a be=\r\ning in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle/ideal/ab=\r\nility that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinating for th=\r\ne mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects around that=\r\n are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind is ab=\r\nout to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can try to c=\r\nontemplate god instead.\n     \n    Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says in the =\r\nmovie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can&#39;t be trans=\r\nformed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits!\n     \n   =\r\n Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks &quot;the omnipresen=\r\nt God is enjoying this thru this instrument&quot; and starts contemplating the q=\r\nualities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sense objec=\r\nts, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whenever o=\r\nne is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks &quot;the omnipresent Go=\r\nd is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument&quot; and starts con=\r\ntemplating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone, one=\r\n is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on.\n     \n=\r\n    In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. Eve=\r\nry now and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than ab=\r\nout god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am doing this nice homam&quot;, &quot;=\r\nI think *I* am making progress through this&quot;). With effort and perseverance=\r\n, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the supreme=\r\n power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long time to train a wild ani=\r\nmal, it takes a long time to train mind!\n     \n    Try to develop devotion =\r\nand surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/p=\r\nrinciple of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate t=\r\nhat concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When min=\r\nd veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don&#39;t spend too much t=\r\nime dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into con=\r\ntemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself.\n     \n=\r\n    The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it ab=\r\nout themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try =\r\nto break free from it.\n     \n    *        *        *\n     \n    Finally, one=\r\n can try to overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actio=\r\nns that benefit a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from tru=\r\nly loving god is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our =\r\n*limited* notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One wa=\r\ny to overcome that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people ar=\r\nound us are as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with =\r\nthem, love them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to tran=\r\nscend the limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God?\n     \n\n    =\r\nBest regards,\n    Narasimha\n    --------\n    Astrology & Spirituality Resou=\r\nrces: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n    --------\n     \n\n------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n      From: Leela =\r\nSastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n      To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n      Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 10:35=\r\n PM\n      Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kundalini syndrome\n\n\n\n        \n  =\r\n     Dear Friends ,\n       All psychosomatic or schizophrenic cases are not=\r\n defined as    wrongly    experimented  kundalini   experiences .

It is just A SMALL STEP in overc=\r\noming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n         \n        Let me give an anal=\r\nogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this body-mind=\r\n complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace o=\r\nver time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasion=\r\nally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out=\r\n of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact,=\r\n it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in=\r\n it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without =\r\nany out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishth=\r\na&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n         \n        Secondly, one does not get someth=\r\ning without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may ha=\r\nve deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enou=\r\ngh effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepare=\r\nd (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.\n      =\r\n   \n        As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. =\r\nNature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constrain=\r\nts on what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous ac=\r\ntions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longe=\r\nr want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealt=\r\nh one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. On=\r\ne may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life aft=\r\ner that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In a=\r\nnother case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be rebo=\r\nrn as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that =\r\nexperience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives, =\r\nalways &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n         \n        Anyway, co=\r\nming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience giv=\r\nen by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from havin=\r\ng it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire d=\r\nestined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).\n         \n=\r\n        *        *        *\n         \n        Kundalini rise is not necessa=\r\nrily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and det=\r\nachment.\n         \n        Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I w=\r\nent to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I w=\r\nent to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kil=\r\nl it!\n         \n        We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap =\r\ncalled this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a certain sl=\r\now death!\n         \n        If our ideas about who we are (viz this current=\r\n body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as sha=\r\nstras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that at some stage involve stepp=\r\ning out of this body-mind complex, without being scared?\n         \n        =\r\n*        *        *\n         \n        Kundalini rise after most undesirable=\r\n conditioning is overcome, is far better than Kundalini rise forced when so=\r\nme really undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.\n         =\r\n\n        When one transcends one problematic notion about who one is and wh=\r\nat one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may sp=\r\nring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the =\r\nbody&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s aw=\r\nareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar,=\r\n a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep=\r\n desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a=\r\n re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awaren=\r\ness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc.=\r\n The person may show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and=\r\n get stuck badly.\n         \n        An awakened Kundalini in a system with =\r\nundesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions =\r\nheavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.\n         \n   =\r\n     *        *        *\n         \n        The best approach I recommend is=\r\n to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome=\r\n your weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to em=\r\nphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people a=\r\nround you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negativ=\r\ne attachment.  \n        Don&#39;t worry about whether your Kundalini rises or n=\r\not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripu=\r\ns) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or not. If your ability to resist them is =\r\nincreasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep,=\r\n you are still making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalin=\r\ni (your self-awareness) will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her L=\r\nord (true Self).\n         *        *        *\n         \n        One word on=\r\n surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most p=\r\neople do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may b=\r\ne offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.\n         \n        =\r\n&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Ku=\r\nndalini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just =\r\na business deal. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True s=\r\nurrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True s=\r\nurrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. =\r\nTrue surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is p=\r\nleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully.=\r\n True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in =\r\nthe face of (and during) Death.\n         \n        If one without true surre=\r\nnder and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, =\r\none may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not tha=\r\nt god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protect=\r\ning or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; exa=\r\nmple above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s=\r\n conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s protection =\r\nmay seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away f=\r\nrom!\n         \n        *        *        *\n         \n        Whether throug=\r\nh the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Reali=\r\nze that all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while=\r\n you have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anyt=\r\nime. Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desir=\r\nes, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Sel=\r\nf. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Ku=\r\nndalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n         \n   =\r\n     The real key is how light your conditioning is.\n         \n        Best=\r\n regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www=\r\n.vedicastrologer.org/\n        --------\n\n\n\n          From: Leela Sastry &lt;lee=\r\nla.sastry@...&gt;\n          To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n          Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n=\r\n          Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n\n            \n    =\r\n       YES  SIR  , perfectly correct   , but intense bhakthi and saranagath=\r\ni  makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hu=\r\nrdles .

Constant efforts of purification of the vari=\r\nous elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words t=\r\nhis translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness=\r\n, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalin=\r\ni awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with grea=\r\nter force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then tak=\r\nes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens =\r\n- IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to var=\r\nious other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature whi=\r\nle some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the in=\r\ndividual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=\r\nr and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=\r\ns even more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an ex=\r\nperience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of p=\r\nsychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west t=\r\noday is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also po=\r\nssible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from var=\r\nious subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can g=\r\net &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifest=\r\nyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the=\r\n mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are v=\r\nery complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list =\r\ndown every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, ve=\r\nry few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who clai=\r\nm they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess wo=\r\nrk. Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achi=\r\neved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Gr=\r\neeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards  Rajarshi \n\n\n       =\r\n     awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | \n            param bhA=\r\nwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n            From: sunrise_1080 &lt;=\r\nsunrise_1080@...&gt; \n            To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  =\r\n          Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM\n            Subject: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n\n              \n            Dear all, Just w=\r\nanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of=\r\n a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been i=\r\nnvolved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous=\r\n awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-bod=\r\ny experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin=\r\n and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she search=\r\ned for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wr=\r\nong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to derange=\r\nd kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having=\r\n a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has =\r\ntriggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. U=\r\nnfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, an=\r\nd as we have no treatments for deranged kundalini, we struggle to help them=\r\n. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this l=\r\nady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. Thi=\r\ns woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deran=\r\nged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something sh=\r\ne cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her proble=\r\nm. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the k=\r\nundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or gi=\r\nve her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans am=\r\nong you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- th=\r\neir suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so a=\r\ns not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti=\r\n marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrumen=\r\nt&quot; and leave the kundalini rising bit to God&#39;s will.

I did not mean to say \n =\r\n   otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;But just having an ishta devata is not enough to=\r\n be \n    &quot;protected&quot; from deep and troublesome instabilities when one&#39;s bod=\r\ny-mind \n    complex goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring d=\r\nevotee \n    becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the=\r\n two examples \n    Leelaji gave below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;, the sec=\r\nond lady &quot;did much \n    sadhana of Srirama&quot;. Even those who think of a deit=\r\ny and pray to him/her can \n    end up with hallucinations, mental and spiri=\r\ntual disorders, wrong (colored \n    by one&#39;s conditioning and desires!) int=\r\nerpretation of internal/external \n    experiences and even madness.&lt;BR&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;True surrender/devotion to ishta \n    devata will definitely protect =\r\none, but cultivating it is as difficult as \n    cultivating detachment thro=\r\nugh wisdom! In fact, true surrender and \n    detachment are almost the same=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;This is why I said that \n    *lightness of conditioning* is =\r\nthe most important thing. One with dense \n    conditioning will find SOME w=\r\nay to fail even if a great guru or god are \n    ready to help.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Now, the question \n    is: How do we redu=\r\nce our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single \n    magic bullet. T=\r\nhinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can \n    help, but the=\r\ny need to be augmented by regular introspection and \n    self-improvement.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Taking mind away from its current \n    pre-occupations (e.g. &quot;=\r\nI am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing good sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am mad at \n    X&quot;, &quot;I did not ge=\r\nt what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am better than X&quot;, &quot;I must have \n    Y at any co=\r\nst&quot; etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for \n    these t=\r\nhoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;To reduce \n    th=\r\ne regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualization may \n   =\r\n work better for some people.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;One approach is to contemplate g=\r\nod \n    whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can imagine a=\r\n being in \n    your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle/=\r\nideal/ability \n    that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fasci=\r\nnating for the mind \n    to contemplate that it does not care about other o=\r\nbjects around that are \n    making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mi=\r\nnd. Whenever mind is about to \n    entertain its regular debilitating pre-o=\r\nccupations, one can try to \n    contemplate god instead.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Mind =\r\nis a wild animal. As Pi says in \n    the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger=\r\n on the boat, wild animals can&#39;t be \n    transformed or domesticated, but t=\r\nhey can be trained into some \n    habits!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Whenever one is enjo=\r\nying a sensual pleasure, if one \n    thinks &quot;the omnipresent God is enjoyin=\r\ng this thru this instrument&quot; and \n    starts contemplating the qualities of=\r\n that god instead of thinking too much \n    about limited sense objects, on=\r\ne is better placed to reduce the damage done \n    by shadripus. Whenever on=\r\ne is angry at someone for what they did, if one \n    thinks &quot;the omnipresen=\r\nt God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that \n    instrument&quot; and s=\r\ntarts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of \n    being angry a=\r\nt someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by \n    shadripus=\r\n. And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;In the beginning, even contemplation of \n    god =\r\nbecomes laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up \n    becom=\r\ning about oneself rather than about god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice \n    bhaja=\r\nn&quot;, &quot;*I* am doing this nice homam&quot;, &quot;I think *I* am making progress \n    th=\r\nrough this&quot;). With effort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about \n=\r\n    oneself and keep it centered on the supreme power that runs the show. J=\r\nust \n    as it takes a long time to train a wild animal, it takes a long ti=\r\nme to \n    train mind!&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Try to develop devotion and surrender. =\r\nBased on all \n    that you read and heard, develop of a concept/principle o=\r\nf god that is so \n    superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that c=\r\noncept as frequently as \n    possible, especially when meditating. When min=\r\nd veers off into other things, \n    gently steer it back. Don&#39;t spend too m=\r\nuch time dissecting what mind is \n    doing and why. Just put it back gentl=\r\ny into contemplating god. Try to make \n    it about god rather than about y=\r\nourself.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The main drawback of \n    the sadhana of most people =\r\nis that they make it about themselves at some \n    level or the other. Thou=\r\ngh that is unavoidable, try to break free from \n    it.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Finally, one can \n    try to overcome the limite=\r\nd sense of self and engage in selfless actions \n    that benefit a larger s=\r\net of people than oneself. What stops us from truly \n    loving god is our =\r\ndeep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our \n    *limited* notion=\r\n of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way \n    to overco=\r\nme that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people \n    around u=\r\ns are as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with \n    t=\r\nhem, love them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to \n    =\r\ntranscend the limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent \n    God?&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\n    &lt;DIV \n    style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13px; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT=\r\n-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; BACKGROUN=\r\nD-COLOR: transparent&quot;&gt;Best \n    regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;--------&lt;BR&gt;Astrol=\r\nogy &amp; Spirituality Resources: \n    &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n    rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV \n    style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13px; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-S=\r\nTYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, clean,\n     sans-serif; BACKGR=\r\nOUND-COLOR: transparent&quot;&gt;--------&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;\n    &lt;BLOCKQUOTE=\r\n style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-=\r\nSIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;DIV \n      s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, ser=\r\nif&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;\n      &lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n=\r\n      &lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Leela Sastry \n =\r\n     &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n      style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT=\r\n: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; \n      &lt;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n      style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent=\r\n:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, February 28, 2013 \n      10:35 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: \n      [vedic-wisdom] Re: Ku=\r\nndalini syndrome&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n      &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv353263917&gt;\n      &lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n      &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv353263917ygrp-text&gt;\n      &lt;DIV =\r\n\n      style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman,=\r\n new york, times, serif; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;De=\r\nar Friends ,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;All psychosomatic or schiz=\r\nophrenic cases are not defined \n      as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrongly&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; \n      experimented&nbsp;&nbsp;kundalini&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences =\r\n.

To get &#39;that kind \n      of guru is also&nbsp; near impossibility . =\r\nSo it is always desirable to \n      depend on the ishtadevatha to lead to t=\r\nhat stage .When once the \n      appropriate time comes even Ishtadevatha al=\r\nso&nbsp;&nbsp; recedes to the \n      back ground .

It is just A SMALL STEP in =\r\novercoming one&#39;s current limited \n        identity.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Let me giv=\r\ne an analogy. One wanting to move from \n        one&#39;s small dilapidated hou=\r\nse (this body-mind complex) to a huge palace \n        (realized Self) may f=\r\nirst construct the palace over time and move into \n        it when it is CO=\r\nMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays \n        in the pal=\r\nace still under construction (analogy for out of body \n        experiences =\r\ndue to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it \n        comes wi=\r\nth risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in \n        it=\r\n. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization \n        wi=\r\nthout any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but \n        Ma=\r\nharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Secondly, one does \n   =\r\n     not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient effort \n  =\r\n      towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previou=\r\ns \n        life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be get=\r\nting it \n        now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not eve=\r\nn want it!) \n        when it comes in this life.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;As you do sad=\r\nhana, try not to \n        fancy too many specific desires. Nature has a del=\r\nay mechanism in \n        granting your desires (because of constraints on w=\r\nhat Nature can give \n        you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous =\r\nactions). So Nature \n        sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when y=\r\nou no longer want it or \n        want something else. For example, one may =\r\npray for great wealth one&#39;s \n        whole life and be born as a rich but v=\r\nery sick man in next life. One may \n        not enjoy that wealth and pray =\r\nwhole life for health. In the life after \n        that, one may be very hea=\r\nlthy, but not have any knowledge or money. \n        &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv35=\r\n3263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&gt;In another \n        case, one may dee=\r\nply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn \n        as a tiger o=\r\nr a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \n        experi=\r\nence. Basically, people &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN \n        id=3Dyiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19=\r\n_1362067846619_141&gt;keep going in circles \n        through various lives, al=\r\nways &quot;seeking&quot; something they are \n        &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway, =\r\ncoming back to Kundalini, if one deeply \n        desires an out of body exp=\r\nerience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s \n        previous karmas cons=\r\ntrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be \n        born in next lif=\r\ne with this specific desire destined to fructify (if \n        there is enou=\r\ngh karmik force behind \n        it).&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Kundalini \n        rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if=\r\n one is well-prepared in \n        terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk \n        glued to a mouse trap. I went to free =\r\nit and it panicked so badly and \n        started to shake violently.

If one over=\r\ncomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another \n        notion in o=\r\nne&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to \n        (&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;=\r\nSPAN id=3Dyiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&gt;&lt;SPAN \n        class=\r\n=3Dyiv353263917userContent&gt;e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a \n        =\r\ngreat scholar, a great saint etc&lt;/SPAN&gt;). As an extreme example, if one \n  =\r\n      person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the \n =\r\n       world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescu=\r\ne \n        the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deepl=\r\ny clings \n        to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may sh=\r\now some signs \n        of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuc=\r\nk \n        badly.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undes=\r\nirable \n        conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong noti=\r\nons heavily \n        and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual \n        p=\r\nroblems.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n        =\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR \n        id=3Dyi=\r\nv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_158&gt;The best approach I \n        recom=\r\nmend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise.

True surrender has \n        no place for agendas,=\r\n desires, demands or expectations. True surrender \n        is losing onesel=\r\nf in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True \n        surrender i=\r\ns accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is \n        pleasura=\r\nble or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it \n        gratefull=\r\ny. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and \n        pleasur=\r\ne, even in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If one \n        wit=\r\nhout true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions \n        experi=\r\nences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking \n       =\r\n of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as \n =\r\n       said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you go bac=\r\nk to \n        my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying=\r\n to protect \n        it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning m=\r\nakes one *run \n        away* from God&#39;s protection!

Constant efforts of purification of the various \n            element=\r\ns that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler \n            words=\r\n this translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more \n            n=\r\non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once \n         =\r\n   and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self \n     =\r\n       identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more =\r\n\n            intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journe=\r\ny. 3 - \n            A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and=\r\n when it \n            really does - it can also open up the mind and body t=\r\no various other \n            things and entities, some of which are not pos=\r\ntive in nature while \n            some of them are useless, and given half =\r\na chance can make use of \n            the individual for its own ends. They=\r\n take hold of inhernent \n            weakness in character and nature and m=\r\niss-utilizes the same. Hence \n            constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes eve=\r\nn more vital. 4 - While someday or \n            other every sadhaka will ha=\r\nve an experience of Kundalini Shakti \n            awekening and rising up, =\r\nnot all maladies of psychology are because \n            of this. The human =\r\npsychology as understood by west today is puerile \n            and insuffic=\r\nient to deal with various things. It is also possible \n            sometime=\r\ns that the aura of an individual, which protects us from \n            vario=\r\nus subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional \n            enti=\r\nties, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or \n         =\r\n   unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of \n  =\r\n          various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing=\r\n \n            serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various \n=\r\n            possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every \n=\r\n            option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, v=\r\nery \n            few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation.=\r\n Many who \n            claim they can do so, are often doing nothing more t=\r\nhan an \n            intelligent guess work. Sometimes it will have results,=\r\n sometimes \n            not. For all these to be achieved, the starting poi=\r\nnt is a sound \n            mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used=\r\n to say - &lt;SPAN \n            class=3Dyiv353263917st&gt;Mens sana in corpore sa=\r\nno.&lt;/SPAN&gt; -Regards \n            &nbsp;Rajarshi \n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dyiv353263917MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B=\r\n&gt;&lt;SPAN \n            class=3Dyiv353263917Apple-style-span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE=\r\n: 16px&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n            class=3Dyiv353263917Apple-style-span \n       =\r\n     style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(153,153,153)&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n       =\r\n     class=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950 yiv353263917yui_3_7_2=\r\n_19_1362067846619_92&quot; \n            style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, n=\r\new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;awaktam \n            wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabud=\r\ndhayah |&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n            class=3D&quot;yiv353263917yui_3_2_0_2_13424=\r\n3506227946 yiv353263917yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_17=\r\n_1362045432997_73 yiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_93&quot; \n            s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT \n        =\r\n    face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot; color=3D#000000&gt; \n            &lt;DIV&gt;\n          =\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam \n            ||[7:24]&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  =\r\n          &lt;DIV class=3Dyiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_95 \n         =\r\n   style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, mon=\r\nospace, sans-serif&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dyiv353263917yui_3_7_2_19_1362=\r\n067846619_96 \n            style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new =\r\nroman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal size=3D2&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dyiv353263917hr \n            style=3D&quot;=\r\nBORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px solid; FONT-SIZE: 0px; B=\r\nORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid; HEIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n            style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; sunri=\r\nse_1080 \n            &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n       =\r\n     style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; \n            vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n            style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;=\r\n/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, 28 February \n            2013 1:50 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n   =\r\n         style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom] \n  =\r\n          Kundalini syndrome&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv3532=\r\n63917&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n            &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv35326=\r\n3917ygrp-text&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kun=\r\ndalini syndrome \n            based on my recent experience of a patient of =\r\nmine. I am doing a \n            psychiatry job at present, and have been in=\r\nvolved in the care of \n            someone who seems to think she has had a=\r\n spontaneous awakening of \n            their kundalini since childhood. Thi=\r\ns has involved out-of-body \n            experiences and surges of energy in=\r\n the body. She is not of Indian \n            origin and had never heard of =\r\nkundalini until her symptoms started \n            and she searched for an e=\r\nxplanation. We have not been able to find \n            anything physically =\r\nwrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might \n            be that this is=\r\n due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call \n            mentally ill d=\r\nescribe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or \n            unwanted s=\r\npontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered \n            interest an=\r\nd research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. \n            Unfortuna=\r\ntely these patients are not well-understood by western \n            medicin=\r\ne, and as we have no treatments for deranged kundalini, we \n            str=\r\nuggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the \n            kunda=\r\nlini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that \n            k=\r\nundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill \n        =\r\n    herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is \n   =\r\n         so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she \n  =\r\n          cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to he=\r\nr \n            problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, w=\r\nho \n            manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this=\r\n woman- \n            and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear =\r\nthis. May I \n            request that the good samaritans among you pray fo=\r\nr her, and for \n            others like her (whom we may not know of)- thei=\r\nr suffering really is \n            pitiable. And let us be careful in our s=\r\nadhana so as not to end up \n            in this situation ourselves. Perhap=\r\ns this is why the bhakti marga is \n            the safest. It is perhaps sa=\r\nfest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; \n            and leave the kundalin=\r\ni rising bit to God&#39;s will.
