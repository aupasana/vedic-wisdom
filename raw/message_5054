As one does more and more sadhana, one leaves saattwik energy in the place. Sleeping is a taamasik activity. Whatever little (or more) tamas is in one is brought to the surface when one sleeps. So one leaves some taamasik energy in the place where one sleeps. It is a good idea to not mix up the two. So try not to sleep in a temple or atleast in the pooja room in your own house (unless it is unavoidable).\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- rajmohansrinivas &lt;yrskmohan@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; In several small towns and villages in Andhra Pradesh, i found a strange practice of sleeping at temples in the nights during navratri and also doing pradakshina (parikrama)around midnight. A friend of mine told me that sleeping at temples during nights is prohibited in Hindu sampradayas and also only certain left handed practices mandate worship and pradakshina during midnight. He does not have any substantiation. Are these only local practices or is there any text(s) that deal with this.\n&gt; \n&gt; I request scholarly friends to enlighten me on this/\n&gt; \n&gt; Love to all,\n&gt; Rajmohan\n\n\n"}}
