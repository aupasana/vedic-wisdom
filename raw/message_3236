Although coming from a meat-eating=\r\n\nfamily, I turned vegetarian while still a boy. I was mainly a worshipper o=\r\nf\nShiva but learned about Christ and Buddha too and revered them. Twice I\nv=\r\nisited the great Muslim shrine at Nagore, and I understood that Allah was\no=\r\nnly another name for God. My one ambition in life was to see God face to\nfa=\r\nce. This was granted to me while still a schoolboy in March of 1917 when I\n=\r\nfirst went to Skandashram and set my eyes upon Bhagavan. Reclining on the\nc=\r\nouch, he looked indescribably majestic. Since then he has been God in human=\r\n\nform for me, my God, Guru and All. I did not ask him for anything. I was\nf=\r\nilled to overflowing by just seeing him. He turned on me that look of heart=\r\n\nmelting Grace that he so often bestowed on newcomers. After a few days I h=\r\nad\nto return home. There I learned the &quot;Marital Garland of Letters&quot; and spe=\r\nnt\nmy time reciting it either mentally or aloud and even writing it out.\n\n\n=\r\nIt was on my second visit to Skandashram that I first made pradakshina. A\nv=\r\nisitor from Madurai whom I knew wanted to go round the hill with Bhagavan\na=\r\nnd I joined him. At that time the lower slopes were still forested and we\nt=\r\nook the forest path for a good part of the way before coming out on the\nroa=\r\nd. Next day I had a sudden urge to go round by myself. I started out as\nbef=\r\nore but soon lost my way on the forest track. As I started I had noticed\nth=\r\nat one of the Ashram dogs was following me. Now it ran in front and began\nt=\r\no lead. At once it flashed on me that this was Bhagavan&#39;s work. With tears\n=\r\nof gratitude and joy I followed my guide. He took me by the same path as th=\r\ne\nprevious day until we came to the road and then disappeared; and I saw hi=\r\nm\nat the Ashram when I got back. At the time I told nobody about this. It w=\r\nas\nmy first experience of my spiritual relationship with Bhagavan and I was=\r\n\nmore than ever convinced that he would guide me through the unknown paths =\r\nof\nlife. Such an incident may appear trivial to the reader, but when it\nact=\r\nually happens it strengthens one&#39;s faith in Bhagavan, who alone can help\nby=\r\n his infinite Grace in opening one&#39;s inner vision.\n\n\nFor a whole year at Sk=\r\nandashram Bhagavan took only one meager meal a day. I\nwas on a visit there =\r\nthe day he broke this fast. I had decided to stay the\nnight even though the=\r\nre was no food for an evening meal for the rest of us.\nI didn&#39;t feel hungry=\r\n. At about 7:30 one of the devotees, Ramanatha\nBrahmachari, came back with =\r\nsome pieces of broken coconut and some rice that\nhe had been given at a cer=\r\nemony he attended in town.\n\nBhagavan suggested that we should boil it up on=\r\n the charcoal stove we had\nthere and share it, as was the usual custom. He =\r\ntold us to see whether there\nwas any sugar or sugar candy left from gifts b=\r\ny earlier visitors to flavor\nit with. We looked but there was nothing at al=\r\nl. It was dark and raining\noutside and we could not go into town for anythi=\r\nng. I was near to tears that\nBhagavan should ask for something =E2=80=94 so=\r\n rare an event =E2=80=94 and we should not be\nable to provide it. At that v=\r\nery moment the door opened and two students\ncame in with a bag of sugar can=\r\ndy and a bunch of bananas that they had\nbrought to present to Bhagavan. The=\r\n meal was cooked and eaten, the two\nvisitors also being invited.\n\nBhagavan =\r\nremarked that we had asked for sugar candy and got bananas also,\nwhich coul=\r\nd be cut up and served like a pickle with the food. After eating\nhe said th=\r\nat it was just a year, 365 days exactly, since he had limited\nhimself to on=\r\ne meal a day and that from now on he would eat in the evening\nalso. That wa=\r\ns how things happened with Bhagavan. He did not work miracles,\nthings just =\r\nhappened right.\n\nMiracles are generally thought of as deliberate acts wille=\r\nd by a person, but\nhappenings like this are the result of spiritual forces =\r\nnaturally and always\nat work. The Jnani is God Himself in human form. He ne=\r\nver wills anything but\nthings happen in his presence and the ignorant attri=\r\nbute them to him. His\nstate is pure awareness. It is a matter of experience=\r\n.
