Spirituality is related too, as spiritual sadhana improves free will and makes one freer to do the right things.\n \nSome karmas are &quot;dridha&quot; (firm or mandatory) and their results MUST be experienced, no matter what. Throat cancer of Ramakrishna and skin cancer of Ramana Maharshi are examples. However, many karmas are not dridha and are flexible/optional. Their results can be avoided by the application of free will.\n \nA regular person&#39;s free will is not strong enough to bend the curve of habit resulting from previous actions and change the course. One goes with the flow, keeps on accumulating newer karmas and reaping the good and bad fruits. One remains a slave of bad habits and those habits get reinforced further and further with time.\n \nOne making spiritual progress develops stronger free will. One starts to show better judgment and stronger will power and does the right things despite strong obstcles. Thus, one avoids payback for a lot of undesirable karmas that are not dridha. One also stops accumulating too many new undesirable karmas.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDestiny is the sum total of karmas that one&#39;s free will performed in the past (including previous lives). Astrology captures one&#39;s destiny. Destiny restrains one&#39;s free will and tries to compel free will to act in some patterns, but free will need not obey. One always has many options, though *tends to* select the option that is favored by destiny. But one *can* select another option. Strengthening judgment, wisdom and breaking from bad haits is what is needed. Spiritual practices do help in that process.\n \nAn astrologer focuses on destiny, but a spiritualist may focus on free will. Destiny is water under the bridge, while free will is the new stream that can flow in many ways. If some yogis downplayed astrology and emphasized free will, it is not without reason. Swami Vivekananda once famously said astrology is for the weak-minded people and emphasized free will.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Ahamkaara makes decisions.\n \nBuddhi makes decisions, controlled by ahamkaara and aided by chitta. Ahamkara, chitta and buddhi work closely. In computer technology terms, look at ahamkaara as a CPU, chitta as DRAM that stores all data and buddhi as an ALU or a logic co-processor that runs logical algrithms. Manas is an I/O controller. The five jnanendriyas are input channels, the five karmendriyas are output channels; and, the five praanas are the electricity flowing in the computer. When the electricity stops flowing, CPU works in a minimal mode based on an internal battery until electricity is turned on again and some important data in DRAM remains and some is lost by the time electricity is turned on again. Similarly, some experiences from past lives remain in chitta as subconscious memories that influence our thinking in future lives, but many specific memories are lost.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhen buddhi makes decisions, it may have to process many previous memories that may be leading it in different directions. Some memories may be conscious memories of things from this life. Some memories may be subconscious memories of things from past lives.\n \nFor example, one&#39;s guru may have told one &quot;never keep anything in mind; forgive and forget&quot; in a previous life and one may have lived whole life following it. That ideal may be a sub-conscious memory influencing thinking now. If someone did terrible things to one in this life, that may be a conscious memory now. When one is in a position to take revenge, there may be a clash between the two memories.\n \nAs another example, one may have spent a whole life trying to become a millionnaire and failed. That desire may be a sub-conscious memory influencing thinking now. If one may be under the influence of a spiritual teacher and living a simple life of contentment now. But the sub-conscious memory may be clashing now and then with the ideals taught by guru in this life.\n \nMemories accumulated and retained in chitta over lives may be guiding one in conflicting directions. A subjective algorithm of weighted judgment runs in buddhi. The weights are constantly adjusted based on the history of how information is stored in or retrieved from chitta. Free will is essentially the subjective element of buddhi, that controls this algorithm of weighted judgment.\n \nBy engaging in spiritual practices, by reading scriptures and spiritual teachings of great masters and by contemplating, we store some new useful information in chitta, slowly affect how information is stored to or retrieved from chitta, and modify the relative weights of various information in chitta. When the free will is strong, it is possible to overcome latent tendencies by storing new information in chitta and marking it as high priority.\n \n*        *        *\n \nEverybody in the spiritual path knows what are good tendencies and what are not. Feeling lust or desire when one sees a beautiful person or object is bad. Feeling anger when someone says bad things about one is bad. Feeling proud about what one did or has is bad. Hanging on to emotions is bad. And so on. Everybody knows these things. But knowing is not enough and one needs to act on that knowledge! The problem is that these things are stored in chitta with a low weight and there are overriding memories stored chitta with much strong weights. So it is difficult or even impossible for the subjective portion of one&#39;s buddhi to make them win in the final decision-making process.\n \nRising above firm latent tendencies is possible only by continuing to exert whatever little free will one has over and over again. Slowly, free will becomes stronger and stronger and latent tendencies become weaker and weaker. Once one breaks through the barriers, progress is accelerated.\n \nPractice and persistence have no substitutes.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Kishore Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Assuming perfect astrological predictions, one&#39;s life should be read\n&gt; from the chart almost like a biography with no elaborate details in it.\n&gt; If this is correct and the backdrop is set for a person, how\n&gt; does spirituality\n&gt; effect one&#39;s life?\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a line of thought based on this mail:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2733\n&gt; \n&gt; A person&#39;s birth time is based on that person&#39;s chitta baggage.\n&gt; Astrology gives hints on person&#39;s chitta to tell the person&#39;s tendencies\n&gt; to react in certain conditions also a path with a set of life events like\n&gt; birth, graduation, marriage, children, happy and sad occassions etc..\n&gt; As every step towards next event life is a natural result of decisions\n&gt; made during previous steps, the decisions to chose a path are heavily\n&gt; influenced by chitta.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ahamkaara makes decisions. Spirituality pushes chitta away from\n&gt; influencing logical unit ahamkaara so that ahamkaara can make\n&gt; decision according to swadharma (one&#39;s dharma). This results in\n&gt; decreasing chitta baggage and increasing spiritual knowledge for future.\n&gt; Eventually spirituality only influences ahamkaara, the actions are oriented\n&gt; towards self-realization as next major event.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using this reasoning, one can say the following:\n&gt; \n&gt; a) with zero spirituality, one&#39;s life should comply 100% with astrological\n&gt; predictions (from a pure person)\n&gt; \n&gt; b) with 100% spirituality, the person only touches the predicted events\n&gt; for the sake of clearing chitta baggage\n&gt; \n&gt; Help me understand this better.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kishore\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Oct 14, 2009 at 5:20 AM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Rakeshji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my little understanding, any sadhana of Ma Durga should be good enough\n&gt; &gt; to control a malefic Rahu...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Wed, 14/10/09, rakesh.behal &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: rakesh.behal &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] query\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, 14 October, 2009, 2:01 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Dear guru ji,\n&gt; &gt; charan saparsh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1] Pls design homa for rahu\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2] pls also suggest which sadhna are best to control rahu and avoid its bad\n&gt; &gt; effects\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regds\n&gt; &gt; rakesh\n\n\n"}}
