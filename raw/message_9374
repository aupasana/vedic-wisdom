Is it ok if I do mantra japa lying on bed comfortably? Or \n=\r\n&gt; should it always be in a a seated positon? Because, lying on \n&gt; bed comfo=\r\nrtably, I can do far more number of rounds than \n&gt; sitting up. Also, I can =\r\nconcentrate entirely on mantra being \n&gt; chanted that way. Also I read somew=\r\nhere Anga nyasa, Kara \n&gt; nyasa etc.are not necessary, just chanting the spe=\r\ncified \n&gt; mantra is adequate. What&#39;s your opinion on this?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
