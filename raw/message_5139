There are bound to be various perspectives and this may di=\r\nstract or confuse the initial practitioner. Moreover the tyranny of over-in=\r\ntellectualization has to be kept in mind. To any such reader my advice is- =\r\nplease follow what you are doing currently. Things will evolve and happen o=\r\nn their own accord. Whatever is suited to you will happen in the natural fl=\r\now of Life.        \n\nIn this post I will also touch upon certain other topi=\r\ncs raised in some related posts while primarily addressing Rajarshi ji&#39;s qu=\r\neries.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I had talked to a few people who adhere to different paramparas=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;within the broader subset of Kalikula. They said that the &gt;&gt;&gt;initiation=\r\n in Chandi sadhana in required for not only the parayana &gt;&gt;&gt;but also (mostl=\r\ny?) because of the main mantra. Normally we are &gt;&gt;&gt;accustomed with only the=\r\n navarna mantra, but there are various &gt;&gt;&gt;other mantras of the different as=\r\npects of the Universal Chandi, of &gt;&gt;&gt;which the navarna we know of, is proba=\r\nbly the mildest. To chant &gt;&gt;&gt;one of these mantras and awaken the same needs=\r\n initiation. This, &gt;&gt;&gt;they said, is a part of the &gt;&gt;&gt;entire Chandi sadhana.=\r\n What is your &gt;&gt;opinion on this?&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\n\nBroadly speaking most of the above i=\r\ns true from the traditional *Sakta* perspective. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana as =\r\nenjoined by Kalikula emphasises MANTRA sadhana. Merely chanting the Devi Ma=\r\nhatmyam text is not the same as Sri Sri Chandi sadhana, as per this view. I=\r\nt has various mantric nuances and practices including other mantras and bij=\r\nas and ways to make them work. I will expand on this at the end of this pos=\r\nt after addressing your other points.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As a corollary to your above pa=\r\nragraph, one can therefore read the &gt;&gt;&gt;text of the Chandi in a pouranik app=\r\nroach, as a sacred myth? There &gt;&gt;&gt;are people, specially in Bengal, who do a=\r\n Chandipath on their own &gt;&gt;&gt;without having undergone any formal initiation.=\r\n How good or bad is &gt;&gt;&gt;this practise?\n\n\nAs always there will be varied beli=\r\nefs and opinions ranging from the very rigid traditional extreme to the ver=\r\ny liberal and casual new-age extreme based on one&#39;s personal affiliations, =\r\nfamily and cultural influences. I will speak for *myself*. I prefer the mod=\r\nerate view that is respectful to tradition but does not allow tradition to =\r\nbe one more fetter. \n \nQuite often many of our beliefs are fear-based rathe=\r\nr than knowledge-based. However undigested, unassimilated and unharmonised =\r\ninformation gathered from the internet or even the print media is not knowl=\r\nedge. There is no need to be fearful as long as one is not experimenting wi=\r\nth mantramarga based on fragmented information gathered from books or worse=\r\n still the internet. As long as one does the parayana along with other supp=\r\nortive practices such as kirtan, swadhyaya, reflection and bhakti bhava, in=\r\nitiation need not be a binding factor. However if one wishes to do Sri Sri =\r\nChandi sadhana in a full-fledged manner as per the traditional Sakta perspe=\r\nctive, better be initiated. If one strongly wills it (sankalpa) and is suit=\r\ned to it, the external guru and initiation will happen on their own accord.=\r\n For the rest who are not predominantly suited to or inclined towards mantr=\r\namarga, this discussion is not relevant. \n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;There &gt;&gt;&gt;are people, special=\r\nly in Bengal, who do a Chandipath on &gt;&gt;&gt;their own &gt;&gt;&gt;without having undergo=\r\nne any formal initiation. How &gt;&gt;&gt;good or bad is &gt;&gt;&gt;this practise?\n\n\nBengal =\r\nis one of the areas of the subcontinent where Kalikula flourished in a full=\r\n-fledged manner at one time. So at the collective level Kalikula is deeply =\r\nembedded in the collective unconscious and thereby the tendency to do Chand=\r\nipath irrespective of initiation. To undertand this one needs to appreciate=\r\n the dynamics between Kundalini and *KULA* KUNDALINII which are akin to the=\r\n individual unconscious and collective unconscious. If a particular family/=\r\nsignificant member of the family has practiced the sadhana of a devata for =\r\nsometime, the descendants automatically have its influence in their unconsc=\r\nious. That is why we are advised to worship the kuladevata along with ishta=\r\n devata though ishta devata remains a major focus. The same applies to para=\r\nyana too. Bengal was at one time a hotbed for the living and breathing trad=\r\nition of Kalikula. Though we do not see its flowering at the same level or =\r\nin the same form today, at the unseen and unconscious collective level, the=\r\n age-old Kalikula is very much alive and breathing.  \n\nSpiritual life is al=\r\nl about Awareness and oversimplifying it further, making the unconscious co=\r\nnscious is what Awareness is about. In true Advaitic fashion the collective=\r\n and individual consciousness are not separate. The advent of Sri Ramakrish=\r\nna is a predictable culmination of the flowering of Kalikula at a collectiv=\r\ne level. His advent marks a major milestone in not just Kalikula sadhana bu=\r\nt Sakta sadhana itself. Irrespective of the physical death of Sri Ramakrish=\r\nna, his satsangha is possible for all sincere seekers. Whilst swadhyaya of =\r\nthe Kathamrta is the easiest way to revel in his Satsangha, it is possible =\r\nto connect with him through a combination of trust (sraddha) and sense of b=\r\nelongingness too. If you consider him as your APTA, he automatically become=\r\ns your apta at a manasik level. This sense of belongingness straightaway op=\r\nens the doors of your heart and makes his grace and protection possible. \n\n=\r\nIn view of the above discussed factors, it might be okay to do Chandi paray=\r\nana without initiation, in our times. Initiation could happen in the long r=\r\nun if it is meant to be. However traditionally speaking Sri Sri Chandipath =\r\nwithout initiation is unimaginable as Sri Sri Chandi&#39;s integrated sadhana i=\r\nncludes various other mantras and bijas that are generally not written in t=\r\nexts though some texts talk about them without giving the complete details.=\r\n Diksha includes all this and much more. Here a word on `diksha&#39; itself is =\r\nin order to clarify the difference between uninitiated Devi Mahatmya paraya=\r\nna and initiated Sri Sri Chandi sadhana.  \n\nDiksha differs in accordance wi=\r\nth the sampradaya or the lineage within Kalikula or Srikula. To understand =\r\n`diksha&#39; itself, one needs to examine certain differences (bhedas), of whic=\r\nh the following are most important:\n \n1. Guru Parampara:  This forms the co=\r\nre of Devi Upasana and the other bhedas (differences) are in a way based on=\r\n this.\n\n2. Sampradaya: Guru of any authentic lineage should necessarily bel=\r\nong to one of the recognized sampradayas. \n\n3. Diksha: Depending on the dis=\r\nciple&#39;s eligibility and the Guru&#39;s capability, the type of diksha too varie=\r\ns. \n \n4. Yaga Bheda:  There are four levels of Yajna or yaga - Antaryaga, B=\r\nahiryaga,Mahayaga and Rahoyaga. Guru initiates the disciple into one or mor=\r\ne of these paths depending on the adhikara (aptitudes, needs and capabiliti=\r\nes) of the sadhaka. Only antaryaga and bahiryaga are relevant to our discus=\r\nsion. I have already expanded on this in another post on Yajna. \n\n5. Devata=\r\n Bheda:  Though the Devi is only One, depending on the samskara and vasana =\r\nof the initiate, he is initiated into the worship of Kali or Sri and thus t=\r\nhe paths of Kalikula and Srikula or Kalividya and Srividya. \n \n6. Achara Bh=\r\neda:  Depending on the initiate&#39;s samskara and adhikara, broadly speaking t=\r\nhere are seven acharas- Vedachara, Vaisnavachara, Saivachara, Dakshinachara=\r\n, Vamachara, Siddhantachara , and Kaulachara. Within the framework of Sakta=\r\n sadhana, there are only three acharas- Samaya, Dakshina and Kaulachara. It=\r\n is highly misleading to speak of the *superiority* of one achara over the =\r\nother. The path, the chosen form of the Mother (Kali or Sri), the means of =\r\nworship, are all differently devised to suit the varying temperaments of th=\r\ne practitioners. All forms of the Devi and all paths of sadhana are equally=\r\n respectable and ancient enough. The differences pertain more to the practi=\r\ntioner and NOT TO THE DIVINITY. As such we are advised not to degrade or cr=\r\niticize any path or deity.  All upasanas lead to the Devi and all sadhakas =\r\nhave the Devi within them. To talk lowly of any other sadhana marga or rupa=\r\n of the Devi amounts to insulting the Devi Herself.  As Sri Bhaskararaya ob=\r\nserves with characteristic tolerance, &quot;all vidyas are not different, a comp=\r\narison of one to another (in the texts) is merely for the sake of praising =\r\nand encouraging its performance&quot;. One could as well extend this tolerance (=\r\nif not acceptance) to all forms of God and all paths of attaining Her/Him. =\r\nIn the ultimate reckoning, any division is relative as there is only the ON=\r\nE. Advaita is the true essence of Sakta sadhana. All paths are practically =\r\nalong a *circular* continuum. An intellectual debate on the differences bet=\r\nween various paths is irrelevant to sadhana itself though it has relevance =\r\nto academicians or to the respective world-view of the sadhaka. Instead sad=\r\nhakas should focus on the underlying unity of all paths and the ultimate On=\r\neness of all forms of the Divine. This is a major tenet of Sakta sadhana.\n =\r\n             \n7. Mantra Bheda =96 Based on certain factors including the sa=\r\ndhaka&#39;s adhikara bheda, he is initiated into a different mantra. It is not =\r\nuncommon that the same sadhaka is initiated into various forms of the mantr=\r\na progressively in a gradual manner if he persists with commitment. For ins=\r\ntance in Sri Vidya upasana the mantra of Sri has five variant versions- Bal=\r\na, Panchadashi, Shodashi, Para shodashi and Guhya shodashi. Bala mantra is =\r\nthe entry level or preparatory level mantra for Sri Vidya. Likewise the nav=\r\nakshari or navarna mantra too has SEVEN VARIANT versions, of which the Nava=\r\nrna mantra that most written texts include is the mildest and akin to the e=\r\nntry level Bala mantra in Sri Vidya upasana. \n \nThe *details* of the seven =\r\nvariant versions of the navakshari or the twelve different ways of doing Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi path are really unnecessary to our current discussion. Instead=\r\n in my next post I will write more on MANTRA and its central importance in =\r\nsadhana as per the Sakta world-view. \n\nFinally a word on `Vak and `artha&#39; t=\r\noo is in order here. It is true that one derives great benefit by chanting =\r\na mantra in its original form. No doubt translation of a mantra is NOT the =\r\nsame as the mantra in its original form as `vak&#39;. Undoubtedly `Sabda&#39; comes=\r\n first and then only the `artha&#39; follows (&quot;Artha Srishtaeh Purvam Sabda sru=\r\nshtih&quot;). However one has to bear in mind that `Vak&#39; and `Artha&#39; are interde=\r\npendent and inseparable. I will elaborate on Sabda/Vak/Artha in my next pos=\r\nt along with Sri Bhaskararaya makhin&#39;s commentary and the importance accord=\r\ned to the fifteen levels of meaning (artha) of a mantra, so much so that he=\r\n even affirms that, &quot;the mere utterance of sabda without a knowledge of the=\r\n true import bears no fruit, even as the offering thrown over ashes in the =\r\nabsence of fire does not burst into flame&quot;. I will examine both sides of `s=\r\nabda&#39; and `artha&#39; in my next post as and when I can. All Indian traditions =\r\nthat explore `Vak&#39; or `Sabda&#39; agree that both are inseparable. The very men=\r\ntion of the words `sabda&#39; and `artha&#39; brings to my mind the most beautiful =\r\nmangala sloka from Kalidasa&#39;s `Raghuvamsa&#39; wherein he compares the insepara=\r\nble and interdependent nature of `Vak&#39; and `Artha&#39; to `Siva&#39; and `Sakti&#39; th=\r\ne parents of the entire universe =85.\n\nvagarthaviva samprkthau vagarthaapra=\r\nthipaththaye / \njagathaha pitharau vandhe parvathiparameshvarau //      \n\nR=\r\negards,\nSatya Prakash\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nand=\r\ny &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Satya Prakash ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for you=\r\nr beautiful=C2=A0analysis of Sri Sri Chandi. I read it and reflected \n&gt; on =\r\nit, and in my limited understand I agree to most of what you have said. \n&gt; =\r\nSpecially your explanation pertaining to=C2=A0Chand-munda and=C2=A0Sumbha-N=\r\nishumbh were \n&gt; awesome!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a question about your following paragr=\r\naph:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the s=\r\nadhana as per \n&gt; the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that need=\r\ns initiation as per \n&gt; its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if o=\r\nne adopts the Vedantic path \n&gt; of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of =\r\nAbhyasa and Vairagya, or even the \n&gt; Pauranic approach of reading the text =\r\ndevoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam \n&gt; too is not required if one is no=\r\nt inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice \n&gt; of Ritual/Yagnya. One ma=\r\ny benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri \n&gt; Chandi. However=\r\n one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions \n&gt; of bot=\r\nh Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of \n=\r\n&gt; the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence th=\r\ne \n&gt; importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri =\r\nVidya.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) I had talked to a few people who adhere to different pa=\r\nramparas within the \n&gt; broader subset of Kalikula.

Since the last 4-5 \n&gt; &gt;years I have =\r\npreferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reasons. \n&gt; &gt;It =\r\nhas been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. However aft=\r\ner \n&gt; &gt;Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my write u=\r\np to my \n&gt; &gt;inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some po=\r\nsts. I am happy \n&gt; &gt;to note that the general atmosphere here is far better =\r\nand more sincere than a \n&gt; &gt;lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed thr=\r\nough this particular thread, I \n&gt; &gt;thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s=\r\n question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the=\r\n necessity of \n&gt; &gt;initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big p=\r\nicture that needs to be \n&gt; &gt;invoked in order to understand the ONE question=\r\n and the MANY answers possible. \n&gt; &gt;Firstly is the question a general or sp=\r\necific one? Generally speaking if the \n&gt; &gt;question is whether initiation is=\r\n an absolute requirement for spiritual life or \n&gt; &gt;sadhana, *my* answer is-=\r\n NO. However if the question is about the necessity of \n&gt; &gt;being initiated =\r\nfor mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is \n&gt; &gt;YES.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the ne=\r\ncessity for \n&gt; &gt;multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the ine=\r\nvitability of \n&gt; &gt;multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there ar=\r\ne many paths for \n&gt; &gt;sadhana. But in the current context of this question I=\r\n will restrict myself to \n&gt; &gt;only the five that are relevant to the discuss=\r\nion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-=\r\nspiritual)\n&gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract T=\r\nruths \n&gt; &gt;of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular meth=\r\nods and \n&gt; &gt;techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths a=\r\nt an experiential \n&gt; &gt;level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods=\r\n/ techniques employed by \n&gt; &gt;each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; For those who are pre=\r\ndominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking \n&gt; &gt;even the extern=\r\nal guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the \n&gt; &gt;wisdo=\r\nm and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita \n&gt; &gt;empha=\r\nsises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retai=\r\nned the \n&gt; &gt;vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) to=\r\no as an important \n&gt; &gt;practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; i=\r\nn a big way with a marginal \n&gt; &gt;role for external practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yoga =\r\nmarga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and \n&gt; &gt;Vai=\r\nragya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionall=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt;emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme I=\r\nswara) too \n&gt; &gt;while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only t=\r\nhe first two as they \n&gt; &gt;subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga=\r\n (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;will t=\r\nhrough total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in \n&gt; &gt;=\r\nKarma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in act=\r\nions \n&gt; &gt;without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga o=\r\nf the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadh=\r\nana where alone the \n&gt; &gt;inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the =\r\nnecessity of a Guru arises. \n&gt; &gt;Mantra sadhana involves the practicalizatio=\r\nn of certain occult truths via the \n&gt; &gt;energetics of Sabda through the empl=\r\noyment of Vak. It presupposes certain \n&gt; &gt;dangers inherent to any lab exper=\r\niment and thereby certain regulations and safe \n&gt; &gt;practices. It should be =\r\nremembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke \n&gt; &gt;Fire or Agni at v=\r\narious levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the \n&gt; &gt;reference h=\r\nere is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke \n&gt; &gt;Agn=\r\ni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fire of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet another the physical fir=\r\ne of the \n&gt; &gt;Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire de=\r\nals with the fire of Vak through the \n&gt; &gt;lab-like practical mantrasastra. S=\r\nince Tantra employs highly powerful techniques \n&gt; &gt;that bring results more =\r\nquickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is \n&gt; &gt;not about autho=\r\nrity but more about qualification. Would you allow a child to \n&gt; &gt;experimen=\r\nt with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need \n&gt; &gt;experienc=\r\ne and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper training \n&gt; &gt;an=\r\nd experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety measures, =\r\nin \n&gt; &gt;the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one&#39;s own conscio=\r\nusness \n&gt; &gt;whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individu=\r\nal consciousness \n&gt; &gt;(also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not =\r\na topic for mere \n&gt; &gt;intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discu=\r\nssion on the Kundalini. \n&gt; &gt;Without going into other needless details here,=\r\n I will just elaborate on \n&gt; &gt;initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since=\r\n we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt;Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhan=\r\nas \n&gt; &gt;comprehensively. However there are actually three major schools that=\r\n are \n&gt; &gt;full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula=\r\n, Srikula and \n&gt; &gt;Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whil=\r\nst Sri Vidya sadhana \n&gt; &gt;belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more =\r\ncomplete the Vajrayanas among \n&gt; &gt;the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula.=\r\n To those who are familiar with Tibetan \n&gt; &gt;Buddhism I will draw attention =\r\nto the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana \n&gt; &gt;shares both the Advaiti=\r\nc outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach \n&gt; &gt;to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked =\r\nat all) \n&gt; &gt;while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the majo=\r\nr milestones in \n&gt; &gt;the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bij=\r\na, devata, etc are all \n&gt; &gt;consistently of a particular set of synchronisti=\r\nc frequencies for each of these \n&gt; &gt;three lineages. Initiation is the full-=\r\nfledged entry of the practitioner into a \n&gt; &gt;particular spiritual lineage o=\r\nf that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be \n&gt; &gt;compared to an INVERTED T=\r\nREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk \n&gt; &gt;arises. Each bra=\r\nnch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward \n&gt; &gt;till t=\r\nhe individual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is =\r\nheld by \n&gt; &gt;the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the cir=\r\ncuit necessary \n&gt; &gt;for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short c=\r\nircuit. Imagine many \n&gt; &gt;beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inver=\r\nted tree of live wires, where \n&gt; &gt;there is a long series of sadhakas sittin=\r\ng in silent practice all the way up \n&gt; &gt;till Siva himself. It is a dynamic =\r\nworld of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). \n&gt; &gt;Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the =\r\nindividual \n&gt; &gt;consciousness through an integrated approach that combines t=\r\nhe practices of \n&gt; &gt;Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula an=\r\nd Srikula have evolved \n&gt; &gt;into highly comprehensive and integrated approac=\r\nhes that can simultaneously hold \n&gt; &gt;the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi se=\r\nemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. \n&gt; &gt;However it is also a full-fl=\r\nedged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It \n&gt; &gt;is also simultaneo=\r\nusly a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The \n&gt; &gt;question of init=\r\niation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and \n&gt; &gt;thus emp=\r\nloying the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the A=\r\ndvaitic \n&gt; &gt;path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerfu=\r\nl reflections \n&gt; &gt;through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, =\r\nthe crowning glory in \n&gt; &gt;the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Hersel=\r\nf proclaims in full-fledged \n&gt; &gt;Upanishadic fashion that She is one without=\r\n a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in \n&gt; &gt;this universe. Who else is there be=\r\nsides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other \n&gt; &gt;Mahavakyas of the Upanisha=\r\nds and reflect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason I advis=\r\ned the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional \n&gt; &gt;language i=\r\ns because understanding the meaning and constant reflection are \n&gt; &gt;possibl=\r\ne only when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can \n&gt; &gt;f=\r\nully follow. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Adva=\r\nitic \n&gt; &gt;and Yogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. H=\r\nowever Sri Sri \n&gt; &gt;Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Ved=\r\na Samhita, especially \n&gt; &gt;the four hymns. In that regard all the applicatio=\r\nns of Veda mantras or the Veda \n&gt; &gt;Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sr=\r\ni Chandi and hence the practice of \n&gt; &gt;Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquai=\r\nnted with the original Vedic method will \n&gt; &gt;straightaway identify that Yag=\r\nnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even \n&gt; &gt;the worship of the Vigr=\r\naha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED \n&gt; &gt;from a one on one=\r\n mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just as some=\r\n practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi \n&gt; &gt;sadha=\r\nna in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is thi=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt;particular approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. =\r\nInitiation \n&gt; &gt;is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka a=\r\nnd Vichara, or the \n&gt; &gt;Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Paur=\r\nanic approach of reading the \n&gt; &gt;text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Hom=\r\nam too is not required if one is not \n&gt; &gt;inclined to the predominantly Vaid=\r\nik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit \n&gt; &gt;from any or all of these =\r\napproaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear \n&gt; &gt;in mind that the =\r\nliving and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as \n&gt; &gt;Srikula as =\r\npracticed originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally \n&gt; &gt;tr=\r\nace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In summary, one=\r\n can make spiritual progress through any of the \n&gt; &gt;merthods/practices usin=\r\ng Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, \n&gt; &gt;Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa=\r\n, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are \n&gt; &gt;all effective. Ho=\r\nwever depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., \n&gt; &gt;some of t=\r\nhese methods are more suited relatively to different practitioners. One \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;may progress through a combination of any of these methods in spiritual li=\r\nfe. \n&gt; &gt;However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves=\r\n Mantra \n&gt; &gt;diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer to =\r\nthe question has \n&gt; &gt;to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally one last word. =\r\nIrrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and \n&gt; &gt;SATSANGHA are the mo=\r\nst effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular \n&gt; &gt;self-study of =\r\ntexts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. \n&gt; &gt;This=\r\n is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for \n&gt; &gt;S=\r\nATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is th=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt;alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not poss=\r\nible. It is \n&gt; &gt;Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapi=\r\nd progress in \n&gt; &gt;spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted=\r\n state by virtue of \n&gt; &gt;serving, listening to and spending time in the comp=\r\nany of sadhus and sants in \n&gt; &gt;his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva an=\r\nd Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in \n&gt; &gt;their spiritual lives after they at=\r\ntended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, \n&gt; &gt;Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath re=\r\nspectively.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha=\r\n nowadays, I will just \n&gt; &gt;quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a =\r\ncomplaint by householders nowadays that there are no good \n&gt; &gt;Mahatmas. Thi=\r\ns is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of supply \n&gt; &gt;and d=\r\nemand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come at once. This is =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirsty, you will find =\r\nyour \n&gt; &gt;Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your min=\r\nd is full of \n&gt; &gt;passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for high=\r\ner divine life. You \n&gt; &gt;waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly=\r\n talks. You have become a \n&gt; &gt;hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name an=\r\nd fame. And yet you complain: `I \n&gt; &gt;cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make you=\r\nrself a deserving Adhikari first. Then \n&gt; &gt;come to me. I shall take you to =\r\nthe lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you \n&gt; &gt;in the right path, gui=\r\nde you and elevate you to sublime heights. These \n&gt; &gt;&quot;oversouls&quot; or high so=\r\nuls are waiting to get hold of the right type of \n&gt; &gt;aspirants. Mahatmas ar=\r\ne in plenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, \n&gt; &gt;&quot;There are no=\r\n good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are \n&gt; &gt;no re=\r\nal seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this=\r\n forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted \n&gt; &gt;with the appropriate =\r\nbhavana, this group too is a potential Satsangha though not \n&gt; &gt;comparable =\r\nto the actual company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri \n&gt; &gt;Cha=\r\nndi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the up=\r\nlifting \n&gt; &gt;kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and =\r\nreflection, by \n&gt; &gt;discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere disc=\r\nussions on a group such \n&gt; &gt;as this, one makes progress truly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I m=\r\nay not interact regularly or reply at least for a while. However I might \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;participate in some discussions on and off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Satya P=\r\nrakash\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_=\r\npathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I read this mess=\r\nage of respected Narasimha Garu few times. Frankly, i found \n&gt; &gt;it routine =\r\nbecause i found that i know all these already as he has so many times \n&gt; &gt;m=\r\nentioned these things and then it suddenly occoured to me that he has given=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;answer to a very very crucial query which keep on haunting many people=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt;confuse people a lot. I am obviously talking about &quot;Initiation&quot; an=\r\nd he has \n&gt; &gt;really given an answer to this greatly confusing phenomina. I =\r\nam reproducing \n&gt; &gt;this again below. for me i am completely satisfied with =\r\nsimple but very \n&gt; &gt;effective defination. i would draw attention of members=\r\n to following paragraph \n&gt; &gt;again:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to d=\r\no Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do \n&gt; &gt;it with the a=\r\nttitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not know how \n&gt; &gt;to f=\r\nulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any material results or \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept wh=\r\natever \n&gt; &gt;god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrender and make=\r\n spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. Th=\r\nat attitude itself \n&gt; &gt;is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So Its a time =\r\nto say Happy Vijaya Dashami in true sense!

However, one witho=\r\nut a rich father is still better off opening a bank \n&gt; &gt;account with a zero=\r\n balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. \n&gt; &gt;Similarly,=\r\n one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and \n&gt; &gt;bu=\r\nild one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as=\r\n a \n&gt; &gt;formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just g=\r\no ahead and \n&gt; &gt;do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used fo=\r\nr two purposes - (i) for getting \n&gt; &gt;specific material results and (ii) as =\r\ntools of increasing surrender and making \n&gt; &gt;spiritual progress. In the cas=\r\ne of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, \n&gt; &gt;in the case of (i), t=\r\nhere are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. \n&gt; &gt;One can get =\r\nin trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, the=\r\nre are very few people who can do (i) \n&gt; &gt;now-a-days. Nature has destabiliz=\r\ned the whole system, for a reason, as Kali \n&gt; &gt;progressed. I suggest doing =\r\nmantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, \n&gt; &gt;getting whatever mat=\r\nerial results god wants to give and making spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress. If one i=\r\ns meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material \n&gt; &gt;results (for on=\r\neself or others or society/universe in general), Nature will make \n&gt; &gt;arran=\r\ngements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one \n&gt; &gt;s=\r\ntarts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If y=\r\nou want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, \n&gt; &gt;do i=\r\nt with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not know =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any material r=\r\nesults or \n&gt; &gt;spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I wi=\r\nll accept whatever \n&gt; &gt;god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surren=\r\nder and make spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not =\r\nrequired. That attitude itself \n&gt; &gt;is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Ge=\r\nntle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. \n&gt; &gt;Fie=\r\nrce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave this \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from=\r\n a fruit \n&gt; &gt;basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one=\r\n good fruit from \n&gt; &gt;under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gen=\r\ntly and the spillage of \n&gt; &gt;rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If =\r\nthe person is aggressive, one may \n&gt; &gt;do it fast and there may be more spil=\r\nlage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the \n&gt; &gt;good fruit stuck under the =\r\nrotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, \n&gt; &gt;phala of your karmas=\r\n is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and \n&gt; &gt;throw them =\r\nin garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some \n&gt; &gt;spillage=\r\n. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity =\r\nlike \n&gt; &gt;Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, bu=\r\nt the good \n&gt; &gt;fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember=\r\n that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but \n&gt; &gt;fruits of your own ac=\r\ntions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of \n&gt; &gt;those rotten fr=\r\nuits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unabl=\r\ne to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is \n&gt; &gt;better off avoiding =\r\nfierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler \n&gt; &gt;deities. If init=\r\niation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before \n&gt; &gt;starting=\r\n a practice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without \n&gt; &gt;in=\r\nitiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit=\r\n of \n&gt; &gt;your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good results=\r\n. If you are \n&gt; &gt;weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5=\r\n) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of \n&gt; &gt;r=\r\nituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who took several hours to re=\r\nad \n&gt; &gt;Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chan=\r\ndi homam \n&gt; &gt;with entire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them have=\r\n transformed a lot \n&gt; &gt;and have experienced some things too. Obviously, the=\r\ny have done sadhana with \n&gt; &gt;fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divi=\r\nne Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance =\r\nand rank materialism, if someone has even a \n&gt; &gt;faint idea that spiritual p=\r\nrogress is important, is looking for god and is \n&gt; &gt;attracted to a specific=\r\n advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person \n&gt; &gt;obviously has some goo=\r\nd karmas and good vasanas. That person has done that \n&gt; &gt;sadhana in the pas=\r\nt. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If=\r\n you have a good understanding of what is what, how things work, why \n&gt; &gt;on=\r\ne should do something, how to do it, what is more important and what is les=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt;important, that is what initiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best=\r\n regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyo=\r\ntish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that ma=\r\nke a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal opini=\r\non that Strong and long standing urge should be \n&gt; &gt;considered as Initiatio=\r\nn at least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a person who wanted to recite Chan=\r\ndi paatha regularly but was not \n&gt; &gt;able to almost for a year.
