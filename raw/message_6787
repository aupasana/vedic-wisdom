A yogi who considers each sensory experience as an \naahuti (oblation) to the agni (fire) of indwelling Self, does not get \nattached to sensory experiences and remains free from attraction and \naversion for them. Whatever one sees (physically or within the mind!), \nwhatever one hears (physically or within the mind), whatever touch one \nfeels etc, one considers it a sacred offering to the fire of indwelling \nSelf.\n\nSimilarly, whatever action one performs, one considers it as an offering \nto the fire of all-pervading Self and remains free from the sense of \ndoership.\n\nThis is the real internal homam performed by a liberated yogi. This is \nthe goal of sadhana.\n\nHowever, most of us are not able to avoid attraction/aversion for \nvarious sensory experiences and the sense of doership over actions. One \nneeds to purify one&#39;s consciousness to free oneself and prepare for this \ninternal homam. One can perform an external homam to purify and prepare \noneself.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen one feels attraction or aversion for something one perceives \nphysically or mentally, one can try to take a steo back and consider the \nperception itself to be an offering to the fire of Self or Brahman \nburning brightly inside one (and outside too). When feels pride or shame \nfor an action one performed, one can try to take a step back and \nconsider the action to be an offering to the fire of Self or Brahman \nburning brightly everywhere. Even a non-liberated person can try to \nalter one&#39;s thinking slowly, with practice.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
