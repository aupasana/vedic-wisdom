Yet there is a verse in the\nArunachala=\r\n Mahatmyam, which has been selected and translated into Tamil by\nSri Bhagav=\r\nan, that says:\n\nArunachala is truly the holy place. Of all holy places it i=\r\ns the most\nsacred! Know that it is the heart of the world. It is truly Siva=\r\n himself! It\nis his heart-abode, a secret kshetra. In that place the Lord e=\r\nver abides the\nhill of light named Arunachala.\n\nWhenever Sri Bhagavan asked=\r\n about the special sanctity of Arunachala, he\nused to explain that other ho=\r\nly places such as Kailas, Kasi and Chidambaram\nare sacred because they are =\r\nthe abodes of Lord Siva whereas Arunachala is\nLord Siva himself.\n\nThe uniqu=\r\ne sanctity and power of Arunachala-kshetra was once confirmed by an\ninciden=\r\nt that happened in the life of Sri Bhagavan. Because of his great\nlove for =\r\nSri Bhagavan, a certain devotee wanted to take him to his native\nplace, Chi=\r\ndambaram. But rather than directly ask Sri Bhagavan to come to\nChidambaram,=\r\n he began to ask him if he had ever been to see Lord Nataraja in\nChidambara=\r\nm Temple. When Sri Bhagavan replied that he had not, the devotee\nbegan to d=\r\nescribe the greatness of Chidambaram, saying that it was the most\nsacred Si=\r\nva-kshetra in South India, that so many saints and sages had lived\nthere an=\r\nd had sung in praise of Lord Nataraja, and so on and so forth. Sri\nBhagavan=\r\n listened to all he said with patient interest, but showed no signs\nof want=\r\ning to visit Chidambaram.\n\nSeeing this, the devotee at last said, &#39;Chidamba=\r\nram is even greater than\nArunachala, because among the panchabuta lingams [=\r\nthe lingams representing\nthe five elements] Chidambaram is the space-lingam=\r\n while Arunachala is only\nthe fire-lingam. Since the four elements, earth, =\r\nwater, air and fire,\nfinally have to merge in space, space is the principal=\r\n element.&#39;\n\nHearing this, Sri Bhagavan smiled and said, &#39;All the five eleme=\r\nnts come into\nexistence only when Sakti seemingly forsakes her identify wit=\r\nh Lord Siva,\nthe Supreme Self (Paramatman). Since the five elements are thu=\r\ns only the\ncreations of Sakti, she is superior to all of them. Therefore, m=\r\nore\nimportant than the place where the elements merge, is the place where S=\r\nakti\nherself merges. Because Sakti is dancing in Chidambaram, Lord Siva has=\r\n to\ndance before her and thereby make her become motionless. But in Arunach=\r\nala\nLord Siva remains ever motionless (achala), and hence Sakti automatical=\r\nly\nand effortlessly merges in him through great love. Therefore, Arunachala=\r\n\nshines as the foremost and most powerful kshetra, because here Sakti, who\n=\r\nhas seemingly created all this manifold appearance, herself merges into the=\r\n\nLord. So for those mature aspirants who seek to put an end to the false\nap=\r\npearance of duality, the most powerful help is to be found only in\nArunacha=\r\nla-kshetra.&#39;\n\nSri Bhagavan summarized this reply of his in the form of a ve=\r\nrse, which\nlater became the first verse of Sri Arunachala Navamanimalai. In=\r\n this verse\nhe says:\n\nThough he is truly motionless by nature, in the court=\r\n [of Chidambaram] Lord\nSiva dances before Sakti, thereby making her motionl=\r\ness. But know that [in\nTiruvannamalai] Lord Arunachala shines triumphant, t=\r\nhat Sakti having merged\nin his motionless form.\n\nSources:\n\n1) Arunachala&#39;s =\r\nRamana Volume 1 Book\n\n2) http://www.davidgodman.org/asaints/powerofa1.shtml=\r\n\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000325560f9ebba0b5047a592dba\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIn India there are countless h=\r\noly places (kshetras) that are sacred to Lord Siva or to some other name an=\r\nd form of God, and many of them are more well-known and popular than Arunac=\r\nhala.
