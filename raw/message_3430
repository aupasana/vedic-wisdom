Suddenly one of the visitors started weeping bitterly.\n\n&#39;I am a h=\r\norrible sinner. For a long time I have been coming to you, but there is no =\r\nchange in me. Can I become pure at last? How long am I to wait? When I am h=\r\nere near you, I am good for a time. But when I leave this place, I become a=\r\n beast again. You cannot imagine how bad I can be -- hardly a human being. =\r\nAm I to remain a sinner forever?&#39;\n\n&#39;Why do you come to me? What have I to d=\r\no with you?&#39; demanded Bhagavan. &#39;What is there between us that you should c=\r\nome here and weep and cry in front of me?&#39;\n\nThe man started moaning and cry=\r\ning even more, as if his heart were breaking.\n\n&#39;All my hopes of salvation a=\r\nre gone. You were my last refuge and you say you have nothing to do with me=\r\n! To whom shall I turn now? What am I to do? To whom am I to go?&#39;\n\nBhagavan=\r\n watched him for some time and said, &#39;Am I your Guru that I should be respo=\r\nnsible for your salvation? Have I ever said that I am your Master?&#39;\n\n&#39;If yo=\r\nu are not my Master, then who is? And who are you, if not my Master? You ar=\r\ne my Guru. You are my guardian angel. You must take pity me and release me =\r\nfrom my sins!&#39;\n\nHe started sobbing and crying again.\n\nWe all sat silent, ov=\r\nercome with pity. Only Bhagavan looked alert and matter-of-fact.\n\n&#39;If I am =\r\nyour Guru, what are my fees? Surely you should pay me for my services.&#39;\n\n&#39;B=\r\nut you won&#39;t take anything,&#39; cried the visitor. &#39;What can I give you?&#39;\n\n&#39;Di=\r\nd I ever say that I don&#39;t take anything? And did you ever ask me what you c=\r\nan give me?&#39;\n\n&#39;If you would take, then ask me. There is nothing I would not=\r\n give you.&#39;\n\n&#39;All right. Now I am asking. Give me. What will you give me?&#39;\n=\r\n\n&#39;Take anything. Everything I have is yours.&#39;\n\n&#39;Then give me all the good y=\r\nou have done in this world.&#39;\n\n&#39;What good could I have done? I have not a si=\r\nngle virtue to my credit.&#39;\n\n&#39;You have promised to give. Now give. Don&#39;t tal=\r\nk of your credit. Just give away all the good you have done in your past.&#39;\n=\r\n\n&#39;Yes, I shall give. But how does one give? Tell me how the giving is done =\r\nand I shall give.&#39;\n\n&#39;Say like this: &quot;All the good I have done in the past I=\r\n am giving away entirely to my Guru. Henceforth I have no merit from it nor=\r\n have I any concern with it.&quot; Say it with your whole heart.&#39;\n\n&#39;All right, S=\r\nwami. &quot;I am giving away to you all the good I have done so far, if I have d=\r\none any, and all its good effects. I am giving it to you gladly, for you ar=\r\ne my Master and you are asking me to give it all away to you.&#39;\n\n&#39;But this i=\r\ns not enough,&#39; said Bhagavan sternly.\n\n&#39;I gave you all I have and all you a=\r\nsked me to give. I have nothing more to give.&#39;\n\n&#39;No, you have. Give me all =\r\nyour sins.&#39;\n\nThe man looked wildly at Bhagavan, terror stricken.=C2=A0\n\n&#39;Yo=\r\nu do not know, Swami, what you are asking for. If you knew, you would not a=\r\nsk me. If you take over my sins, your body will rot and burn. You do not kn=\r\now me, you do not know my sins. Please do not ask me for my sins.&#39;=C2=A0\n\nH=\r\ne wept bitterly.\n\n&#39;I shall look after myself. Don&#39;t you worry about me,&#39; sa=\r\nid Bhagavan. &#39;All I want from you is your sins.&#39;\n\nFor a long time the barga=\r\nin would not go through. The man refused to part with his sins. But Bhagava=\r\nn was adamant.\n\n&#39;Either give me your sins along with your merits, or keep b=\r\noth and don&#39;t think of me as your Master.&quot;\n\nIn the end the visitor&#39;s scrupl=\r\nes broke down and he declared, &#39;Whatever sins I have done, they are no long=\r\ner mine. All of them and their results, too, belong to Ramana.&#39;\n\nBhagavan s=\r\neemed to be satisfied. &#39;From now on there is no good nor bad in you. You ar=\r\ne just pure. Go and do nothing, either good or bad. Remain yourself. Remain=\r\n what you are.&#39;\n\nA great peace fell over the man and over us all. No one kn=\r\nows what happened to the fortunate visitor, for he was never seen in the as=\r\nhram again. He might have had no further need to come.\n\nSource: From the Kr=\r\nishna Bhikshu chapter in The Power of the Presence, Part Three, by David Go=\r\ndman\n\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=\r\n=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 \n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =\r\n=C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82 \n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n =\r\n     The INTERNET now has a personality.
