I thank you for guiding me so detailed... without your=\r\n manual it would never be possible.\n\nInteresting point to note, that in Dec=\r\n of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Brahmin family for about 10 days=\r\n and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing homam! However I was d=\r\nisappoint because their procedure was so big that it would take about 3 hou=\r\nrs for the homam, and many more materials also. Of course, they learnt it f=\r\nrom &#39;guru-kulam&#39; and it was their own tradition. They are not a modern rese=\r\narcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who could compare many traditions, research =\r\non them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had no idea that a s=\r\nhorter version is possible, or something can be left out. As an example, th=\r\ney suggested a mantadory japam of 10x times before I do an &#39;x&#39; times offeri=\r\nng in homam, and many more formalities.\n\nSo, I knew in Bangladesh I would n=\r\never have so much materials needed, and I would not be able to perform a 3 =\r\nhour homam regularly, so it was of no use. \n\nMuch later when I was reading =\r\nyour manual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :-=\r\n)\n\nAnyway Ji...\n\nEverything was almost as per recommendation, except I used=\r\n a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I couldn&#39;t manage a wooden spoon e=\r\nven after a lot of effort. May be I have to order it... but I will have to =\r\nwork much hard to find a craft-man who can make a spoon with wood.\n\nI burnt=\r\n the fire with mango-wood and jute-sticks.\n\nPurnahuti with ghee only.\n\nThat=\r\n WAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an idea how fast the =\r\nwoods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I knew that with =\r\na big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire will not survive long to allo=\r\nw me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning out fast.\n\nSo I c=\r\nould not meditate.\n\nMy first Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can =\r\nI make the fire last long so that it burns for at least 10 mins allowing me=\r\n mediate? I noted even if I had put much wood, they would still burn out fa=\r\nst...\n\nOffering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing that would k=\r\neep the fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.\n\nAnother Q. - 2) I h=\r\nave sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I can dry them=\r\n no matter how long it takes, so that I can use them as suggested in the ma=\r\nnual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut so much that =\r\nit becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts... b=\r\nut if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rotten=\r\n or something? Any procedure? I am asking this because here no one has any =\r\nidea about that, because no one even thinks of having &quot;burnable&quot; full cocon=\r\nuts. That is why.\n\nMantras work very strong for me. But I feel not strong e=\r\nnough for big spiritual or material effects. I have had very strong experie=\r\nnces with homam before while performing with others. Even a few times I *ar=\r\nranged* homams for others and I always directly felt a strong effect workin=\r\ng on me also.\n\nToday with the homam, the effect was not that strong. I know=\r\n why, because it was a super-short homam, with many mantras left. Also, I s=\r\nhould honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva =\r\nin the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worried an=\r\nd nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their presence=\r\n. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.\n\nI am going to add man=\r\ntras from the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed in all homam=\r\ns like Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I guess Avahana-r=\r\nelated Sanskrit mantras are very important.\n\nBy the way I did 108 offerings=\r\n with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with the smallest Shani=\r\n mantra again.\n\nI am thankful to the ultimate divinity that at least I didn=\r\n&#39;t have any negative experience after the homam. I was pretty nervous about=\r\n the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 when I started mantras, al=\r\nmost everyday I faced negative energies for the imperfection of pronunciati=\r\non and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so strong. But I didn&#39;t giv=\r\ne up and tried to understand the correct ways because since I saw the power=\r\n in it, I had to find what&#39;s the right way to get the pure blessings, avoid=\r\ning mistakes.\n\nAs an example, you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to stay in an e=\r\nmpty stomach while doing homam. I find this 100% true from my mantra japam =\r\nexperience. Though no website or almost no one instructed me to stay empty =\r\nstomached in japam, I found that mantras work very strong with empty stomac=\r\nh. Also, I always got strong negative effects when I did japam after my din=\r\nner. Thus, I learned this from my own experience but after a lot of trouble=\r\ns faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now days, I can&#39;t eat anything aft=\r\ner my lunch... because I do mantras in the evening. At times it becomes ver=\r\ny difficult not to eat something as I sometimes hang out with friends etc. =\r\nat afternoon or early evening. But I have no choice.\n\nThat is the thing I a=\r\nppreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very important] t=\r\nhings always mentioned.\n\nSame thing about your instruction of minimum movem=\r\nent of the body, I find it very correct.\n\nAnyway Ji I guess I am stretching=\r\n my mail very long...\n\nmy 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani as=\r\n an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer other =\r\nGods&#39; mantras in fire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way, or at least=\r\n a homam for 6-7 grahas?\n\n4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order such=\r\n as Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?\n\n5) Is there any exceptional instructio=\r\nn while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?\n\nWanted to m=\r\nention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and other deitie=\r\ns but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these additional q=\r\nuestions about graha-homams.\n\nAppreciate your time to answer me.\n\nThanking =\r\nyou again,\nTanvir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n---848367683-818788774-1332753874=:60836\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;I believe that it doesn&#39;t matter if you =\r\nperform homam for 3hrs or 3 mins and with many materials or little material=\r\ns.

Thus, I learned this from my own exp=\r\nerience but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong practices I did]! =\r\nNow days, I can&#39;t eat anything after my lunch... because I do mantras in th=\r\ne evening. At times it becomes very difficult not to eat something as I som=\r\netimes hang out with friends etc. at afternoon or early evening. But I have=\r\n no choice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That is the thing I appreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] =\r\nto make the small [yet very important] things always mentioned.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Same=\r\n thing about your instruction of minimum movement of the body, I find it ve=\r\nry correct.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyway Ji I guess I am stretching my mail very long...&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;my 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani as an expression of=\r\n the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer other Gods&#39; mantras in =\r\nfire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way, or at least a homam for 6-7 =\r\ngrahas?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4) If yes, should I maintain the graha\n order such as Surya,=\r\n Chandra, Kuja and so on?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5) Is there any exceptional instruction wh=\r\nile doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wanted to=\r\n mention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and other deit=\r\nies but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these additional=\r\n questions about graha-homams.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Appreciate your time to answer me.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanking you again,&lt;BR&gt;Tanvir&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQU=\r\nOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n---848367683-818788774-1332753874=:60836--\r\n\n"}}
