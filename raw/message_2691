It see=\r\nms to be his extrapolation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; What you quoted from Taittariya Upanishad=\r\n is the traditional view that I am familiar with. Other scriptures refer to=\r\n the same order of creation, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, where Maharshi V=\r\nasishtha teaches creation, destruction and liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; This Upanishadic understanding is also consistent =\r\nwith chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five chakras downwards from =\r\nVisuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water an=\r\nd earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is su=\r\nrrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effaced in one&#39;s self-aware=\r\nness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water element within one is su=\r\nrrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are effaced in one&#39;s self-aware=\r\nness. And so on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; By earth and water etc, don&#39;t just think of physical=\r\n earth and physical water etc. Earth element shows a solid state of existen=\r\nce. Water element shows a flexible and fluid state of existence. For exampl=\r\ne, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse,=\r\n some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of earth element. An idea t=\r\nhat one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowl=\r\nedge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus, different mental concept=\r\ns and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one thinks of &quot;I=\r\n&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way ph=\r\nysically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone w=\r\nho has certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those =\r\nconcepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini =\r\nrepresents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra,=\r\n if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of wh=\r\no one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra,=\r\n if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative=\r\n idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Many people who ta=\r\nlk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often talking merel=\r\ny about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which may still be =\r\na nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini actually being ther=\r\ne. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid b=\r\nody, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini =\r\nmoves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of w=\r\nho one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of existence! To com=\r\npletely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), ev=\r\nen for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The order in whi=\r\nch elements are effaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water=\r\n, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced elements retu=\r\nrn to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, water and earth.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regarding physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Does physics describe reality?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Physics tries to describe/model real=\r\nity at the gross physical level, as perceived by the external senses. Howev=\r\ner, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses playing a =\r\nrole.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in whic=\r\nh one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. =\r\nIn another example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense foc=\r\nus and &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be =\r\nperceived by the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern scie=\r\nnce.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that can be perc=\r\neived by the external senses, because different people can experience the s=\r\name reality using their senses individually and verify the observation. How=\r\never, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are s=\r\nometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liberat=\r\ning influence on people. Inability to study and model them is a big drawbac=\r\nk of modern science.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One may categorize dre=\r\nams and internal yogic experiences as imaginations or hallucinations, becau=\r\nse there is no independent validation, and call them unworthy of a study. B=\r\nut there are cases that make one wonder. For example, see the following mes=\r\nsages from the archives.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mystical experiences of mind and mantras (me=\r\nssage 951)\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n&gt;  \n&gt; I=\r\nn the above message, one person had a specific yogic experience that was de=\r\nscribed in detail and another person seemed to know about it and supplied o=\r\nne tangible detail relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;obse=\r\nrved&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was beyond the external=\r\n senses of either person!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/391\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the above message also, one p=\r\nerson had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and anot=\r\nher person seemed to know about it and supplied a couple of tangible detail=\r\ns relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experie=\r\nnce of the first person, though it was beyond the external senses of either=\r\n person!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the above message, one =\r\nperson had a specific yogic experience involving a deity and another person=\r\n perceived with his external senses a vision involving the same deity, thou=\r\ngh others in the room could not perceive anything with their external sense=\r\ns, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first=\r\n person through a specific prism.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Such exam=\r\nples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *some* experiences=\r\n that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses are observable=\r\n by others, though not everyone may be able to observe. Then, one cannot ru=\r\nle out the possibility of *some* experiences that cannot be measured or per=\r\nceived by the external senses being a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can a=\r\nccess.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, how can modern science study it?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Because the only t=\r\nhing that can be studied and measured is the reality involving the gross bo=\r\ndy and its senses, one may suggest that experiences of the subtle body may =\r\nbe studied by observing various parts of the gross physical body. For examp=\r\nle, one can look at the nervous signals flowing through various parts of th=\r\ne brain and try to correlate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that sub=\r\ntle body and causal body are redundant. Though there is some correspondence=\r\n between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-=\r\nto-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept of =\r\ncausal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model can b=\r\ne moderled using just the gross body!\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you drive through a neighbor=\r\nhood and observe the houses from the road, you can have *some* idea of what=\r\n is going on. A particular house with a lot of lights and sound and many ca=\r\nrs parked outside may be having a party. People in one particular house wit=\r\nh no lights are probably out of town. But you can never be sure what is goi=\r\nng on in the house, how many people are inside, what exactly they are doing=\r\n etc, by merely looking at the house from outside.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, by look=\r\ning at the nervous signals in various points of the brain, you may be able =\r\nto see some basic things, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind =\r\nare beyond your reach and study, if your tools are limited to the gross phy=\r\nsical domain.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Unfortunately, modern science=\r\n cannot study that part of the reality which is beyond the scope of externa=\r\nl senses, unless scientists become yogis and develop mastery of the interna=\r\nl world.\n&gt;  \n&gt; While rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal wo=\r\nrld (which is the microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any s=\r\npace-time point, even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their stat=\r\ne completely. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experie=\r\nnce some part of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where=\r\n Kundalini goes and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes=\r\n. Rishis seemed to have a perfect control.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarp=\r\nanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://=\r\nvedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaga=\r\nnnath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Sorry the previo=\r\nus mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Let me ment=\r\nion some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized =\r\nYogi of the highest order) - it maybe of some help to you. He did mention i=\r\nn details about the process of creation as he saw it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; As per him,=\r\n at the beginning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then from there came the=\r\n &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produce=\r\nd some universal energies which are more commonly known as the universal de=\r\nities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of =\r\nthese are the actual physical elements as we see it, but more the essence o=\r\nf the element, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose int=\r\neraction with the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this =\r\nway came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previous and e=\r\nach one resulting in some energy states, which in the end resulted in 33 cr=\r\nore possible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; There is some lesson in there (at =\r\nleast for me), and I want to get at it..

There being multiple theor=\r\nies of the String variety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory =\r\n(11 dimensional one) is one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts s=\r\nome aspects of the physical world. Finding a correlation between this and t=\r\nhe idea of the five elements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I=\r\n can understand some correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least=\r\n the Copenhegan Interpretation), non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian =\r\nmysticism, but a link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta?!..\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Wel=\r\nl, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know more about h=\r\now exactly you can link these two, because I myself with my limited underst=\r\nand fail to see any viable correlation at all as of now, specially, since t=\r\nhe M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The other thing one m=\r\nust think about is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics de=\r\nscribe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two are differ=\r\nent. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exa=\r\nctly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quoted =\r\nthat everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it re=\r\nally is!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost th=\r\ne essence of everything.
