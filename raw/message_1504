Namely, the Sahasranama already has the Dhyana =\r\nSloka and other preliminaries which are by now very well known to most of u=\r\ns. So isn&#39;t it a simple matter of using these, doing the prana prathistha o=\r\nf Lord Narayana or Lord Krishna and then using each verse for one offering =\r\nto the fire?\n&gt; \n&gt; There is also a detailed anga nyaasa procedure available =\r\nhere\n&gt; http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/shivkuma/personal/music/vishnu-sah=\r\nasranamam-meanings.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; if one wishes to do these.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any comments?\n&gt;=\r\n  Namaskaram, \n   As you said prana prathistah  of  &quot;Narayan&quot; for Homa ever=\r\ny day, i didn&#39;t  read  anywhere, But  i know that starting  day of &quot;Uttaray=\r\nan&quot; that is the next day of Makara Sankranti, 13th or 14th  of January of e=\r\nvery year, &quot;The Narayana yagnam&quot; is conducting by DR.Vedavyas, at Rajahmund=\r\nry, duddukuru venkateswara swamy temple past 45 years, i had listened that =\r\nmany mircles happened, i too tried to attend the yagna, but its not happene=\r\nd, \nBut i am doing HOMA or YAGNA every day morning and evening starts at 5A=\r\nM and 5PM. That i feel my stomach is homa gund, and reading vishnu shasrana=\r\nmas along with purva phittika and uttara phittika for the time of 29mint 30=\r\n sec. say exact 30mint, and i go to Dhyana with &quot;Asthaksari mantra&quot; as long=\r\n as i concentrate, cause i can not move my hands and lggs, and  i am a bedr=\r\nidden, they are not in my control, only i can move my hand fingers. All i d=\r\no this on my bed only, i don&#39;t know its correct or not? If any thing wrong =\r\nin this please let me know.\nIn my search of learning of Astrology i found G=\r\nuru Narasimha ji, and i convinced his teachings of Astrology,\nAnd i request=\r\n you to tell me about &quot;Vishnu sahasra nama prayoga HOMA&quot;\n\nThanking YOU all.=\r\n\nNamaskaram Narasimha ji,\n\n\n"}}
