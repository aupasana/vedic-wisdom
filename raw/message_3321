Although it was useful, I feel it didnt really get to the crux =\r\nof the matter. I have for a while been pondering how to pose the question i=\r\nn the correct way in order to elicit, from you or anyone else, the level of=\r\n answers that I would like to see. I&#39;ll make an attempt now, I would ask on=\r\nly that you read the whole post..\n\nFirst, contrary to what most people on t=\r\nhis group probably believe, I feel it is best to start, in intellectual dis=\r\ncussion at least, with the western concept of consciousness. The reason is =\r\nthat western-style inquiry/explanations always originate from sensory obser=\r\nvables - which are of *common experience to all*, whereas eastern-style inq=\r\nuiry/explanations may originate from sometimes non-sensory observables, whi=\r\nch lead to many misconceptions/subjective interpretations. So if we are to =\r\nreach an understanding that is to some degree objective, it is best to star=\r\nt from some common ground.\n\nFor this purpose, I&#39;ll take Carl Jung&#39;s definit=\r\nions as a starting point. What is ego? From his point of view, ego is one&#39;s=\r\n everyday field of consciousness. What is one conscious of? Things reported=\r\n by the senses - the material universe. But also feelings and memories, whi=\r\nch have no material representation - they are not &quot;gathered&quot; by the senses =\r\nas the material world is. What is the feeling of &quot;I&quot;? It is the center of t=\r\nhe ego, that gives the ego a feeling of oneness. However, this ego is not a=\r\n solid circle i.e if the inside of the circle is the contents of the consci=\r\nousness, it is not as if the center is a content of consciousness too! The =\r\nego is more like a doughnut, with the empty central part being what Jung ca=\r\nlls, naturally, the unconscious. We all feel whole i.e. my hand is mine, my=\r\n leg is mine, the memory of savoring a mango last night is also mine, but a=\r\nm I the hand - no; am I the leg - no; am I the memory - no; I&#39;ll still be I=\r\n without them, though maybe not a happy I. So all this is consistent with t=\r\nhe doughnut model - an invisible I in the center, conscious of the edible p=\r\nart of the doughnut.\n\nAt this point, even the least spiritual of people wou=\r\nld be hard pressed to disagree with me. So from my point of view, this is g=\r\nood and common ground i.e. a good point from where to start investigating v=\r\nedic definitions. \n\nSo at this point, I&#39;ll pose my first set of questions -=\r\n Where does this doughnut fit vis-a-vis the antahakarana? Is the doughnut i=\r\nnside the manas with the ahamkara at the invisible center? Or is the doughn=\r\nut in the physical body with the entire antahakarana at the invisible cente=\r\nr? Either way, when you raise kundalini/attempt spiritual awakening, you ar=\r\ne pushing the inside of the doughnut toward the center, right? \n\nI can get =\r\nto more questions as and when you reply..\n\n\nRegards,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
