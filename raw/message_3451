It is no doubt as you said written by a great b=\r\neing . Vimalananda in his book mentions three karmas which cannot be easily=\r\n gotten rid of and are very terrible by nature and might take an immense am=\r\nount of lifetimes to even clear.\n\nThe two I remember are Killing of one&#39;s g=\r\nuru and rape . \n\nNow the doubt that has arisen in my mind is this\n\n1.How do=\r\n we know whether a thing that is happening now is an reaction to an past ac=\r\ntion or a fresh action being set forth in this lifetime...\n\nThe learned gur=\r\nujan&#39;s on the board might question ..Is there really a use by knowing that =\r\nsince either way the action is taking place and cannot be stopped.\n\nThe rea=\r\nson I ask this is  ...the mother goddess is described as\n\n&quot; Ati Soumyati Ro=\r\nudrayai Nathastasyai namo namah &quot;\n\nShe is the most pleasing among beautiful=\r\n things and the most ferocious among terrible things ...There is no relativ=\r\ne scale of good or bad for nature ( Ramarkrishna&#39;s parable of Devi Kali bri=\r\nnging up a child and killing it ) ....I fully understand good or bad exists=\r\n only in the human mind.\n\nBut if a certain act right now is not happening a=\r\ns a reaction to a past act... What on earth can possibly cause a person to =\r\ndo such a severe act.  \n\n:( And how should one console a person who has und=\r\nergone such a punishment....\n\nOne more reason for me asking this is ...A lo=\r\nt of great gurus have always said &quot; Whatever happening in the world right n=\r\now is Mangala and the very form of Shiva himself &quot;\n\nHow can I reconcile suc=\r\nh acts of violence happening in this kali yuga as Mangala especially some o=\r\nf the henious acts ....which brings back my original question...Are these h=\r\nappening more in number in kali yuga as a reaction of the souls who needed =\r\nthis punishment being born in greater numbers now...or are these a fresh se=\r\nt of acts.\n\n\nI do not know whether my questions would make sense. If you co=\r\nuld answer them would help me in clearing some confusion.\n\n\nPranams\n\nVempar=\r\nla Ram Kishore  \n\n\n\n\n"}}
