You cannot say that even begging =\r\nfor bread is a binding rule on a sannyasin. That is not a desire and the sa=\r\nnnyasin is virtually a mendicant without rules binding him. He is not liabl=\r\ne to any kind of command. Even one who does not know Brahman but who is des=\r\nirous of emancipation should enter into the order of a sannyasin. The sruti=\r\n says: =E2=80=9CLet one live in the order of sannyasa which is a means to t=\r\nhe knowledge of Brahman.=E2=80=9D Brahmacharya may help one to attain knowl=\r\nedge but it is not the case with a householder. When a means is not properl=\r\ny followed it can never accomplish any object. The heavenly bliss of the ka=\r\nrma-kandin is only a form of worldly enjoyment. Heaven is only another worl=\r\nd. If one professes to have knowledge he cannot do actions, for actions are=\r\n worldly. The atman is entirely opposed to action and hence it cannot be an=\r\n auxiliary to the knowledge of it. The sruti says: =E2=80=9CWhen to him eve=\r\nrything has become the Self, who should see what and through what should on=\r\ne see?=E2=80=9D etc. This nullifies the meaning of actions in one who has k=\r\nnowledge. \n\n\n"}}
