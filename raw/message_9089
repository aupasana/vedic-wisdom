Some these very questions I&#39;ve asked myself=\r\n and I am\ngrateful that you&#39;ve answered them today!!\n\nI am wondering if you=\r\n could please also express your views on the\nfollowing three questions:\n\n  =\r\n               1. How does nishkam karma works? In other words, when a\ndoer=\r\n detaches himself from an action, where does the reaction goes?  I\nmean the=\r\n reaction has to be experienced by someone or something, right?\nFor example=\r\n, in Mahabharata, after Lord Krishna&#39;s deliverance of Shrimad\nbhagwad Gita,=\r\n when Arjuna  fought in war, if we have to assume those\nactions were perfor=\r\nmed as detached from the doer, who gets all the\nbalancing reactions?  Or le=\r\nt&#39;s assume that a mahapurusha X performs\nsome nishkam action, which is perc=\r\neived by some other person Y as not\nfavorable and thus makes him/her enough=\r\n angry+sad that in ordinary\ncircumstance it will equate to Y cursing X and =\r\nX have to eventually\nsuffer equivalent effect(and so would Y) . In our scen=\r\nario if X&#39;s\naction were truly detached, where does the curse from Y end up?=\r\n\n\n                 2. As per Shri Vimalanda, you may also offer all the\nkar=\r\nmas as Homa to inner devas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is\nlesse=\r\nr of suffering if you do that. Who gets the remaining delta\nsuffering?\n\n   =\r\n              3. Something of a fashion now a days in current western\ncultu=\r\nre (TV shows and what not) is something called law-of-attraction\n(something=\r\n popular in current western culture).is it merely rearranging\nof karmas or =\r\nthe `positive-thinking&#39; involved actually changing\nthem at some level (subt=\r\nle )? Link:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(book)\n&lt;http://en.wikip=\r\nedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(book)&gt;   .Is it really\npossible that ordinary peo=\r\nple are capable of somehow rearranging their\nown karma pipeline out of inte=\r\nnse desire and get the things they want?\n\n                 As always, thank=\r\ns for all you say and do. Your writings\nare treasure for seekers.\n\nRegards\n=\r\n\nKshraum\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I will add\nmy 2 cents.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2  =C2  =\r\n=C2 =C2  *=C2  =C2  =C2 =C2  *\n&gt; =C2 The cosmos runs based on the fundament=\r\nal law that each action\n(karma) gives a reaction/result (karmaphala) commen=\r\nsurate with it.\nShakti is the sum total of all the beings with various agen=\r\ndas engaging\nin various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purush=\r\na is the\nwitness of it all.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Though each karma should give karmaphal=\r\na that is commensurate with it,\nthat requires an *agent* to deliver the kar=\r\nmaphala, i.e. another being.\nSo this requires a complicated balancing act o=\r\nn part of Cosmic\nCumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are =\r\nvery\ncomplicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and\npick=\r\ning of agents for their delivery.\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; At any time, some karmas from o=\r\nne&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must\nexperience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool, s=\r\nome karmas in a &quot;preferably\nexperience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and th=\r\ne rest in the third pool\nwhich may not be experienced anytime soon. The way=\r\n karmas are assigned\nand ordered in these pools is based on the balancing o=\r\nf karma/karmaphala\nsequencing of all beings.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; The assignment and ord=\r\nering of these pools will constantly undergo\nchurn as one engages in variou=\r\ns new actions and adds them to the pools.\nAlso, as new people enter one&#39;s l=\r\nife, possibilities in terms of\nkarmaphala delivery agents and sequencing ma=\r\ny change and hence the pools\nmay be re-arranged.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; As one engages in reme=\r\ndial measures such as prayers, fasting,\ndonations etc, one may transform on=\r\ne&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s\nvulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with =\r\nother beings\n(including planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of =\r\ndelivery\nof karmaphala, who operate through other people who act as physica=\r\nl\nagents of delivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result.\nSom=\r\ne undesirable karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down\nin or=\r\nder within the same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded\nto a hi=\r\ngher pool or pushed up in order within the same pool.\n&gt; =C2 When someone cu=\r\nrses or blesses one, with sufficient mental force\nbehind it (this is the ke=\r\ny), the same thing can happen. It is all about\nre-arranging karmas between =\r\nthe karmik pools. Every action by one, or\neven people around one, has the p=\r\notential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik\npools. A karma about to give karmaphala=\r\n may be postponed or a karma that\nwas not to give karmaphala anytime soon m=\r\nay be advanced sooner.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; However, remember that the remedial measure =\r\nhas to be as intense as\nthe karma that it is trying to manipulate. You can =\r\nmove a small rock\nwith small force, but you need a large force to move a bi=\r\ng rock or a\nhill.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt; If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool tha=\r\nt can give a specific\nresult, nobody can make one experience that result, n=\r\no matter what\nritual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of nega=\r\ntive karmas\nin their optional pool and even evil people have a lot of posit=\r\nive\nkarmas in their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and\n=\r\nblessings can often make some difference.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; This point is well illust=\r\nrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber\nji referred in his point (3).\n&gt;=\r\n =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt; If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is\nmis=\r\ntakened. God is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism\ntowards t=\r\nhose who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a\nwitness to th=\r\ne play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the\npower that impar=\r\ntially and impassionately manages the fine balance and\norder within this pl=\r\nay of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in\nHer eyes, from the lowest=\r\n of evil persons to the noblest of saints. She\nadministers just and balance=\r\nd delivery of fruits to actions using\navailable agents.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; The karmas =\r\nwe committed in the past are already in the pipeline and\nwill give their re=\r\nsults sooner or later. The best we can do with them,\nwith some effort, is t=\r\no perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most\nimportant thing is to not add mor=\r\ne serious bad karmas to the pipeline\nnow. Simply put, selfish actions and a=\r\nctions that cause pain or harm to\nothers are bad karmas and selfless action=\r\ns and actions that cause\npleasure or benefit to others are good karmas.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline of karmas\nawa=\r\niting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current action, yes,\nit is p=\r\nossible and general guidelines are available in shastras, but we\ncan&#39;t be c=\r\nertain about the specific impact of each action. One thing is\nfor sure - re=\r\nmedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be\ncommensurate with the karma=\r\n itself.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; You need only small force to push a cat out of your way, b=\r\nut need a\nlarge force to push an elephant.\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: A=\r\njit Krishnan ajit.krishnan@...\n&gt; &gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Sent:=\r\n Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] few que=\r\nstions\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2\n&gt; &gt;Dear=C2 Digamber,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no=\r\n royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed\nby the courtiers to randomly=\r\n pick the next king.

Purusha is the witness of it a=\r\nll.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though each karma should give karmaphala that=\r\n is commensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the karmaphal=\r\na, i.e. another being. So this requires a complicated balancing act on part=\r\n of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very c=\r\nomplicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking of=\r\n agents for their delivery.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; At any time,=\r\n some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in=\r\n this life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in thi=\r\ns life&quot; pool and the rest in the third pool which may not be experienced an=\r\nytime soon. The way karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is based=\r\n on the balancing of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The assignment and ordering of these pools will constantly u=\r\nndergo churn as one engages in various new actions and adds them to the poo=\r\nls. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, possibilities in terms of karmaph=\r\nala delivery agents and sequencing may change and hence the pools may be re=\r\n-arranged.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=\r\n=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=\r\n=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As one engages in remedial m=\r\neasures such as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s na=\r\nture, change one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other =\r\nbeings (including planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delive=\r\nry of karmaphala, who operate through other people who act as physical agen=\r\nts of delivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some unde=\r\nsirable karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order wi=\r\nthin the same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher p=\r\nool or pushed up in order within the same pool.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;When someo=\r\nne curses or blesses one, with sufficient mental force behind it (this is t=\r\nhe key), the same thing can happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas bet=\r\nween the karmik pools. Every action by one, or even people around one, has =\r\nthe potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to give karma=\r\nphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karmaphala anytime s=\r\noon may be advanced sooner.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, remember tha=\r\nt the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma that it is trying =\r\nto manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force, but you need a l=\r\narge force to move a big rock or a hill.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a specific resul=\r\nt, nobody can make one experience that result, no matter what ritual one do=\r\nes. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in their option=\r\nal pool and even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in their optiona=\r\nl pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can often make so=\r\nme difference.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This point is well illustrated by =\r\nthe &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=\r\n=C2&nbsp; *=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of=\r\n one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings, who may=\r\n show favoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect=\r\n of God is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of G=\r\nod is the power that impartially and impassionately manages the fine balanc=\r\ne and order within this play of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in=\r\n Her eyes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of saints. She ad=\r\nministers just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using available a=\r\ngents.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The karmas we committed in the past are al=\r\nready in the pipeline and will give their results sooner or later. The best=\r\n we can do with them, with some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat=\r\n. The most important thing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pip=\r\neline now. Simply put, selfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm =\r\nto others are bad karmas and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasu=\r\nre or benefit to others are good karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When it =\r\ncomes to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting karmapha=\r\nla, through conscious effort and current action, yes, it is possible and ge=\r\nneral guidelines are available in shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about t=\r\nhe specific impact of each action. One thing is for sure - remedial measure=\r\n for overcoming a karma has to be commensurate with the karma itself.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; You need only small force to push a cat out of your wa=\r\ny, but need a large force to push an elephant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Astrology &=\r\namp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -------=\r\n-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;________________________________&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan ajit.krishnan@...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;To: vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=C2&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Dear=C2&nbsp;Digamber,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special ele=\r\nphant was appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, =\r\nit was possible for a beggar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose karma=\r\n is this?=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha gives tw=\r\no answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king, and all the citize=\r\nns, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Everything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him=\r\n a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the =\r\nking. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the=\r\n king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and =\r\naccept the result.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;The sanskrit word =\r\n&quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curses that we see=\r\n are for the benefit of mankind, and are actually blessings. At the end of =\r\nthe day, some people with a certain amount of purity of speech discharge th=\r\neir tapas shakti through speech.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;When=\r\n it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumptio=\r\nn. We assume that there is a person, and separate from the person are his m=\r\nany karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We the=\r\nn want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipe=\r\nline.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;pe=\r\nrson&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. And you are noth=\r\ning but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaas=\r\nanaas are your karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;If you can cha=\r\nnge your vaasanaas, you have changed your karma. Or course, that is easier =\r\nsaid than done.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Any moment when your =\r\nmind becomes quiet is a blessing. Any moment when your mind becomes agitate=\r\nd is a curse.

I vaguely remember Vimalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s =\r\ncurse in Aghora trilogy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(2) On similar note, what happens =\r\nwhen you get `blessings&#39; say from a saint or elders? We also come across lo=\r\nt of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapa=\r\nti =E2=80&quot; what do this items really do if they work? Something similar wit=\r\nh wearing gemstones for planets =E2=80&quot; do they bring forward good karmas o=\r\nr they create new ones?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from fam=\r\nous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady=\r\n cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we wor=\r\nship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but=\r\n later tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next bi=\r\nrth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to=\r\n recollect this episode from old memory]. So question I have is, does our s=\r\nadhana change karmaphal to a great extent or it is just our perception that=\r\n changes?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanking you,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Digamber&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n\r\n--6-7787110076-7788354368=:8--\r\n\n"}}
