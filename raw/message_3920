Al=\r\nso, the significance of the names Kaushiki and\nKalika\n\n2) The significance =\r\nof 5 salutations to the goddess during the Stuti in\nthe 5th chapter (namast=\r\nasyai, namastasyai, namastasyai namo namah) - is\nthat related to the purifi=\r\ncation of the 5 elements or senses ?\n\n3) In the 11th chapter 2nd shloka, wh=\r\nat is the esoteric significance of\nthe Devas worshipping the Goddess with A=\r\ngni Deva in front?  Does that\nelude to homam in a gross sense and the pavak=\r\na nature of the fire - ie\nthe Goddess can only be approached by the purest =\r\nof all beings?\n\n4) The esoteric significance of some of the additional demo=\r\nns listed in\nChapter 11th, namely\n\na) Vaiprachitta Demon to be countered by=\r\n Raktadantika\nb) Goddess manifesting as Ayonija,  Shatakshi and Shakambhari=\r\n to counter\nlack of rain for 100 years\nc) Aruna Demon to be defeated by god=\r\ndess as countless Bhrahmri\n\nRegards\n\nVeenu\n\n\n\n\n"}}
