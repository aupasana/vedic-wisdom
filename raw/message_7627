Yoga is nothing less than Sanat=\r\nana Dharma in practice. Yoga and Sanatana Dharma are synonymous. There is n=\r\no meaning to one without the other. More, the only way to truly understand =\r\nand derive full benefit from the Yoga system is by choosing to make the jou=\r\nrney from mere asana (physical postures) to sadhana (spiritual discipline).=\r\n \n\nIn this historic talk, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya presents the system=\r\natic and authoritative Vedic perspective on the teachings, philosophy and s=\r\npiritual goal of the path of Yoga. He also explains the origin and mystical=\r\n elements of this increasingly popular, if incredibly misunderstood, Vedic =\r\ndiscipline. If you have just taken your first Yoga class, or if you have be=\r\nen practicing for the last four decades, this presentation will expand your=\r\n understanding of Yoga tremendously!\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO HERE:\n\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.youtube.com/watch?v=3DvKO0rbDPqmo\n\n\nPlease subscribe, favorite, comment, =\r\nand share this video with others.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
