One of the best I have seen is by Sri \nChaitanyananda and called &quot;Sri Vidya Pooja Vidhi&quot;. It is in Tamil, English \nand Hindi. It is a very elaborate book on the worship of Sri Chakra. It is \nwritten by the gentleman who runs Rajarajeswari peetham at Rush (near \nRochester), New York. It is a fantastic temple (www.srividya.org). His \ngod-brother Sri Karunamaya Baba used to live in the Boston area (where I \nlive) and teach Sri chakra pooja to people in this area (www.srimeru.org). \nNow he is the pontiff of a religious order in Devipuram (near Visakhapatnam, \nAP, India). Both of them belong to this religious order (www.devipuram.com). \nSri Karunamaya Baba conducts seminars in India and US and teaches Sri Chakra \npooja. This book gives the method used by their religious order and lineage.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dheena0104&quot; &lt;dheena0104@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 10:38 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Sri Chakra pooja-Ji&#39;s version\n\n\n&gt; OM NAMAHSHIVAAYA\n&gt; Dear Sri Narasimha P.V.R.

Do it with a spirit of humility and devotion and\n&gt; think: &quot;I\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know the correct way to do it and am doing it to the best of\n&gt; my\n&gt;&gt; ability. Please forgive me for my mistakes and give me a hand to\n&gt; lift me\n&gt;&gt; up&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A lot of people are very afraid of a lot of saattwik rituals also\n&gt; these days\n&gt;&gt; and prefer to call a priest for everything. It is perfectly fine\n&gt; to do a lot\n&gt;&gt; of saattwik rituals by oneself. The above attitude helps too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;dheena0104&quot; &lt;dheena0104@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2008 11:01 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Sri Chakra pooja-Permissibility\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha P.V.R.
