However, there is one more angle to c=\r\nonsider.\n\nManish told me long back that we should guard against focusing on=\r\n &quot;personalities&quot; and building awe. He said we should focus on sadhana. He s=\r\naid, &quot;my message is not that I am special, but it is that everyone is speci=\r\nal. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyone can and s=\r\nhould find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody could. A=\r\ns people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there will be =\r\nmany people who make great progress. World will be a changed place.&quot;\n\nManis=\r\nh said, &quot;people should do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when you are on earth. =\r\nNever give the excuse that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhana. Do whatever yo=\r\nu can. If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you ca=\r\nn sit down and do a bhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do some sadhana or the othe=\r\nr for as much time as you can. Don&#39;t worry about the results, but keep doin=\r\ng sadhana to the best of your ability.&quot;\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n\nI have personally seen clear indications that Manish operates on =\r\na different plane compared to most people. I will give a few small examples=\r\n in this writeup. However, I want to re-iterate that Manish does not see hi=\r\nmself as a special person or a &quot;man of god&quot; as you say, but sees himself as=\r\n a small instrument of Nature.\n\nWhen I mention any supernatural things invo=\r\nlving Manish, the goal is to show that such things are possible even now an=\r\nd not just limited to books and stories. As Rajarshi wisely said, we &quot;educa=\r\nted city people&quot; lack faith. True, skepticism is useful as a lot of fake pe=\r\nople do exploit the blind faith of people, but the pendulum has swung too f=\r\nar and educated people have lost faith so completely that it is almost cyni=\r\ncal.\n\nThis is like lazy people of a village who do not have the energy and =\r\npatience to climb a hill next to the village refusing to believe that anybo=\r\ndy can climb that hill. Thus, if someone climbs the hill, finds something n=\r\nice on the hill and wants to inspire others to climb it, such accounts will=\r\n be inspiring.\n\nThe goal is to inspire and enable a group of spiritual aspi=\r\nrants to do sadhana, become powerful instruments of Nature and end up inspi=\r\nring many more people. The ultimate goal is to uphold Veda dharma of rishis=\r\n in the world.\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\nWhen we went to =\r\nCalcutta to visit Dakshineshwar, we stayed near the Kalighat temple. We cou=\r\nld not find a hotel room as hotels were full and someone at a temple referr=\r\ned us to a nearby house that was being converted to a lodge. House owners l=\r\nived upstairs. We checked in our luggage downstairs. Manish told me, &quot;we ha=\r\nve a rina with this couple. His wife is very sincere and spiritual. We need=\r\n to do something.&quot; We met his wife later and saw her horoscope. She was ind=\r\need quite spiritual. She is a worshipper of Sarada Mata and Ramakrishna Par=\r\namahamsa and a regular visitor of Ramakrishna Mutt.\n\nManish showed a very t=\r\nall wall on one side of that property and asked them, &quot;is there a smashaan =\r\n(cemetary) on the other side of that wall&quot;. They said no. Manish said, &quot;hmm=\r\n, it somehow feels like that.&quot; That person clarified then, &quot;it is a house a=\r\nnd not a smashaan, but this house was a small mosque several decades ago an=\r\nd they supposedly buried several people of that large family in the backyar=\r\nd itself.&quot; After all, Manish&#39;s &quot;perception&quot; was correct.\n\nBTW, we two ended=\r\n up doing two simultaneous Ganapathi homas on the next night next to that w=\r\nall.\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\nOn his advice, one lady st=\r\narted chanting Chandipath everyday to solve some problem with her son, whic=\r\nh was bothering her very much.\n\nOneday Manish talked to her daughter. He as=\r\nked her, &quot;what is your mother doing? She is doing Chandipath alright, but s=\r\nhe is asking for weird things. Check with her and ask her to stop asking th=\r\nose things.&quot;\n\nWhen she cornered her mother on what she was asking, her moth=\r\ner finally revealed that she was frustrated with the situation with her son=\r\n and so was asking Devi at the time of Chandipath to take her life so that =\r\nshe does not have to see her son&#39;s situation.\n\nHer daughter straightened he=\r\nr out and she stopped that. As a postscript, her son&#39;s problem was solved a=\r\nfter she did Chandipath for a few more weeks.\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\nManish told me a few times that he &quot;knows&quot; when someone thi=\r\nnks of him.\n\nWhen we were staying at a hotel in Kurukshetra, Manish said to=\r\n me one evening, &quot;the hotel owner is thinking of me right now. He is thinki=\r\nng about me and money.&quot; Interestingly, phone in the room rang in a minute a=\r\nnd it was the hotel owner. He called to ask if we wanted to pay for the nex=\r\nt day ahead instead of paying in the morning.\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\nManish came to Seatle, USA for a conference in fall 2005 an=\r\nd I met him physically for the first time then. After lunch, we were walkin=\r\ng around. Suddenly, Manish declared, &quot;there is a rudraaksha maalaa meant fo=\r\nr your son close to here. I can sense it. Let us go and find it.&quot; We walked=\r\n quite a distance. Then he said, &quot;this is the place.&quot; There was a big count=\r\nry market kind of place in a small shopping complex. We went in, but found =\r\nnothing. We came out of the complex. Manish looked around and said, &quot;no, th=\r\nis is the place. I was confused by the smell from the fish market inside th=\r\nis complex. Let us try again.&quot; We went in again and this time Manish took m=\r\ne inside a small alley and there was a small mom & pop kind of shop selling=\r\n some Tibetan things. They had several Rudraaksha maalaas. Manish picked on=\r\ne, bought it and gave it for my son.\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *\n\nI mentioned this earlier. Manish told me oneday that he &quot;saw me&quot; doi=\r\nng my daily Chandi homam while he was driving fast on a highway in UK. He l=\r\nifted one hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) while driving. His wife aske=\r\nd what he was doing. He said he told her, &quot;Narasimha is doing homam right n=\r\now. I am blessing him.&quot;\n\nWhen he mentioned this, I wanted to verify it. I n=\r\normally wear red or yellow or white veshti and anga vastram (lower cloth an=\r\nd upper cloth) for my homam. That day I was wearing a blue veshti and a blu=\r\ne T-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti by a priest and wore it only twice=\r\n until now. So one is unlikely to *guess* this. I asked him, &quot;if you saw me=\r\n, tell me what kind of clothes I was wearing.&quot; He said, &quot;Narasimha, it seem=\r\ned like some shade of blue. You were wearing a T-shirt and it was also anot=\r\nher shade of blue.&quot; He was correct. If one was merely guessing it, the prob=\r\nability of getting is correct was very very small - almost zero.\n\n*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\nWhen we went to Pune, Delhi and Kuruksh=\r\netra for the Krishna movie shooting, it rained heavily. In May, it was a bi=\r\nt early for the monsoon rains. When we reached the temple at Mayapur, Manis=\r\nh said that nature was pleased with the work on Krishna and rains wherever =\r\nwe went was a sign. Sometimes Manish says big-sounding things like this, wh=\r\nich may give an impression that he is proud. But I realized that it is not =\r\nbecause of pride, but he was simply making observations from the plane he i=\r\ns in. From where others are, they may sound weird or proud or pretentious.\n=\r\n\nI kind of dismissed him, &quot;well, it could be a coincidence. It is very hot =\r\nhere right now and I see no clouds anywhere. If it rains here today, I will=\r\n believe your theory.&quot;\n\nManish seriously looked at the sky and nodded his h=\r\nead. Because it was too hot, we retired into our room at the accommodation =\r\nthere, unpacked our stuff and got tripod etc ready. Within ten minutes, we =\r\nheard loud thunders. In a few minutes, there was a heavy thunderstorm that =\r\nlasted half an hour. There were puddles of water everywhere. Manish remarke=\r\nd, &quot;see, it rained here also. Gods are happy with this work. This film is a=\r\nn important work.&quot; The rest of the day and next day was perfect and we shot=\r\n what we wanted. \n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\nDuring March =\r\n2006 Shata Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai where Mother g=\r\nave a darshan to Manish and asked to start a homam movement, I was meditati=\r\nng in the garbhalaya one evening, sitting in front of Manish. We were both =\r\nmeditating on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost normal =\r\nawareness of my body and I felt like I was some all-pervading orange light.=\r\n I saw that there was a person at the center of that light, who was emiting=\r\n that light. When I looked closer, it was Manish. After a little time, he s=\r\nuddenly transformed into a very famous saint from the past. I wondered &quot;why=\r\n did Manish change into that saint&quot;. That disturbed my focus and my regular=\r\n self-awareness returned and I became aware that I was Narasimha meditating=\r\n in that garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in front of me. I opened my eyes=\r\n. At the same time, Manish also opened his eyes. Without my saying anything=\r\n, he asked &quot;you saw me, no?&quot; I was surprised that he\n knew it. However, wha=\r\nt baffled me the most was why he transformed into that saint. I stuttered, =\r\n&quot;but...&quot;. Without my finishing it, he remarked, &quot;you see Narasimha, the ble=\r\nssings of my guru of last life are still with me. That is why you saw him i=\r\nn me!&quot; He not only knew what I saw, but explained it succintly.\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\nI was sleeping oneday. In the middle of th=\r\ne night, I woke up. When I was still on the bed and partially awake, my sha=\r\nkti rose. In other words, my self-awareness got refined. I first perceived =\r\na tremendous bolt of electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split seco=\r\nnd, my perception of that electricity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I=\r\n inside shakti&quot;. My changed perception was that there was a tremendous amou=\r\nnt of shakti that was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing everyt=\r\nhing that was there and that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendous =\r\nwave. Moreover, I also &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara being chanted togeth=\r\ner by millions of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That wa=\r\nve reverberated with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived that I =\r\ntoo was chanting that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled with =\r\nthat sound and a kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny partic=\r\nle filled with that sound\n and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of anyth=\r\ning else. Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple and yet =\r\nfantastic state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a thoug=\r\nht that can be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? How am I=\r\n hearing this loud sound? Are there people in the room&quot; came to my mind. Th=\r\nat thought disturbed the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In other=\r\n words, I returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again perceiv=\r\ned that I was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind =\r\nwas again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.\n=A0\nI mentioned this i=\r\nncident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it was the middle o=\r\nf the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned the incident an=\r\nd said that I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating in the wave i=\r\nn which I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he knew it and also=\r\n mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you heard, rig=\r\nht?&quot; That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated with that bee=\r\njaakshara before and it is not something one would expect me to have a myst=\r\nical experience with.\n\nWhen I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, =\r\nManish shed some light: &quot;I was at that time meditating with that beejaaksha=\r\nra. So and so deity came and filled my consciousness. I then went into a ni=\r\nce samadhi. Some people close to me may also have experienced that deity at=\r\n that time. But we should realize that this is all Her play and we are just=\r\n nimittas. What she does and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are =\r\njust dummies observing what comes our way. We neither make anything happen =\r\nnor should we desire anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be att=\r\nracted or repelled by anything.&quot;\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n\n\nWhen Manish called me in mid-2004, he told me, &quot;You are doing good work b=\r\ny giving free astrology software and doing several poojas, but you are not =\r\nexperiencing anything. Time has now come for your Kundalini to awaken and f=\r\nor you to start experiencing things&quot;. I thought he was crazy. He sent me a =\r\nRudraaksha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 times Gayatri mantra everyday us=\r\ning that maalaa while maintaining brahmacharya (celibacy) and keeping the b=\r\nack straight and without any body movement at all. I ignored the Rudraaksha=\r\n maalaa sent by him for many months before starting the practice he wanted =\r\nin May 2005. I experienced something very intense, powerful, profound and l=\r\nife changing within 18 days of starting the practice.\n\nWhen I mentioned wha=\r\nt happened to him, he laughed and said, &quot;now an irreversible transformation=\r\n has been kicked off&quot;. He said, &quot;we two were born together many times. Even=\r\n if you think I am crazy, you cannot leave me and will be pulled towards me=\r\n. Such is our relationship. You don&#39;t know who you are and who I am, but I =\r\ndo.&quot; He also told me then about his first phone call to me in 2004: &quot;I did =\r\nnot have your phone number but wanted to connect with you. When I was in a =\r\ntrance after meditation, I simply picked up the phone and dialed whatever d=\r\nigits my hand felt like pressing. Then I got you on the phone.&quot;\n\nThough I s=\r\ntill thought he was crazy, I knew that what I had experienced was too profo=\r\nund and the coincidence that it happened soon after starting to use his maa=\r\nlaa was too strong, to ignore. I started to wonder if he was genuine after =\r\nall, but his manner of speaking was still too weird for me. I never hid my =\r\nthoughts from him and shared freely.\n\nMy journey since then has been very i=\r\nnteresting and I have shared parts of it on this yahoogroup. Someone said R=\r\najarshi&#39;s mails reminded of Vimalananda. There is indeed something Vimalana=\r\nnda-like about Manish. In fact, Manish says he is like a spiritual son to V=\r\nimalananda and holds Vimalananda in great esteem. I don&#39;t know Vimalananda,=\r\n but I know Manish and I can imagine several things mentioned by Vimalanand=\r\na in &quot;Aghora&quot; series books being correct.\n\nDespite some of his supernatural=\r\n abilities that I have seen, like the ability to create a specific mystical=\r\n experience in someone thousands of miles away, he insists that Devi does e=\r\nverything and he is just a small instrument and an observer of Devi&#39;s leela=\r\na and a small player in the big game of chess being played by Devi. In fact=\r\n, his main teaching to me was to improve devotion, faith and surrender and =\r\ngive up doership of my actions.\n\nHis teachings are sublime and yet practica=\r\nl. He is not content to explain theory, but practically demonstrates the we=\r\naknesses of mind and how to overcome them. Instead of swimming in modern ps=\r\neudo-vedanta, he made me understand and appreciate duality and non-duality =\r\nat the same time. He made me understand things through experience. He broug=\r\nht great change in my attitude and thinking in the last 5.5 years of intera=\r\nction. He destroyed my biases and expanded the horizons of my understanding=\r\n and gave a much better perspective.\n\nMost importantly, using me as an inst=\r\nrument, he enabled many sincere spiritual seekers to embrace the ancient Ve=\r\ndic sadhana of rishis - homam or fire ritual for saattwik purposes. He tell=\r\ns me that one lakh (one hundred thousand) people will be doing homam on a r=\r\negular basis one hundred years from now.\n\nAs I said at the beginning of thi=\r\ns email, inspiring sadhana is more important than inspiring awe regarding s=\r\npecific personalities, though the latter sometimes helps with the former.\n\n=\r\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\nI will conclude with Manish&#39;s wo=\r\nrds I mentioned before:\n\n&quot;My message is not that I am special, but it is th=\r\nat everyone is special. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is tha=\r\nt everyone can and should find god. I am a normal person. If I could find g=\r\nod, anybody could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few y=\r\nears, there will be many people who make great progress. World will be a ch=\r\nanged place.&quot;\n\n&quot;People should do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when you are on =\r\nearth. Never give the excuse that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhana. Do what=\r\never you can. If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam.

However, there is one more angle to consider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manish told me lo=\r\nng back that we should guard against focusing on &quot;personalities&quot; and buildi=\r\nng awe. He said we should focus on sadhana. He said, &quot;my message is not tha=\r\nt I am special, but it is that everyone is special. My assertion is not tha=\r\nt I found god, but it is that everyone can and should find god. I am a norm=\r\nal person. If I could find god, anybody could. As people do homam sincerely=\r\n and unselfishly for a few years, there will be many people who make great =\r\nprogress. World will be a changed place.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manish said, &quot;people shoul=\r\nd do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when you are on earth. Never give the excuse=\r\n\n that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhana. Do whatever you can. If you know h=\r\now to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you can sit down and do a =\r\nbhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do some sadhana or the other for as much time a=\r\ns you can. Don&#39;t worry about the results, but keep doing sadhana to the bes=\r\nt of your ability.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have personally seen clear indicatio=\r\nns that Manish operates on a different plane compared to most people. I wil=\r\nl give a few small examples in this writeup. However, I want to re-iterate =\r\nthat Manish does not see himself as a special person or a &quot;man of god&quot; as y=\r\nou say, but sees himself as a small instrument of Nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I men=\r\ntion any supernatural things involving Manish, the goal is to show that suc=\r\nh things are possible even now and not just limited to books and stories. A=\r\ns Rajarshi wisely said, we &quot;educated city people&quot; lack faith. True,\n skepti=\r\ncism is useful as a lot of fake people do exploit the blind faith of people=\r\n, but the pendulum has swung too far and educated people have lost faith so=\r\n completely that it is almost cynical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is like lazy people of a=\r\n village who do not have the energy and patience to climb a hill next to th=\r\ne village refusing to believe that anybody can climb that hill. Thus, if so=\r\nmeone climbs the hill, finds something nice on the hill and wants to inspir=\r\ne others to climb it, such accounts will be inspiring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The goal is t=\r\no inspire and enable a group of spiritual aspirants to do sadhana, become p=\r\nowerful instruments of Nature and end up inspiring many more people. The ul=\r\ntimate goal is to uphold Veda dharma of rishis in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;When we went to Calcutta to visit Dakshineshwar, we stayed near the Kali=\r\nghat temple. We could not find a hotel room as hotels were\n full and someon=\r\ne at a temple referred us to a nearby house that was being converted to a l=\r\nodge. House owners lived upstairs. We checked in our luggage downstairs. Ma=\r\nnish told me, &quot;we have a rina with this couple. His wife is very sincere an=\r\nd spiritual. We need to do something.&quot; We met his wife later and saw her ho=\r\nroscope. She was indeed quite spiritual. She is a worshipper of Sarada Mata=\r\n and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and a regular visitor of Ramakrishna Mutt.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Manish showed a very tall wall on one side of that property and asked t=\r\nhem, &quot;is there a smashaan (cemetary) on the other side of that wall&quot;. They =\r\nsaid no. Manish said, &quot;hmm, it somehow feels like that.&quot; That person clarif=\r\nied then, &quot;it is a house and not a smashaan, but this house was a small mos=\r\nque several decades ago and they supposedly buried several people of that l=\r\narge family in the backyard itself.&quot; After all, Manish&#39;s &quot;perception&quot; was c=\r\norrect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW, we two ended up doing two\n simultaneous Ganapathi homas=\r\n on the next night next to that wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On his advice, one l=\r\nady started chanting Chandipath everyday to solve some problem with her son=\r\n, which was bothering her very much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oneday Manish talked to her dau=\r\nghter. He asked her, &quot;what is your mother doing? She is doing Chandipath al=\r\nright, but she is asking for weird things. Check with her and ask her to st=\r\nop asking those things.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she cornered her mother on what she wa=\r\ns asking, her mother finally revealed that she was frustrated with the situ=\r\nation with her son and so was asking Devi at the time of Chandipath to take=\r\n her life so that she does not have to see her son&#39;s situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her =\r\ndaughter straightened her out and she stopped that. As a postscript, her so=\r\nn&#39;s problem was solved after she did Chandipath for a few more weeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manish told me a few times that he &quot;knows&quot; when someone thinks=\r\n of him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we were staying at a hotel in Kurukshetra, Manish said=\r\n to me one evening, &quot;the hotel owner is thinking of me right now. He is thi=\r\nnking about me and money.&quot; Interestingly, phone in the room rang in a minut=\r\ne and it was the hotel owner. He called to ask if we wanted to pay for the =\r\nnext day ahead instead of paying in the morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manish ca=\r\nme to Seatle, USA for a conference in fall 2005 and I met him physically fo=\r\nr the first time then. After lunch, we were walking around. Suddenly, Manis=\r\nh declared, &quot;there is a rudraaksha maalaa meant for your son close to here.=\r\n I can sense it. Let us go and find it.&quot; We walked quite a distance. Then h=\r\ne said, &quot;this is the place.&quot; There was a big country market kind of place i=\r\nn a small shopping complex. We\n went in, but found nothing. We came out of =\r\nthe complex. Manish looked around and said, &quot;no, this is the place. I was c=\r\nonfused by the smell from the fish market inside this complex. Let us try a=\r\ngain.&quot; We went in again and this time Manish took me inside a small alley a=\r\nnd there was a small mom &amp; pop kind of shop selling some Tibetan things=\r\n. They had several Rudraaksha maalaas. Manish picked one, bought it and gav=\r\ne it for my son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mentioned this earlier. Manish told me =\r\noneday that he &quot;saw me&quot; doing my daily Chandi homam while he was driving fa=\r\nst on a highway in UK. He lifted one hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) w=\r\nhile driving. His wife asked what he was doing. He said he told her, &quot;Naras=\r\nimha is doing homam right now. I am blessing him.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he mentioned=\r\n this, I wanted to verify it. I normally wear red or yellow or white veshti=\r\n and anga vastram (lower\n cloth and upper cloth) for my homam. That day I w=\r\nas wearing a blue veshti and a blue T-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti =\r\nby a priest and wore it only twice until now. So one is unlikely to *guess*=\r\n this. I asked him, &quot;if you saw me, tell me what kind of clothes I was wear=\r\ning.&quot; He said, &quot;Narasimha, it seemed like some shade of blue. You were wear=\r\ning a T-shirt and it was also another shade of blue.&quot; He was correct. If on=\r\ne was merely guessing it, the probability of getting is correct was very ve=\r\nry small - almost zero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we went to Pune, Delhi and Ku=\r\nrukshetra for the Krishna movie shooting, it rained heavily. In May, it was=\r\n a bit early for the monsoon rains. When we reached the temple at Mayapur, =\r\nManish said that nature was pleased with the work on Krishna and rains wher=\r\never we went was a sign. Sometimes Manish says big-sounding things like thi=\r\ns, which may give\n an impression that he is proud. But I realized that it i=\r\ns not because of pride, but he was simply making observations from the plan=\r\ne he is in. From where others are, they may sound weird or proud or pretent=\r\nious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I kind of dismissed him, &quot;well, it could be a coincidence. It =\r\nis very hot here right now and I see no clouds anywhere. If it rains here t=\r\noday, I will believe your theory.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manish seriously looked at the sk=\r\ny and nodded his head. Because it was too hot, we retired into our room at =\r\nthe accommodation there, unpacked our stuff and got tripod etc ready. Withi=\r\nn ten minutes, we heard loud thunders. In a few minutes, there was a heavy =\r\nthunderstorm that lasted half an hour. There were puddles of water everywhe=\r\nre. Manish remarked, &quot;see, it rained here also. Gods are happy with this wo=\r\nrk. This film is an important work.&quot; The rest of the day and next day was p=\r\nerfect and we shot what we wanted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During March 2006 Sha=\r\nta Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai where Mother gave a da=\r\nrshan to Manish and asked to start a homam movement, I was meditating in th=\r\ne garbhalaya one evening, sitting in front of Manish. We were both meditati=\r\nng on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost normal awarenes=\r\ns of my body and I felt like I was some all-pervading orange light. I saw t=\r\nhat there was a person at the center of that light, who was emiting that li=\r\nght. When I looked closer, it was Manish. After a little time, he suddenly =\r\ntransformed into a very famous saint from the past. I wondered &quot;why did Man=\r\nish change into that saint&quot;. That disturbed my focus and my regular self-aw=\r\nareness returned and I became aware that I was Narasimha meditating in that=\r\n garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in front of me. I opened my eyes. At the=\r\n same time, Manish also opened his eyes. Without my saying anything, he\n as=\r\nked &quot;you saw me, no?&quot; I was surprised that he knew it. However, what baffle=\r\nd me the most was why he transformed into that saint. I stuttered, &quot;but...&quot;=\r\n. Without my finishing it, he remarked, &quot;you see Narasimha, the blessings o=\r\nf my guru of last life are still with me. That is why you saw him in me!&quot; H=\r\ne not only knew what I saw, but explained it succintly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I =\r\nwas sleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, I woke up. When I was stil=\r\nl on the bed and partially awake, my shakti rose. In other words, my self-a=\r\nwareness got refined. I first perceived a tremendous bolt of electricity go=\r\ning up in my back. Then, in a split second, my perception of that electrici=\r\nty changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My changed percept=\r\nion was that there was a tremendous amount of shakti that was surging up li=\r\nke an ocean wave and encompassing everything that was there and\n that I was=\r\n a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, I also &quot;heard&quot; a s=\r\npecific beejaakshara being chanted together by millions of people, who were=\r\n all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverberated with the sound of =\r\nthat beejaakshara and I perceived that I too was chanting that beejaakshara=\r\n along with all. My mind was filled with that sound and a kind of bliss. My=\r\n self-awareness was that of a tiny particle filled with that sound and joy =\r\nand nothing else. I was unaware of anything else. Compared to my normal men=\r\ntal state, it was a very simple and yet fantastic state to be in. I was in =\r\nthat state for a while. Suddenly a thought that can be loosely expressed as=\r\n &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? How am I hearing this loud sound? Are there=\r\n people in the room&quot; came to my mind. That thought disturbed the state of m=\r\ny mind and my shakti came down. In other words, I returned to the regular l=\r\nevel of self-awareness and again perceived that I was a\n body lying on a be=\r\nd in a room. The bliss was gone and mind was again filled with hundreds of =\r\nthoughts as usual.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I mentioned this incident a few days later =\r\nto Manish. When this happened, it was the middle of the night for me and mo=\r\nrning for Manish. When I mentioned the incident and said that I heard the s=\r\nound of a beejaakshara reverberating in the wave in which I was a small par=\r\nticle, Manish immediately said he knew it and also mentioned the specific b=\r\neejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you heard, right?&quot; That was indeed corr=\r\nect. Moreover, I had never meditated with that beejaakshara before and it i=\r\ns not something one would expect me to have a mystical experience with.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;When I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, Manish shed some li=\r\nght: &quot;I was at that time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so deity=\r\n came and filled my consciousness. I then went into a nice samadhi. Some pe=\r\nople close to me may also have experienced that\n deity at that time. But we=\r\n should realize that this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What sh=\r\ne does and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies obser=\r\nving what comes our way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desi=\r\nre anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or repelled=\r\n by anything.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Manish called me in mid-2004, he told =\r\nme, &quot;You are doing good work by giving free astrology software and doing se=\r\nveral poojas, but you are not experiencing anything. Time has now come for =\r\nyour Kundalini to awaken and for you to start experiencing things&quot;. I thoug=\r\nht he was crazy. He sent me a Rudraaksha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 ti=\r\nmes Gayatri mantra everyday using that maalaa while maintaining brahmachary=\r\na (celibacy) and keeping the back straight and without any body movement at=\r\n all. I ignored the Rudraaksha maalaa\n sent by him for many months before s=\r\ntarting the practice he wanted in May 2005. I experienced something very in=\r\ntense, powerful, profound and life changing within 18 days of starting the =\r\npractice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I mentioned what happened to him, he laughed and said=\r\n, &quot;now an irreversible transformation has been kicked off&quot;. He said, &quot;we tw=\r\no were born together many times. Even if you think I am crazy, you cannot l=\r\neave me and will be pulled towards me. Such is our relationship. You don&#39;t =\r\nknow who you are and who I am, but I do.&quot; He also told me then about his fi=\r\nrst phone call to me in 2004: &quot;I did not have your phone number but wanted =\r\nto connect with you. When I was in a trance after meditation, I simply pick=\r\ned up the phone and dialed whatever digits my hand felt like pressing. Then=\r\n I got you on the phone.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though I still thought he was crazy, I kne=\r\nw that what I had experienced was too profound and the coincidence that it =\r\nhappened soon after starting to\n use his maalaa was too strong, to ignore. =\r\nI started to wonder if he was genuine after all, but his manner of speaking=\r\n was still too weird for me. I never hid my thoughts from him and shared fr=\r\neely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My journey since then has been very interesting and I have sha=\r\nred parts of it on this yahoogroup. Someone said Rajarshi&#39;s mails reminded =\r\nof Vimalananda. There is indeed something Vimalananda-like about Manish. In=\r\n fact, Manish says he is like a spiritual son to Vimalananda and holds Vima=\r\nlananda in great esteem. I don&#39;t know Vimalananda, but I know Manish and I =\r\ncan imagine several things mentioned by Vimalananda in &quot;Aghora&quot; series book=\r\ns being correct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite some of his supernatural abilities that I h=\r\nave seen, like the ability to create a specific mystical experience in some=\r\none thousands of miles away, he insists that Devi does everything and he is=\r\n just a small instrument and an observer of Devi&#39;s leelaa and a small playe=\r\nr in the big game of\n chess being played by Devi. In fact, his main teachin=\r\ng to me was to improve devotion, faith and surrender and give up doership o=\r\nf my actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His teachings are sublime and yet practical. He is not=\r\n content to explain theory, but practically demonstrates the weaknesses of =\r\nmind and how to overcome them. Instead of swimming in modern pseudo-vedanta=\r\n, he made me understand and appreciate duality and non-duality at the same =\r\ntime. He made me understand things through experience. He brought great cha=\r\nnge in my attitude and thinking in the last 5.5 years of interaction. He de=\r\nstroyed my biases and expanded the horizons of my understanding and gave a =\r\nmuch better perspective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most importantly, using me as an instrument=\r\n, he enabled many sincere spiritual seekers to embrace the ancient Vedic sa=\r\ndhana of rishis - homam or fire ritual for saattwik purposes. He tells me t=\r\nhat one lakh (one hundred thousand) people will be doing homam on a regular=\r\n basis one\n hundred years from now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said at the beginning of th=\r\nis email, inspiring sadhana is more important than inspiring awe regarding =\r\nspecific personalities, though the latter sometimes helps with the former.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will conclude with Manish&#39;s words I mentioned before:&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;My message is not that I am special, but it is that everyone is speci=\r\nal. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyone can and s=\r\nhould find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody could. A=\r\ns people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there will be =\r\nmany people who make great progress. World will be a changed place.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&quot;People should do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when you are on earth. Never g=\r\nive the excuse that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhana. Do whatever you can. =\r\nIf you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you can sit d=\r\nown\n and do a bhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do some sadhana or the other for =\r\nas much time as you can. Don&#39;t worry about the results, but keep doing sadh=\r\nana to the best of your ability.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;----=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jy=\r\notish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;br&gt;----------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;=\r\nMon, 1/18/10, chaudhuri.krishnendu\n &lt;i&gt;&lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt;&lt;/i=\r\n&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255=\r\n); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: chaudhuri.krishnendu &lt;kri=\r\nshnenduchdhr@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Resected Narasimhaji&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Monday, January 18, 2010, 2:06=\r\n PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv630583455&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;From time =\r\nto time various sayings and incidents related to Manishji are scattered in =\r\nthis forum and maybe at other places.His site also contains&lt;br&gt;\nsome valuab=\r\nle materials.Will it not be nice to archive them as i feel they are great p=\r\nieces of inspiration.
