Quoting below. Prophetic and =\r\ninsightful words.\n\n\n\nQuestion: Why do human  beings hurt each other? How do=\r\n we get rid of all our previous (and  future) hurts? How do we prevent furt=\r\nher hurts (to ourselves and  others)? \n\n\n\n&quot;Your question raises  a very imp=\r\nortant issue of the basis of human relationship. Human  relationship is so =\r\nmuch full of quarrels, misunderstandings and  hurts because it is based upo=\r\nn selfishness and centered on the fulfillment  of desires. Human love burns=\r\n low and is so full of smoke because  it is a flame of the ego, which is ev=\r\ner engaged in eating up the  fuel that feeds it. It thrives upon return of =\r\nsome kind or the other  and when the need is not satisfied or the return di=\r\nminishes, human  love tends to die or exists merely as a habitual remnant o=\r\nf the  past or a duty to be fulfilled, as a social or religious obligation.=\r\n  Love and selfishness are by their nature self-contradictory movements  an=\r\nd therefore cannot co-exist. But true love is extremely rare.  Normally wha=\r\nt passes off in its name is a strange mixture of greed  and lust applied at=\r\n the emotional level. Yet while none of us are  able to love truly we expec=\r\nt the other person to truly love\n and  understand. This is a fundamental er=\r\nror because the ego-bound consciousness  of human beings cannot love truly =\r\nsince it dwells so much on division  rather than identity and oneness, whic=\r\nh is what love seeks.\nRelationships and \n              Expectations\n\nAnothe=\r\nr problem  in a relationship arises because of wrong expectations. So long =\r\n as there are expectations there will always remain a vulnerability  to get=\r\n hurt and hurt others. These expectations exist because we  all make the fu=\r\nndamental error of believing that others think and  feel the same way as we=\r\n do. In reality each one of us is different  despite certain commonality. H=\r\nowever we should avoid the error of believing  that anyone else would think=\r\n and feel like us and therefore understand  us.=C2=A0 Thus before rushing t=\r\no react one  can see how a particular reaction will help or hinder the cent=\r\nral  aim of one&#39;s life. \n\n\nThis is not to say that  relationships that last=\r\n and appear happy and smooth are free of  expectations. Many relationships =\r\nlast out of habit or mutual dependence,  others stick along due to social o=\r\nr moral reasons as a duty and  a ritual even when the flame of love has bec=\r\nome tepid. Still others  curiously last despite quarrels and heartburns bec=\r\nause of a peculiar  need in the human vital for drama and its love for trag=\r\nedy, as if  the drama could not endure without the exchange of these strong=\r\n  emotions. Still others  curiously last despite quarrels and heartburns be=\r\ncause of a peculiar  need in the human vital for drama and its love for tra=\r\ngedy, as if  the drama could not endure without the exchange of these stron=\r\ng  emotions. Unfortunately the vital of most human beings needs the  food o=\r\nf anger etc to thrive. If one knows how to cut off the supply  of this fuel=\r\n then much can change for better. To respond to anger  with anger is like g=\r\netting caught up in\n the same hole as the other  person. Anger helps none b=\r\nut injures both. When the other partner  is angry it is better to detach on=\r\neself or simply walk away from  the scene or (if possible) remember that th=\r\nis is not the total person  but only a part of him/her. After all none of u=\r\ns is made up of one  piece and many factors could be operating in any given=\r\n relationship.\n\nEven if everything was going smooth, it is unfortunately th=\r\ne  very nature of the restless human vital to get easily dis-satisfied  wit=\r\nh one&#39;s established position and turn towards other seemingly  greener past=\r\nures only to be frustrated again. For, ultimately the  source of happiness =\r\nand fulfillment lies within and not outside  us. It lies in discovering tha=\r\nt part or entity in us that can love  truly; give truly and thereby fulfill=\r\n us truly. For, in the end we  realize that the love that makes us happy is=\r\n not the love we receive  but the love we give. But most of our time and en=\r\nergy is spent in  observing what we have not received from others. We seldo=\r\nm pause  to consider what we have given to this world and others. This gene=\r\nrosity  of the mind and heart becomes possible only when we have discovered=\r\n  the source of love that lies within us, our true soul.\n\n\nThe true and las=\r\nting  Solution\n\nTo discover this secret  soul in us is therefore the one tr=\r\nue and lasting remedy against  all previous and future hurts. The ego sense=\r\n in us takes a strange  pleasure in dwelling upon the real and unreal defec=\r\nts of others.  We see things and often attribute motives, which are not the=\r\nre leading  to avoidable hurt and pain. The closer we get to our true soul =\r\nand  allow our emotional nature to be governed by it, the sooner we develop=\r\n  a more generous and luminous understanding of others. True, we cannot  un=\r\ndo the past, but we can always understand it in a truer light.  As we grow =\r\nin our consciousness we naturally begin to be more forebearing  and truly f=\r\norgiving of others since we see that all of us are what  we are because of =\r\nthe unique constitution of our human nature. We  also begin to be more tole=\r\nrant of the folly of others since we have  sincerely struggled within ourse=\r\nlves and know what it means to try  to change oneself. And since we cannot =\r\nreally\n change another human  being we begin to work upon ourselves to make=\r\n ourselves immune to  the hurts and depressions, to discover joy and hope a=\r\nnd freedom  amidst death and disaster. So long as we depend upon others to =\r\nchange  for us we can never be fully free in our happiness, as we have give=\r\nn  it in other&#39;s hands. We have to discover the joy and strength we  need i=\r\nn life from within us and then in proportion to our discovery  distribute a=\r\nnd share it with others. The only lasting remedy to  hurts in human relatio=\r\nnships is to learn to give love rather than  want to receive it.\n\nThis howe=\r\nver is not easy  and takes time and effort. In the meantime we can do sever=\r\nal other  things. For example when we get hurt, we can take it as an opport=\r\nunity  to become a little more conscious of those parts in us that childish=\r\nly  crave for affection. If we are sincere in our probe we can make  many u=\r\nseful discoveries about human nature and ourselves. For example,  we may fi=\r\nnd that the source of our hurt is not really in the other  person but in ou=\r\nr self. We can also try to widen ourselves intellectually  and emotionally =\r\nto accommodate the ideas, opinions and feelings  of others rather than focu=\r\nsing only on our own grievances. Kindness  and considerateness of others se=\r\nnsitivities go a long way towards  improving relationships. Of course all t=\r\nhese things can come much  more readily in friendship than in a structured =\r\nand closed relationship  where two people have to live in a defined manner =\r\nunder the same  roof. Friendship lasts mainly because it is\n not so much ba=\r\nsed on  the expectation that others should change for our sake. Defined  re=\r\nlationships however suffer this difficulty that the roles and  rules are al=\r\nready fixed by the society and others for us thereby  creating an external =\r\npressure of expectations. That is one reason  why the spirit of our times i=\r\ns breaking the fixed moulds and established  roles while encouraging friend=\r\nship and undefined relatedness independent  of outer circumstances of birth=\r\n, environment, society, etc. Future  relationships are likely to be less an=\r\nd less fixed and more open  ended to allow enough room and space for each o=\r\nther&#39;s growth. The  future is going to encourage only those relationships, =\r\nwhich are  helpful in evolution. All the moulds fixed by our past are going=\r\n  to be broken since they have served their term and utility and must  be r=\r\neplaced by a newer consciousness, the consciousness of the soul  rather tha=\r\nn of the ego. This is the true solution and the\n solution  of the future. T=\r\no live in and by the soul rather than for the ego  is the final solution to=\r\n all our miseries including those that hurt  and bruise us. To live in the =\r\nego is to be forever vulnerable. To  live in the soul is to be secure and f=\r\nree.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nI have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit =\r\nethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter =\r\nthrough them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n\n\n________________________________\n From: N=\r\narasimha P.V.R.

We are always pulled in different directi=\r\nons by different rinas and dharmas. One needs to JUDGE which dharma is high=\r\ner and which rina is more important.\n\n=C2=A0\nDepending on one&#39;s individual =\r\ncircumstances, one of the following may be the best option:\n=C2=A0\n(1) Igno=\r\nre the complaining wife/husband. Don&#39;t fight or argue, but keep doing your =\r\nsadhana. As time progresses, (a) she may see the positive change in your at=\r\ntitude and stop complaining, (b) she may just get used to it and accept her=\r\n fate, (c) she may keep complaining and YOU may get used to that complaints=\r\n and accept your fate.\n=C2=A0\n(2) Talk to her/him and find some compromise =\r\nthat is acceptable. Instead of doing 1 hour sadhana, may be do half hour an=\r\nd spend more time doing something she likes.\n=C2=A0\n(3) Give up your idea o=\r\nf sadhana and take whatever you are able to do, as sanctioned by your wife/=\r\nhusband, as your sadhana. For example, cooking, cleaning dishes, washing cl=\r\nothes, taking her to a movie, massaging her feet, taking kids to activities=\r\n etc can also be sadhanas.\n=C2=A0\nAny activity can be done with a protestin=\r\ng/dissenting attitude or an agitated mind, or with love and caring and a ca=\r\nlm and composed mind. Every activity involves interacting with some objects=\r\n. Just as god is in idol and fire, he is in vegetables you cut, food you co=\r\nok, feet you massage etc. If you see an action as a chore or look at it or =\r\nits object(s) with an impure mind (e.g. with lust or with anger or with fru=\r\nstration) or focus more of your attention on yourself, then it becomes impu=\r\nre. If you approach the action with a calm and devoted mind, see the action=\r\n and its object(s) with love, devotion and caring and focus the more of you=\r\nr attention on the action and its objects (rather than youself and your own=\r\n happiness), then it becomes a ritual or sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nOf course, in some=\r\n actions one hates, it is very difficult to bring that calmness and caring.=\r\n In some other actions (e.g. sex), one may become too selfish or self-absor=\r\nbed and think too much about one&#39;s own sensations, to look at the action an=\r\nd other persons/objects with love, caring, devotion.\n\n=C2=A0\nThus, we norma=\r\nlly don&#39;t talk about converting all actions into sadhana and talk about jap=\r\nam, homam etc. It is easier in those to look at the action and its objects =\r\nwith a sense of purity and devotion. However, if that is not possible and o=\r\nne has to do some other actions, why note TRY to convert them into sadhana?=\r\n Try to perform the action with a calm, stable, selfless mind, focus attent=\r\nion on the action and its objects and imbibe love and caring into your thin=\r\nking.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIn fact, at some stage, (3) has to bec=\r\nome part of one&#39;s sadhana. One has to convert every action into a sadhana. =\r\nJust doing japam or homam for an hour or two may not cut it.\n=C2=A0\nIf you =\r\nlive in a really cold country, your room can get very cold. If you turn the=\r\n heater on for an hour everyday and keep it off rest of the time, the room =\r\nwill overall be very cold. Similarly, if you do sadhana for an hour, you ma=\r\ny feel better, but the normal attitude returns. To make permanent progress,=\r\n the heater has to be on most of the day! Of course, as you cannot do japam=\r\n or homam for 12 hours a day, you have to convert whatever you do (eating, =\r\ndriving to work, your work, driving back, cooking, eating, talking to peopl=\r\ne, etc) into sadhana. At some stage, every seeker will have to start doing =\r\nit.\n\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resou=\r\nrces: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt;__________________=\r\n______________\n&gt;From: Durgesh Mishra &lt;durgesh.mishra@...&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2013 11:43 AM\n&gt;Subject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] most difficult question\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Dear All,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you=\r\n are interested in spiritual sadhana, dhyaan, homam, fasting etc and your s=\r\npouse doesn&#39;t like you doing it ? then what should you do ?=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rega=\r\nrds\n&gt;Durgesh O Mishra\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-- \n&gt;&quot;If you only have a hammer, you tend to see=\r\n every problem as a nail.&quot; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n \r\n--192144850-1787627619-1375640860=:31288\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;Any\n activity can be done with a protesting/dissenting attitude or an \nag=\r\nitated mind, or with love and caring and a calm and composed mind.&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Something si&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;milar &lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;=\r\n&gt;was&lt;/font&gt; said by Sri Aurobindo&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt; in a letter to a devotee=\r\n who asked him about human relations&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;hip&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;s.=\r\n Qu&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;oting below. &lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Prophetic and insightful =\r\nwords.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question: Why do =\r\nhuman \n              beings hurt each other?

It thrives upon return of some kind or the other \n           =\r\n   and when the need is not satisfied or the return diminishes, human \n    =\r\n          love tends to die or exists merely as a habitual remnant of the \n=\r\n              past or a duty to be fulfilled, as a social or religious obli=\r\ngation. \n              Love and selfishness are by their nature self-contra=\r\ndictory movements \n              and therefore cannot co-exist. But true lo=\r\nve is extremely rare. \n              Normally what passes off in its name i=\r\ns a strange mixture of greed \n              and lust applied at the emotion=\r\nal level. Yet while none of us are \n              able to love truly we exp=\r\nect the other person to truly love and \n              understand. This is a=\r\n fundamental error because the ego-bound consciousness \n              of hu=\r\nman beings cannot love truly since it dwells so much on division \n         =\r\n     rather than identity and oneness, which is what love seeks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n            &lt;b&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Relations=\r\nhips and \n              Expectations&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial,=\r\n Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;Another problem \n              in a relationship ar=\r\nises because of wrong expectations. So long \n              as there are exp=\r\nectations there will always remain a vulnerability \n              to get hu=\r\nrt and hurt others. These expectations exist because we \n              all =\r\nmake the fundamental error of believing that others think and \n            =\r\n  feel the same way as we do. In reality each one of us is different \n     =\r\n         despite certain commonality. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica=\r\n, sans-serif&quot;&gt; However we should avoid the error of believing \n            =\r\n  that anyone else would think and feel like us and therefore understand \n =\r\n             us.&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt; =\r\nThus before rushing to react one \n              can see how a particular re=\r\naction will help or hinder the central \n              aim of one&#39;s life. &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;This is not to=\r\n say that \n              relationships that last and appear happy and smoot=\r\nh are free of \n              expectations. Many relationships last out of h=\r\nabit or mutual dependence, \n              others stick along due to social =\r\nor moral reasons as a duty and \n              a ritual even when the flame =\r\nof love has become tepid. Still others \n              curiously last despit=\r\ne quarrels and heartburns because of a peculiar \n              need in the =\r\nhuman vital for drama and its love for tragedy, as if \n              the dr=\r\nama could not endure without the exchange of these strong \n              em=\r\notions. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;Still others \n  =\r\n            curiously last despite quarrels and heartburns because of a pec=\r\nuliar \n              need in the human vital for drama and its love for tra=\r\ngedy, as if \n              the drama could not endure without the exchange =\r\nof these strong \n              emotions. Unfortunately the vital of most hu=\r\nman beings needs the \n              food of anger etc to thrive. If one kno=\r\nws how to cut off the supply \n              of this fuel then much can chan=\r\nge for better. To respond to anger \n              with anger is like gettin=\r\ng caught up in the same hole as the other \n              person. Anger help=\r\ns none but injures both. When the other partner \n              is angry it =\r\nis better to detach oneself or simply walk away from \n              the sce=\r\nne or (if possible) remember that this is not the total person \n           =\r\n   but only a part of him/her. After all none of us is made up of one \n    =\r\n          piece and many factors could be operating in any given relationsh=\r\nip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;Even if every=\r\nthing was going smooth, it is unfortunately the \n              very nature =\r\nof the restless human vital to get easily dis-satisfied \n              with=\r\n one&#39;s established position and turn towards other seemingly \n             =\r\n greener pastures only to be frustrated again. For, ultimately the \n       =\r\n       source of happiness and fulfillment lies within and not outside \n   =\r\n           us. It lies in discovering that part or entity in us that can lo=\r\nve \n              truly; give truly and thereby fulfill us truly. For, in t=\r\nhe end we \n              realize that the love that makes us happy is not t=\r\nhe love we receive \n              but the love we give. But most of our tim=\r\ne and energy is spent in \n              observing what we have not received=\r\n from others. We seldom pause \n              to consider what we have given=\r\n to this world and others. This generosity \n              of the mind and h=\r\neart becomes possible only when we have discovered \n              the sourc=\r\ne of love that lies within us, our true soul.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font f=\r\nace=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;The true and lasting \n              So=\r\nlution&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font=\r\n-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-styl=\r\ne:normal;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans=\r\n-serif&quot;&gt;To discover this secret \n              soul in us is therefore the =\r\none true and lasting remedy against \n              all previous and future =\r\nhurts. The ego sense in us takes a strange \n              pleasure in dwell=\r\ning upon the real and unreal defects of others. \n              We see thing=\r\ns and often attribute motives, which are not there leading \n              t=\r\no avoidable hurt and pain. The closer we get to our true soul and \n        =\r\n      allow our emotional nature to be governed by it, the sooner we develo=\r\np \n              a more generous and luminous understanding of others. True=\r\n, we cannot \n              undo the past, but we can always understand it i=\r\nn a truer light. \n              As we grow in our consciousness we naturall=\r\ny begin to be more forebearing \n              and truly forgiving of others=\r\n since we see that all of us are what \n              we are because of the =\r\nunique constitution of our human nature. We \n              also begin to be=\r\n more tolerant of the folly of others since we have \n              sincerel=\r\ny struggled within ourselves and know what it means to try \n              t=\r\no change oneself. And since we cannot really change another human \n        =\r\n      being we begin to work upon ourselves to make ourselves immune to \n  =\r\n            the hurts and depressions, to discover joy and hope and freedom=\r\n \n              amidst death and disaster. So long as we depend upon others=\r\n to change \n              for us we can never be fully free in our happines=\r\ns, as we have given \n              it in other&#39;s hands. We have to discover=\r\n the joy and strength we \n              need in life from within us and the=\r\nn in proportion to our discovery \n              distribute and share it wit=\r\nh others. The only lasting remedy to \n              hurts in human relation=\r\nships is to learn to give love rather than \n              want to receive i=\r\nt.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:=\r\nArial, Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;This however is not easy=\r\n \n              and takes time and effort. In the meantime we can do severa=\r\nl other \n              things. For example when we get hurt, we can take it=\r\n as an opportunity \n              to become a little more conscious of thos=\r\ne parts in us that childishly \n              crave for affection. If we are=\r\n sincere in our probe we can make \n              many useful discoveries ab=\r\nout human nature and ourselves. For example, \n              we may find tha=\r\nt the source of our hurt is not really in the other \n              person b=\r\nut in our self. We can also try to widen ourselves intellectually \n        =\r\n      and emotionally to accommodate the ideas, opinions and feelings \n    =\r\n          of others rather than focusing only on our own grievances. Kindne=\r\nss \n              and considerateness of others sensitivities go a long way=\r\n towards \n              improving relationships. Of course all these things=\r\n can come much \n              more readily in friendship than in a structur=\r\ned and closed relationship \n              where two people have to live in =\r\na defined manner under the same \n              roof. Friendship lasts mainl=\r\ny because it is not so much based on \n              the expectation that ot=\r\nhers should change for our sake. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial, Helvetica, san=\r\ns-serif&quot;&gt;Defined \n              relationships however suffer this difficult=\r\ny that the roles and \n              rules are already fixed by the society =\r\nand others for us thereby \n              creating an external pressure of e=\r\nxpectations. That is one reason \n              why the spirit of our times =\r\nis breaking the fixed moulds and established \n              roles while enc=\r\nouraging friendship and undefined relatedness independent \n              of=\r\n outer circumstances of birth, environment, society, etc. Future \n         =\r\n     relationships are likely to be less and less fixed and more open \n    =\r\n          ended to allow enough room and space for each other&#39;s growth. The=\r\n \n              future is going to encourage only those relationships, whic=\r\nh are \n              helpful in evolution. All the moulds fixed by our past=\r\n are going \n              to be broken since they have served their term an=\r\nd utility and must \n              be replaced by a newer consciousness, the=\r\n consciousness of the soul \n              rather than of the ego. This is t=\r\nhe true solution and the solution \n              of the future. To live in =\r\nand by the soul rather than for the ego \n              is the final solutio=\r\nn to all our miseries including those that hurt \n              and bruise u=\r\ns. To live in the ego is to be forever vulnerable. To \n              live i=\r\nn the soul is to be secure and free.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, ne=\r\nw york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;=\r\nApple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b=\r\n&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot;&gt;I have a hundred lives before =\r\nme yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, /&lt;/span&gt; Be sure I will with h=\r\neart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt; -Sri Aurobi=\r\nndo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_1342435272=\r\n49952\n yui_3_2_0_2_137332740501958&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT=\r\n-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-family: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; font=\r\n-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, times,=\r\n serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D=\r\n&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; N=\r\narasimha P.V.R.

If you approach the action w=\r\nith a calm and devoted mind, see the action and its object(s) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;with love, devotion and cari=\r\nng&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt; and focus the more of your attention on the action and its=\r\n objects (rather than youself and your own happiness), then it becomes a ri=\r\ntual or sadhana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-s=\r\nize:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transpar=\r\nent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica,=\r\n sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;=\r\n3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, in some actions one hates, it is very difficult to brin=\r\ng that calmness and caring. In some other actions (e.g. sex), one may becom=\r\ne too selfish or self-absorbed and think\n too much about one&#39;s own sensatio=\r\nns, to look at the action and other persons/objects with love, caring, devo=\r\ntion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13p=\r\nx;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;fon=\r\nt-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-s=\r\nerif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;Thus, we normally don&#39;t talk about converting all actions into sadhana an=\r\nd talk about japam, homam etc. It is easier in those to look at the action =\r\nand its objects with a sense of purity and devotion. However, if that is no=\r\nt possible and one has to do some other actions, why note TRY to convert th=\r\nem into sadhana? Try to perform the action with a calm, stable, selfless mi=\r\nnd, focus attention on the action and its objects and imbibe love and carin=\r\ng into your\n thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);=\r\nfont-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:tr=\r\nansparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helv=\r\netica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font si=\r\nze=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, =\r\n0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-co=\r\nlor:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial=\r\n, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, at some stage, (3) has to become part of\n one=\r\n&#39;s sadhana. One has to convert every action into a sadhana. Just doing japa=\r\nm or homam for an hour or two may not cut it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-se=\r\nrif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;=\r\nfont-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-=\r\nstyle:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you live in a really cold country,=\r\n your room can get very cold. If you turn the heater on for an hour everyda=\r\ny and keep it off rest of the time, the room will overall be very cold. Sim=\r\nilarly, if you do sadhana for an hour, you may feel better, but the normal =\r\nattitude returns. To make permanent progress, the heater has to be on most =\r\nof the day! Of course, as you cannot do japam or homam for 12 hours a day, =\r\nyou have to convert whatever you do (eating, driving to\n work, your work, d=\r\nriving back, cooking, eating, talking to people, etc) into sadhana. At some=\r\n stage, every seeker will have to start doing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);fon=\r\nt-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-colo=\r\nr:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasim=\r\nha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollo=\r\nw&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-siz=\r\ne:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:tra=\r\nnsparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left:2px sol=\r\nid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:a=\r\nrial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;div\n=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12p=\r\nt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;hr =\r\nsize=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;font =\r\nsize=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Du=\r\nrgesh Mishra &lt;durgesh.mishra@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, July 30, 2013 11:43 AM&lt;br&gt;=\r\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] mo=\r\nst difficult question&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv4433008198y_msg_c=\r\nontainer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4433008198&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4433008198ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div di=\r\nr=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dear All,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you are interested in spiritual s=\r\nadhana, dhyaan, homam, fasting etc and your spouse doesn&#39;t like you doing i=\r\nt ? then what should you do ?&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Durgesh O Mishra&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;&quot;If you only h=\r\nave a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.&quot;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    =\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div=\r\n&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--192144850-1787627619-1375640860=:31288--\r\n\n"}}
