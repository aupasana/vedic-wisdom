Balram Reddy. Moreover, his understanding of Sri Aurobindo&#39;s wor=\r\nk seems to be very superficial and mistaken. It is surprising to see that a=\r\nfter being in the Ashram he confuses Sri Aurobindo&#39;s teachings with physica=\r\nl immortality.\n\nIt is also factually incorrect that disciples of Sri Aurobi=\r\nndo and Mother were not allowed to visit Ramanashram. Shri Balaram Reddy se=\r\nems to confuse his imaginations for facts.\n\nThere were several instances wh=\r\nen Mother and Sri Aurobindo would send disciples away to Ramanashram saying=\r\n they are more suited for the path of Ramana Maharishi than the Integral Yo=\r\nga. I know of atleast one case (there could be several) where Ramana Mahari=\r\nshi sent disciples to Sri Aurobindo Ashram as they were meant for the path =\r\nof Integral Yoga. \n\nIt is very possible that Ramana Maharishi might have sa=\r\nid something specific to Balaram Reddy to help him come out of his guilt co=\r\nnsciousness of having left Sri Aurobindo Ashram without full consent of his=\r\n Guru. We need to take Balaram Reddy&#39;s recollections and opinions (especial=\r\nly his assumptions and interpolations) with a big pinch of salt. \n\n-Shiva.\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Prasanth Jalasutram &lt;jvrsprasanth@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  In 1931, after reading about Sri Aurobindo, and also hearing =\r\nabout him from\n&gt; others, I made my way to his ashrama in Pondicherry. Immed=\r\niately upon my\n&gt; arrival I was struck by the spiritual atmosphere of the pl=\r\nace. On August\n&gt; 15th of that year, I had my first darshan of Sri Aurobindo=\r\n. This was one of\n&gt; three times in a year that he gave darshan. I found Sri=\r\n Aurobindo and Mother\n&gt; to be powerful spiritual personalities, as they see=\r\nmed to have the ability\n&gt; to work on the development of their disciples in =\r\na silent and invisible\n&gt; manner. All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings =\r\ncannot convey his or the\n&gt; Mother&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wh=\r\nile I was in Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed\n&gt; discip=\r\nle of both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then\n&gt; visiting S=\r\nri Ramanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharshi and his\n&gt; ashrama. Hi=\r\ns intriguing descriptions, along with the reading of B. V.\n&gt; Narasimhaswami=\r\n&#39;s biography of the Maharshi, is what prompted my first visit\n&gt; to Ramanasr=\r\namam in 1933.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before this second visit to Ramanasramam I once again re=\r\nad Bhagavan&#39;s\n&gt; biography. In it I found a passage relating to the possibil=\r\nity of changing\n&gt; one&#39;s guru. I had a doubt about this and addressed it to =\r\nthe Maharshi. He\n&gt; told me, &quot;Yes. Certainly. One can change his guru. What =\r\nof that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, was =\r\nregulated and\n&gt; controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip into t=\r\nown we had to\n&gt; obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam it was=\r\n totally\n&gt; different. I experienced a liberating feeling of freedom, inform=\r\nality and\n&gt; spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at the same time ele=\r\nvating.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples were generally permitted=\r\n to visit all\n&gt; other saints and ashramas, with the exception of the Mahars=\r\nhi and Sri\n&gt; Ramanasramam. It was believed that the Maharshi had the power =\r\nto undo years\n&gt; of spiritual preparation that the Mother and Aurobindo were=\r\n effecting on the\n&gt; psyche of their followers. In other words, they conside=\r\nred the Maharshi too\n&gt; powerful an influence. Bhagavan was aware of this an=\r\nd once when I was alone\n&gt; with him he told me, &quot;Yes, I know of that place. =\r\nThey are afraid of me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Leaving Aurobindo Ashram\n&gt; \n&gt; I had been with =\r\nthe Mother and Aurobindo for five years. During those years\n&gt; they showered=\r\n me with kindness and love, while guiding me on the spiritual\n&gt; path. My gr=\r\natitude and regard for them compelled me to obtain their\n&gt; permission and b=\r\nlessings before leaving. This turned out to be much more\n&gt; difficult than I=\r\n imagined.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Aurobindo Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples w=\r\nho had doubts or\n&gt; questions to write them in the form of a letter to Sri A=\r\nurobindo. All the\n&gt; letters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, wh=\r\no would sit with the\n&gt; Mother during the nights and promptly answer them in=\r\n writing. Sometimes we\n&gt; would see the lights burning all night as they wer=\r\ne engaged in this work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Upon my return from Ramanasramam I wrote a let=\r\nter stating my desire to\n&gt; receive their blessings and permission to live a=\r\nt Ramanasramam. In the\n&gt; letter to Aurobindo I wrote that since your yoga b=\r\negins with\n&gt; Self-realization, kindly permit me to go to Ramana Maharshi wh=\r\no emphasizes\n&gt; only Self-realization, a state I have not attained, or may n=\r\not even be\n&gt; worthy of attaining. Aurobindo&#39;s reply was affectionate, but n=\r\negative in\n&gt; regards to my leaving his ashram. He wrote, &quot;Both Self-realiza=\r\ntion and the\n&gt; supra-mental state can be simultaneously developed and achie=\r\nved here. There\n&gt; is no need for you to go there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I was extremely dis=\r\nappointed at his response and consequently became\n&gt; frustrated, restless an=\r\nd discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights\n&gt; and felt distraught.=\r\n I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same\n&gt; request. Again I=\r\n was denied permission. It took a long five months and a\n&gt; third letter bef=\r\nore Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving me their\n&gt; permission a=\r\nnd blessings. Perhaps they realized I was determined to go and\n&gt; they saw n=\r\no other recourse but to grant my request.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final letter =\r\nto me he wrote, &quot;Since you are determined to\n&gt; follow a path in which you c=\r\nan achieve only partial realization, we give you\n&gt; our blessings, though we=\r\n believe it would be better if you stayed on here\n&gt; and pursued your sadhan=\r\na where both the Mother and I can help you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It was the rule in Aurobi=\r\nndo Ashram that any letter written to or received\n&gt; from Aurobindo should n=\r\not leave the ashram premises. So, to comply with this\n&gt; rule, I burnt all m=\r\ny letters, except the final letter I received from\n&gt; Aurobindo. This I kept=\r\n with the view of showing it to Bhagavan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Settling at Sri Ramanasramam=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; During the early years there were no houses anywhere near the ashram,=\r\n as it\n&gt; was mostly jungle or forest. I eventually found an upstairs room i=\r\nn a\n&gt; brahmin&#39;s house near the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I wo=\r\nuld\n&gt; sometimes cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from som=\r\newhere\n&gt; outside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.\n&gt; \n&gt; D=\r\naily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in the\n&gt; h=\r\nall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back again to the\n=\r\n&gt; ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on like this during =\r\nthe\n&gt; first year. If possible, I would always sit close to Bhagavan so I co=\r\nuld\n&gt; hear all of his precious utterances.\n&gt; \n&gt; S. S. Cohen, after repeated=\r\nly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decided that the\n&gt; Yogi from Pondicherry mu=\r\nst have some greatness. Consequently, one day he\n&gt; travelled to Pondicherry=\r\n and while there wrote a note to Aurobindo\n&gt; describing who he was, what he=\r\n wanted from life (Self-realization) and where\n&gt; he was then residing (Sri =\r\nRamanasramam). Cohen later showed me the reply he\n&gt; got from Aurobindo. It =\r\nsaid, in brief, that all his aspirations could be\n&gt; fulfilled at Sri Ramana=\r\nsramam, where he was then living.\n&gt; \n&gt; I remember during my second visit to=\r\n Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day\n&gt; reading a lengthy book review from=\r\n a newspaper. The book being reviewed was\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s Lights on Yoga. The=\r\n reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of\n&gt; this newspaper was Bhagavan=\r\n&#39;s devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed to take\n&gt; great interest in the r=\r\neview and would occasionally stop reading and comment\n&gt; on what he had just=\r\n read to those sitting around him. When he had concluded\n&gt; reading it, some=\r\none who was aware that I had that very book with me, said to\n&gt; Bhagavan, &quot;T=\r\nhis man has come from the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book\n&gt; with him.=\r\n&quot; Bhagavan turned to me and said, &quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have a\n&gt; look at =\r\nit.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I went back to my room, fetched the book and handed it over to Bh=\r\nagavan.\n&gt; Immediately Bhagavan began reading it intently. He kept on readin=\r\ng it well\n&gt; into the night, with the help of a small oil lamp, until he fin=\r\nished it.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I came into the hall the next day he began discussing t=\r\nhe book with me,\n&gt; telling me that a certain term used in the book might lo=\r\nok like something\n&gt; new, but it is actually the equivalent of this other te=\r\nrm used in such and\n&gt; such ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discuss=\r\ning and comparing\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thorou=\r\nghly understood\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy both intellectually and also from =\r\nthe standpoint of\n&gt; experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; One evening I said to Bhagavan that th=\r\ne major attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s\n&gt; teachings is that it professes that imm=\r\nortality of the body can be achieved.\n&gt; Bhagavan made no comment.\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nnext day, as soon as I walked into the hall and sat down, Bhagavan\n&gt; looked=\r\n at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakonam there was one yogi, C. V. V.\n&gt; Rao=\r\n, who was proclaiming to all, his doctrine of the immortality of the\n&gt; body=\r\n. He was even so bold as to declare that Dr. Annie Besant (a\n&gt; distinguishe=\r\nd public and spiritual personality in India) would have to come\n&gt; to him to=\r\n learn how to make her body immortal. But, before he had a chance\n&gt; to meet=\r\n Dr. Annie Besant, he died.&quot; This brief story clearly illustrated his\n&gt; poi=\r\nnt.\n&gt; \n&gt; On another day, not too long after settling near Sri Ramanasramam,=\r\n I\n&gt; approached Bhagavan when no one was in the hall and showed him that la=\r\nst\n&gt; letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan asked me to give it to =\r\nhim to\n&gt; read. I told him he would be unable to decipher Aurobindo&#39;s handwr=\r\niting, as\n&gt; it was very illegible and only those who have studied it for so=\r\nmetime could\n&gt; read it. He said, &quot;Give it to me. Let me try.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; After lo=\r\noking into it and realizing he could only make out a few words, he\n&gt; return=\r\ned it and asked me to read it out. I began reading it and when I came\n&gt; to =\r\nthe sentence, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in which you can\n&gt;=\r\n achieve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me and said,\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nPartial realization? If it is partial, it is not realization, and if it is\n=\r\n&gt; realization, it is not partial.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This was the final blow that silenc=\r\ned all my doubts. I then destroyed this\n&gt; letter, like all the rest. And be=\r\ncause of all the discussions I had had with\n&gt; Bhagavan I soon felt perfectl=\r\ny established in his teachings, having a clear\n&gt; understanding of where the=\r\n Maharshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s path diverged and\n&gt; went different ways. W=\r\nhen all the clouds of doubts and distractions\n&gt; dispersed, so did our discu=\r\nssions. Bhagavan then knew that I understood and\n&gt; the foundation work had =\r\nbeen done. The purpose of all our discussions were\n&gt; served and so they sto=\r\npped automatically.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe the most unique characteristic of Bhagav=\r\nan was the power of his\n&gt; presence. Much of what he taught had already been=\r\n transmitted to the masses\n&gt; down through the ages. In Bhagavan we found a =\r\nbeing that was surcharged with\n&gt; the Reality to such an extent that coming =\r\ninto his presence would effect a\n&gt; dramatic change in us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sources:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; a) http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmay-jun\n&gt; b) http://w=\r\nww.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Dmar-apr\n&gt; c) http://www.arunachala=\r\n.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Djul-aug\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =E0=B0&quot;=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=AF\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
