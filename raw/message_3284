Thought of mailing them to you. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0Jumping =\r\non conclusion without properly studying/thinking about Thakur&#39;s life, just =\r\non literal meaning of those 2 words would be a sure blasphemy.\n=C2=A0\nYou a=\r\nre right. But since this is a debate and just a debate, =C2=A0let me put fo=\r\nrth some logical points.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\n1) Two wrongs never make a right. Th=\r\nis is one mistake we Indians do when we try to debate over something. When =\r\nwe are discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matter whether Ramakrishna - who=\r\n lived in a different century - was right or now. That would be a different=\r\n debate. \n=C2=A0\n2) Ramakrishna did not write anything -:). He only=C2=A0wo=\r\nke up=C2=A0people to what ever degree was necessary and gave general talks =\r\non spirituality. So, one can always contend that a mistake maybe the biogra=\r\nphers mistake. M or Saradananda=C2=A0could very well have been mistaken in =\r\nwhat he quoted. Giving a freewheeling talk is different from creating a com=\r\nposition. When one writes, one has more time and energy to indulge in think=\r\ning, and checking up possibilities of different shades of meanings for the =\r\nsimple reason that the audience is large, unknown and spread out=C2=A0over =\r\nhuge spans of time.=C2=A0When one talks, and that too talking to friends, o=\r\nr close people, one does not need to be careful of every word or sentence o=\r\nne speaks. \n=C2=A0\nTo understand this better,=C2=A0=C2=A0we have to think -=\r\n scientifically speaking - how communication happens in three levels. Aroun=\r\nd 33 percent of the communication is through the words, 64 percent through =\r\nbody language and a solid 3 percent is &#39;unknown&#39; or sub conscious communica=\r\ntion. This last three percent is the most powerful. When a person can use t=\r\nhis 3 percent of sub conscious communication - he can move masses of people=\r\n. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also do so (IMO). If you listen t=\r\no the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find it uninspiring. But if =\r\nyou were to be present in a live rock concert, you will definitely feel an =\r\nenergy and get swayed.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\nThen comes body language which is so i=\r\nmportant.=C2=A0For example,=C2=A0if you enter a Govt office in India, you m=\r\nay find that the babus there will be sitting relaxed in their chair with th=\r\neir spine reclining. Whatever you say will hardly make any impact on them. =\r\nThat is why the files in Govt. of India offices move at a=C2=A0snail&#39;s pace=\r\n.=C2=A0If you find that someone whom you are talking to=C2=A0is sitting cro=\r\nss legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the right, even if the person =\r\nmay hang on eagerly to every word you speak, know it for the sure that ther=\r\ne is a strong change he is listening through one ear and throwing out the w=\r\nords through the other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect, once you=\r\n leave his presence he probably=C2=A0won&#39;t bother about what you said.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nAnd last is spoken word. When two people speak with each other, both wo=\r\nrds and body language come into picture. Sometimes sub conscious communicat=\r\nion too can happen. Therefore there is a LOT of the energy exchanged/commun=\r\nica tion not through words but through other means. \n=C2=A0\nWhen you write =\r\ndown something, body languages gets negated. Therefore, one needs to be ext=\r\nra cautious while writing something in order to convey the correct sense. T=\r\nhat is why there are so many more rules to be followed=C2=A0for writing any=\r\nthing.\n=C2=A0\nSo therefore, if Ramakrishna is &quot;talking&quot; to someone he is pr=\r\nobably communicating using all means possible. But if he were to write a bo=\r\nok and mention &quot;Kamini and Kanchan&quot; without further explanation of what he =\r\nintends to mean, then he too can be called to question. But he never wrote =\r\nany books, and the authors who did, made sure they explained the sense. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\nContrast this to that line from Ramacharit Manas, without any qualif=\r\nications, that implies &quot;women&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot; are worthy of &quot;tadan&quot;.=C2=\r\n=A0 If I were a woman, I would take offense=C2=A0to that line.=C2=A0 \n=C2=\r\n=A0\n3) Whenever I am doing a critic of a religious literature, I keep the K=\r\noran as a standard. By this I mean, whenever I am judging a book of religio=\r\nus nature, I follow the same parameters of judgement that I use when I judg=\r\ne the Koran as a book.\n=C2=A0\nThe Koran contains a verse, translated correc=\r\ntly in the M.A. Shakir and Dawood translations, which recommend husbands to=\r\n beat their wives if the wives are disobedient. \n=C2=A0\n\n&quot;Men are the maint=\r\nainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and bec=\r\nause they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedien=\r\nt, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose par=\r\nt you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in their sleeping=\r\n places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against the=\r\nm; surely Allah is High, Great. (Shakir&#39;s version of the Koran, Quran, 4:34=\r\n) \n=C2=A0\nA lot of muslims I have talked to, defend the above=C2=A0giving v=\r\narious reasons one of which is &#39;misunderstanding context&#39;. I find it inexcu=\r\nsable. Same way a line in a religious book bracketing &quot;nari&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot;, &quot;sud=\r\nra&quot; together, I find=C2=A0to be equally inexcusable. That is the sense that=\r\n comes out from a normal reading of that line. I am not commenting on the w=\r\nhole of Ramcharit Manas, but that one vital line.\n=C2=A0\n[Prem, Ahinsa], Sa=\r\ntya Vachan aur=C2=A0Par-stri Matusamaan|\nInase agar prabhu na mile to Tulas=\r\ni Juth Jabaan ||\n(I have given=C2=A0this doha =C2=A0out of memory and its q=\r\nuite possible that first two=C2=A0wrods are wrong in the doha )=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nInteresting doha. Maybe you are right, maybe you are not. But that line=\r\n (pashu/naari etc)=C2=A0definitely conveys a simple meaning. If=C2=A0Tulasi=\r\ndasji ment what you are saying, he should have used some appropiate punctua=\r\ntion marks. Since he did not, I have to reject your explanation. Or I can s=\r\nay, Tulasidasji respects women a lot, but that line is simply a bad composi=\r\ntion. One way or the other, I cannot absolve the composer of that specific =\r\nline.\n=C2=A0\nBTW,=C2=A0 were you refering to the Gita verse 1.41 where Arju=\r\nna talks about women of the family getting corrupted?\n=C2=A0\nYou and I&#39;ve n=\r\notably common Astrological factors in our chart.

The highlig=\r\nhting is done by you, not in the actual text. If he ment pashu-nari he shou=\r\nld have used some basic grammer to remove confusion. He did not. At the lev=\r\nel of text, it is indefensible. Also, if I go by your explanation, why only=\r\n Naari who are pashu, why not Naras who are like pashus? There are more Naa=\r\nras of Pashu nature than Naaris in the world.=C3=82=C2=A0This explanation=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 that you found looks more like a back engineering job to bail =\r\nout.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Regarding Rama self realization, I thi=\r\nnk I was unable to express the ideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again=\r\n. He is not really saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact=\r\n he quite agrees that Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, =\r\n(his opinion)=C3=82=C2=A0God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be wor=\r\nshipped. He descended in order to lead by example. That is why the text is =\r\ncalled Rama+ayana. A path that an ordinary man can and should follow. One o=\r\nf principles.=C3=82=C2=A0 Compare this to the name of the other great epic,=\r\n Mahabharata, which was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One cannot follow Krish=\r\nna&#39;s path. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godho=\r\nod to Sri Rama, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between=\r\n the worshipper and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a li=\r\nfe like Rama did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great kin=\r\ng, a nobel man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following=\r\n such a life.\n&gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can fo=\r\nllow the life of a great man.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, even today lot of=\r\n people advise that one should try to become like Vivekananda, or that this=\r\n country needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in teh future. It does not =\r\nmean Vivekanada was not a self realized=C3=82=C2=A0saint of highest calibre=\r\n, but his life&#39;s image is like=C3=82=C2=A0one who=C3=82=C2=A0lived like a l=\r\nion among sheep of ordinary=C3=82=C2=A0men, fearless and uncompromising and=\r\n principled. If every=C3=82=C2=A0person would constantly think that Vivekan=\r\nada was a saint=C3=82=C2=A0who worked by the pwoer of a deity or due to his=\r\n extreme spirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C3=82=C2=A0no one wi=\r\nll ever make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C3=82=C2=A0emulate his way=\r\n of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C3=82=C2=A0the image he pr=\r\nojected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire people.=\r\n \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0On the other hand=C3=82=C2=A0you will never =\r\nhear anyone advising that one should try to lead a life like Ramarkishna.=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0That is impossible. He=C3=82=C2=A0 was God incarnat=\r\ne leading a charmed life.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Similar is the case =\r\nwith the Avatar called Sri=C3=82=C2=A0Ramachandra incomparison to Sri Krish=\r\nna.

It is unders=\r\ntandable if he says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe that such a gr=\r\neat person claims Rama is not God.

Mind you, these are all theoritical/ theolo=\r\ngical debates - nothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he stopped =\r\nthe debate because I was getting agitated and it would have affected our fr=\r\niendship. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Whenever his opinion is aske=\r\nd on anything, he will only mention that what he can support using logic. T=\r\nherefore he never generally discusses spirituality with anyone per se. He w=\r\nill discuss and debate scriptures using exact quotations etc, (theology)=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0but not about mysticism or sadhana or anything whic=\r\nh=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0needs a belief system.

He =\r\nsaid, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed R=\r\navana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the place where h=\r\ne was=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0located when he first heard the news of Sit=\r\na&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose the hard way of des=\r\ntroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend, it is more important t=\r\no emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Rama.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodge=\r\npodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s=\r\n paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but a critics =\r\nnightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women with animals =\r\nor something similar. He believes that was introduces in the text because T=\r\nulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up com=\r\nposing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama =\r\nis worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Ra=\r\nma was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be worshippe=\r\nd because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be =\r\nmore God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; The above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Dear U=\r\ntpal,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; One request, if you can speak to =\r\nhim about his thought on Food habits, it&#39;ll be great.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I have been out of touch with him since August, been busy =\r\nmyself.

I met him about two years bac=\r\nk. What first attracted me to=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 towards him was hi=\r\ns impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0whe=\r\nn it comes to=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0honestly.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simpl=\r\ne, harmless=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he w=\r\nould not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually =\r\nnever ever=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0spoken even a single lie in his whole =\r\nlife, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teacher told him th=\r\nat Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his teacher. Later=\r\n someone else told him English is more comprehensive language and the world=\r\n cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself two =\r\nthick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten\n years every day=\r\n he spend one hour reading the\n&gt; English dictionary and\n&gt; &gt; one hour readin=\r\ng the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0up volu=\r\nmes of Hindi and English literature.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0When I asked=\r\n him why, he just said it is because he wanted to be=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0equally adept at both the languages so that one day he can take a rea=\r\nlly detached view to judge the truth about=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0which =\r\nis more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitud=\r\ne when it comes to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he i=\r\ns a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to =\r\neducation to journalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks=\r\n and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Pers=\r\nian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above =\r\nlanguages. When he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While =\r\napplying for a job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. Whe=\r\nn the clerk who was supposed to take the forms\n saw that blank space,\n&gt; he =\r\nasked\n&gt; &gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. =\r\nSeeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up righ=\r\nt there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the=\r\n form would have been a lie. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; So this g=\r\nives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever kno=\r\nws him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; One=\r\n day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His way to=\r\n office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the tem=\r\nple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temple, but he d=\r\nid. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is=\r\n 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he=\r\n asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat down an=\r\nd just stayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. The priest=\r\n somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this hap=\r\npened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say=\r\n much about these, infact most people who know him also do not know these t=\r\nhings. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditat=\r\nion seat, in the exact same place and same position for 3 days continuously=\r\n.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 Only his wife and close relatives know about t=\r\nhis incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often =\r\nenters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during sama=\r\ndhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am=\r\n the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, childr=\r\nen, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than e=\r\nverything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0He c=\r\nonsiders Sri Krishna to be God and=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Lord Rama to b=\r\ne the ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because h=\r\ne\n thinks it elevated\n&gt; Sri=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Rama to the\n&gt; &gt; level=\r\n of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri R=\r\nama as an ideal man,=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0not a God.The difference he =\r\nsays is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man =\r\ncan and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated b=\r\ny ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, bu=\r\nt I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru=\r\n at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless =\r\nto say, he is not an atheist any more.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nLater he had once=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0mentioned he knew the relation =\r\nhe had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mother he says=\r\n, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time o=\r\nn different internet forums interacting with people, specially=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0with those in=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0the age group of 18 =\r\nto 30, discussing anything and everything with them, from Indian politics t=\r\no Indian history, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge =\r\nto young people who will be the future of this country.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; He is am omnivorous person.

This is one mistake we India=\r\nns do when we try to debate over something. When we are discussing Tulasida=\r\nsji, it does not matter whether Ramakrishna - who lived in a different cent=\r\nury - was right or now. That would be a different debate. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;2) Ram=\r\nakrishna did not write anything -:). He only&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;people to wh=\r\nat ever degree was necessary and gave general talks on spirituality. So, on=\r\ne can always contend that a mistake maybe the biographers mistake. M or Sar=\r\nadananda&nbsp;could very well have been mistaken in what he quoted. Giving =\r\na freewheeling talk is different from creating a composition. When one writ=\r\nes, one has more time and energy to indulge in thinking, and checking up po=\r\nssibilities of different shades of meanings for the simple reason that the =\r\naudience is large, unknown and spread out&nbsp;over huge spans of time.&nbs=\r\np;When one talks, and that too talking to friends, or close people, one doe=\r\ns not need to be careful of every word or sentence one speaks. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;T=\r\no understand this better,&nbsp;&nbsp;we have to think - scientifically spea=\r\nking - how communication happens in three levels. Around 33 percent of the =\r\ncommunication is through the words, 64 percent through body language and a =\r\nsolid 3 percent is &#39;unknown&#39; or sub conscious communication. This last thre=\r\ne percent is the most powerful. When a person can use this 3 percent of sub=\r\n conscious communication - he can move masses of people. All great leaders =\r\ndo so. All rock stars also do so (IMO). If you listen to the lyrics of an a=\r\nverage rock music, you may find it uninspiring. But if you were to be prese=\r\nnt in a live rock concert, you will definitely feel an energy and get swaye=\r\nd.&nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;Then comes body language which is so important.&nbsp;Fo=\r\nr example,&nbsp;if you enter a Govt office in India, you may find that the =\r\nbabus there will be sitting relaxed in their chair with their spine reclini=\r\nng. Whatever you say will hardly make any impact on them. That is why the f=\r\niles in Govt. of India offices move at a&nbsp;snail&#39;s pace.&nbsp;If you fin=\r\nd that someone whom you are talking to&nbsp;is sitting cross legged on a ch=\r\nair, with left leg crossing the right, even if the person may hang on eager=\r\nly to every word you speak, know it for the sure that there is a strong cha=\r\nnge he is listening through one ear and throwing out the words through the =\r\nother. In short, pretending to listen. In effect, once you leave his presen=\r\nce he probably&nbsp;won&#39;t bother about what you said.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;And last is=\r\n spoken word. When two people speak with each other, both words and body la=\r\nnguage come into picture. Sometimes sub conscious communication too can hap=\r\npen. Therefore there is a LOT of the energy exchanged/communica tion not th=\r\nrough words but through other means. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgi=\r\na&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;When you write down somethi=\r\nng, body languages gets negated. Therefore, one needs to be extra cautious =\r\nwhile writing something in order to convey the correct sense. That is why t=\r\nhere are so many more rules to be followed&nbsp;for writing anything.&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeo=\r\nrgia&gt;So therefore, if Ramakrishna is &quot;talking&quot; to someone he is probably co=\r\nmmunicating using all means possible. But if he were to write a book and me=\r\nntion &quot;Kamini and Kanchan&quot; without further explanation of what he intends t=\r\no mean, then he too can be called to question. But he never wrote any books=\r\n, and the authors who did, made sure they explained the sense. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;C=\r\nontrast this to that line from Ramacharit Manas, without any qualifications=\r\n, that implies &quot;women&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot; are worthy of &quot;tadan&quot;.&nbsp; If I =\r\nwere a woman, I would take offense&nbsp;to that line.&nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;3) W=\r\nhenever I am doing a critic of a religious literature, I keep the Koran as =\r\na standard.

Let me try again. He is not really =\r\nsaying that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees th=\r\nat Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinion)=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descend=\r\ned in order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. =\r\nA path that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles.=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp; Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, which=\r\n was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One cannot follow\n Krishna&#39;s path. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to =\r\nSri Rama, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the w=\r\norshipper and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life lik=\r\ne Rama did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a n=\r\nobel man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following such =\r\na life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can fo=\r\nllow the life of a great man.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, even =\r\ntoday lot of people advise that one should try to become like Vivekananda, =\r\nor that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in teh future. =\r\nIt does not mean Vivekanada was not a self realized=C3=82&nbsp;saint of hig=\r\nhest calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like=C3=82&nbsp;one who=C3=82&nbsp;li=\r\nved like a lion among sheep of ordinary=C3=82&nbsp;men, fearless and uncomp=\r\nromising and principled. If every=C3=82&nbsp;person would constantly\n think=\r\n that Vivekanada was a saint=C3=82&nbsp;who worked by the pwoer of a deity =\r\nor due to his extreme spirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;no one will ever make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C3=82&nbsp;em=\r\nulate his way of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C3=82&nbsp;th=\r\ne image he projected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can in=\r\nspire people. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;On the other hand=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;you will never hear anyone advising that one should try to lead=\r\n a life like Ramarkishna.=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;That is impossible. He=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; was God incarnate leading a charmed life.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similar is the case with the Avatar called Sri=C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;Ramachandra incomparison to Sri Krishna.
