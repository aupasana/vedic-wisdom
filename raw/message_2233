He =\r\nchose the path to find out &quot;Who am i?&quot; (&quot;Naan Yaar?&quot;). in other words -self=\r\n realisation. he finally realised the self and understood personally that t=\r\nhere is nothing but self. it only is. one without second which Adi Shanka a=\r\nnd many others have equivivocally stated earlier.\n\nNow one important point =\r\nto note in case of Raman Maharashi which can easily go unnoticed by some. I=\r\n&#39;ve read that one person came to Ramana&#39;s Ashram and stayed with him for so=\r\nme time in the hope that he will be able to see live form of his chosen dei=\r\nty which was Bhagavan Shree Ramchandra. It is mentioned that when he was ta=\r\nking leave of Maharshi, he finally saw Shri Rama in Maharshi and was overjo=\r\nyed and satisfied. (I&#39;ve given this episode out of my memory so please excu=\r\nse me if some details are not exactly correct)\n\nIf we scrutinise this incid=\r\nent with more intrest than it suggests us few very important things.\n* Thou=\r\ngh Raman Maharashi is generally regarded as Self Realised saint and chiefly=\r\n taught self realisation to people, he was not UNAWARE of &quot;Forms of GODS&quot; i=\r\nn the plane of Duality. or else he would not have satisfied the devotee by =\r\nshowing him the form of Sri Rama.\n\nWho knows?....during the mind-blowing Sa=\r\nadhana which Maharshi did for many years for Self realisation, he would hav=\r\ne by all chances, also realised many aspect of the self such as Forms of Go=\r\nds and goddesses, and many other aspect which we even haven&#39;t heard of.\n\nno=\r\nw can we say hear that Raman was only a Self Realised and NOT God Realised.=\r\n\n\n***\n\nIf we look at Thakur&#39;s life chronolgy, He seems to have first Realis=\r\ned &#39;Kali&#39; in her Human form. we can say that he realised God (If we conside=\r\nr form of Mother Kali as God). same way he realised Gods in different forms=\r\n such as Rama and Krishna.\n\nJust turn our attention to his Advait Sadhana u=\r\nnder guidance of Totapuri ji and we know that he was established in Brahman=\r\n aspect in just 3 days and remain in that state for almost 6 months afterwo=\r\nrds. so he experienced the &#39;Ekmevaadwitiya&#39;.\n\nso now can we say that he was=\r\n God Realised and not self realised?. actually in my thinking it is not cor=\r\nrect to imagine for Spiritual giants like Shankara, Budhha, Ramana, Thakur,=\r\n Jesus, Gnyaaneshwar etc..knew only one aspect of supreme. i think they kne=\r\nw many aspects which are poular amongst us and may be some more also which =\r\nare yet not known to us. for them These two words (GOD & SELF) may not make=\r\n any sense at all.\n\nBut for ordinary mortals like me, i think that there is=\r\n some difference still and the difference may remain. what i mean here is s=\r\nuppose i am Shiva Bhakta or Mahalakshmi Bhakta and i do intense saadhana to=\r\n meet them, see them, talk to them in person and i may eventually realised =\r\nthem with their popular forms BUT if i, for any reasons stopped there then =\r\nfor me Self Realsiations will still be far away. like Thakur said do not st=\r\nop and keep going forward and you will find one after the other more precio=\r\nus wealth.\nmay be END is self realisation or merging in to Brahman. I don&#39;t=\r\n want get dragged in to Dwait, Adwait and vishistaadvait debate.\n\nMy Thakur=\r\n used gto say Kali-Krishna and Brahman are the same !\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal=\r\n \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; What is the difference between self realization=\r\n and God realization?=A0We often say=A0Buddha or Sri Ramanamaharishi or Sri=\r\n Adi Shankaracharya were self realized masters, whereas a Ramakrishna Param=\r\nhamsa was a God realized master.
