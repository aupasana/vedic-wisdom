Like Ra=\r\njarshi has mentioned, I wish to say that many members of this list are well=\r\n read. I assume that they must have read many a books from different author=\r\ns and covering many philosophies. I have myself read books of various sages=\r\n, yogis and philosophers. It was not accurate when you said Vimalananda is =\r\nthe only saint, this list discuss about. This assumption was not right.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I being a gruhastha, know very well, the importance of Material success, =\r\neven for survival. I am not completely against asking for some material suc=\r\ncess while doing some saadhana (Say Homa, Japa etc...) but i feel that it i=\r\ns much better, atleast for people who engage in serious saadhana, to consci=\r\nously try for reducing and removing the thoughts of some or the other wants=\r\n. If i take my example, When i started Homam, i dont remember thinking anyt=\r\nime about money, fame, career etc...during Homam or Japa. it is clear now t=\r\no me that i was provided by Mother what i needed to survive and even better=\r\n. It also happened that I lost a good amount of money in a certain case but=\r\n i never related to the Spiritual practices especially Homam. Infact i trie=\r\nd not to relate any Material succes or losses to Homam. though I must say h=\r\nere that several people who attended Homam with me have been benefited mate=\r\nrially and that has instilled faith in them.\n&gt; In my opinion, it is a very =\r\nbeautiful suggetion to leave it to God to decide what is right and what is =\r\nwrong, what is required and what is not for us rather than asking or doing =\r\nsaadhana for getting specific material result on a *Regular basis*. but tha=\r\nt is my personal opinion and it can differ with yours and i respect that.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; My message to Rajesh was on the same line. as i known him, i was little=\r\n personal when i wrote.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; It is to be also noted that while this g=\r\nroup is propogating Homam as Saadhana, it also respect other paths such as =\r\nJapa, Kirtana, Self inquiry. Narasimha and others are open in that way. Wha=\r\nt i personally say is that do any saadhana you like but do it with regulari=\r\nty, seriously and dedicatedly. Last thing i (or others on the list) will wa=\r\nnt is to be fanatic about one particular saint or path or God or book.\n&gt; Ho=\r\nwever, i should also add here that after going through many books and many =\r\ndifferent forms of Saadhanas, it is better to get the crux, select one Saad=\r\nhana or Idea to experience and stick to it. reading many books has a danger=\r\n of creating fascination for reading, generate confusions and stop one for =\r\nengaging in to Saadhana.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; On some other discussions about Guru,=\r\n I should put my personal experience again. I never hanker for Finding Guru=\r\n. i never went out for that. Niether in Astrology nor in Spirituality. As R=\r\namakrsihna aptly used to say- &quot;Satchidananda is the real Guru&quot;. God is all =\r\nknowing. i trust and relied upon. when my time was up, Guru in flash and bl=\r\nood came.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is my habit to describe personal experiences which may or=\r\n may not be useful. As it is in fashion to say now a days - :Igonre me as a=\r\n fool if it does not make any sense to you&quot; and also &quot;No Offence meant&quot; is =\r\nalso another popular statement. \n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; PS: Raju, =\r\nthere is no pint of thinking as to how Homam will change your destiny and s=\r\nuch things. Let us review after a couple of years if anything has changed.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The original question from Rajesh was a very good one, =\r\nand a real one . I compliment him for asking it and having the courage to a=\r\nsk it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lord Shiva in Guru Gita tells to Devi Parvati --- &quot;There is=\r\n no mukti without bukti&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any good saint I have had a chance to re=\r\nad or listen or speak to,\n&gt; &gt; never says that &quot;Do Sadhana with spiritual ex=\r\npectations only&quot; In general I mean any type of Sadhana, Japam, Homam, Karma=\r\n Yoga, Seva, Charitable donation, bhajan,satsang and many other types.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; They always try to increase further the Shraddaha of a sadhak in thing=\r\ns that captivates a Sadhaka&#39;s mind due to his or her state of sanskars.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; They always try to help the Sadhak walk on the path that leads toward=\r\ns spirituality. They always wish well for their disciples and have good amo=\r\nunt of patience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many Sadgurus take care of their disciples for ma=\r\nny life times, helping and guiding in each life time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They always =\r\npreach many things and show value for different types of sadhanas depending=\r\n on their state, time, and type of disciple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For householders alwa=\r\nys there are challanges and one should request God to look into it and give=\r\n guidance and help, whether it is food, house, marriage, car, or any materi=\r\nal issue. There is nothing wrong in doing this, even if sadhana done for ma=\r\nterialistic benefits.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Today even those who have renounced househol=\r\nder life have to pray god to fulfill some of their material needs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n We live in very difficult and challanging times and it appears it is going=\r\n to become more challenging.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some material gain can at times make =\r\na person better or more balanced or be more prepared to do sadhana for spir=\r\nitual benefits. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even during an eclipse many people do mantras etc=\r\n to solve problems or improve material conditions, there is nothing wrong a=\r\nbout it. I have read messages in the past on this group suggesting natives =\r\nnot to do it or it is wrong. These type of messages are not correct, it onl=\r\ny confuses people. Time during the eclipse is very good for getting results=\r\n for any sadhana done during that time. it is equally good for material or =\r\nspiritual type.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Everyone has right to have a opinion and share the=\r\nir views but one needs to also understand the influence aspect of those vie=\r\nws.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Every Shotra or prayer or even Geeta or Ramayan, there are rid=\r\ners at the end for results like becoming wealthy, overcoming challenges, en=\r\nemies etc.\n&gt; &gt; If it were inappropriate the Seers from the past would not w=\r\nrite it.\n&gt; &gt; Are they wrong in writing that?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; They write it to mot=\r\nivate people to read them as one reads more times there is a possibility th=\r\nat may lead to change in the person&#39;s attitude.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moving to original=\r\n set of questions,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Every one is born with accumulated sanskars out=\r\n of which as a native interacts with the world some of these accumulated or=\r\n sanchit sanskars take the form of prarabdh sanskara, these type of sanskar=\r\ns give pleasure, pain and challanges to the native. Sanchit Sanskars are li=\r\nke seeds and Prarabdh sanskars are like a tree that bears fruit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A=\r\nll human beings are also born with another quality and that is known as wil=\r\nl power. They say will power can change destiny ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When one does =\r\nsadhana like say Homaam or Japam. Many things happen\n&gt; &gt; at many levels, at=\r\n times there is improvement in materialistic situation, problems get solved=\r\n or if the problems remain that state of sadhaka becomes such that he or sh=\r\ne pays less attention to the problem or attaches less importance to the pro=\r\nblem. God or Guru or Shakti shows the sadhaka a path to move forward. Sadha=\r\nna does increase will power and makes one more tolerant and \n&gt; &gt; Sadhana al=\r\nso help in eliminating the sanchit sanskars, in fact one Saint use to say, =\r\ndo your sadhana and your sanchit sanskars will get crushed such that they c=\r\nan never germinate or fruitify into prarabdh sanskars.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So yes doin=\r\ng sadhana can help one overcome many things at different levels and help on=\r\ne move in the right direction. At times one moves faster or very slowly. Th=\r\ne important thing is moving and if one falls down, than one should immediat=\r\nely get up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are many ways to improve and move faster towards=\r\n spirtuality,\n&gt; &gt; Vimalanda is not just one saint, there are many who have =\r\nreached similar or higher or lower realizations adopting different methods =\r\nand have written very good books too. Sprituality is much bigger, deeper an=\r\nd broader than what Vimalanada has described in his books.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I find =\r\nit little cultish to just refer him all the time in the group. Spirituaity =\r\nis atleast not a narrow cult.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please note that I have nothing agai=\r\nnst Him, I respect him as I respect other saints from the bottom of my hear=\r\nt. I did spent money to get his books and plan to read in near future.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I urge all the readers of this group to read more books from different=\r\n sects, different saints and try to get appropriate influence. Get broader =\r\nand deeper views as that helps forming a good base for spirituality. Spirtu=\r\nality is about tolerance and remaining neutral in different situations.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; The Nath Sampradaya, Shiviates from Kashmir, the lineage of Ramananda=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; Datta Sampradaya, the sufis, even some christain saints (The book of =\r\nMirdad) and many more sects some of the Lhamas of Buddhism had very deeper =\r\nrealizations and experiance. There are many sects in south india too, keral=\r\na, tamil nadu, andhra pradhesh, maharastra,rajasthan, gujarat and other sta=\r\ntes, all of them had great saints.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Generally these saints never bo=\r\nthered to write or explain or were not able to explain. But some did write =\r\nand a lot of good work is out there to explore along with doing sadhana.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We live in times where there is very little guidance available on th=\r\ne path of spirituality. So in these times we have to make up with reading g=\r\nood books written by saints of yestaryers and surrender more to god.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; There is scarcity of Sadgurus and good Sadhaks, we have many entry level=\r\n and confused situation :-) ....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you look at sikhism, the last =\r\nsadguru dev from their sect made the book &quot;granth saheb&quot; as the guru instea=\r\nd of making anyone else take his seat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When Lahiri Mahashaya met a=\r\n famoius saint of kashi, he got lot of respect from him. Some of the famous=\r\n saint&#39;s disciple were upset,\n&gt; &gt; at that the saint reminds them that to re=\r\nach his own spiritual state he took 400 or so years but Lahiri Mahashaya di=\r\nd it in one birth.\n&gt; &gt; His name slips my tongue, he was big and very strong=\r\n lived in water many hours at a time, his name starts with tri. They say th=\r\nat one is not able to stare at the eyes of the statue of the saint at his s=\r\namadhi mandir.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One must always try to broaden ones perspective, al=\r\nl of us have a long long way to go, even if some may feel that oh I only ha=\r\nve some more things left so I may be done in some years, even that is an in=\r\nteresting situation as there is always a chance of falling down.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; E=\r\nven for Saint Bharathari one of the nav naths, he was so elevated but he al=\r\nso had some sanskars that forced him to take birth and enjoy first and than=\r\n suffer due to pingala. He was already realized before his birth as the raj=\r\nah.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did not intend to offend anyone or thier veiws, If I inadver=\r\ntantly did it I appologize in advance, Narashima has written very well many=\r\n times and of late has written some good stuff.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards\n&gt; &gt; M=\r\nitesh \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_=\r\npathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Raju,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems honest outburs=\r\nt.

It=\r\n&#39;s like switching the source (Normal prayers in temples, Japam etc...) for =\r\nasking the same thing.
