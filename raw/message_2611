If the self effort is right, someone somewhere will be sent by=\r\n Nature to give you the necessary guidance. Look=A0at it this way. You have=\r\n a car. A guru is a petrol pump. Once the car reaches the PP, it can get en=\r\nough fuel to reach the destination safely. But, to reach the PP one needs=\r\n=A0some balance fuel.=A0=A0That is=A0the self effort you do before Nature d=\r\necides to help you. \n=A0\nPractically speaking, since the time I had read Ji=\r\nddu Krishnamurti, I disagreed with him on his ideas about Guru. Though I co=\r\nncede that a Guru will probably at the most give you the necessary push. di=\r\nrection but finally it is you who must make the journey. The practical step=\r\n is to keep doing sadhana on your own which is any day better than waiting =\r\nfor the Guru to arrive and start things for you. Also, this is a weird age =\r\nwe live in. For one genuine person there are 90 fakes of all hues and colou=\r\nrs. I know because I have met some awesome fakes.=A0A regular regime of sad=\r\nhana can actually help you in this regard. One, it will tune your mind to s=\r\nome fundamental aspects of spirituality and in ways, help you to avoid inco=\r\nrrect people. Some of these incorrect people are even dangerous.\n=A0\nFor qu=\r\nestions number two, my idea is no effort is wasted. Forget about the end of=\r\n the path, just keep walking. End is not in your hands. Only effort is in y=\r\nour hands.\n=A0\nThe third question is the best one. I do not have any answer=\r\ns to this but merely some opinions which may or may not be correct. Creatio=\r\nn is an act of joy on part of the Brahman. As they say, lila. Lila is play,=\r\n and play is always fun.
