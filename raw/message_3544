What doth it profit to argue about hidden\nand dark things=\r\n, concerning which we shall not be even reproved\nin the judgment, because w=\r\ne knew them not?  Oh, grievous folly,\nto neglect the things which are profi=\r\ntable and necessary, and to\ngive our minds to things which are curious and =\r\nhurtful!  Having\neyes, we see not.\n\n2. And what have we to do with talk abo=\r\nut genus and species!\nHe to whom the Eternal Word speaketh is free from mul=\r\ntiplied\nquestionings.  From this One Word are all things, and all things\nsp=\r\neak of Him; and this is the Beginning which also speaketh unto\nus.(2)  No m=\r\nan without Him understandeth or rightly judgeth.  The\nman to whom all thing=\r\ns are one, who bringeth all things to one,\nwho seeth all things in one, he =\r\nis able to remain steadfast of\nspirit, and at rest in God.  O God, who art =\r\nthe Truth, make me\none with Thee in everlasting love.  It wearieth me often=\r\ntimes to\nread and listen to many things; in Thee is all that I wish for\nand=\r\n desire.  Let all the doctors hold their peace; let all\ncreation keep silen=\r\nce before Thee: speak Thou alone to me.\n\n3. The more a man hath unity and s=\r\nimplicity in himself, the more\nthings and the deeper things he understandet=\r\nh; and that without\nlabour, because he receiveth the light of understanding=\r\n from\nabove.  The spirit which is pure, sincere, and steadfast, is not\ndist=\r\nracted though it hath many works to do, because it doth all\nthings to the h=\r\nonour of God, and striveth to be free from all\nthoughts of self-seeking.  W=\r\nho is so full of hindrance and\nannoyance to thee as thine own undisciplined=\r\n heart?  A man who is\ngood and devout arrangeth beforehand within his own h=\r\neart the\nworks which he hath to do abroad; and so is not drawn away by the\n=\r\ndesires of his evil will, but subjecteth everything to the\njudgment of righ=\r\nt reason.  Who hath a harder battle to fight\nthan he who striveth for self-=\r\nmastery?  And this should be our\nendeavour, even to master self, and thus d=\r\naily to grow stronger\nthan self, and go on unto perfection.\n\n4. All perfect=\r\nion hath some imperfection joined to it in this\nlife, and all our power of =\r\nsight is not without some darkness.  A\nlowly knowledge of thyself is a sure=\r\nr way to God than the deep\nsearching of man&#39;s learning.  Not that learning =\r\nis to be blamed,\nnor the taking account of anything that is good; but a goo=\r\nd\nconscience and a holy life is better than all.  And because many\nseek kno=\r\nwledge rather than good living, therefore they go astray,\nand bear little o=\r\nr no fruit.\n\n5. O if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of v=\r\nice\nand the planting of virtue which they give unto vain\nquestionings: ther=\r\ne had not been so many evil doings and\nstumbling-blocks among the laity, no=\r\nr such ill living among\nhouses of religion.  Of a surety, at the Day of Jud=\r\ngment it will\nbe demanded of us, not what we have read, but what we have do=\r\nne;\nnot how well we have spoken, but how holily we have lived.  Tell\nme, wh=\r\nere now are all those masters and teachers, whom thou\nknewest well, whilst =\r\nthey were yet with you, and flourished in\nlearning?  Their stalls are now f=\r\nilled by others, who perhaps\nnever have one thought concerning them.  Whils=\r\nt they lived they\nseemed to be somewhat, but now no one speaks of them.\n\n6.=\r\n Oh how quickly passeth the glory of the world away!  Would\nthat their life=\r\n and knowledge had agreed together!  For then\nwould they have read and inqu=\r\nired unto good purpose.  How many\nperish through empty learning in this wor=\r\nld, who care little for\nserving God.  And because they love to be great mor=\r\ne than to be\nhumble, therefore they &quot;have become vain in their imaginations=\r\n.&quot;\nHe only is truly great, who hath great charity.  He is truly\ngreat who d=\r\neemeth himself small, and counteth all height of\nhonour as nothing.  He is =\r\nthe truly wise man, who counteth all\nearthly things as dung that he may win=\r\n Christ.  And he is the\ntruly learned man, who doeth the will of God, and f=\r\norsaketh his\nown will.\n\n(1) Psalm xciv. 12; Numbers xii. 8.   (2) John viii=\r\n. 25 (Vulg.).\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nOf prudence in action\n\nWe must not trust every =\r\nword of others or feeling within\nourselves, but cautiously and patiently tr=\r\ny the matter, whether\nit be of God.  Unhappily we are so weak that we find =\r\nit easier to\nbelieve and speak evil of others, rather than good.  But they\n=\r\nthat are perfect, do not give ready heed to every news-bearer,\nfor they kno=\r\nw man&#39;s weakness that it is prone to evil and\nunstable in words.\n\n2. This i=\r\ns great wisdom, not to be hasty in action, or stubborn\nin our own opinions.=\r\n  A part of this wisdom also is not to\nbelieve every word we hear, nor to t=\r\nell others all that we hear,\neven though we believe it.  Take counsel with =\r\na man who is wise\nand of a good conscience; and seek to be instructed by on=\r\ne better\nthan thyself, rather than to follow thine own inventions.  A good\n=\r\nlife maketh a man wise toward God, and giveth him experience in\nmany things=\r\n.  The more humble a man is in himself, and the more\nobedient towards God, =\r\nthe wiser will he be in all things, and the\nmore shall his soul be at peace=\r\n.\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nOf the reading of Holy Scriptures\n\nIt is Truth which we must=\r\n look for in Holy Writ, not cunning of\nwords.  All Scripture ought to be re=\r\nad in the spirit in which it\nwas written.  We must rather seek for what is =\r\nprofitable in\nScripture, than for what ministereth to subtlety in discourse=\r\n.\nTherefore we ought to read books which are devotional and simple,\nas well=\r\n as those which are deep and difficult.  And let not the\nweight of the writ=\r\ner be a stumbling-block to thee, whether he be\nof little or much learning, =\r\nbut let the love of the pure Truth\ndraw thee to read.  Ask not, who hath sa=\r\nid this or that, but look\nto what he says.\n\n2. Men pass away, but the truth=\r\n of the Lord endureth for ever.\nWithout respect of persons God speaketh to =\r\nus in divers manners.\nOur own curiosity often hindereth us in the reading o=\r\nf holy\nwritings, when we seek to understand and discuss, where we should\npa=\r\nss simply on.  If thou wouldst profit by thy reading, read\nhumbly, simply, =\r\nhonestly, and not desiring to win a character for\nlearning.  Ask freely, an=\r\nd hear in silence the words of holy men;\nnor be displeased at the hard sayi=\r\nngs of older men than thou, for\nthey are not uttered without cause.\n\n\n"}}
