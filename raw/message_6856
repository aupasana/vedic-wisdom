I =\r\nsee no inconsistency between the two statements you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; asked me to recon=\r\ncile:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) Nobody can escape the result of one&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (=\r\n2) Remedies such as homam and japam can prevent the ill-effects of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ka=\r\nrma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What we have to realize is that karma (action) is somethin=\r\ng that keeps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flowing continuously and dynamically. It is not somethin=\r\ng frozen in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time. Yes, karmas done in previous lives, *before* curren=\r\nt birth, are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frozen in the form of one&#39;s horoscope. BUT, one does not=\r\n stop doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmas after birth. One keeps doing karmas and they get a=\r\ndded to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karma pipeline.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One has to experience the res=\r\nults of one&#39;s karmas, but different\n&gt; &gt; karmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may give results after=\r\n different waiting times. Some karmas take a\n&gt; &gt; long\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to give re=\r\nsults and some fructify fast. When big karmas one\n&gt; &gt; commits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after b=\r\nirth are added to this karma pipeline, it may be re-arranged.\n&gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n newer karmas done in this life may give results ahead of older karmas\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some older karmas may be pushed back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When you sow som=\r\ne kind of seeds in a field, it may take a long time\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them to b=\r\necome trees and give fruits (sweet or sour or bitter). When\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\now some other kind of seeds, it may take a short time for them to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bec=\r\nome trees and give fruits (sweet or sour or bitter). Like that,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; diffe=\r\nrent karmas (seeds) need different time to give fruits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If your=\r\n field is filled with bad trees or plants or seeds, it does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; preve=\r\nnt you from sowing new seeds that give desirable fruits. A new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; plant =\r\nmay give good fruits or atleast stop an older bad plant from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; growing.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one blocked an older bad karma from giving its result using=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; remedy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as homam or japam, that act of homam or japam is a=\r\nlso a karma\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pushed out or blocked the older karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is one more thing really. Apart from sowing new =\r\nseeds or\n&gt; &gt; blocking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; old seeds/plants from growing, remedies can als=\r\no make one spiritually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mature and even liberate one. With spiritual m=\r\naturity, one can handle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the stress of bad times better. When I have a=\r\n problem, I can get\n&gt; &gt; worried\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the problem can be blown up, beco=\r\nme weightier in my mind and cause\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more stress. Or I can say, &quot;well, t=\r\nhis too will pass&quot; and move on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though the basic problem itself canno=\r\nt be avoided, I can stop it from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; becoming weightier in my mind and ca=\r\nusing more stress. Most of our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problems cause far more stress than th=\r\ney should, because we waste so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much time and mental energy worrying a=\r\nbout and worrying about what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in our hands, instead of acceptin=\r\ng what is not in our hands and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focusing attention on what is in our h=\r\nands and doing the best we can.\n&gt; &gt; A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clear mind enabled by spiritual=\r\n sadhana can minimize such dispersion\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy and wasting of ti=\r\nme. That way too, spiritual sadhana helps.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally know se=\r\nveral people who do homam everyday now and lead\n&gt; &gt; much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happier live=\r\ns, though the ground situation may have been the same!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Japam an=\r\nd homam can also be used as &quot;placebos&quot; like you said. But they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have t=\r\nhe potential to be far more than that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nDo It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, Jul 9, 2011 at 2:35 AM, Yogesh=\r\n Lajmi wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Mr.Narasimha PVR Rao,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly reconcile=\r\n the following\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinions of our Great Ancient Rishis...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.=\r\n Nothing or nobody,not even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brahma,can alter/modify/change one&#39;s Fate=\r\n/Destiny,once it is written\n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brahma himself soon after one&#39;s Bi=\r\nrth...as per one&#39;s Karma accumulated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; over previous births/existences.=\r\n..(Sanchita Karma,Prarabdha Karma...\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Agami Karmas ) or genera=\r\nlly referred to as Shukla-Krishna Karmas...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Our elders have always ma=\r\nintained that there is NO ESCAPE from\n&gt; &gt; Karma...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.

Kavachas =\r\nof various deities (or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; planets) are protective sheaths covering one&#39;s=\r\n consciousness and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stopping harmful influences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Grahas (l=\r\niteral meaning: those who grasp or get hold of) give good and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bad res=\r\nults by grasping one&#39;s consciousness and affecting it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Each pla=\r\nnet has positives and negatives, in general and also based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the cha=\r\nrt. If one chants the kavacha of a planet many times,\n&gt; &gt; eventually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\na protective sheath is formed around one&#39;s consciousness with the\n&gt; &gt; natur=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and energy of that planet. This will obviously offer protection tha=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consistent with the nature of that planet, in general and in=\r\n one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chart. But, please remember that reading the kavacha of any pl=\r\nanet\n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NOT harm you. Even the kavacha of 8th lord or 6th lord =\r\nwill not harm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one has Pi lagna. If he chants=\r\n Sukra kavacha, Venus will\n&gt; &gt; protect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one from loss of courage (3rd)=\r\n, problems to shoulders (3rd), untimely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; death (i.e. loss of longevity=\r\n/8th), problems in anus/genital area\n&gt; &gt; (8th)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. There may be othe=\r\nr things based on other factors like aspects,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; occupancy etc. Based on=\r\n his inherent nature, Venus may also protect in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the matters of love, =\r\nromance, creativity etc also. Bottomline is that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the aspects of one&#39;s=\r\n personality that the planet is conducive to will\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; protected by=\r\n the planet&#39;s energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you pick a wrong planet, you may not g=\r\net the desired result, but no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; harm is done. Even bad planets in your =\r\nchart will have some aspects\n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; want to protect and doing their=\r\n kavacha will protect those aspects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best will be to chant the =\r\nkavachas of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lord, Moon&#39;s dispositor a=\r\nnd Sun&#39;s dispositor. Even better will be to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chant the kavachas of dev=\r\natas instead of planets. Out of all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kavachas I have seen until no=\r\nw, Narayana kavacha (from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SrimadBhagavatam)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Chandi Kavacha =\r\nare the most potent kavachas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But please note that chanting a k=\r\navacha once or twice or even once or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; twice a day is hardly sufficient=\r\n. If one has enough purity already,\n&gt; &gt; most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras work right away.=\r\n But most of us have very dense conditioning\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the energy of ma=\r\nntras gets dispersed. The energy of the planet/deity\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the kavac=\r\nha we chant cannot form a sheath around us easily. It\n&gt; &gt; requires\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in=\r\ntense sadhana for most people. If one chants a kavacha 10-30 times\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ev=\r\neryday and does it for 40-60 days, then some kind of results can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; e=\r\nxpected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is needed for most people to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n see some results. Getting things done by a professional priest is also\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; not that useful, as there are very very few priests with the required\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; purity, the ability to identify with your problem and the ability to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; transfer the energy. For most people, the best solution is to learn\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chant by themselves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a=\r\n difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyoti=\r\nshWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Thu, Jul 7, 2011 at 11:39 AM, =\r\nmonkeymonkeyking10 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I sincerely =\r\nhope our moderator forgives this question which I also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; posted on the =\r\njyotish forum...I am a bit unclear about Kavacha for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; planets.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, if a planet such as Rahu is giving one to have proble=\r\nms\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during his dasha, would one recite the Kavach of Rahu, OR some oth=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;counter-balancing&quot; planet that was strong in one&#39;s chart?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Raj\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
