The process of sincere inquiry, and the reciprocal\nreceiving =\r\nof real and satisfying answers is a course of action that\ncontinues all thr=\r\noughout one&#39;s spiritual journey. This is one thing\nthat, in fact, makes the=\r\n path of Yoga and Sanatana Dharma very\ndifferent from almost all other spir=\r\nitual traditions: unlike the\nWestern Abrahamic religions, sincere questioni=\r\nng is actually actively\nencouraged in our spiritual tradition.\n\nSanatana Dh=\r\narma is a spiritual world-view that is predicated upon the\nidea that we are=\r\n all free and unique beings. We are respected as\npersons who have the abili=\r\nty to make our own choices in life, and who\ndeserve to have our choices hon=\r\nored. As free beings, it is incumbent\nupon us to progress spiritually by th=\r\ne strength of our own sincerity,\ndedication, and free inquiry. The traditio=\r\nn of Dharma, from this\nperspective, can almost be called the religion of qu=\r\nestioning and\nfree inquiry.\n\nThroughout the Dharmic scriptures (the Vedic l=\r\niterature), we see\nagain and again thousands of examples of free and open d=\r\nialogs that\ntake place between students and teachers in an attempt to under=\r\nstand\nthe truth of a particular question or philosophical problem. Whether\n=\r\nin the Upanishads, Puranas, Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, or any of the\nother=\r\n scriptures of Sanatana Dharma, we repeatedly read about various\nphilosophi=\r\ncal discussions that take place between either a guru and\ndisciple, or a ki=\r\nng and a guru, or a god and a human, etc., etc.\nIndeed, only in Sanatana Dh=\r\narma is there even a scripture known as\nthe Prashna Upanishad, or the &quot;Upan=\r\nishad of Questioning&quot;. The most\nimportant of Dharmic scriptures, the Bhagav=\r\nad Gita, is itself an open\nphilosophical dialog between a princely warrior =\r\nand God Himself.\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, we have God Himself engaging in fre=\r\ne and open\ndialog with His student Arjuna, in the attempt to bring Arjuna t=\r\no a\ndeeper understanding of the truth of his own self-identity, and his\nrel=\r\nationship with God. This vision of God as the Supreme Person who\nis compass=\r\nionate, loving, and secure in His own being enough to have\na down-to-earth =\r\nconversation with His devotee is in stark contrast to\nhow the Abrahamic (Ju=\r\ndeo-Christian-Islamic) god is depicted in the\nBiblical and Koranic texts, a=\r\ns an unapproachable being who only\nengaging in a one-way dialog with his fo=\r\nllowers. The encouraging of\nsincere and open questioning is found throughou=\r\nt our spiritual\ntradition like with no other religious tradition on earth.\n=\r\n\nIt is understood in Santana Dharma that the process of questioning is\nin i=\r\ntself an art. The important thing to understand about the\nprocess of philos=\r\nophical questioning is that the questioning itself\nhas to follow the proper=\r\n methodology if one is to receive real and\ntruly authentic answers. Questio=\r\nning is itself an art and a\nspiritual discipline. Above all, it is the moti=\r\nvational attitude,\neven more so than the cognitive abilities of the questio=\r\nner, that is\nof operative importance. In other words, the important factor =\r\nin\nquestioning is not how smart the questioner thinks he is, but why the\npe=\r\nrson is asking the questions in the first place. A philosophical\nquestion n=\r\needs to be presented in a way that is sincere, humble,\nopen, and direct. An=\r\nything less than this attitude will not lead to\nreal answers. Even a questi=\r\non as seemingly benign as &quot;What is God?&quot;,\nfor example, can be asked in such=\r\n a manner as to receive a real\nanswer, or it can be asked in a manner that =\r\nis arrogant and\ndemanding. Only the former, asking with humility and openne=\r\nss, will\nlead the questioner to Truth. Asking with arrogance will only lead=\r\n\nto further ignorance.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita provides us with a very clear des=\r\ncription of the\nscience of asking:\n\n\n&quot;Attempt to learn that truth by approa=\r\nching a spiritual teacher.\nInquire submissively from him and render service=\r\n to him. The self-\nrealized sages will initiate you into true knowledge for=\r\n they have\nthemselves seen the truth.&quot;\n\n(Bhagavad Gita, 4:34)\n\n\nIt is only =\r\nin approaching the search for truth with such an attitude\nof openness, humi=\r\nlity, patience, and sincerity that the truth will be\nrevealed to you.\n\nIn t=\r\nhe same way that we can approach an embodied guru or sage with\nsincere inqu=\r\niries, we can also engage in such a student/teacher\nrelationship with God H=\r\nimself as the antaryamin, or the inner witness\nwithin our hearts. While it =\r\nis imperative that we have a living,\nembodied guru to whom we can approach =\r\nand receive Divine knowledge,\nGod is ultimately the source of all Truth, an=\r\nd the eternal Guru.\nThus, through the process of meditation, we can both co=\r\nnfirm the\nrealizations that we receive from the embodied guru, as well as\ne=\r\nngage in a direct reciprocal relationship with God in which we can\nclarify =\r\ninner doubts, receive answers to further queries, and deepen\nour understand=\r\ning of both ourselves and the nature of reality.\n\nThere are always two peop=\r\nle involved in spiritual inquiry: the\nstudent (shishya) and the teacher (gu=\r\nru). Likewise, the general\nprocess of inquiry consists of a two way process=\r\n. It requires not\nonly the asking of questions on the part of the student, =\r\nbut also the\nability to receive and accept answers from the teacher. These =\r\ntwo\nsteps are necessary whether the teacher is an embodied guru, or God\nHim=\r\nself. When we are inquiring directly from God, these two steps\nare found in=\r\n the form of 1) prayer and 2) meditation.\n\nThrough prayer, we are communica=\r\nting our concerns to God, and through\nmeditation, we are allowing God to re=\r\nveal Himself to us. Thus, the\ncommunication is a two way street, and not a =\r\none way monologue. One\nof the problems that we often find with the Abrahami=\r\nc religions of\nJudaism, Christianity, and Islam is that these religious con=\r\nstructs\ntend to lay a great emphasis on prayer alone, or speaking to their\n=\r\ngod and petitioning him, without any understanding of the reciprocal\nneed o=\r\nf stilling the mind in meditation and allowing their specific\ndivinity to t=\r\nhen reveal himself to them. Prayer, for the Abrahamic\nfaiths is a one way f=\r\norm of communication alone.\n\nToo many of us want to speak to God, ask Him q=\r\nuestions, ask for\nfavors and gifts, but so few of us are ready to then sit =\r\nin the\nsilence of meditation and allow God to respond to our queries. Would=\r\n\nit not at the very least be considered rude if someone were contantly\nspea=\r\nking at you, asking your questions, petitioning you for favors,\nbut never a=\r\nllowing you an opportunity to actually respond? This is\nwhat we are doing t=\r\no God when we only pray, but never open ourselves\nin meditation for His res=\r\nponse to us. In Sanatana Dharma, it is\nunderstood that &quot;listening&quot; to God i=\r\nn meditation is often of much\ngreater importance than talking to God, since=\r\n it is in humbly and\nopenly listening that we learn and grow. Both, speakin=\r\ng and\nlistening to God, however, must be present if we are to fully\nexperie=\r\nnce what it means to commune with the Absolute.\n\nIt is in devotional medita=\r\ntion that we are in the most intimate\ncommunion with God. God, being purely=\r\n spiritual in nature, the only\nway to truly communicate with, experience, a=\r\nnd thus truly know God is\nin the pure realm of consciousness. In meditation=\r\n, the pure atman\nthat is our true self is in closest proximity with God. An=\r\nd the\ndeeper and more advanced the meditator is, in direct proportion is\nsh=\r\ne able to experience and understand the eternal Truth free of egoic\nmediati=\r\non. It is when there is no medium left separating the\nmeditator from the ob=\r\nject of meditation (God) that we can then\nexperience pure and eternal knowl=\r\nedge being revealed to us directly\nfrom the mercy of God Himself. At this p=\r\noint of pure meditative\nabsorption upon the Absolute, nothing remains unkno=\r\nwn to us. This,\nof course, is the ultimate goal (artha) of meditation, and =\r\ntakes\nyears of dedicated practice, sincerity, focused determination, and\ngr=\r\neat devotion to attain.\n\nAs for the question of getting immediate answers t=\r\no ones questions\nthrough meditation, the answers that one gets will be in d=\r\nirect\nproportion to one&#39;s spiritual advancement and God&#39;s grace. The path\no=\r\nf Sanatana Dharma offers us the greatest, most systematic, and most\neffecti=\r\nve vehicle for making spiritual advancement and for\nexperiencing the infini=\r\nte grace of the Divine.\n\n\nThe Author:\n\nDr. Frank Morales, Ph.D. (Sri Dharma=\r\n Pravartaka Acharya) is an\nAmerican who has been practicing Sanatana Dharma=\r\n for over 30 years.\nHe has a Ph.D. in Religious Studies and is recognized b=\r\ny the global\nHindu community as one of the leading Hindu Acharyas (Spiritua=\r\nl\nPreceptors) in the nation.
