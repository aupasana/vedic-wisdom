Human brain has \n&gt; millions of neurons a=\r\nnd a lot of complicated cells that work in harmony. \n&gt; When there are probl=\r\nems, it can result in strange behaviors. These \n&gt; behaviors are not easy to=\r\n change just by analyzing them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, homam is a powerful practice and =\r\ncan help. Also, think of god as a \n&gt; loving father (or mother) instead of a=\r\n strict disciplinarian. Tell \n&gt; yourself that god is NOT in a temple and he=\r\n is in a peaceful heart. \n&gt; Whatever good happens, thank god for being your=\r\n own heart and guiding \n&gt; your life. Get rid of the notion of visiting a te=\r\nmple from your mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apart from all these things, see a good homeopath=\r\ny or ayurveda doctor. \n&gt; Allopathy is bad at curing ailments like this. The=\r\ny like to keep one on \n&gt; medicines for ever and milk money. Future breakthr=\r\noughs in neurosciences \n&gt; may enable better medicines in allopathy, but the=\r\n best medicines right \n&gt; now are in ayurveda and homepathy. There are herbs=\r\n like Shankhapushpi, \n&gt; Brahmi, Jatamamsi, Aswagandha etc that calm vaata a=\r\nnd pitta in the \n&gt; nerves and cure such ailments. See a good ayurvedic doct=\r\nor for \n&gt; improvement. With some medical help to address the physiological =\r\nside \n&gt; and some mental reprogramming, one CAN overcome issues like this.

But =\r\nI want to tell you that I hate \n&gt; God because one part of my brain always t=\r\nells me from behind to go to a \n&gt; certain temple on accomplishing some task=\r\n.And then I counter that \n&gt; thought saying that I will not go to temple eve=\r\nn if my work gets done. \n&gt; This way whole of my energy is exhausted in gett=\r\ning these obsessive \n&gt; thoughts and countering them. I hate god because he =\r\nforces me to do so.I \n&gt; was a very religious girl even since by childhood.\n=\r\n&gt; But now I cant see him.\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; AS\n&gt; -wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;javas=\r\ncript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&#39;)&gt; \n&gt; , visw=\r\na raghava &lt;raghavaviswanathkrishna@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I did not understand yo=\r\nur problem. Is that your problem with going to \n&gt; &gt; temple or hating the go=\r\nd. It doesn&#39;t mean you love god if you go to \n&gt; &gt; temple or you hate him if=\r\n you don&#39;t.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; There are types of Bhakthis or prayers humans offer t=\r\no god. Yours is \n&gt; &gt; the most beautiful kind of prayer. praying the god out=\r\n of fear and \n&gt; &gt; hatred.\n&gt; &gt; There are people who did the same, say for ex=\r\nample Ravana, \n&gt; &gt; Hiranyakasyapa. Marrecha from Ramayana has also same kin=\r\nd of problem. \n&gt; &gt; Interesting part is GOD didn&#39;t do any thing to them unti=\r\nl they crossed \n&gt; &gt; their limits.\n&gt; &gt; They all hate the god. Just believe i=\r\nn one thing, when it comes to \n&gt; &gt; god. What ever you feel about GOD. it do=\r\nesn&#39;t change how god sees you.\n&gt; &gt; If you can not see you in the form he is=\r\n in temples, See him in the \n&gt; &gt; form you like. For example, if you like pa=\r\nrents start praying to them \n&gt; &gt; daily imagining them as God you want to pr=\r\nay.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If I have to go in details, If you want to pray to Siva today=\r\n, Start \n&gt; &gt; seeing you father as Shiva and start seeing you mother as parv=\r\nathi.=C2=A0 I \n&gt; &gt; do the same, I pray Lord Lakshmi Devi who looks exactly =\r\nlike mother.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; you dont have to feel wrong for hating god. The more=\r\n you hate the god \n&gt; &gt; the more you become close to god. you dont believe m=\r\ne. There are three \n&gt; &gt; stories in puranas which say that Lord Vishnu menti=\r\nons the same fact.\n&gt; &gt; I apologies if I have mentioned any thing wrong and =\r\nhope this helps \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; Thanks Viswanath\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
