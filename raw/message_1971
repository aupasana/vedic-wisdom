However, sometimes the only thing we can d=\r\no to inspire practice is to discuss theory and try to put things in the rig=\r\nht perspective. It may inspire someone to do sadhana.\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \nThe ten mahavidyas are considered by many people to be &quot;taantrika&quot; godde=\r\nsses. Some people also think that you *have to* do specific sadhanas to get=\r\n knowledge from them or experience them.\n \nMahavidyas, as the name implies,=\r\n are essentially personification of supreme liberating knowledge of ten kin=\r\nds. The names, imagery, various symbols and procedures employed in various =\r\ntaantrika sadhanas are *metaphors* for *esoteric truths*. One engages in th=\r\ne practices that are designed to make one *realize* certain esoteric truths=\r\n in the long run. However, dealing with those symbols and engaging in the p=\r\nractices is neither necessary nor sufficient for realizing the esoteric tru=\r\nths and for getting the essential knowledge.\n \nIf a deity wants to bless on=\r\ne, the deity can just come to one in several forms. One may see the deity a=\r\ns a person externally. One may see the deity internally as a person, fillin=\r\ng one&#39;s existence. One may experience the deity in all pervading light or s=\r\nound forms also. Also, one may see a deity in different forms at different =\r\ntimes.\n \nOne example of an experience of a mahavidya is narrated in the art=\r\nicle below, from the archives of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. After the experie=\r\nnce, that person&#39;s knowledge expanded and his thinking changed completely.\n=\r\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n \n*        *      =\r\n  *\n \nSometimes a deity may not come to one in a tangible form, either exte=\r\nrnally or internally, but just come to one as internal knowledge. In other =\r\nwords, one may not see the deity or experience her as a person or as light =\r\nor as sound and yet she may enter one as knowledge. Slowly, this may bloom =\r\nand result in a maturing of thinking and a supreme kind of knowledge and se=\r\nlf-realization.\n \nIn fact, I will go on to say that every self-realized per=\r\nson from every religion until today has been blessed by one mahavidya, whet=\r\nher or not he or she realizes it or not and thinks in those terms or not.\n =\r\n\n*        *        *\n \nIf you look at Buddha&#39;s works, it is clear he was bl=\r\nessed by Maatangi and filled with the realization personified by Maatangi, =\r\nthough I do not believe he did any Maatangi sadhana formally.\n \nOf course, =\r\naccording to Munda Maalaa Tantra list, Maatangi is equated to Buddha. Also,=\r\n Matangi khanda of Rudrayamala says that Matangi and Buddha are essentially=\r\n the same.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWe talked about Chhinnamasta, the deity =\r\nstanding near a copulating couple and holding her own severed hand. While s=\r\nome people associate her with Rahu, I associated her with Venus as Munda Ma=\r\nala Tantra equates her to Parasu Rama (who is Venus according to Parasara).=\r\n\n \nParasu Rama&#39;s mother Renuka saw a gandharva called Chitraratha and an ap=\r\nsara (celestial couple) having a lustful union in the forest and she had a =\r\ndesire to enjoy in the same manner with her husband. She lost her brillianc=\r\ne due to this thought and Jamadagni ordered his eldest son to kill her. Whe=\r\nn the first four sons refused, the fifth son Parasu Rama agreed to kill his=\r\n mother and the boon he got from his father as a result was that Renuka wou=\r\nld be alive again and be perfectly pure.\n \nRenuka means the pollen and coul=\r\nd also mean seminal fluid at the gross level and self-awareness (Kundalini)=\r\n at a subtle level. Chitraratha means various strange desires. Chitraratha&#39;=\r\ns lustful activities in the forest are metaphors for various desires that s=\r\npring in the forest of one&#39;s mind. Desires and lust in one&#39;s mind stop one =\r\nfrom mastery over Self. They make one&#39;s shakti impure. The five sons could =\r\nshow the five chakras from moolaadhaara to visuddhi. As shakti rises, still=\r\n one is susceptible to desires. When the shakti comes up to visuddhi chakra=\r\n, one&#39;s self-awareness is cut off from earth, water, fire and air elements =\r\nand one attains self-mastery and freedom from various forms of lust. Then o=\r\nne&#39;s self-awareness has a new birth in a purified form.\n \nIf you understand=\r\n this story at an esoteric level, you understand what knowledge Chhinnamast=\r\na represents. Just as the story of Parasurama and Renuka esoterically symbo=\r\nlizes reaching a pure state of consciousness where desires and lust do not =\r\ntrouble one anymore, Chhinnamasta makes one a yogi with perfect self-contro=\r\nl, who is unaffected by sensory inputs and untouched by thoughts of lust.\n =\r\n\nAlso, she is the mahavidya who cuts off her head to feed her associates (a=\r\nnd herself) with the blood and then re-attaches the head. Please note that =\r\nVenus is the one associated with mrita sanjivani vidya.\n \n*        *       =\r\n *\n \n&gt; Indeed Bagalamukhi is unmistakably Mars. Sadhakas will know that.\n \n=\r\nBagalamukhi&#39;s consort Maharudra is shown by Mars. Thus, is not surprising i=\r\nf sadhakas of Bagalamukhi experiece a Martian influence.\n \nSimilarly, Kaali=\r\n&#39;s consort is Mahaakaala shown by Saturn and Taara&#39;s consort is Akshobhya s=\r\nhown by Jupiter. Again, some influence of Saturn and Jupiter may be felt by=\r\n their sadhakas.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Different Avatar-Mahavidya co-re=\r\nlations are given in the\n&gt; Guhyatiguhya Tantra, the Todala tantra, the Mund=\r\namala\n&gt; Tantra and some other articles as well. .. another list\n&gt; given by =\r\nSwami Sadhananda Shastri of Varanasi ..\n \nGuhyatiguhya tantra and Todala ta=\r\nntra lists do not stick to 10 mahavidyas and 10 Vishnu avataras. Sri Shastr=\r\ni&#39;s list also does not stick to 10 avataras of Vishnu and includes various =\r\nother gods. Only Munda Mala tantra list gives the exact lists of 10 maha vi=\r\ndyas and 10 avataras of Vishnu. Moreover, it explains the essence of each m=\r\nahavidya very well. That is why I accept Munda Maalaa Tantra list.\n \n*     =\r\n   *        *\n \nOne may read about how deities are difficult to reach and h=\r\now austere sadhanas are to be done by others for many years.\n \nThe final go=\r\nal of all spiritual sadhana is internal transformation and self-realization=\r\n. Various sadhanas and austerities were designed to slowly bring that trans=\r\nformation. One may do austere sadhana for 50 years and yet not achieve. One=\r\n may achieve in a single day like Sarvananda or Kalidasa did. We don&#39;t know=\r\n who is capable of what. More importantly, it is Her grace at the end.\n \nIf=\r\n you have an inclination to do sadhana, do the sadhana you are capable of, =\r\nwithout worrying about success or failure or without being daunted by what =\r\nyou hear from others. Do your chosen external practices, but do augment the=\r\nm with constant comtemplation and conscious self-criticism of your motives =\r\nin your actions. Put in a conscious effort to detect ego when it starts to =\r\ncontrol your actions and cut it down. When constant contemplation and consc=\r\nious self-correction aids, external practices work faster.\n \nMany capable s=\r\nadhakas fall in the trap of pride, possessiveness or entitlement when they =\r\nmake some progress (&quot;I am good and I got this&quot;, &quot;I did good sadhana and so =\r\nI got this&quot;, &quot;I deserve this&quot; etc) and get stuck there. Remembering the nee=\r\nd to keep a tab on ego is very important, in addition to the external pract=\r\nices.\n \nAgain, one should remember as one engages in spiritual sadhana that=\r\n the final goal is an internal transformation to remove identification with=\r\n one&#39;s actions and remove ego from one&#39;s thinking.\n \n*        *        *\n \n=\r\nI finally think that all the points I wanted to make on this topic have bee=\r\nn made. I sign off from this topic and I will wait for the next inspiration=\r\n.
