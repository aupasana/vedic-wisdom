What is the exact meaning of Trikaagni-kaala?\n \nTrika = three types of\nAgni = fire\nKaala = regulator, time-keeper, one who ends\n \nThe previous word in the verse is &quot;tripuraantakaaya&quot;. Tripuraantaka means one who ends the three puras. Pura means a town or a castle. The three castles/towns referred to are basically the three bodies (or sheaths) that house each person. The sthoola sareera (gross body), sookshma sareera (subtle body) and kaarana sareera (causal body) are the three bodies/castles/towns hosting each being.\n \nThe gross body is what we see - made of gross matter and consisting of flesh, blood, nerves etc. The subtle body cannot be seen with eyes and it contains thousands of nadis (subtle channels of energy flow) and several chakras (various planes of existence in which one keeps going like in a wheel). The causal body is made of causal matter and is a repository of all the karmas (actions) the being is carrying, which are yet to be canceled by equal and opposite reactions. This body is the root cause of one&#39;s existence as a being separate from Supreme Soul.\n \nTripuraantaka means one who brings the end of these three bodies. In a lower level form, Rudra brings the end of the physical body, but in the highest form, he actually brings the end of Kaarana sareera too, i.e. grants moksha! However, it must be emphasized that most people sugffer from &quot;obesity&quot; when it comes to causal body.\n \nNow, there is a basic fire that burns in each of these bodies, illuminating them and sustaining them. In the gross body, we have the jatharaagni and several other agnis (physical tranformative forces) as described in ayurveda. Similarly, there is a fire burning in the other bodies too. Without that fire, these bodies cannot live. Rudra is the regulator and time-keeper of those three fires. When the time&#39;s up, he extinguishes each of those three types of fire. Until then, he keeps the fires going and regulates them. That is what trikaagnikaala means.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Soul Sadhak&quot; &lt;soulsadhak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx for the response, Anand.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.
