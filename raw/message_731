But, if \nit =\r\n\n&gt; does, don&#39;t worry. Re-ignite it as Narayan said, pray to Agni in \nthe \n&gt;=\r\n mind and continue.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Suppose a servant is asked by his master to c=\r\narry a vessel of \nmilk \n&gt; to a place without spilling it on the way. Suppos=\r\ne a little milk \nis \n&gt; spilled on the way. What should he do? Should he aba=\r\nndon the \nproject \n&gt; or atleast carry the remaining milk to the destination=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; As Narayan said, fire going away =\r\ncan signal the bhutagni being \nweak.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; But, one is better off ignor=\r\ning those things and not thinking \ntoo \n&gt; much about the significance.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I recommend doing homam without worryin=\r\ng about how well or badly \nit \n&gt; went and what results it brought. Let me g=\r\nive an analogy.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yo=\r\nurself as a \n&gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all =\r\nthe \n&gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to serve \nyour=\r\n \n&gt; master.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big=\r\n checks \n&gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail other=\r\ns. \n&gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank \nan=\r\nd \n&gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in \nthis \n=\r\n&gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in \nthis \n&gt;=\r\n world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; various =\r\nrishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. The \n&gt; supreme god of =\r\nthis world operates through various physical \npersons \n&gt; present on earth.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and \ntr=\r\ny \n&gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant \ncarries=\r\n \n&gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Doing w=\r\nhat is applauded by others as good work tends to promote \nego \n&gt; and we nee=\r\nd to guard against it. A servant carrying a million \ndollar \n&gt; check to the=\r\n bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; carrying a $100 check =\r\nto the bank and cashing it. Both are merely \n&gt; doing their master&#39;s work an=\r\nd do not own anything. Both are just \n&gt; *instruments* used by the master to=\r\n carry out his agenda. \nSimilarly, \n&gt; one who does what are considered grea=\r\nt deeds in this world and one \n&gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds =\r\nin this world are both \n&gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda =\r\nin this world. \n&gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself su=\r\nperior to \n&gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by the=\r\n \nworld, \n&gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers \n&gt; him=\r\nself/herself superior to another servant carrying something \nless \n&gt; valuab=\r\nle.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates \n=\r\none&#39;s \n&gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; si=\r\ntuations his previous karmas place one in. One can remain happy \nand \n&gt; bli=\r\nssful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in \nlight \n&gt; and da=\r\nrkness.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. I=\r\nt is a \njob \n&gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own =\r\n\nnothing. \n&gt; You are doing it for god.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimh=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n-\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons =\r\n(MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Window=\r\ns): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\nhttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   Fr=\r\nom: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Thu=\r\nrsday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regardi=\r\nng Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         R=\r\neading your response another question came into my \nmind. \n&gt; You said:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;          It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; midd=\r\nle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Is it not good that the fire gets extinguis=\r\nhed by rain, \nor \n&gt; the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;         I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa \n&gt; regular=\r\nly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets \n&gt; extinguished while th=\r\ne homa is still on..happened with me couple \nof \n&gt; times... i seriously don=\r\nt knbow what to make of it but as one \nmember \n&gt; in this list had suggested=\r\n to me,  i relight the fire and keep \n&gt; continuing with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n        -Regards\n&gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;          \n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n     The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n         --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n      From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;           Subject: Re: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Regarding Maha Ganapati \nHomam\n&gt; &gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com\n&gt; &gt;           Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;          =\r\n Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Namaste =\r\nPhani,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a h=\r\nouse\n(3-\n&gt; floors) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; kundam made by arranging r=\r\ned bricks, with sand base \nbe \n&gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; copper o=\r\nne?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the ope=\r\nn \nis \n&gt; actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a =\r\n\n&gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the \nfire \n&gt;=\r\n if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is \n&gt; exting=\r\nuished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Yes, you can co=\r\nnstruct a homa kundam with bricks and \nsand \n&gt; at the bottom. Use a square =\r\nshaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using =\r\nthe mp3 audio \nfile, \n&gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; mantras menta=\r\nlly along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           One can repeat mentally while =\r\nlistening attentively \n(not \n&gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantr=\r\nas with all the \nattention \n&gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;           Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of \n&gt; so=\r\nme mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to \nit \n&gt; with=\r\n focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the \nmantra \n&gt; may do=\r\n nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the \n&gt; mantra. The =\r\nword mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One \ncan \n&gt; say a mantra o=\r\nr listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \n&gt; control over the mind =\r\nand keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           However, the=\r\nre is a difference between meditation and \n&gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in =\r\nthe internal fire in meditation and \nit \n&gt; is submitted in the external fir=\r\ne as well in a homam. So making \nsome \n&gt; external sound (even if feeble) is=\r\n a good idea as opposed to \nsilent \n&gt; chanting or just listening. Try to re=\r\npeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? A=\r\nny Other \n&gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; should be followed apar=\r\nt from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Yes. Anybody whose upanay=\r\nanam (sacred thread ceremony) \n&gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or =\r\nmarried is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           One should follow the yamas and n=\r\niyamas set by one&#39;s \n&gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should fol=\r\nlow them \n&gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food o=\r\nn \nthe \n&gt; day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt;=\r\n recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n           By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; homam =\r\nfor spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility \nand \n&gt; allow t=\r\nhem to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as \nguru \n&gt; and perf=\r\norm homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in \nthe \n&gt; process un=\r\ntil the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity \n&gt; through homam a=\r\nnd other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no \n&gt; sacred thread, mantrop=\r\nadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter \n&gt; after a while, when the per=\r\nson crosses a threshhold of purity. The \n&gt; goal of upanayanam and other man=\r\ntropadesa by guru is to speed this \nup \n&gt; and make the person cross the thr=\r\neshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           As long as one desires no specific ma=\r\nterial benefits \n(and \n&gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homa=\r\nm for spiritual \n&gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some su=\r\nffering \nfor \n&gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam=\r\n? or any day would \nbe \n&gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           For Mahaganapathi homam,=\r\n the best is a Chaturthi \nmorning. \n&gt; But any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n          * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Mentioning rain and rooftop homam remind=\r\ned me of my \nIndia \n&gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           When I went to India in May =\r\n2008, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; traveled together to several places (on a spe=\r\ncific project). We \nended \n&gt; up doing homam in the morning in several place=\r\ns (wherever we \nwere). \n&gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbr=\r\nella with me. As \n&gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not tak=\r\ne it \n&gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n&gt;=\r\n rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish \n&gt; told=\r\n me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city \nafter \n&gt; our hom=\r\nam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           To my surprise, it did rain=\r\n as soon as our homas \n&gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenl=\r\ny started \nraining \n&gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small tow=\r\nel/blanket on \n&gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of th=\r\ne two \nsmall \n&gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the clo=\r\nth \ncover \n&gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off =\r\nand \n&gt; then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra \nlater=\r\n \n&gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few \ndays =\r\n\n&gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered \n&gt; th=\r\ne north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we \nwent \n&gt; to, a=\r\ns we finished our task in that place and prepared to move on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n      Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;           Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;           ------------ ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --\n---\n&gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt;           Do a Shor=\r\nt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt;           D=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n&gt; wisdom\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. \n&gt; home..comcast=\r\n. net\n&gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt;=\r\n rologer.org\n&gt; &gt;           Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: \nhttp://www.=\r\nSriJagan \n&gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt;           ------------ --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --\n---\n&gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;it=\r\nsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; \nwrote: \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, \nand \n=\r\n&gt; have few questions\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n       &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house\n(3-\n&gt; floors) =\r\n?
