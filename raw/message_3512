Then possibly give a break for a few days and do fo=\r\nr another 100 days. Like that, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of=\r\n course, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping =\r\nbrahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult for some people and hence the su=\r\nggestion of the break.\n&gt; \n&gt; For success in any sadhana, brahmacharya is ver=\r\ny important. Restraint from sex and control of anger and short-temper will =\r\nhelp one avoid leakage of shakti (purifying energy). Everytime one experien=\r\nces lust, anger etc, one loses some shakti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every factor contributes a=\r\n little to success. Beard is useful. The tradition of growing beard exists =\r\nin many religions and it is not without a reason. We discussed this sometim=\r\ne back.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one is living a lifestyle where one avoids contact with any=\r\n tempting situations altogether (e.g. living in a remote monastery), beard =\r\nmay or may not add much value. But, if one is living a lifestyle where one =\r\ncomes in contact with tempting situations regularly (e.g. living in the mod=\r\nern world with a family and job and a TV), beard can be very useful. As I s=\r\naid earlier when we discussed this, beard is not the complete solution but =\r\na small part of the solution. Just as a railing on the side of a hill road =\r\nmay stop a slowly moving car from sliding off the hill at night but be unab=\r\nle to stop a fast moving car out of control, similarly a beard can help a p=\r\nerson with decent control over the mind to retain control in some tricky si=\r\ntuations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Trimming beard is ok.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; If one inde=\r\ned does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) everyday f=\r\nor one year while maintaining brahmacharya, \n&gt; while following the simple r=\r\nules of same place, same time everyday and facing the same direction, one w=\r\nill certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sitting=\r\n still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the other =\r\nthing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost zero if the body is=\r\n not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is a chance that mind=\r\n will also become still for a moment. If the mind is still for even a momen=\r\nt, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to being still, it wil=\r\nl become still more often and for longer times. Then various kinds of samad=\r\nhis become possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manua=\r\nls for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a diff=\r\nerence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota =\r\n&lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Repost:Manishji&#39;s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure\n&gt; To: ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 8:40 PM\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;   =\r\n    This is a great mail and very inspiring.

So, should we do 3000 =\r\ntimes japam in a day for 100 days or do 1000 times every day for=C2=A0300 d=\r\nays? He also says &#39;Grow a beard&#39;.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again exp=\r\nerience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is=\r\n done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that t=\r\nhe deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself=\r\n as that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the=\r\n sadhak or the deity commanding a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what=\r\n appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deit=\r\ny&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; devatas make the person care almo=\r\nst for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the p=\r\nerson&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82=\r\n very little=C3=82 according to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a =\r\nuse of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as Pr=\r\nachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be=\r\n that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of =\r\nthe body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or=\r\niginally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma ont=\r\no the heads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this to thei=\r\nr detriment(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Pata=\r\nn with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equ=\r\nate this with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bi=\r\nt like you attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this =\r\nfrom that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. Bu=\r\nt if you attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has=\r\n very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because =\r\nyour attack is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God =\r\nor the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a=\r\n small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can b=\r\ne used, moreover=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be fr=\r\nee of identification with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those whi=\r\nch are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the=\r\n same spirits\n&gt;  which they have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not =\r\nan enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika =\r\nfor a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to th=\r\nat deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a man=\r\ntra(because of his previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody=\r\n doing this mantra only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things =\r\nwhich bind every mantra are crucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifet=\r\nime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so le=\r\nt me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then start=\r\ning on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 ca=\r\nll this the=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day,=\r\n main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same\n&gt;  place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sam=\r\ne materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restr=\r\naint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce fo=\r\nod intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure=\r\n your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 =\r\ndays and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your =\r\npersonality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is t=\r\nhat life may be short, so do some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadh=\r\nana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifie=\r\ns some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind =\r\nLove and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a\n&gt;  c=\r\nlarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The INTERNET now has a personality.
