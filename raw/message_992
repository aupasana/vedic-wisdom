Shriram Sharma Acharya=\r\n\nDear ALL,\n\nThere are several methods of conditioning the mind for the Nada=\r\n\nYoga Sadhanas (of the Shabda tanmatra). One such method, experimented at\nS=\r\nhantikunj, Hardwar is so simple that anybody can easily adopt it. In the\nre=\r\ngular training programmes of spiritual refinement organized at Shantikunj,\n=\r\nHardwar, the trainees are given exposure to the Nada Yoga every evening fro=\r\nm\n6 p.m to 6:15 p.m. During this practice, the students are supposed to sit=\r\n in\nsukhasana in a calm and and cheerful mood. A special kind of music\n(res=\r\nembling a superb combination of Krish=CC=F1a&#39;s flute, Shiva&#39;s damaru and\nSa=\r\nraswati&#39;s Vi=F1a or Sitara) is played in this time-period. The divine music=\r\n\nflows across the serene atmosphere of the ashram. The sadhakas (students)\n=\r\nare given instructions to let their minds get immersed in the divine music\n=\r\nthrough deep mental and emotional absorption. As the snakes are attracted b=\r\ny\nthe typical sound of a lyre (bina) and begin to dance in the tune of its\n=\r\nmusic, similarly, during the above practice, the sadhakas&#39; thoughts and\nemo=\r\ntions begin to flow with the melodious currents of the special musical\nmani=\r\nfestation of Nada.\n\nThose endowed with the piety of character and are emoti=\r\nonally soft or have\nstrong control over the mental power of imagination, us=\r\nually get rapid\nsuccess in linking their consciousness with the subtle form=\r\n of Nada. Others,\nwho do not have such qualities, should not feel depressed=\r\n because the\nabove-mentioned practice is based on the principle of the inhe=\r\nrent\nrelationship between divine music and the human consciousness and ther=\r\nefore\nbrings fruits in every case. If they were honestly trying in their\nda=\r\ny-to-day life to inculcate purity and strength of character, they would\nals=\r\no be able to illuminate their mental and emotional levels and train\nthemsel=\r\nves for Nada Yoga by this simple &#39;exercise&#39; of listening to the\nspecial com=\r\nposition of spiritually sonorous music. The sadhanas of Bindu\nYoga also hel=\r\np increase mental concentration.\n\nThe simplest kind of Bindu Yoga Sadhanas =\r\nbegins with trataka - concentration\non the tip of the flame of a lamp or a =\r\ncandle for a few seconds then to\n&#39;visualize&#39; its illumination in the centra=\r\nl part of the forehead (little\nabove the middle of the eyebrows) with close=\r\nd eyes; again open the eyes to\nfocus at the flame&#39;s tip and repeat the same=\r\n cycle several times. In a\nsimilar manner, the ears and the mind together c=\r\nould also be trained to\nlisten to the divine music. The elementary steps of=\r\n Nada Yoga consist of -\nmeditating upon the internal sounds of the body by =\r\nclosing the ears and\nkeeping the other sense organs in a relaxed condition =\r\nunder properly\ncontrolled, silent surroundings. One gradually begins to per=\r\nceive clearly\nthe sound of gaseous flows, heartbeats, the flute-like sound =\r\nof the breath,\nsubtle sound of fluidic flows inside the body, etc. With dee=\r\nper\nconcentration, the lab-Aab sound of heartbeats begins to sound louder l=\r\nike a\nAamaru. Successively one hears the sounds that resemble that of tinkl=\r\ning of\nbells, blow of a conch shell at a long distance, etc.\nThose who find=\r\n it difficult to concentrate upon the internal sounds of the\nbody should ta=\r\nke support of external sound of soothing music. After playing\nmusical instr=\r\numents like sitara or ikatara or flute etc, or, after listening\nto their so=\r\nft, soothing music with the help of a tape recorder for about 10\nto 15 minu=\r\ntes in a quiet room, the sadhaka should close his ears and attempt\nmental p=\r\nerception of the echo of the same musical sound. He should repeat\nthis cycl=\r\ne several times every day for gradually longer durations (not more\nthan an =\r\nhour). He should keep the mind stress-free. Slowly and steadily, the\nmind w=\r\nould get trained to naturally &#39;play or listen&#39; this music internally\nwithou=\r\nt the help of any external devices.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean remains calm because=\r\n of lighter pressure of air and more\nconcentration of salt as compared to t=\r\nhe Atlantic Ocean, where the currents\nof water usually rise very high and a=\r\nre prone to storms. The hard-hearted\npeople are like the Pacific Ocean; the=\r\nir emotions remain dull in spite of\nmental inspirations. The soft and compa=\r\nssionate ones are just the opposite.\nLike the waves in the Atlantic Ocean, =\r\ntheir emotional currents are easily\nactivated and rise high by the force of=\r\n divine inspirations. The emotional\npiety and mental determination together=\r\n lend extraordinary support in the\nsadhanas of different tanmatras.\n\nThe sa=\r\ndhakas who have aggressive mentality or who are emotionally rude,\noften fin=\r\nd it difficult to perform the sadhanas of mastery over the\ntanmatras. The t=\r\nraining with the help of music that is specifically designed\nfor the Nada Y=\r\noga Sadhanas (of the shabdatanmatra), however, works\nwonderfully on such sa=\r\ndhakas too. It is said that the poisonous &#39;snake&#39; of\nthe vicious, agile min=\r\nd also begins to &#39;dance&#39; in the tune of the bina of\nholy  Nada and comes un=\r\nder proper control by musical practices of Nada Yoga.\nThis is because sonor=\r\nous, soft music generates a soothing impact on the\nsentimental core of the =\r\nlistener. The simple exercises associated with the\npractice of Nada Yoga in=\r\ndeed offer peace and stability to the sadhaka&#39;s mind\nand help in enlighteni=\r\nng his intrinsic emotional and mental qualities\nnecessary for higher-level =\r\nsadhanas.\n\nDuring the initial stages of success in this practice, one hears=\r\n varieties\nof sounds ranging from the physiological tremors to those of the=\r\n types of\nthunderbolts to the divine music of a vi=F1a or a sitara inside t=\r\nhe body. By\nfurther training and meditation, the mind begins to identify an=\r\nd remember\nthese sounds. It is at this stage that one can analyze the types=\r\n and\ndurations of the physiological tremors to &#39;know&#39; the condition of the =\r\nbody\nexactly like the doctors do by analyzing the sonic patterns heard with=\r\n the\nhelp of a stethoscope or an echocardiogram.\n\nAt the higher stages of t=\r\nhe sadhanas of Nada Yoga, the specific sounds\nexperienced during meditation=\r\n could be correlated with the state of mind and\nsentiments. At further adva=\r\nnced stages, the subliminal sounds of the etheric\nvibrations are heard from=\r\n within and recognized. A spiritually elevated mind\ncan grasp the divine me=\r\nssages (if any) hidden in such occult sounds. An\naccomplished yogi of the N=\r\nada Yoga can activate the subliminal communication\nlinks of his inner self =\r\nwith the divine energies. Eventually, comes the\nultimate realization of the=\r\n omnipresent, eternal sound of Om.\n\r\n--0016364585cc9ad5b8046133889e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Source : &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.awgp.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgp.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.awgpsouth.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgpsouth.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author : Pt.
