With a\npeaceful mind he lives=\r\n as if without a body. 18.22\n\nHe whose joy is in himself, and who is peacef=\r\nul and pure within has no\ndesire for renunciation or sense of loss in anyth=\r\ning. 18.23\n\nFor the man with a naturally empty mind, doing just as he pleas=\r\nes, there is\nno such thing as pride or false humility, as there is for the =\r\nnaturalman.\n18.24\n\n&quot;This action was done by the body but not by me.&quot; The pu=\r\nre-natured person\nthinking like this,is not acting even when acting. 18.25\n=\r\n\nHe who acts without being able to say why, but is not thereby a fool, he i=\r\ns\none liberated while still alive, happy and blessed. He is happy even in\ns=\r\namsara. 18.26\n\nHe who has had enough of endless considerations and has atta=\r\nined peace, does\nnot think, know, hear, or see. 18.27\n\nHe who is beyond men=\r\ntal stillness and distraction does not desire either\nliberation or its oppo=\r\nsite.

It shines unmoving,\nd=\r\nesireless, and free from doubt. 18.30\n\nHe whose mind does not set out to me=\r\nditate or act, still meditates and acts\nbut without an object. 18.31\n\nA stu=\r\npid man is bewildered when he hears the ultimate truth, while even a\nclever=\r\n man is humbled by it just like the fool. 18.32\n\nThe ignorant make a great =\r\neffort to practise one-pointedness and the\nstopping of thought, while the w=\r\nise see nothing to be done and remain in\nthemselves like those asleep. 18.3=\r\n3\n\nThe stupid man does not attain cessation whether he acts or abandons act=\r\nion,\nwhile the wise man finds peace within simply by knowing the truth. 8.3=\r\n4\n\nPeople cannot come to know themselves by practices -- pure awareness, cl=\r\near,\ncomplete, beyond multiplicity, and faultless though they are. 8.35\n\nTh=\r\ne stupid man does not achieve liberation even through regular practice,\nbut=\r\n the fortunate remains free and actionless simply by understanding. 18.36\n\n=\r\nThe stupid does not attain Godhead because he wants it, while the wise man\n=\r\nenjoys the Supreme Godhead without even wanting it. 18.37\n\nEven when living=\r\n without any support and eager for achievement, the stupid\nare still nouris=\r\nhing samsara, while the wise have cut at the very root of\nits unhappiness. =\r\n18.38\n\nThe stupid man does not find peace because he desires it, while the =\r\nwise man\ndiscriminating the truth is always peaceful minded. 18.39\n\nHow can=\r\n there be self-knowledge for him whose knowledge depends on what he\nsees? T=\r\nhe wise do not see this and that, but see themselves as infinite.\n18.40\n\nHo=\r\nw can there be cessation of thought for the misguided who is striving for\ni=\r\nt. Yet it is there always naturally for the wise man delighting in himself.=\r\n\n18.41\n\nSome think that something exists, and others that nothing does. Rar=\r\ne is the\nman who does not think either, and is thereby free from distractio=\r\nn. 18.42\n\nThose of weak intelligence think of themselves as pure nonduality=\r\n, but\nbecause of their delusion do not really know this, and so remain unfu=\r\nlfilled\nall their lives. 18.43\n\nThe mind of the man seeking liberation can =\r\nfind no resting place within, but\nthe mind of the liberated man is always f=\r\nree from desire by the very fact of\nbeing without a resting place. 18.44\n\nS=\r\neeing the tigers of the senses, the frightened refuge-seekers at once enter=\r\n\nthe cave in search of cessation of thought and one-pointedness. 18.45\n\nSee=\r\ning the desireless lion, the elephants of the senses silently run away,\nor,=\r\n if that is impossible, serve him like courtiers. 18.46\n\nThe man who is fre=\r\ne from doubts and whose mind is free does not bother about\nmeans of liberat=\r\nion. Whether seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, or tasting,\nhe lives at ea=\r\nse. 18.47\n\nHe whose mind is pure and undistracted from just hearing of the =\r\nTruth does\nnot see anything to do or anything to avoid or even a cause for\n=\r\nindifference. 18.48\n\nThe upright person does whatever presents itself to be=\r\n done, good or bad,\nfor his actions are like those of a child. 18.49\n\nBy in=\r\nner freedom one attains happiness, by inner freedom one reaches the\nSupreme=\r\n, by inner freedom one comes to absence of thought, by inner freedom\nto the=\r\n Ultimate State. 18.50\n\nWhen one sees oneself as neither the doer nor the r=\r\neaper of the\nconsequences, then all mind waves come to an end. 18.51\n\nThe s=\r\npontaneous unassuming behaviour of the wise is noteworthy, but not the\ndeli=\r\nberate purposeful stillness of the fool. 18.52\n\nThe wise who are rid of ima=\r\ngination, unbound and with unfettered awareness,\nmay enjoy themselves in th=\r\ne midst of many goods, or alternatively go off to\nmountain caves. 18.53\n\nTh=\r\nere is no attachment in the heart of a wise man whether he sees or pays\nhom=\r\nage to a learned brahmin, a celestial being, a holy place, a woman, a\nking =\r\nor a friend. 18.54\n\nA yogi is not in the least put out even when humiliated=\r\n by the ridicule of\nservants, sons, wives, grandchildren, or other relative=\r\ns. 18.55\n\nEven when pleased he is not pleased, not suffering even when in p=\r\nain. Only\nthose like him can know the wonderful state of such a man. 18.56\n=\r\n\nIt is the feeling that there is something that needs to be achieved which =\r\nis\nsamsara. The wise who are of the form of emptiness, formless, unchanging=\r\n,\nand spotless see nothing of the sort. 18.57\n\nEven when doing nothing the =\r\nfool is agitated by restlessness, while a\nskillful man remains undisturbed =\r\neven when doing what there is to do. 18.58\n\nHappy he stands, happy he sits,=\r\n happy sleeps, and happy he comes and goes.\nHappy he speaks and happy he ea=\r\nts. This is the life of a man at peace. 18.59\n\nHe who of his very nature fe=\r\nels no unhappiness in his daily life like\nworldly people, remains undisturb=\r\ned like a great lake, cleared of\ndefilement. 18.60\n\nEven abstention from ac=\r\ntion has the effect of action in a fool, while even\nthe action of the wise =\r\nman brings the fruits of inaction. 18.61\n\nA fool often shows aversion towar=\r\nds his belongings, but for him whose\nattachment to the body has dropped awa=\r\ny, there is neither attachment nor\naversion. 18.62\n\nThe mind of the fool is=\r\n always caught in thinking or not thinking, but the\nwise man&#39;s is of the na=\r\nture of no thought because he thinks what is\nappropriate. 18.63\n\nFor the se=\r\ner who behaves like a child, without desire in all actions,there\nis no atta=\r\nchment for such a pure one even in the work he does. 18.64\n\nBlessed is he w=\r\nho knows himself and is the same in all states, with a mind\nfree from cravi=\r\nng whether he is seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, or\ntasting. 18.65\n\nThe=\r\nre is no one subject to samsara, no sense of individuality, no goal or\nmean=\r\ns to the goal in the eyes of the wise man who is always free from\nimaginati=\r\non and unchanging like space. 18.66\n\nGlorious is he who has abandoned all g=\r\noals and is the incarnation of the\nsatisfaction, which is his very nature, =\r\nand whose inner focus on the\nUnconditioned is quite spontaneous. 18.67\n\nIn =\r\nbrief, the great-souled man who has come to know the Truth is without\ndesir=\r\ne for either pleasure or liberation, and is always and everywhere free\nfrom=\r\n attachment. 18.68\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =\r\n=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e64aed12f2a85204aa83e1c2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nHe by whom inner distraction is seen may put an end to it, but t=\r\nhe noble one is not distracted.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When =\r\nthere is nothing to achieve what is he to do? 18.17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wise =\r\nman, unlike the worldly man, does not see inner stillness, distraction, or =\r\nfault in himself, even when living like a worldly man. 18.18&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Nothi=\r\nng is done by him who is free from being and non-being, who is contented, d=\r\nesireless, and wise, even if in the world&#39;s eyes he does act. 18.19&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;The wise man who just goes on doing what presents itself for him to do,=\r\n encounters no difficulty in either activity or inactivity. 18.20&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;He who is desireless, self-reliant, indepe=\r\nndent, and free of bonds functions like a dead leaf blown about by the wind=\r\n of causality. 18.21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;There i=\r\ns neither joy nor sorrow for one who has transcended samsara.
