I do not wish to deviate the discussion but int=\r\neresting piece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the clip is owned by daya=\r\nnidhi maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is a carbon copy of =\r\nCommunist ideology) and in today&#39;s speech he used the cover of this occasio=\r\nn to once again lash out at dharma.\n\nThe same Karunanidhi also lashed out a=\r\nt Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was ongoing. Hindu newspaper which =\r\nis praised by normal people as unbiased was writing articles every day with=\r\n so called details of misgivings at the ashram....Sense a pattern ...That i=\r\ns the media war of modern India controlled by vested interests who would lo=\r\nve to see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also stakeholders in this drama are=\r\n the missionary orgs.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.In Nithyananda&#39;s defense he never said he was =\r\ngod . He also never encouraged one to turn away from sex. His advice was ve=\r\nry simple ...when in the physical act keep it physical.As long as fantasies=\r\n are not involved it does not become a addiction. \n\nHe could very well be r=\r\nepaying a rna ...or might be involved in a sexual ritual. \n\nTwo of his guru=\r\ns were an old woman and a female tantrik which he mentions in his youtube v=\r\nideo on divine consciousness and feminity.\n\n\n3.Like Narasimha ji pointed ou=\r\nt , he has a very good way of explaining higher level truths.\n\n\nWhat he did=\r\n or did not do is only his karma alone .This does not take away anything fr=\r\nom his lectures or messages.\n\nand like Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When =\r\nwe are prepared to sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we better be=\r\n prepared when the divine mother tests us.By juding we will incurr a share =\r\nof the karma others committed and also will be judged quite harshly when ou=\r\nr turn comes.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Narasimha aptly worte:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;No matter how much one has read, no matter h=\r\now much one has &gt;understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no ma=\r\ntter how &gt;many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experienc=\r\nes &gt;one had, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most &gt;of=\r\n the time, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can &gt;still fall. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I learnt a very good thing today from Narasimha&#39;s message. What will =\r\nbe our condition if we were tested by The Mother? Period.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; You ha=\r\nve passionately raised some questions in defense and i find nothing wrong i=\r\nn it but One thing i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrassmen=\r\nt such episodes gives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be anyt=\r\nhing wrong, if a Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a gre=\r\nat many followers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches=\r\n the same and does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and t=\r\nalk about Brahmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a g=\r\nross.\n&gt; I whole heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extre=\r\nmely truthful in his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his strug=\r\ngles on sexual matters. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of su=\r\nch a stature in society. He really was a Saadhu.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a big differ=\r\nence between fall of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri=\r\n Sri Ravishankar didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big =\r\nembarrassment for us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Ma=\r\nster, in front of the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It=\r\n is a bigger blow to faiths of general public.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not specific on Sa=\r\ntyananda here because i do not know if it is really true.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the foota=\r\nge is right, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are n=\r\needed to steer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter=\r\n pills so that corruption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimum=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;t=\r\nwisted and \n&gt; \n&gt; You have spoken the truth. The world today is many times m=\r\nore tempting then say even 100 years back. It is better to be a married per=\r\nson (Even for a very elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes back) and over=\r\ncome the pleasure/pains of sexual desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, i would say that i=\r\nts high time for Big names and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start t=\r\naking a leaf out of  Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to the s=\r\nubject of physical and mental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps =\r\nin final Brahmacharya.)\n&gt; \n&gt; It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line\n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ut=\r\npal   \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14=\r\n@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I too believe we should give the =\r\nbenefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda. There are some questions one has to a=\r\nsk here:\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the st=\r\ning operation,=C2=A0is a VERY questionable organization.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 2) =\r\nSecond, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not practising say s=\r\nome sexual ritual?\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 3) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swam=\r\ni, and a reasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; We live =\r\nin such times where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VERY ad=\r\nvanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death. Souls wh=\r\no might have been brahmacharis in all previous births, would=C2=A0probably=\r\n=C2=A0not be able to remain so when born in thid age=C2=A0is a simple fact =\r\nof nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas=\r\n? She wants it that way and so it is that way.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Further, in t=\r\nhis age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and complex that=\r\n untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is one going =\r\nto overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and=\r\n misconceptions about lust and spirituality. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; All said and d=\r\none, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who live=\r\nd - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sa=\r\ndhus and saints?\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swa=\r\nmi Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come=\r\n, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as h=\r\nis/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possib=\r\nle way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doin=\r\ng homas for some years. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and =\r\nYou, there is only me.\n&gt; &gt; Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals =\r\nby spiritual gurus\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday,=\r\n 4 March, 2010, 8:26 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste KK=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the benefi=\r\nt of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as someon=\r\ne said.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *Even if* his expose on video is genuine, i=\r\nt is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web.
