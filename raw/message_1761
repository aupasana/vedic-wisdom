Before sleeping, if one wishes =\r\nto do some japa mentally with a veda mantra wil it be fine?\n&gt; Are there any=\r\n restrictions on the kind of dieties that one should not be performing duri=\r\nng the night time ( i remember Narasimha cautioning earlier from performing=\r\n chandi homam during the night). In general any pre-cautions are to be take=\r\nn if we have to read/do japa with veda mantra during the night time.\n&gt; \n&gt; C=\r\nan i read veda mantras while sleeping on bed? (not in a casual way by any m=\r\neans)\n&gt; \n&gt; I some times put on the some vedic chants during night and while=\r\n listening to them sleep, the chants go on till the morning until i wakes u=\r\np again. Is this is an acceptable way? \n&gt; \n&gt; Kindly give me your thoughts o=\r\nn this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; KK\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
