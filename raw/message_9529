These people\nreally are not bothered about what you might or might not be interested in\n... until it impacts them in some way.\n\nWe have diverse responsibilities to different people, institutions and\nplaces. We have to figure out how to best follow our &#39;svadharma&#39; in each of\nthese interactions. In some cases, we may also have to prioritize between\nour various dharmas.\n\nDoing sadhana like homam should not be a source of pride. It is not an\nactivity that everyone should magically &#39;like&#39;, or &#39;respect&#39;. We are not\n&#39;better&#39; people for having performed homam or other sadhana.\n\nAll of us sleep for many hours a day. If we give up a couple of hours of\nthat sleep, and do our sadhana at that time, does it really impact anyone\nother than us? If we choose to give up the time that we spend doing\nsomething for ourselves, does it really impact anyone other than us?\n\nOften, we make bad choices in the name of sadhana. We keep doing activities\nthat we are attached to, and give up some other activities that we have\nsome amount of aversion to. This really reflects nothing more than our own\nbiases.\n\nSomething like homam necessarily impacts those close to you. You are giving\nup some portion of time that you might spend with them. You are spending a\ncertain amount of money on some materials. Depending on your circumstances,\nthe smoke etc may physically impact others. Every one of us has to figure\nout how to balance our desire to do sadhana with our other dharmic\nresponsibilities.\n\nLike everything else, sadhana also presents an opportunity to inflate our\nego. When we do sadhana in a big way such that it is noticeable to others,\nwe are often trying to show off. We even try and fool ourselves. Real\nsadhana is simple, and hidden away. It is only presented in public when it\nserves some purpose.\n\nThough we are experts at lying to ourselves, our spouses can often see\nright through us.\n\nsasneham,\n\n    ajit\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 30, 2013 at 8:43 AM, Durgesh Mishra &lt;durgesh.mishra@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are interested in spiritual sadhana, dhyaan, homam, fasting etc and\n&gt; your spouse doesn&#39;t like you doing it ? then what should you do ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Durgesh O Mishra\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; &quot;If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--089e0158be44fd614c04e2c22fff\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dear Durgesh,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some ran=\r\ndom thoughts ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Through the course of our day, we=\r\n interact with many people.
