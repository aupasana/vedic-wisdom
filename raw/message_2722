It seems to be his extrapolation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wha=\r\nt you quoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional view that I am fa=\r\nmiliar with. Other scriptures refer to the same order of creation, includin=\r\ng &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; , where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destructi=\r\non and liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thi=\r\ns Upanishadic understanding is also consistent with chakra based understand=\r\ning of Tantra. The five chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadha=\r\nara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leav=\r\nes Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces o=\r\nf earth element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves =\r\nSwaadhishthaana, water element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces o=\r\nf water element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and water etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physic=\r\nal water etc. Earth element shows a solid state of existence. Water element=\r\n shows a flexible and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that o=\r\nne &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge e=\r\ntc) is of solid state and made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a=\r\n particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of t=\r\nhe nature of water element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can b=\r\ne mapped to the five elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one=\r\n perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way physical=\r\nly. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has=\r\n certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concep=\r\nts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini repres=\r\nents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *a=\r\nnything* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one =\r\nis is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *a=\r\nnything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea =\r\nof who one is is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people w=\r\nho talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often talking =\r\nmerely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which may stil=\r\nl be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini actually being=\r\n there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a so=\r\nlid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kunda=\r\nlini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea=\r\n of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of existence! T=\r\no completely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;=\r\n), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe order in which elements are effaced as one progresses towards samadhi i=\r\ns - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, effac=\r\ned elements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, water a=\r\nnd earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and spi=\r\nritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe reality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe/model reality at the gross physical lev=\r\nel, as perceived by the external senses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot;=\r\n things without the external senses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a s=\r\nimple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;=\r\nsee&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In another example=\r\n, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some =\r\nscenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceived by the e=\r\nxternal senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that can be perceived b=\r\ny the external senses, because different people can experience the same rea=\r\nlity using their senses individually and verify the observation. However, s=\r\nome experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are sometime=\r\ns very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liberating inf=\r\nluence on people. Inability to study and model them is a big drawback of mo=\r\ndern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize dr=\r\neams and internal yogic experiences as imaginations or hallucinations, beca=\r\nuse there is no independent validation, and call them unworthy of a study. =\r\nBut there are cases that make one wonder. For example, see the following me=\r\nssages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mind and=\r\n mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdo=\r\nm/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a spec=\r\nific yogic experience that was described in detail and another person seeme=\r\nd to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating to the experie=\r\nnce, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, =\r\nthough it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisd=\r\nom/message/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had =\r\na specific yogic experience that was described in detail and another person=\r\n seemed to know about it and supplied a couple of tangible details relating=\r\n to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the=\r\n first person, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http:/=\r\n/groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In t=\r\nhe above message, one person had a specific yogic experience involving a de=\r\nity and another person perceived with his external senses a vision involvin=\r\ng the same deity, though others in the room could not perceive anything wit=\r\nh their external senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the e=\r\nxperience of the first person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest t=\r\nhat perhaps *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the =\r\nexternal senses are observable by others, though not everyone may be able t=\r\no observe. Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences =\r\nthat cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses being a part of=\r\n the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern s=\r\ncience study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can be studie=\r\nd and measured is the reality involving the gross body and its senses, one =\r\nmay suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be studied by observing=\r\n various parts of the gross physical body. For example, one can look at the=\r\n nervous signals flowing through various parts of the brain and try to corr=\r\nelate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the=\r\n surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body and=\r\n causal body are redundant. Though there is some correspondence between wha=\r\nt happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many mapp=\r\ning and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept of causal and s=\r\nubtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model can be moderled u=\r\nsing just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive through a neighborh=\r\nood and observe the houses from the road, you can have *some* idea of what =\r\nis going on. A particular house with a lot of lights and sound and many car=\r\ns parked outside may be having a party. People in one particular house with=\r\n no lights are probably out of town. But you can never be sure what is goin=\r\ng on in the house, how many people are inside, what exactly they are doing =\r\netc, by merely looking at the house from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarl=\r\ny, by looking at the nervous signals in various points of the brain, you ma=\r\ny be able to see some basic things, but not much. The experiences of the su=\r\nbtle mind are beyond your reach and study, if your tools are limited to the=\r\n gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunate=\r\nly, modern science cannot study that part of the reality which is beyond th=\r\ne scope of external senses, unless scientists become yogis and develop mast=\r\nery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times h=\r\nad mastery of the internal world (which is the microcosm of the entire univ=\r\nerse) and could observe any space-time point, even the greatest yogis of to=\r\nday cannot control their state completely. When Kundalini rises, it may go =\r\nsomewhere and one may experience some part of the Infinite Reality. But one=\r\n cannot control exactly where Kundalini goes and exactly which part of the =\r\nInfinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed to have a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): h=\r\nttp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows)=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarsh=\r\ni14@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stu=\r\nff from the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the =\r\nhighest order) - it maybe of some help to you.

Then from there came the =\r\n&quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produced=\r\n some universal energies which are more commonly known as the universal dei=\r\nties like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of t=\r\nhese are the actual physical elements as we see it, but more the essence of=\r\n the element, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose inte=\r\nraction with the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this w=\r\nay came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previous and ea=\r\nch one resulting in some energy states, which in the end resulted in 33 cro=\r\nre possible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in =\r\nthere (at least for me), and I want to get at it..

Finding =\r\na correlation between this and the idea of the five elements, in my humble =\r\nopinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation between ba=\r\nsic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation) , non-local=\r\nity etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of =\r\npanch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permission of=\r\n Narasimha, I would like to know more about how exactly you can link these =\r\ntwo, because I myself with my limited understand fail to see any viable cor=\r\nrelation at all as of now, specially, since the M-theory is yet in a very n=\r\nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think about is =\r\nthe basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe reality? Or =\r\ndoes it provide a model of reality? These two are different. Mathematics pr=\r\novides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly as reality is.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quoted that everyone=\r\n knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it really is!\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost the =\r\nessence of everything. The day physics gets THAT deep, there would be reall=\r\ny nothing more left to do. Physics is still quite far away from that stage.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- =\r\nOn Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if I get the thrust =\r\nof your point. Yes, sadhana is the only way to know this for sure. And so a=\r\nlso for everything else that is below the reach of the senses (e.g. Atma, s=\r\nookshma sarira etc). But we do read about them (all these things e.g Atma e=\r\ntc), and about the significance of the vedic gods anyway, dont we? They do =\r\noffer a mild complement to sadhana, dont they? They do help make the mind m=\r\nore receptive toward the benefits of sadhana..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also wa=\r\nnted to assure you that I really want to know the answer to the question. I=\r\n am not interested in a he-said/she- said type game (if perhaps that is wha=\r\nt you were hinting at?). I am extremely curious as to why there is an order=\r\n and not a parallelism, for e.g. why are the mahabhutas not simultaneously =\r\nformed. There is some lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get =\r\nat it.. I feel there may be some correlation between that and the 11-dimens=\r\nional physics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With all=\r\n due respect to your query, I wanted to ask, how does it matter?
