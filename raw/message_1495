But, if you are not comfortable, it may \nbe difficult to ask.\n\n&gt; because aren&#39;t priests after-all, micro-Gods...\n\nThat is the theory. That used to be true in practice too...\n\nIf any person does a good amount of sadhana and makes spiritual progress, \nthe divine forces are stronger and active in that person.\n\nRemember one thing. An elevated soul with no ego would care little about \nothers pointing out his mistakes. You have nothing to fear when you point \nout a mistake to such a person. An egoistic person without much spiritual \nprogress will be offended, but again you have nothing fear with such a \nperson. It is somebody who made some progress and yet has a strong ego, that \nyou have to fear! Such a person has accumulated some shakti, but keeps \nwasting it now and then due to ego. You don&#39;t want to be the target of such \na wasting exercise.\n\nThus, your attitude of not questioning is pragmatic.\n\n&gt; 1. one has to accept this is one&#39;s karma for getting a &#39;wrong&#39; mantra?\n\nGetting a wrong mantra may be the fruit of one&#39;s previous karma. But one can \nuse one&#39;s free will to get out of this situation. You are, after all, not \nforced to do the wrong mantra.\n\n&gt; 2. even if the mantra were to be incorrect, does the fact that it was\n&gt; heard out of the mouth of a pious and pure purohit automatically\n&gt; correct any blemishes of the mantra?\n\nIf the purohit is pure and pious and has some shakti, yes, it is the best to \njust do it. Even if that is not the case, if you *firmly believe* that to be \nthe case and do it, it will still do good to you. However, in this age, such \nblind faith in somebody is very difficult. But, if you have such blind \nfaith, nothing like it.\n\nIn fact, a sishya seeing guru as Shiva (or Krishna) with the full force of \nmind and a firm unshakable belief will make much progress and his faith may \neven end up making his guru as Shiva!\n\n&gt; 3. or should one trust one&#39;s own judgement and auto-correct the mantra \n&gt; without informing the purohit about it?\n\nIf you do not have 100% blind faith in the purity and piety of the purohit, \nthe best course of action is to use your own judgment and correct it based \non available literature.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;waspieswaspies&quot; &lt;waspieswaspies@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 8:42 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Can the words of a purohit ever be bad?\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and all friends,\n&gt;\n&gt; First of all I would like to say a big thank you and how fortunate I feel \n&gt; to have come across this amazing yahoo group, where I find the answers to \n&gt; the questions which I&#39;ve had for a long time but was afraid to ask!\n&gt;\n&gt; :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a situation where the family purohit-cum-jyotish has advised for \n&gt; the japam of the Ketu beeja mantra, which he has given thus - &quot;Om Sah Prom \n&gt; Prim Pram Om Ketave Namah&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; From the little that I know, I have only come across the &quot;prom prim pram&quot; \n&gt; beeja for the Shani mantra and the Ketu mantra being thus &quot;Om shram shreem \n&gt; shroum sah ketave namah&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now unless this is a NEW practice of mixing and merging of the Navgraha \n&gt; beejas or a practice/tradition which I have not heard of so far, I have \n&gt; doubts regarding its correctness. And I would not question the family \n&gt; purohit for fear of appearing arrogant or causing any offence to them \n&gt; because aren&#39;t priests after-all, micro-Gods...in such a case should one \n&gt; continue doing a mantra which one doubts because:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. one has to accept this is one&#39;s karma for getting a &#39;wrong&#39; mantra?\n&gt; 2. even if the mantra were to be incorrect, does the fact that it was \n&gt; heard out of the mouth of a pious and pure purohit automatically correct \n&gt; any blemishes of the mantra?\n&gt; 3. or should one trust one&#39;s own judgement and auto-correct the mantra \n&gt; without informing the purohit about it?\n&gt;\n&gt; I will be grateful for any input on this one as always.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt; Somanathan\n\n\n"}}
