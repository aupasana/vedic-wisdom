I did=\r\n this in the past but of late I find that most offered seeds pop with a cra=\r\nckling noise and a good few shoot out of the homa kunda with a trail of wis=\r\np of smoke and scatter about the floor. I do not put them back in thinking =\r\nanything rejected by Fire God should not be re-offered. I would be lying if=\r\n I pretended that I am not apprehensive of the significations but my questi=\r\non really has to do with the practical aspect of how to prevent this.  I wo=\r\nuld be grateful to hear from others of their experiences of the same and ho=\r\nw to alleviate it.\n\nThanks,\nAlok.\n\n\n\n"}}
