I then took him to Bhagavan. Also, I was=\r\n asked to\nvacate the room I had been occupying at that time, in favor of Ch=\r\nadwick.\nChadwick did not like this and said that if I vacated he would not =\r\nstay at\nthe Ashram. It was then agreed that the two of us would share the r=\r\noom.\n\nThis is how I became very friendly with Chadwick. He appreciated my h=\r\nard\nwork and sincerity. I even used to learn a little bit of English from\nC=\r\nhadwick.\n\nChadwick gave me an umbrella, shaded eyeglasses and sandals to us=\r\ne when I\nwas supervising or working in the hot sun. Once, when Bhagavan cam=\r\ne by, I\ntried to remove all three. Then Bhagavan came near me and chided me=\r\n, saying,\n&quot;If you behave like this on seeing me, I will never come near you=\r\n.&quot; The\nirony is that some others in the Ashram used to scoff at me for wear=\r\ning\nthese in Bhagavan&#39;s presence. I was in a dilemma because it was Bhagava=\r\nn who\ninsisted that I behave normally, or He would not come near me.\n\nIf yo=\r\nu got up from your seat when Bhagavan passed by, He wouldn&#39;t be happy\nand w=\r\nould say, &quot;So you are showing off your bhakti. Why not behave normally\neven=\r\n when I come.&quot;\n\nConstruction Work\n\nI knew nothing about masonry work before=\r\n coming here. Although my father was\nproficient in masonry, sculpture, astr=\r\nology and other fine arts, I knew none\nof these when I came to Bhagavan. Bh=\r\nagavan taught me everything.\n\nOne day, Thenamma Paati asked Bhagavan how I =\r\ncould apply my mind to\nsupervise all the construction work that was going o=\r\nn and still be devoted\nto Bhagavan. Bhagavan laughed and remarked that I sh=\r\nould have been an\nengineer in my previous birth.\n\nIt was in very subtle way=\r\ns that Bhagavan extracted work from the\ndevotees. During\nmy early days with=\r\n Bhagavan, he once told me, &quot;Go and see what the mason is\ndoing.&quot; So I went=\r\n there, asked him what he was doing and conveyed the reply\nto Bhagavan. Aft=\r\ner sometime, Bhagavan again asked me to go and see what the\nmason was doing=\r\n. I complied. The mason was a little annoyed, but made the\nsame reply. When=\r\n Bhagavan asked me to go and see what the mason was doing\nfor the third tim=\r\ne, the mason thought that Bhagavan was mad as he was just\nasking him the sa=\r\nme question again and again. I now asked Bhagavan why he\nkept repeating the=\r\n same question. That is when he came out with his\nintentions and said, .Som=\r\neone can attend to the work here. You go and\nsupervise that work.&quot; I reflec=\r\nted that Bhagavan could have told me this in\nthe first instance itself, or =\r\njust ordered me to go and do it. But that\nwasn&#39;t Bhagavan&#39;s way. He was ver=\r\ny subtle, shy, and very gentle. Bhagavan\nwould indicate with only a few wor=\r\nds or signs.\n\nWhen the storeroom was being built, Bhagavan wanted me to mak=\r\ne an image of\nArunachala in cement. I honestly felt that I was overworked, =\r\nnot getting\nenough rest. Also, I was feeling a little dejected. A little la=\r\nter, Bhagavan\ncame back and said, &quot;I thought I could make that request, but=\r\n if that&#39;s\ndifficult for you, don&#39;t bother with it.&quot; I felt badly about the=\r\n thoughts I\nhad entertained and resolved that in the future I would definit=\r\nely undertake\nand fulfill any of Bhagavan&#39;s requests, even if that should m=\r\nean sacrificing\nmy body. It was a solemn pledge I made to myself.\n\nBhagavan=\r\n was very particular about doing things meticulously and perfectly. On\nall =\r\ncupboards and other furniture, the name &quot;Sri Ramanasramam,\nTiruvannamalai&quot; =\r\nhad to be written very neatly, just like printed letters.\n\nBhagavan insiste=\r\nd that I should draw the image of Arunachala on the wall of\nthe Ashram Stor=\r\ne. When it did not come out properly, Bhagavan came and\ninstructed me. Howe=\r\nver, it did not come out the second time as well.\nBhagavan once again gave =\r\nme a few hints and I managed to get it right the\nthird time, and it can be =\r\nseen at the store entrance even today. The three\ndimensional aspect is also=\r\n visible on account of the cement being plastered\naccordingly. The same thi=\r\nng happened with the arch of the Ashram entrance.\nBhagavan would encourage =\r\nme to take up such work, and whenever I had\ndifficulty, Bhagavan would come=\r\n, give hints, and encourage me to do it\nperfectly.\n\nOne day I was feeling t=\r\nired and was reclining against a wall. Bhagavan came\nup to me and said, &quot;I&#39;=\r\nm afraid to even look at you.&quot; I asked Him why that\nshould be so. He said, =\r\n&quot;If I would just look in one direction, you would\nconstruct a structure the=\r\nre.&quot; This was of course in jest but it also meant\nthat I could understand B=\r\nhagavan&#39;s subtle instructions and follow them\nmeticulously. This was great =\r\nappreciation showered upon me by Sri Bhagavan.\n\nOn another occasion, I was =\r\nbuilding some steps near the water tap. Bhagavan\nwas standing there and giv=\r\ning me instructions. As I got up, I banged my head\nhard against the tap. Bh=\r\nagavan asked Madhavaswami to bring zambak (medicinal\nointment), and persona=\r\nlly massaged my head for a long time. Though I had\npain in my head, I kept =\r\nreminding myself of Bhagavan&#39;s teaching, which was\nto give up the &#39;I am-the=\r\n-body&#39; idea. I also thanked the tap for giving me\nthis opportunity to recei=\r\nve a massage from the golden this opportunity to\nreceive a massage from the=\r\n golden hands of Sri Bhagavan.\n\nIn the earlier days, Madhavaswami, Rangaswa=\r\nmi and I used to massage the\nsoles of Bhagavan&#39;s feet with oil, and put our=\r\n heads against His feet to\nreceive His grace after completing the massage. =\r\nBhagavan used to pretend to\nbe asleep when we did this. However, when large=\r\n crowds started coming to the\nAshram regularly, we had to stop this practic=\r\ne of ours.\n\nWhen the Dining Hall was being built, Bhagavan used to dig the =\r\nearth with a\nhuge gaddapare (crowbar) and Santhamma used to mix mortar with=\r\n water. I was\nentrusted with the mason&#39;s work. While we worked on the const=\r\nruction\nThenamma and Subbu-lakshmiamma used to do the cooking nearby. As I =\r\nwas not a\nbrahmin, the women used a large white cloth as a partition betwee=\r\nn them and\nus. Bhagavan told them, &quot;Why are you doing this? It&#39;s only our A=\r\nnnamalai.\nWhy should you segregate him like this?&quot; Chinnaswami, on hearing =\r\nthis said,\n&quot;Bhagavan says &#39;our Annamalai&#39;, so he has become an ichcha brahm=\r\nin&quot;, i.e., a\nbrahmin by the wish of Sri Bhagavan.\n\nDisturbing Ants\n\nOne day=\r\n after lunch we noticed lots of ants in the Old Hall disturbing the\ndevotee=\r\ns. Bhagavan asked me to inspect the area and do the needful. When I\nwent an=\r\nd lifted a stone, millions of ants rushed out. I was jumping all over\nin or=\r\nder to avoid crushing them.When Bhagavan asked me what I was doing, I\nexpla=\r\nined that it would be jivahimsa to kill hundreds and thousands of ants\nby s=\r\ntepping upon them or by closing the opening through which they came out.\nHe=\r\n said, &quot;You are not doing it for yourself, it is for the sake of others.&quot;\nH=\r\ne then quoted from Chapter thirteen of Bhagavad Gita where Krishna says\ntha=\r\nt even killing is permitted if it is for the benefit of the world. Upon\nhea=\r\nring this, I cleared the area of ants, sealed the entrance and cemented\nit.=\r\n\n\nIn the days when I still used to live in the Ashram, I once told Bhagavan=\r\n\nthat I didn&#39;t even desire moksha, but just wanted to be saved from the\natt=\r\nractions of women. I was wondering what reply Bhagavan would give. He\nsaid =\r\nthat it was freedom from this desire that all great people had sought\nand s=\r\nuffered for.\n\nAnimals\n\nBhagavan was extraordinarily kind towards birds, squ=\r\nirrels, cows, dogs and\npeacocks. In fact, He showed visible partiality towa=\r\nrds animals over humans.\n\nBhagavan was particularly interested in rituals f=\r\nor the samadhis of the\nbirds and animals and wanted special pujas to be don=\r\ne for such samadhis with\nofferings of milk, etc. Many people used to witnes=\r\ns this with awe and\nwonder.\n\nOnce, as Bhagavan was descending the steps nea=\r\nr the Valli deer&#39;s samadhi, he\nsaw a dog chasing a squirrel. Bhagavan tried=\r\n to prevent the dog from harming\nthe squirrel by interposing his stick in b=\r\netween them. In the process, He\nstumbled and fell down the steps, suffering=\r\n bruises all over his body.\nTincture was applied all over, which causes a b=\r\nurning sensation. Plaster was\napplied on all the wounds, and there are even=\r\n photographs of Bhagavan with\nplaster all over His body. Bhagavan underwent=\r\n such suffering even for\nanimals. We all have witnessed these phases in Bha=\r\ngavan&#39;s life.\n\nShadow Bhagavan\n\nOnce, there were films being shown at the A=\r\nshram, including one on Bhagavan.\nI wanted to see the film. When I arrived =\r\nand prostrated before Bhagavan, He\nsaid in a stern voice. &quot;So you have come=\r\n to see the shadow of Bhagavan. This\nmeans that you no longer have the real=\r\n Bhagavan in you and have hence come\nto see this shadow-Bhagavan.&quot; This tou=\r\nched me very deeply.\n\nOne day, after this incident, I went up the hill want=\r\ning to meet Bhagavan\nwhen he returned from his walk. He again looked at me =\r\nsternly and said, &quot;Why\nhave you come to see me? You have happiness, you hav=\r\ne happiness.&quot; I couldn&#39;t\nunderstand his words then, but after a lot of refl=\r\nection I realized that\nwhen one is away from society, one has peace, and th=\r\nat Bhagavan wanted me to\navoid the entire society. This is how I interprete=\r\nd His words.\n\nBhagavan also said, &quot;Ananda is not what you get from somewher=\r\ne else. If you\nfollow somebody else&#39;s path, it will only lead you to destru=\r\nction. You have\nto follow your own self. Go within. That alone will lead yo=\r\nu to Ananda.&quot; So\nI interpreted it to mean that I should be alone.\n\nSource: =\r\nhttp://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2005/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=\r\n=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=\r\n=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=81\n\r\n--00504502b0411a311a0487dc72dc\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Major Chadwick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wh=\r\nen Chadwick arrived in Tiruvannamalai he mistook me for Bhagavan and prostr=\r\nated before me.

He said that it was freedom from this desire that al=\r\nl great people had sought and suffered for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Animals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan was extraordinarily kind t=\r\nowards birds, squirrels, cows, dogs and peacocks.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nweight:bold&quot;&gt;In fact, He showed visible partiality towards animals over hum=\r\nans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan was particularly interested in rituals for th=\r\ne samadhis of the birds and animals and wanted special pujas to be done for=\r\n such samadhis with offerings of milk, etc. Many people used to witness thi=\r\ns with awe and wonder.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Once, as B=\r\nhagavan was descending the steps near the Valli deer&#39;s samadhi, he saw =\r\na dog chasing a squirrel. Bhagavan tried to prevent the dog from harming th=\r\ne squirrel by interposing his stick in between them. In the process, He stu=\r\nmbled and fell down the steps, suffering bruises all over his body. Tinctur=\r\ne was applied all over, which causes a burning sensation. Plaster was appli=\r\ned on all the wounds, and there are even photographs of Bhagavan with plast=\r\ner all over His body. Bhagavan underwent such suffering even for animals. W=\r\ne all have witnessed these phases in Bhagavan&#39;s life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Shadow Bhagavan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Once, there were films being shown at the Ashram, inc=\r\nluding one on Bhagavan. I wanted to see the film. When I arrived and prostr=\r\nated before Bhagavan, He said in a stern voice. &quot;So you have come to s=\r\nee the shadow of Bhagavan. This means that you no longer have the real Bhag=\r\navan in you and have hence come to see this shadow-Bhagavan.&quot; This tou=\r\nched me very deeply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One day, after this incident, I went u=\r\np the hill wanting to meet Bhagavan when he returned from his walk. He agai=\r\nn looked at me sternly and said, &quot;Why have you come to see me? You hav=\r\ne happiness, you have happiness.&quot; I couldn&#39;t understand his words =\r\nthen, but after a lot of reflection I realized that when one is away from s=\r\nociety, one has peace, and that Bhagavan wanted me to avoid the entire soci=\r\nety. This is how I interpreted His words.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan also said, &quo=\r\nt;Ananda is not what you get from somewhere else. If you follow somebody el=\r\nse&#39;s path, it will only lead you to destruction. You have to follow you=\r\nr own self. Go within. That alone will lead you to Ananda.&quot; So I inter=\r\npreted it to mean that I should be alone.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/20=\r\n05/?pg=3Dnov-dec&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2=\r\n005/?pg=3Dnov-dec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0=\r\npx;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right=\r\n:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=\r\n=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =\r\n=C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\r\n--00504502b0411a311a0487dc72dc--\r\n\n"}}
