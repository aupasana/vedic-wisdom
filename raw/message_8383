Let me=\r\n narrate the same here.\n\n\nOn his way to Gangotri, an individual named &quot;P&quot; r=\r\neached a small, less-populated village. It was evening and a slight drizzle=\r\n poured on the backdrop of a orange colored setting sun. He was wondering w=\r\nhere to spend the night, when he suddenly found a Bhairavi standing infront=\r\n of him. He was surprised. Shakti sadhana is not that popular in these part=\r\ns of India, neither are Tantriks and Bhairavis. She wore a red sari, had a =\r\njata on her head and a trishul in one hand and small cloth tied into a knot=\r\n in her other hand. She looked about 32-34 years of age and was strikingly =\r\nbeautiful looking.\n\n\nBefore he could open his mouth, she started speaking a=\r\nnd speaking. First she spoke in Hindi, then Punjabi and then Marathi. Becau=\r\nse of his travels across India, the author was familiar with the sound of d=\r\nifferent Indian languages but could not understand them. Then she spoke in =\r\nBengali which was the P&#39;s mother-tongue. &quot;Are you going to Gangotri? Have y=\r\nou found a place to stay for the night?&quot;. P was not too pleased seeing her.=\r\n He loved his own solitary wanderings and was not keen on company. So to av=\r\noid her, he said I have found a place to stay for the night but it is extre=\r\nmely dirty, littered with droppings of wild animals and infested with snake=\r\ns and scorpions. She insisted that she will be able to manage and it was af=\r\nterall only a matter of one night to avoid the rains. Once the staying plac=\r\ne was reached, she cleaned the place up with a fallen branch from a tree, l=\r\naid out her belongings on one side and lit a fire with some twigs. Then she=\r\n asked him if\n had any food. P replied he did not, plus all the shops in th=\r\ne area were closed due to the inclement weather. She got up and said she ha=\r\ns to take a bath in the Ganges nearby and will come back soon. After about =\r\nhalf and hour she returned back with a something tied in a cloth. She opene=\r\nd the cloth and took out 2 rotis and some bhaji and gave it to the author t=\r\no eat. The author was mildly surprised and on inquiry was told that near th=\r\ne bank of Ganges she had found one small eatery and she got the food from t=\r\nhere. She herself did not eat anything but gave the food to the him, saying=\r\n she was not hungry. P felt grateful for the food and confessed that he wou=\r\nld have gone hungry tonight, had it not been for her, because he did not ha=\r\nve money to buy food. \n\n\nShe asked with surprise, &quot;You have come so far wit=\r\nh any money? Where is your home? ETC ETC.&quot; On hearing his answers, she aske=\r\nd, &quot;So do you believe that your meeting me is due to the will of Jagadamba?=\r\n&quot;.\nHe replied, &quot;Well at least on regarding the food, definitely!&quot;\nBhairavi,=\r\n &quot;You people have petty minds, without any gains you don&#39;t listen to anythi=\r\nng, you don&#39;t interact freely with others&quot;.\n\nHe asked,&quot; Are you a Tantrik?&quot;=\r\n She replied, &quot;Yes. What is your bhava?&quot;\nP, &quot;I do not have fixed path, but =\r\nI am very curious about Tantra and Shakti Sadhana. Can you ask you some que=\r\nstions about Tantra? Can a person attain God through the path of Tantra?&quot;\n\n=\r\n\nShe sat down crosslegged in padmasana and replied, &quot; The word God means di=\r\nfferent things to different people. Then attaining God has even more differ=\r\nent and complex meanings to everyone based on their own ideas. This is not =\r\nlike attaining some property or money. It can be attained by various path, =\r\nand then again it can attained by no-path at all. And the most complex thin=\r\ng in all this is what you refer to as God is not something that is to be po=\r\nssessed at all! Are you satisfied with the answer?&quot;\n\nP: &quot;What is the aim of=\r\n Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tangible benefit? Those who are Tantriks or =\r\nSiddha Kaulacharis, what do they gain?&quot;\n\nBhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadhana wi=\r\nth whatever intention, they will achieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, whi=\r\nch is vira-chara, is about becoming free from chains (pashas). Only when th=\r\ne chains have been broken that divine Shakti is awakened in the body. Now i=\r\nf someone then uses this Divine Shakti for personal gains, then they head t=\r\nowards great calamity. Those who use it for the good of humanity, they beco=\r\nme really divine&quot;.\n\nTill now she was speaking calmly. Now P asked, &quot;But the=\r\n answer that you gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you trying to imply th=\r\nat man cannot attain God through Tantra?&quot;\n\nBhairavi:&quot;If you had been intell=\r\nigent, you would not have asked this question. Forget about attaining God f=\r\nor the moment, first learn to acquire shakti. Have you done that? Start imm=\r\nediately and by Bhagawati&#39;s grace you will accomplish. This I can guarantee=\r\n.=C2=A0 First become a Shaktiman, understand what is Shakti and how much Sh=\r\nakti you are capable of holding in your body and mind. Understood? Don&#39;t wa=\r\nste your time in useless debates. Did you understand what I am saying?&quot;\n\nTh=\r\ne Bhairavi looked angry, the color of her face has suddenly changed and her=\r\n eyes become still and unblinking. P felt scared. He kept quite. She contin=\r\nued:&quot; All these idiots having read a few books here and there have only lea=\r\nrnt useless debates and time-wasting. Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Sha=\r\nktihin (sans Shakti), medhahin (sans intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you =\r\nguys get kicked from your bosses in office, and the come home and show off =\r\nyour impotency on your wives and mothers. And you want to debate on Shakti =\r\nsadhana! This is ridiculous!&quot;\n\nP got unnerved and was certain that she is a=\r\n mad woman. The moment this thought came in his mind, she stood up at a lig=\r\nhtning pace and screamed back, &quot; Oh you think I am mad? You don&#39;t know who =\r\nI am. I can destroy you completely, or I can make you into a real Shaktiman=\r\n. Do you want to see?&quot;\n\nHis mind became stunned into silence. He did not kn=\r\now what to say. In fear, he looked down at his own feet unable to make any =\r\nconversation and started chanting the name of Krishna to save him. He wonde=\r\nred if he should now get up and run away from that place. Immediate she cam=\r\ne over to where he was sitting and held his shoulders, &quot;Where will you run?=\r\n Do you think you have the ability to escape from me, without my willing it=\r\n? I consider people like you nothing more than insects. You&#39;ve left your wi=\r\nfe and son and gone out roaming to peform Dharma! You don&#39;t even know what =\r\nDharma means. An idiot of the first order. People like you are sheep, not m=\r\nen. Escapists and cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaitha into the Ga=\r\nnges. It&#39;s nonsense. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do you know what=\r\n is yoga, running away from life and believing that by escaping one attains=\r\n to renunciation. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dead decayed ind=\r\nividuals. A sheep\n whose only contribution to life is to reproduce some mor=\r\ne sheep and then run away from them. Idiot!&quot;\n\nIn fear and shame the P felt =\r\nlike he would faint any moment. For the first time in his wanderings he fel=\r\nt so depressed about himself that he did not know what to say. Like in a tr=\r\nance he felt his \n\nvision was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fal=\r\nl down on the floor, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his sho=\r\nulders and said, &quot;There is no renunciation or detachment from life in your =\r\nheart and mind. How dare you argue and dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha await=\r\ns you and you think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Ar=\r\ne you free from desires of life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through y=\r\nou&quot;. He could not lift his eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt asha=\r\nmed of himself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her fee=\r\nt and started crying, &quot;Ma please save me.=C2=A0 You are right. I am an idio=\r\nt, I am a coward, I am an escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and=\r\n children at home. I am weak of mind and heart.&quot; His voice became choked wi=\r\nth tears.\n\nHearing this the Bhairavi became silent. She held his chin with =\r\nher right-hand and lifted up his face to the light. Her eyes had changed co=\r\nlor and there was a tremendous compassion on her face. &quot;What do you think I=\r\n am? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from hell to torment you, a raving=\r\n mad woman?&quot;\n\n\nAnd P replied, &quot;But I have not said anything to you like tha=\r\nt, have I?&quot;. Hearing this she became furious with anger, &quot;Will you people n=\r\never become real men? You think something in your heart and you lie through=\r\n your teeth when asked. Don&#39;t you have any tej, shakti anything at all? Lyi=\r\nng to escape situations? Is this the character of real purush? Soft like mu=\r\nd who can be molded into any obnoxious character when challenged by situati=\r\nons? And you think you can learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What do you =\r\ndo in life?&quot;\n\nP replied he was a painter before he left home. Hearing this =\r\nher eyes widened in a childlike excitement. She lost her anger completely a=\r\nnd asked,&quot; Can you draw me a picture? I have been searching for a good arti=\r\nst? Can you draw a picture of Chinnamasta? I&#39;ve not found anyone who can dr=\r\naw her properly&quot;.\n\nP, &quot;Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easily available=\r\n in the market for a very little price&quot;. Hearing this she started roaring w=\r\nith laughter, &quot;Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinnamasta? \n\nHave you=\r\n gone mad? &lt;again laughter&gt;.&quot;\n\nP, &quot;I find her image very violent and terrif=\r\nying&quot;.\n\nThen the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud that it sounded like a h=\r\numkar, &quot;Fool! For people like you who are worst than women, it is but natur=\r\nal that Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying. People who are scared a=\r\nt the first sight of blood and death will not appreciate her beauty! Those =\r\nwho remain trapped in conditioned thinking of pap vs punya, sarga vs naraka=\r\n, good vs bad, and other dualities cannot understand the madness of Chinnam=\r\nasta. You will only be able to draw a white Saraswati with her beena and li=\r\nve trying to deny the other aspects and realities of life, the death and th=\r\ne decay and never see the grand play of the Universe. For you and your ilk,=\r\n a woman is an object of subconscious revulsion, you run scared when you se=\r\ne the first woman approaching, you run away from your own wife, how on eart=\r\nh can you handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta?&quot;\n\nThen she pushed him =\r\nwith her hand. He fell on the floor. She continued, &quot;Go drown yourself in t=\r\nhe Ganges and before doing so pray to Jagadamba Durga that She may make you=\r\n fit to hold shakti in your next life. Or at least beg Her, implore Her, th=\r\nat She may grant you intelligence to understand what is Shakti-tattwa.&quot;\n\nHe=\r\naring these words, P was so depressed that his mind plunged into chaos and =\r\ndarkness. Like in a state of debilitating trance, he got up from the floor =\r\nand sat down. The Bhairavi was not there in the room. He looked all around =\r\nhim. Then he saw her on the road outside, walking towards the ganges. He cr=\r\nied out to her, &quot;Don&#39;t leave me here, I must know who you are. I am confuse=\r\nd about life and everything else&quot;. As soon as he uttered these words, the r=\r\noom started reverberating with a attahasa, though there was not a soul pres=\r\nent there apart from him. A laughter so loud that he left his ear drums wil=\r\nl split. He rushed out into the rain to follow the moving figure of the Bha=\r\niravi. The faster he ran, the more did the distance keep increasing between=\r\n him and the Bhairavi. Then he could see clearly, the Bhairavi entering int=\r\no the Ganges water, and kept moving deeper until she was drowned completely=\r\n in the water. The author sat near the banks, shouting out to her,\n asking =\r\nher to come out and help him. But there was no response. Just the regular l=\r\napping sound of waves hitting the shore and a very dark night. \n\n\nHe sat th=\r\nere till sunrise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. Next morning he wen=\r\nt and asked around the village, but no one had seen the Bhairavi and neithe=\r\nr was there any shop near the banks which sold food. Because of the heavy r=\r\nains, everything was shut down last night with not a soul in the open.\n\n\nYe=\r\nars later, P went back home to his wife and son and lead a full and complet=\r\ne family life. I have merely narrated the incident as it is.\n\n\n-Regards\n=C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\nBazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\nHota hain shab-o-roz=\r\n tamasha mere aage\n=C2=A0\nEk khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\nEk ba=\r\nat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n\n\n________________________________\n From: =\r\nLaxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Sunday, 17 June 2012 5:51 PM\nSubje=\r\nct: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability and Personal Grace of Sri Mahav=\r\nidya&quot;\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nHello, \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 This letter is to cheer you up and it is=C2=A0a strange but tr=\r\nue personal experience.\nDivine Mother cares and protects her children all t=\r\nhe time and also plays snakes and ladders and ludo with them. Bhagvati Sri =\r\nChinnmastaji is one of Dash MahaVidya and Her Swroop is very difficult to l=\r\nook at for me. Her Appearence Day Tithi has just gone by few weeks ago.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nMany years ago when I was living in Brajbhoomi, a sadhu came one late e=\r\nvening to my ashram. After some time he took me to a quite corner and told =\r\nme certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glow on his face a=\r\nnd had certain powers about him I believed him. Later on he also gave me a =\r\nMantra of=C2=A0Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu left in the morni=\r\nng and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told me did not happen =\r\nand this tithi became very upsetting for me.\n=C2=A0\nSome years back here in=\r\n London I was coming home in the afternoon. I was in a crowded bus and hold=\r\ning on to railings.Suddenly I rememberd that it was Tithi of Bhagvati Sri C=\r\nhinnmastaji. I started to recite Her mantra&#92;name and try to meditate on Her=\r\n in that crowded bus. I even smiled myself on the strangeness of that situa=\r\ntion. After few more minutes I reached home and opened my front door and we=\r\nnt inside. After going through my Puja room and telling my mother that I wa=\r\ns back, I flopped on sofa in front room which is very near to front gate. T=\r\nhen I heard some noises but I did not get up and slept for nearly one hour.=\r\n After I got up I got a srrong feeling to open my front door although nobod=\r\ny had knocked. The whole area in front of my house was covered in Police li=\r\nnes and tapes. I could not believe it. \n=C2=A0\nI asked a policeman who was =\r\nnear my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were shooting at each other an=\r\nd then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day I was clearly save=\r\nd by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky several minutes be=\r\nfore the incident and I started Her prayers although there was no reasons f=\r\nor me to do so. Then I slept whole time without knowing a single thing as l=\r\noad of armed policemen were there after those gunman.and whole noises and d=\r\nrama.\nWhat else is this but Personal Grace of Bhagvati Sri=C2=A0Chinnmastaj=\r\ni\n=C2=A0\nGoodLuck=C2=A0 and Thanks\nLaxmiNarayan\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=\r\n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nrom: Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Saturday, 16 June 2012, 2:48\n=\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadha=\r\nna&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamaste \n\n\nAparna ji, afew of us whom you consider are blessed wi=\r\nth the desire to pray her may definitely feel bad to read your mail.

Let me narrate the same here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On his way to Gangotri, an individual named &quot;P=\r\n&quot; reached a small, less-populated village. It was evening and a slight driz=\r\nzle poured on the backdrop of a orange colored setting sun. He was wonderin=\r\ng where to spend the night, when he suddenly found a Bhairavi standing infr=\r\nont of him. He was surprised. Shakti sadhana is not that popular in these p=\r\narts of India, neither are Tantriks and Bhairavis. She wore a red sari, had=\r\n a jata on her head and a trishul in one hand and small cloth tied into a k=\r\nnot in her other hand. She looked about 32-34 years of age and was striking=\r\nly beautiful looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Before he could\n open hi=\r\ns mouth, she started speaking and speaking. First she spoke in Hindi, then =\r\nPunjabi and then Marathi. Because of his travels across India, the author w=\r\nas familiar with the sound of different Indian languages but could not unde=\r\nrstand them. Then she spoke in Bengali which was the P&#39;s mother-tongue. &quot;Ar=\r\ne you going to Gangotri? Have you found a place to stay for the night?&quot;. P =\r\nwas not too pleased seeing her. He loved his own solitary wanderings and wa=\r\ns not keen on company. So to avoid her, he said I have found a place to sta=\r\ny for the night but it is extremely dirty, littered with droppings of wild =\r\nanimals and infested with snakes and scorpions. She insisted that she will =\r\nbe able to manage and it was afterall only a matter of one night to avoid t=\r\nhe rains. Once the staying place was reached, she cleaned the place up with=\r\n a fallen branch from a tree, laid out her belongings on one side and lit a=\r\n fire with some twigs. Then she asked him if had any food. P\n replied he di=\r\nd not, plus all the shops in the area were closed due to the inclement weat=\r\nher. She got up and said she has to take a bath in the Ganges nearby and wi=\r\nll come back soon. After about half and hour she returned back with a somet=\r\nhing tied in a cloth. She opened the cloth and took out 2 rotis and some bh=\r\naji and gave it to the author to eat. The author was mildly surprised and o=\r\nn inquiry was told that near the bank of Ganges she had found one small eat=\r\nery and she got the food from there. She herself did not eat anything but g=\r\nave the food to the him, saying she was not hungry. P felt grateful for the=\r\n food and confessed that he would have gone hungry tonight, had it not been=\r\n for her, because he did not have money to buy food. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;She asked with surprise, &quot;You have come so far with any money? Wher=\r\ne is your home? ETC ETC.&quot; On hearing his answers, she asked, &quot;So do you bel=\r\nieve that your meeting me is due to the will of\n Jagadamba?&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; He=\r\n replied, &quot;Well at least on regarding the food, definitely!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bhai=\r\nravi, &quot;You people have petty minds, without any gains you don&#39;t listen to a=\r\nnything, you don&#39;t interact freely with others&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;H=\r\ne asked,&quot; Are you a Tantrik?&quot; She replied, &quot;Yes. What is your bhava?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;P, &quot;I do not have fixed path, but I am very curious about Tantra and S=\r\nhakti Sadhana. Can you ask you some questions about Tantra? Can a person at=\r\ntain God through the path of Tantra?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She sat =\r\ndown crosslegged in padmasana and replied, &quot; The word God means different t=\r\nhings to different people. Then attaining God has even more different and c=\r\nomplex meanings to everyone based on their own ideas. This is not like atta=\r\nining some property or money. It can be attained by various path, and then =\r\nagain it can attained by no-path at all. And the most complex thing in all =\r\nthis is what you refer to as God is not\n something that is to be possessed =\r\nat all! Are you satisfied with the answer?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P: &quot;Wh=\r\nat is the aim of Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tangible benefit? Those who =\r\nare Tantriks or Siddha Kaulacharis, what do they gain?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadhana with whatever intention, they will ac=\r\nhieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, which is vira-chara, is about becoming=\r\n free from chains (pashas). Only when the chains have been broken that divi=\r\nne Shakti is awakened in the body. Now if someone then uses this Divine Sha=\r\nkti for personal gains, then they head towards great calamity. Those who us=\r\ne it for the good of humanity, they become really divine&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;Till now she was speaking calmly. Now P asked, &quot;But the answer tha=\r\nt you gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you trying to imply that man cann=\r\not attain God through Tantra?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bhairavi:&quot;If you ha=\r\nd been intelligent, you would not\n have asked this question. Forget about a=\r\nttaining God for the moment, first learn to acquire shakti. Have you done t=\r\nhat? Start immediately and by Bhagawati&#39;s grace you will accomplish. This I=\r\n can guarantee.&nbsp; First become a Shaktiman, understand what is Shakti a=\r\nnd how much Shakti you are capable of holding in your body and mind. Unders=\r\ntood? Don&#39;t waste your time in useless debates. Did you understand what I a=\r\nm saying?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Bhairavi looked angry, the color of=\r\n her face has suddenly changed and her eyes become still and unblinking. P =\r\nfelt scared. He kept quite. She continued:&quot; All these idiots having read a =\r\nfew books here and there have only learnt useless debates and time-wasting.=\r\n Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Shaktihin (sans Shakti), medhahin (sans =\r\nintellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you guys get kicked from your bosses in o=\r\nffice, and the come home and show off your impotency on your wives and moth=\r\ners. And you want to debate\n on Shakti sadhana! This is ridiculous!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P got unnerved and was certain that she is a mad woman. =\r\nThe moment this thought came in his mind, she stood up at a lightning pace =\r\nand screamed back, &quot; Oh you think I am mad? You don&#39;t know who I am. I can =\r\ndestroy you completely, or I can make you into a real Shaktiman. Do you wan=\r\nt to see?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;His mind became stunned into silence. H=\r\ne did not know what to say. In fear, he looked down at his own feet unable =\r\nto make any conversation and started chanting the name of Krishna to save h=\r\nim. He wondered if he should now get up and run away from that place. Immed=\r\niate she came over to where he was sitting and held his shoulders, &quot;Where w=\r\nill you run? Do you think you have the ability to escape from me, without m=\r\ny willing it? I consider people like you nothing more than insects. You&#39;ve =\r\nleft your wife and son and gone out roaming to peform Dharma! You don&#39;t eve=\r\nn know what Dharma\n means. An idiot of the first order. People like you are=\r\n sheep, not men. Escapists and cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaith=\r\na into the Ganges. It&#39;s nonsense. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do =\r\nyou know what is yoga, running away from life and believing that by escapin=\r\ng one attains to renunciation. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dea=\r\nd decayed individuals. A sheep whose only contribution to life is to reprod=\r\nuce some more sheep and then run away from them. Idiot!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;In fear and shame the P felt like he would faint any moment. For the=\r\n first time in his wanderings he felt so depressed about himself that he di=\r\nd not know what to say. Like in a trance he felt his &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;vision =\r\nwas becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fall down on the floor, when =\r\nthe Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his shoulders and said, &quot;There is=\r\n no renunciation or detachment from life in your heart and mind. How dare y=\r\nou argue and\n dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha awaits you and you think you c=\r\nan escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are you free from desires o=\r\nf life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through you&quot;. He could not lift hi=\r\ns eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt ashamed of himself and in a f=\r\neeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her feet and started crying, &quot;Ma=\r\n please save me.&nbsp; You are right. I am an idiot, I am a coward, I am an=\r\n escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and children at home. I am w=\r\neak of mind and heart.&quot; His voice became choked with tears.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hearing this the Bhairavi became silent. She held his chin with h=\r\ner right-hand and lifted up his face to the light. Her eyes had changed col=\r\nor and there was a tremendous compassion on her face. &quot;What do you think I =\r\nam? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from hell to torment you, a raving =\r\nmad woman?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And P replied, &quot;But I have not sai=\r\nd\n anything to you like that, have I?&quot;. Hearing this she became furious wit=\r\nh anger, &quot;Will you people never become real men? You think something in you=\r\nr heart and you lie through your teeth when asked. Don&#39;t you have any tej, =\r\nshakti anything at all? Lying to escape situations? Is this the character o=\r\nf real purush? Soft like mud who can be molded into any obnoxious character=\r\n when challenged by situations? And you think you can learn vira-bhava of B=\r\nhairava? Fool! What do you do in life?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P replied =\r\nhe was a painter before he left home. Hearing this her eyes widened in a ch=\r\nildlike excitement. She lost her anger completely and asked,&quot; Can you draw =\r\nme a picture? I have been searching for a good artist? Can you draw a pictu=\r\nre of Chinnamasta? I&#39;ve not found anyone who can draw her properly&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P, &quot;Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easily available=\r\n in the market for a very little price&quot;. Hearing this she started\n roaring =\r\nwith laughter, &quot;Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinnamasta? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have you gone mad? &lt;again laughter&gt;.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\nP, &quot;I find her image very violent and terrifying&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud that it sounded like a humkar, =\r\n&quot;Fool! For people like you who are worst than women, it is but natural that=\r\n Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying. People who are scared at the f=\r\nirst sight of blood and death will not appreciate her beauty! Those who rem=\r\nain trapped in conditioned thinking of pap vs punya, sarga vs naraka, good =\r\nvs bad, and other dualities cannot understand the madness of Chinnamasta. Y=\r\nou will only be able to draw a white Saraswati with her beena and live tryi=\r\nng to deny the other aspects and realities of life, the death and the decay=\r\n and never see the grand play of the Universe. For you and your ilk, a woma=\r\nn is an object of subconscious revulsion, you run scared\n when you see the =\r\nfirst woman approaching, you run away from your own wife, how on earth can =\r\nyou handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Th=\r\nen she pushed him with her hand. He fell on the floor. She continued, &quot;Go d=\r\nrown yourself in the Ganges and before doing so pray to Jagadamba Durga tha=\r\nt She may make you fit to hold shakti in your next life. Or at least beg He=\r\nr, implore Her, that She may grant you intelligence to understand what is S=\r\nhakti-tattwa.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hearing these words, P was so depre=\r\nssed that his mind plunged into chaos and darkness. Like in a state of debi=\r\nlitating trance, he got up from the floor and sat down. The Bhairavi was no=\r\nt there in the room. He looked all around him. Then he saw her on the road =\r\noutside, walking towards the ganges. He cried out to her, &quot;Don&#39;t leave me h=\r\nere, I must know who you are. I am confused about life and everything else&quot;=\r\n. As soon as he uttered these words, the room\n started reverberating with a=\r\n attahasa, though there was not a soul present there apart from him. A laug=\r\nhter so loud that he left his ear drums will split. He rushed out into the =\r\nrain to follow the moving figure of the Bhairavi. The faster he ran, the mo=\r\nre did the distance keep increasing between him and the Bhairavi. Then he c=\r\nould see clearly, the Bhairavi entering into the Ganges water, and kept mov=\r\ning deeper until she was drowned completely in the water. The author sat ne=\r\nar the banks, shouting out to her, asking her to come out and help him. But=\r\n there was no response. Just the regular lapping sound of waves hitting the=\r\n shore and a very dark night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He sat there ti=\r\nll sunrise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. Next morning he went and =\r\nasked around the village, but no one had seen the Bhairavi and neither was =\r\nthere any shop near the banks which sold food. Because of the heavy rains, =\r\neverything was shut down last night\n with not a soul in the open.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Years later, P went back home to his wife an=\r\nd son and lead a full and complete family life. I have merely narrated the =\r\nincident as it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Ra=\r\njarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;div class=3D=\r\n&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_109_133999228119169&quot;

After some time he took me to a quite corner and told me certa=\r\nin thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glow on his face and had c=\r\nertain powers about him I believed him. Later on he also gave me a Mantra o=\r\nf&nbsp;Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu left in the morning and I=\r\n never saw him again. Somehow the things he told me did not happen and this=\r\n tithi became very upsetting for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some years back here in London I was coming home in the af=\r\nternoon. I was in a crowded bus and holding on to railings.Suddenly I remem=\r\nberd that it was Tithi of Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. I started to recite He=\r\nr mantra&#92;name and try to meditate on Her in that crowded bus. I even smiled=\r\n myself on the strangeness of that situation. After few more minutes I reac=\r\nhed home and opened my front door and went inside. After going through my P=\r\nuja room and telling my mother that I was back, I flopped on sofa in front =\r\nroom which is very near to front gate. Then I heard some noises but I did n=\r\not get up and slept for nearly one hour. After I got up I got a srrong feel=\r\ning to open my front door although nobody had knocked. The whole area in fr=\r\nont of my house was covered in Police lines and tapes. I could not believe =\r\nit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I asked a polic=\r\neman who was near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were shooting at =\r\neach other and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day I was=\r\n clearly saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky sever=\r\nal minutes before the incident and I started Her prayers although there was=\r\n no reasons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time without knowing a sing=\r\nle thing as load of armed policemen were there after those gunman.and whole=\r\n noises and drama.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;What else is this but Personal G=\r\nrace of Bhagvati Sri&nbsp;Chinnmastaji&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;GoodLuck&nbsp; and Thanks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;LaxmiN=\r\narayan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;rom:&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT=\r\n:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; S=\r\naturday, 16 June 2012, 2:48&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject=\r\n:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material s=\r\nadhana&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, sans-s=\r\nerif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv675366316yui_3_2_0_18_133992468937247&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12p=\r\nt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv675366316&quot;&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND=\r\n-COLOR:#fff;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;COLOR:#000;FONT-SIZE:1=\r\n2pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aparna ji, a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; few of us whom you consider are blessed =\r\nwith the desire to pray her may definitely feel bad to read your mail. The =\r\nways of god are very mysterious and we humans especially in this yug have n=\r\no right to ask her ruling.
