But for whatever reason =\r\nin Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry that habit to other la=\r\nnguages as well and recently I heard one of the North Indian bhajan singers=\r\n (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govi=\r\nndam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which sounded quite odd to=\r\n me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj Bhasha and Avadhi a=\r\ns well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is more important than =\r\neven Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also without proper vowe=\r\nl endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that approach is incorrec=\r\nt. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana\n&gt; &gt; Saroja\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raja&quot; shou=\r\nld be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;.=\r\n You may shed more light on this aspect as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=\r\n=86&#39;=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC=C3=85=C2=A1=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4=\r\n/7/11, aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: =\r\naswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Common San=\r\nskrit Pronunciation Errors (Part 1)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, April 7, 2011, 11:34 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83=C6=92=C3=86&#39;=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC=C3=85=C2=A1=C3=83=C6=\r\n=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry a=\r\nnd just ignore this idiot!&quot;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear narasimha guruji \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing a great job to this universe by sharing your knwle=\r\ndge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and correcting,but you are tooooo humble!!!.Truth ia truth and =\r\nwhat ever you are saying is also truth .no need to consider yourself as an =\r\nidiot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.=\r\nR.

It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; It is my feeling that many people, including highly learned Vedic scho=\r\nlars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantras) in=\r\ncorrectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, pronunciation is not everything.=\r\n Having devotion and the spirit of surrender to god is even more important.=\r\n However, pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation =\r\nis very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can=\r\n stop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have=\r\n a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who=\r\n can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few=\r\n months, I will write my views on correct pronunciation and point out some =\r\ncommon errors. If you do not think that correct pronunciation is important =\r\nor if you disagree with my assessment of the errors or if you do not want t=\r\no change your pronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On =\r\nthe other hand, if you are open to changing your pronunciation, please give=\r\n a consideration to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find them appr=\r\nopriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound=\r\n at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat=\r\n&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. They cha=\r\nnge &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason=\r\n why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption nevertheles=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/s=\r\nyllable/akshara. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowe=\r\nl sound at the end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of a=\r\nksharas, changes the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still e=\r\nxperience something when meditating on the mantra, but you will never exper=\r\nience the mantra to the fullest with that pronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) =\r\nof an akshara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel after it, then =\r\nit has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example=\r\n, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot =\r\nsustain the sound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronoun=\r\nced. It has no life force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whol=\r\ne sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simp=\r\nly joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and =\r\nbecomes part of that akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter =\r\n(one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the li=\r\nstener to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is =\r\npossible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the =\r\nend is a very quick and abrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough =\r\nto hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes people add some vowel to i=\r\nt (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them)=\r\n so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It sudden=\r\nly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probab=\r\nly, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets=\r\n a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his students wo=\r\nuld not get confused when learning. Probably the students thought the mantr=\r\na was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciation. P=\r\nrobably, that became a standard practice after a couple of centuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change=\r\n it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and lea=\r\nve it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the end. The sam=\r\ne thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonants applies to all c=\r\nonsonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. There =\r\ncan be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people normally a=\r\ndd an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhandas an=\r\nd altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sound =\r\n&quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha=\r\n&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of =\r\ntha and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is different.=\r\n It is possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound because =\r\nof their inability to see the dot and others started following. Now pronoun=\r\ncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be the=\r\n odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never hav=\r\ne two different symbols for the same sound or two different sounds for the =\r\nsame symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are=\r\n different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper=\r\n) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha ka=\r\nama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attainin=\r\ng the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling dutie=\r\ns), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developi=\r\nng detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; =\r\nas &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;.=\r\n Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half =\r\na human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have se=\r\nen it committed by many many trained priests!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you=\r\n read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the difference =\r\nbetween &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. When you s=\r\nee &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure that you are=\r\n not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n There are several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people=\r\n in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slow=\r\nly in the next few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Please give me your consideration and take my input into considerati=\r\non in altering your pronunciation (if you are open to that).

It is indeed one o=\r\nf the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a consonant cannot exist by itself and =\r\nits life is given by the Vowel. But for whatever reason in Hindi they mostl=\r\ny avoid ending vowels. They carry that habit to other languages as well and=\r\n recently I heard one of the North Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the =\r\nname) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam=\r\n, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which sounded quite odd to me! And they take =\r\nthat approach to languages like Braj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instanc=\r\ne, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Rama=\r\nyana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also without proper vowel endings. However,=\r\n I have a strong feeling that, that approach is incorrect.\n In avadhi, a ch=\r\nowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Saroja&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raja=\r\n&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Gurucharan saroj=\r\n raj&quot;.

Having devotion and =\r\nthe spirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, pronunciati=\r\non is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is very important in =\r\nVeda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the mo=\r\nst complete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who =\r\ncan memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;experi=\r\nence&quot; a mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ov=\r\ner the next few months, I\n will write my views on correct pronunciation and=\r\n point out some common errors. If you do not think that correct pronunciati=\r\non is important or if you disagree with my assessment of the errors or if y=\r\nou do not want to change your pronunciation, please ignore my writings on t=\r\nhis subject. On the other hand, if you are open to changing your pronunciat=\r\nion, please give a consideration to my views and adopt my suggestions if yo=\r\nu find them appropriate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take =\r\nthe &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;,=\r\n &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrec=\r\ntly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. Ther=\r\ne is a reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruptio=\r\nn nevertheless.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In=\r\n &quot;prachodayaat&quot;,\n the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. If you c=\r\nhange it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at the end, it be=\r\ncomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the chha=\r\nndas and changes the meaning also. You may still experience something when =\r\nmeditating on the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra to the f=\r\nullest with that pronunciation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (l=\r\nife force) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel afte=\r\nr it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. =\r\nFor example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), =\r\nyou cannot sustain the sound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly =\r\nyou pronounced. It has no life force.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshar=\r\na. Because\n &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;ya=\r\na&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that akshar=\r\na. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru). When you pronou=\r\nnce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sure whe=\r\nther you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens car=\r\nefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abr=\r\nupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes people add some v=\r\nowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in betw=\r\neen them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audible. =\r\nIt suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started p=\r\nronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and become=\r\ns\n very clear to hear, so that his students would not get confused when lea=\r\nrning. Probably the students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;ya=\r\nat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a standa=\r\nrd practice after a couple of centuries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not=\r\n change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant =\r\nand leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the end. =\r\nThe same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonants applies to a=\r\nll consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. Th=\r\nere can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people normal=\r\nly add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the\n chhand=\r\nas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the soun=\r\nd &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;d=\r\nha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols o=\r\nf tha and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is differen=\r\nt. It is possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound becaus=\r\ne of their inability to see the dot and others started following. Now prono=\r\nuncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be t=\r\nhe odd person out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols for the same =\r\nsound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;d=\r\nha&quot; are different and their sounds are different too. Pronounce\n &quot;t&quot; (as in=\r\n &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;t=\r\nh&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha ka=\r\nama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attainin=\r\ng the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling dutie=\r\ns), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developi=\r\nng detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; =\r\nas &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;.=\r\n Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half =\r\na human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have se=\r\nen it committed by many many trained priests!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantr=\r\nas, pay attention to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and\n learn to p=\r\nronounce them differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay e=\r\nxtra attention to ensure that you are not confusing tha for dha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes (in my =\r\nview) commonly made by most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras=\r\n. I will be pointing them out slowly in the next few months, whenever the M=\r\nother allows me to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Please give me your consideration and take my input into consideration in=\r\n altering your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t find a=\r\nny sense in what I am saying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I=\r\n can understand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. Bu=\r\nt, because She inspired me to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessi=\r\nng that there are SOME who are destined to change their\n pronunciation base=\r\nd on my views. That is why I am writing these mails.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you do not like this discussion, I am=\r\n sorry and just ignore this idiot!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality:=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targ=\r\net=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.c=\r\nomcast.net/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.=\r\nnet&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software\n (Windows): &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow =\r\ntarget=3D_blank&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR clear=3Dall&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-- &lt;BR&gt;Tha=\r\nnks,&lt;BR&gt;Hari Sarma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tab=\r\nle&gt;\r\n--0-670852657-1302491107=:70467--\r\n\n"}}
