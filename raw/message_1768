Get=\r\n two to four bricks (concrete or regular). Arrange the bricks on the floor,=\r\n preferably on a 2ft by 2ft wooden plank wrapped with aluminium foil. Make =\r\nsure you spread out the bricks, do not put them closer. Put the hawan kund =\r\non the bricks and make sure the hawan kund is stable.\n&gt;      In the Mahagap=\r\nathi homam video at http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/ganapathi.htm, you=\r\n can see couple of concrete bricks underneath the hawan kund that were put =\r\non the floor. Wooden plank with aluminium foil helps in cleaning the mess a=\r\nfter every couple of weeks if you are doing homam daily.\n&gt;      You can get=\r\n a wooden spoon at a store like Walmart in US.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Ravi\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; __=\r\n______________________________\n&gt; From: Padmaja Bandaru &lt;padmajab@...&gt;\n&gt; To:=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 30, 2009 10:36:21 PM\n=\r\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Havan Kund\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Here=\r\n are the websites for agnihotra supplies \n&gt; http://www.agnihotr asupplies. =\r\ncom/\n&gt; http://www.homastore.com/\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Padmaja\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Th=\r\nu, 4/30/09, shankar789 &lt;shankar789@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: shankar=\r\n789 &lt;shankar789@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Havan Kund\n&gt; To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, April 30, 2009, 6:54 PM\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to purchase the havan kund from the=\r\n following online store, but they dont sell &#39;stand&#39; for keeping the havan k=\r\nund. \n&gt; \n&gt; I live in a rented apartment which has carpet floor.\n&gt; \n&gt; One su=\r\nggestion was to purchase a concrete slab from Home depot and place the hava=\r\nn kund. \n&gt; \n&gt; The online shop people also advised me that they would try to=\r\n get havan kund with stand, as a special case but it can take few months. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I am eager to find out how our US friends are performing homa in their=\r\n residences?\n&gt; \n&gt; Another point is that, these people do not sell wooden sp=\r\noons and they are offering copper spoons for ahuti.
