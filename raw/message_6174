The first fragments are o=\r\nnly slightly separated from the supreme consciousness, thus, the 27 deities=\r\n of the Nakshatras, has been talked about and worshipped in the Vedas more =\r\nthan the supreme consciosuness which cannot be described and discussed in a=\r\nny meaningful way anyways, except for the purposes of idling and endless ph=\r\nilosophizing.\n\n&gt; To the sage in the supreme state, that consciousness shine=\r\ns as one \n&gt; whole, not divided into parts.\n   Certainly, the sage is in sup=\r\nreme state of consciousness, because his consciousness is no more accessibl=\r\ne to any of his follower&#39;s petty ignorant minds and souls anymore, as it ha=\r\ns always existed as it is.\n   Sadly, though, like master like follower cann=\r\not be applied to the Sage in his supreme state of consciousness, so the fol=\r\nlowers keep repeating like their master that everybody else is ignorant.\n  =\r\n On a positive note, that leaves a lot of room for us ignorant people , to =\r\nworship god in one of his 27 manifestations mentioned in Vedas and do away =\r\nwith Vedanta completely.\n\n   How fortunate are we ? While no body alive can=\r\n extend the knowledge conveyed in Vedas because they are not written by hum=\r\nan-beings like the Sage himself, there is no end to Vedanta which sees all =\r\nsorts of additions, versions and interpretations of experiential knowledge.=\r\n Thankfully, all the boring vedantists have left the world without trying t=\r\no manipulate Vedas so that we may peacefully and practically follow Vedas.\n=\r\n\nRegards,\nAryama\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Prasanth Jalasutram=\r\n &lt;jvrsprasanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  373 One self-shining consciousness, indepen=\r\ndent of all else, which is the\n&gt; real Self, is alone real. There is no othe=\r\nr consciousness. Therefore, this\n&gt; soul is not consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt; 374 But =\r\nthe soul is taken as being conscious, due to the admixture of the\n&gt; conscio=\r\nusness of the real Self. Therefore Vedantins call this unreal soul\n&gt; =E2=80=\r\n=98the illusory consciousness=E2=80=99.\n&gt; \n&gt; 375 Just as someone, coming in=\r\n uninvited at a marriage, claiming to be a\n&gt; comrade of the bridegroom, obt=\r\nains an honourable reception from the bride=E2=80=99s\n&gt; family, so this sou=\r\nl is accepted at its face value by the ignorant.\n&gt; \n&gt; 376 The pretend bride=\r\ngroom=E2=80=99s comrade runs away of his own accord as soon as\n&gt; an enquiry=\r\n is started by the bride=E2=80=99s party, questioning =E2=80=98Who is he? W=\r\nhence\n&gt; did he come?=E2=80=99 In the same way, this soul flees of his own a=\r\nccord when an\n&gt; enquiry is made as to who he is, or whence he has come.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 377 This soul has really no form of its own. It is like a ghost haunting =\r\na\n&gt; house, this body. Therefore, [our] Guru says that it [the soul] is just=\r\n a\n&gt; ghost appointed to guard the body.\n&gt; \n&gt; 378 Bhagavan, our Guru, makes =\r\nclear the unreality of this soul, saying that\n&gt; when the supreme state is w=\r\non by the quest [of the Self], there is no form\n&gt; of this soul found surviv=\r\ning.\n&gt; \n&gt; 379 The first thought of the mind is this ego-sense. From it aris=\r\ne all other\n&gt; thoughts. Hence this soul is itself mind, the subtle body, th=\r\ne world,\n&gt; worldly life, and bondage =E2=80&quot; nothing else.\n&gt; \n&gt; 380 Both bo=\r\nndage and the bound one are only this soul. There is no other who\n&gt; can be =\r\nsaid to be bound. The real Self is ever-free, and the sole reality.\n&gt; How c=\r\nan it be said that he became bound?\n&gt; \n&gt; 381 As soon as this one named =E2=\r\n=80=98I=E2=80=99 is born, there is born also along with it\n&gt; the whole worl=\r\nd. When it becomes latent, the world also vanishes. Hence the\n&gt; world is sa=\r\nid to be its form.\n&gt; \n&gt; 382 Though this great being, the real Self, is dear=\r\nest to all and of great\n&gt; splendour, it does not shine unmistakably, for it=\r\ns light appears to be\n&gt; stolen by this evil one who has the form of the ego=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; 383 Though unreal, this one named jiva [individual self] covers up t=\r\nhe truth\n&gt; of the Self. So, the Self, being wrongly conceived through a var=\r\niety of\n&gt; false imaginations, is as good as lost for the ignorant man.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 384 The mass of clouds, generated by the light of the sun, conceals the fo=\r\nrm\n&gt; of the sun. In the same way, this jiva, born as it is by the light of\n=\r\n&gt; consciousness of the Self, conceals the Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; This explains why the =\r\nreal Self remains unknown.\n&gt; \n&gt; 385 Revelation accuses him, who by his ego-=\r\nsense has stolen the real Self,\n&gt; and who suffers for that sin, saying: =E2=\r\n=80=98What sin is there that has not been\n&gt; committed by that thief of the =\r\nSelf?=E2=80=99\n&gt; \n&gt; 386 The Master says =E2=80=98original sin=E2=80=99, aff=\r\nirmed to be the cause of death by the\n&gt; Christians, is not an act done by t=\r\nhe first man, but only the sense =E2=80=98I am\n&gt; the body=E2=80=99.\n&gt; \n&gt; 38=\r\n7 This sin is said to pertain to man, but men are not men in deep sleep.\n&gt; =\r\nThe sense of being a man is due to the identification of oneself with the\n&gt;=\r\n body. Consequently, the original sin is only this identification of onesel=\r\nf\n&gt; as the body.\n&gt; \n&gt; 388 All loss, all vice, and all suffering are only du=\r\ne to the sense of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.\n&gt; All gain, all virtue and all happi=\r\nness come from the extinction of the ego.\n&gt; \n&gt; 389 To the ignorant one the =\r\nSelf is lost on account of his ego sense.\n&gt; Therefore, even if he gains all=\r\n things, he is still poor. On the other hand\n&gt; the sage, who has gained his=\r\n Self by the extinction of the ego, sees nothing\n&gt; else to be gained.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nNow the question whether there are many selves is considered.\n&gt; \n&gt; 390 Thos=\r\ne who think that the body is real and consequently come to believe\n&gt; that t=\r\nhe soul itself is the real Self, affirm the plurality of selves,\n&gt; misconce=\r\niving the meaning of the texts of the Vedanta.\n&gt; \n&gt; 391 Deluded men who hav=\r\ne not heard the truth of the supreme state argue in\n&gt; vain, saying that if =\r\nthere is only one Self, then there is a dilemma: either\n&gt; by the deliveranc=\r\ne of one all will be delivered, or none will attain\n&gt; deliverance.\n&gt; \n&gt; 392=\r\n There is no objection to jivas being conceived as many, but the view of\n&gt; =\r\nthe plurality of the real Self is unacceptable. The jivas are many and\n&gt; un=\r\nreal, but the Self is real, auspicious and only one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of those tha=\r\nt affirm the manyness of the Self also say that the selves\n&gt; (jivas) are fr=\r\nactions of the Supreme Being, the Self of all. This is next\n&gt; dealt with.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 393 There are no real fragments of the one supreme consciousness. The\n&gt;=\r\n fragments appear only because of ignorance. To the sage in the supreme\n&gt; s=\r\ntate, that consciousness shines as one whole, not divided into parts.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe experience of the sage is conclusive on all points. Here is given an\n&gt; =\r\nutterance of Bhagavan on this point.\n&gt; \n&gt; 394 Consciousness is one, omnipre=\r\nsent and equal. Its unequal distribution is\n&gt; only an illusion. And because=\r\n space is unreal, its equal distribution is\n&gt; also unreal.\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=98On=\r\ne consciousness, equally distributed everywhere; you through illusion\n&gt; giv=\r\ne it unequal distribution; no distribution, no everywhere=E2=80=9D. These w=\r\nere\n&gt; the words uttered by Bhagavan to an earnest American sadhaka, Mr Hagu=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; It should be remembered that the supreme reality which is the Self =\r\nhas three\n&gt; unique names, namely sat, chit and ananda, and is referred to b=\r\ny one, or\n&gt; two, or all the three names together. These names, it is explai=\r\nned by\n&gt; Bhagavan, must be understood as denying their opposites, and not g=\r\niving a\n&gt; positive description of the indescribable. Thus, sat means not as=\r\nat\n&gt; (non-being); chit means not achit (unconsciousness); and ananda means =\r\nnot\n&gt; unhappiness.\n&gt; \n&gt; 395 It has been clearly taught by the Master that t=\r\nhe supreme consciousness\n&gt; remains whole, not divided into parts. Let disci=\r\nples of non-sages be\n&gt; deluded. How can there be delusion for us on this po=\r\nint?\n&gt; \n&gt; 396 Since it is settled that the one named jiva does not exist, h=\r\now can we\n&gt; think of its bondage or deliverance? There is neither bondage n=\r\nor\n&gt; deliverance for the real Self, who remains unswervingly whole and soli=\r\ntary.\n&gt; \n&gt; This point will be dealt with later.\n&gt; \n&gt; 397 The soul comes to =\r\nbe taken as real by the failure to discriminate\n&gt; rightly. This occurs when=\r\n there is false identification between the body,\n&gt; which is limited in spac=\r\ne and time, and the Self, which is only\n&gt; consciousness, unlimited by space=\r\n and time.\n&gt; \n&gt; 398 First one assumes that one particular body is =E2=80=98=\r\nI=E2=80=99. Then one assumes that\n&gt; the body is real. Once this happens, th=\r\ne ignorant man sees other bodies as\n&gt; being real, and sees different jivas =\r\nin them.\n&gt; \n&gt; 399 The one real Self, being really undivided, is taken as be=\r\ning divided\n&gt; into parts in many bodies, which are all unreal. The ignorant=\r\n one looks upon\n&gt; that whole, formless Self as having form and therefore al=\r\nso as being many.\n&gt; \n&gt; 400 As a seer of a cinema-show, seeing a new picture=\r\n every moment, thinks\n&gt; them all to be one, so the ignorant man seeing a ne=\r\nw body every moment,\n&gt; thinks that all of them are one and the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nn a cinema-show there is a long roll of small pictures that pass\n&gt; successi=\r\nvely at a rapid rate between the light inside and the magnifying\n&gt; lens, ab=\r\nout thirty-two pictures being thus projected on the screen\n&gt; successively e=\r\nach second. But the seer thinks he is seeing one single\n&gt; picture all the t=\r\nime, but one that is slowly changing. The world picture is\n&gt; also made up o=\r\nf a successive stream of separate pictures on the retina\n&gt; inside the eye; =\r\nbut people think it is all one continuous spectacle.\n&gt; \n&gt; 401 All the time,=\r\n at every moment, his mind is imagining a new soul in a new\n&gt; body. Hence, =\r\nthe sages say that this soul is both momentary and unreal.\n&gt; \n&gt; 402 The man=\r\n who has not experienced his own real Self, thinking =E2=80=98I am this\n&gt; b=\r\nody=E2=80=99, sees himself as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, the first person of gram=\r\nmar. He sees another\n&gt; person whom he calls =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99, and refe=\r\nrs to third persons as =E2=80=98he=E2=80=99.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus the one real Self be=\r\ncomes =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in one body, =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99 in another bod=\r\ny and\n&gt; =E2=80=98he=E2=80=99 in a third body. It follows that these distinc=\r\ntions arise from the\n&gt; primary ignorance.\n&gt; \n&gt; 403 These three distinct per=\r\nsons are not real. They are seen on account of\n&gt; the false notion =E2=80=98=\r\nI am the body=E2=80=99. When the ego-soul is lost as a result of\n&gt; the ques=\r\nt of the real Self, only that Self, consciousness alone, will shine.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4=\r\n04 To one who thinks himself to be a jiva or a body, a plurality of jivas\n&gt;=\r\n will appear. But to the sage who is freed from this ignorance, no jiva wil=\r\nl\n&gt; appear.\n&gt; This is next illustrated by the simile of the cinema show.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; 405 On the lighted screen there pass women and men in great number, who =\r\nare\n&gt; only pictures. So too on the screen of consciousness, which is the re=\r\nal\n&gt; Self, there pass a great many souls, who are only mental projections.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 406 The lighted screen is similar to the Self, and the pictures projec=\r\nted\n&gt; onto it are like the jivas. The appearance of a plurality of jivas do=\r\nes not\n&gt; affect the final truth of experience, the oneness of the Self.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 407 A person believes in the plurality of jivas by believing that the jiv=\r\na\n&gt; is the real Self. He does not know the experience of the real Self beca=\r\nuse\n&gt; he has been misled by his belief in multiplicity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another simile=\r\n is next employed to clarify this truth, the plurality of\n&gt; reflections of =\r\na single object.\n&gt; \n&gt; 408 In the waters of separate vessels there appear ma=\r\nny different images of\n&gt; the one moon. Similarly, in the minds that inhabit=\r\n bodies there appear many\n&gt; jivas, which are only reflected images of the o=\r\nne real Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; 409 As the real moon is only one, so the real Self is on=\r\nly one. As there are\n&gt; many reflections of the moon, so there are seen a gr=\r\neat many jivas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now the riddle of deliverance is solved.\n&gt; \n&gt; 410 When=\r\n one reflected image of the moon is lost, the other images go on\n&gt; appearin=\r\ng as before. Similarly, when one pseudo-consciousness dies, the\n&gt; others co=\r\nntinue to appear as before, even though they are unreal.\n&gt; \n&gt; 411 Whoever o=\r\nbtains awareness of the real Self, for him this worldly life\n&gt; comes to an =\r\nend. The others continue to wander here as before, remaining\n&gt; without awar=\r\neness of the real Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; 412 This illustration has been vouchsafed by s=\r\nages to men of immature minds,\n&gt; who have false knowledge. But this discuss=\r\nion can have no meaning at all for\n&gt; those who realise the unreality of the=\r\n individual soul.\n&gt; \n&gt; 413 In dreams a multitude of jivas created by mental=\r\n delusion appear. In\n&gt; just the same way, a multitude of these jivas appear=\r\n in the waking state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_in=\r\ntro.shtml\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =E0=B0&quot;=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=\r\n=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
