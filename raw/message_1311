See, Narasimha h=\r\nas cautioned \nmembers about the un-burnt material offered as Aahuti. I am s=\r\nure \npeople doing Homam will be cautious about that and it is equally \nposs=\r\nible that many will be *Over cautious* about that. The danger \nhere is that=\r\n the attention is diverted to un-burnt Aahuti and NOT to \nthe invoked deity=\r\n and what motive behind that is our SELFISHNESS. \nBecause we are scared of =\r\nfacing any unpleasant fruits of our \nsurfaced karma, we even forget the lor=\r\nd for who we are doing the \nwhole ritual. Major part of my Aahuti is White =\r\nTil, and i see some \nof them burst during burning and come out of Homa Kund=\r\nam. Initially \ni was little distracted worrying about the Un-burnt Aahuti i=\r\nssue but \ni stopped worrying about that after a couple of Homa. However it =\r\nis \nimportant that one learn quickly to optimize the *type* & *quantity* \no=\r\nf Aahuti offered depending upon the capacity of Agni. This is not \ndifficul=\r\nt and within a couple of Homa, one can easily adjust to it \nand then distra=\r\nction is removed. \n\nBy the way, please note my experience, whenever i have =\r\nstarted \nreciting Chandi Paath and Now Homam, My relation with some of the =\r\n\nclose colleagues are becoming tensed for no fault of mine \n(Honestly). My =\r\nonly fault was that earlier i happily accepted their \nmisbehavior and pampe=\r\nred their ego in effort to reduce my `I&#39; ness.  \nNow i have decided not fee=\r\nd their ego and selfishness and changed to \nlittle bit offensive mode.\n\nI w=\r\nonder (though it is very painful) if this is mother&#39;s way of \nremoving some=\r\n unwanted & harmful bondage!!!\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;arunishasengupta&quot; \n&lt;arunishasengupta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dea=\r\nr PVR Sir,\n&gt; \n&gt; I had read on this before through your correspondences and =\r\nhave \nbeen \n&gt; adviced as well on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; This happened to me today...I h=\r\nad some offerings...especially a \n&gt; large chunk of wood that did not burn i=\r\nn the last homa that I did. \n&gt; Further to which I had some troubles which w=\r\nere emotionally \n&gt; disturbing. Considering your reflections on the same, I =\r\nwas \nsanguine \n&gt; that may be those emotional disturbances were a result of =\r\ncertain \n&gt; karmas accelerating and arriving before time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hence i was a=\r\n little scared and tensed...and what was on priority \n&gt; today while doing t=\r\nhe homa was to burn those unburnt portions. \n&gt; Interestingly...I sat to do =\r\nthe homa...did my sankalpa...ahutis \n&gt; started and all that...when i heard =\r\nthis distinct voice \n&gt; (admonishingly)from within me (i guess) which said &quot;=\r\nyour priority \nis \n&gt; not me...but burning off that piece of wood?&quot;. Now thi=\r\ns was \n&gt; something that embarassed me to the core...\n&gt; \n&gt; I said sorry...an=\r\nd went on to concentrate on the task at \n&gt; hand...though could not fully co=\r\nncentrate partly because i was \nstill \n&gt; apprehensive of the offerings were=\r\n properly burning or not and \n&gt; partly because I was still reeling from emb=\r\narassment.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is what I wanted to share with you and also the member=\r\ns of \nthe \n&gt; forum\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Arunisha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
