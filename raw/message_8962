Hope members of the forum would be h=\r\nelpful and share their views. Here are few questions I have with Chandi pat=\r\nh/homam\n(1) I read in Vedavani Saptashati book about Pallav, Yojana and Sam=\r\nputa Chandi path. For Samputa patha, they mention to chant a verse before a=\r\nnd after of each verse, so we have 700(700)700 =96 2100 total verse to chan=\r\nt. Did I get it right here? any other opinion?\n(2) In the parivar devata aa=\r\nhuti and Saptashati mahayantra (6th circle), we have 24 devatas [Vishnumaya=\r\n=85=85.Chiti], however, the  5th chapter of Saptashati,  Dhruti and Pushti =\r\nare missing, wonder why. I tend to include them when I do stuthi mantra alo=\r\nne in the same order as in 6th circle of mahayantra.\n(3) Narasimha Ji, I re=\r\nad that Swami Sathasivom did 1,000 Chandi homas during a 3-month period. I =\r\nwas curious to know how was his day to day conduct. Not that I can think of=\r\n 100day at stretch but could help for 3 or 5 days. What I would like to kno=\r\nw, what and how much he ate during this period, at what times of day, how m=\r\nuch water one can drink. Was he sitting whole day at stretch for 10 homams =\r\nor did 5+5 homam morning evening? Any detailed info I guess would be helpfu=\r\nl for all here.\nThanking you,\nDigamber\n\n\n\n"}}
