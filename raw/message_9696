Rao\nSent: =\r\n30 August 2013 18:27\nTo: Vedic Wisdom\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Panchajanya S=\r\nankha Story\n\n  \n\nFor the benefit of those who are not on facebook, I am rep=\r\nroducing something interesting.\n \n\nFrom Arunisha&#39;s facebook wall:\n \nThey sa=\r\ny our Lord was a meek, humble and obedient student of Rishi Sandipani. He n=\r\never shirked his chores and who inspired his classmates with great love. He=\r\n had a wonderful memory and matchless strength. When his studies were compl=\r\neted, it was time to give his teacher gurudakshina. Divining hidden sorrow =\r\nin Sandipani, he asked him what he would like. Wistfully, the sage asked if=\r\n Krishna could possibly trace his son, kidnapped long ago by a sea monster =\r\ncalled Panchajana. Straightaway, our Lord plumbed the depths of the ocean w=\r\nhere he fought and vanquished the beast. Rescuing his guru=E2=80=99s son, h=\r\ne ground the monster=E2=80=99s bones and fashioned a fearful conch, the Paa=\r\nnchajanya=E2=80=94=E2=80=98derived from Panchajana=E2=80=99=E2=80=94 whose =\r\nsound thereafter struck raw terror in the hearts of evildoers.\n \nMy respons=\r\ne:\n \nMetaphorically, Krishna represents the dark & mysterious entity of a p=\r\nerfected mind. Sandipani means &quot;nice kindling&quot;. A perfected mind is all-kno=\r\nwing and all-capable and just needs some kindling of spirit to get going.\n =\r\n\nFrom the kindling of spirit comes a charming sense of well-being (Madhuman=\r\ngala, son of Sandipani). This charming sense of well-being coming from the =\r\nkindling of spirit may be trapped by an attachment to material world. The d=\r\nemon (tamas) Panchajana (5 beings) represent tamasik attachment to 5 elemen=\r\nts. He lives deep inside the ocean (samsara!).\n \nPerfected mind can rescue =\r\nthis sense of well-being from the clutches of tamasik attachment to the mat=\r\nerial world and converts the 5 elements from a tamasik attachment (demon) t=\r\no a conch (a call for dharmik action). This world made of pancha mahabhutas=\r\n is not for enjoyment and attachment, but for engaging in dharmik actions.\n=\r\n \nMy 2 cents. Sorry if I took away some fun from the beautiful story! :-)\n =\r\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt; \n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
