I told h=\r\nim that i \ntry to follow conventional instructions given in the book i.e 13=\r\n \nchapters with Kavach,Argala, Kilak,Devi & Ratri Sukta, Nyas, 3 \nrasyas an=\r\nd Kshma Prarthana at the end.\n\nHe told me that he only reads Kavach, Nyasa =\r\netc... at the begining \nand then continues reciting 13 chapters every day. =\r\nTHE IMPORTANT \nthing here is that He only indicated me his way of recitatio=\r\nn, he \nNEVER asked me to do the same way or change the conventional way.\n\nI=\r\n need to give one background. for many years i wonder about \n*Mahatmya* in =\r\nmany fo our spiriual books. take for instance Gita. it \nis indicated that G=\r\nita Mahatmya must be recited whenever Gita is \nrecited and without that it&#39;=\r\nll not be complete. Ganapati \nAtharvashirsh also has added protion of the s=\r\name. Durga Saptashati \nalso says that if you don&#39;t recite this, this & this=\r\n then the whole \nchandi paath is like fruitless.\n\ni am not able to reconcil=\r\ne with all these. IT gives a impression of \ninjecting Fear. It is simply Do=\r\ngmatic. If you don&#39;t do this then \nyour efforts are wasted but if you do th=\r\nis along with the main thing \nthen it&#39;ll bring Laddu, Peda, Luxuries, enjoy=\r\nment of Swarga and even \nliberation.\n\nI am at loss to understand these extr=\r\na things. it seems to me that \nit is a Ancient days Marketing gimmick added=\r\n NOT by the original \nauthor but some others at later stages. it is quite p=\r\nossible that it \nwas introduced everywhere out of good intentions to make p=\r\neople \nrecite it and get benefited. BUT these things have a danger of \ncrea=\r\nting religious Fanatics.\n \nDue to the above written feelings, i welcomed th=\r\ne way of the head \npriest and now i too recite the 13 chapters of Chandi Pa=\r\nath since \nlast few recitation. my intentions are to avoid all the added th=\r\nings \nwhich glorifies the Fruits (Tempts us with Great Fruits or \nIntimadat=\r\ne with bad results)\n\ni think it was off the track.\n\nbefore i finish, must s=\r\nay that the sounds with which i do are Aim, \nHreem, Kleem \n\nYours,\n\nutpal\n\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ashwin Rawal &lt;ashwinrawal@...&gt; \nwrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narsimhaji\n&gt; 1.Since=C2=A0I have joined this group before some c=\r\nouple of months, \nsome previous mails I have not read.

However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me=\r\n until much \nlater. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really nee=\r\nded to \ndo homam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to him=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked \nit.=\r\n I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily \nfor a fe=\r\nw months, I finally got down to the original task - teaching \nNarayan. I ch=\r\nose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In \nhindsight, I made the =\r\ncorrect choice, as many people in addition to \nNarayan are able to do homam=\r\n using the manual now! I and many other \npeople have benefited (and will be=\r\nnefit). However, as far as my mind \nconcerned, all this started for Narayan=\r\n! When it was time for \nNarayan to start doing homam, many people across th=\r\ne world started \nwith him. What a fortunate soul..\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; It was p=\r\nrobably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the \nonset itself what =\r\nthe Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental \nstate would&#39;ve been dif=\r\nferent while working on the manual. I \nwould&#39;ve been more egoistic and also=\r\n hurried more. Because the only \nthing I was told was to teach Narayan, I t=\r\nook my sweet time, arrived \nat the correct balance and also wrote it down w=\r\nithout many \npretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and=\r\n I \nreally benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, \nit =\r\nwould have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would \nnot have =\r\nhad made the same progress I made, while preparing myself \nto teach homam t=\r\no Narayan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish told me the full story only when I was better prepar=\r\ned to \nhandle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of =\r\n\nthe manual as asked by him then.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; A good guru protects a si=\r\nshya from unnecessary information that \ncan wreak havoc with the ego. I rem=\r\nember another incident.\n&gt; \n&gt; One day in the spring of the same year, I deci=\r\nded to spend a whole \nday meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming =\r\nweekend. The \ninspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on =\r\nto it. \nWhen I told Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I \nsta=\r\nrted before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 \nbreaks of 2 m=\r\nin, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch \nand another 10 min b=\r\nreak for another bath at dusk, I was basically \nsitting in the same place a=\r\nnd meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was \na very good experience. I was in=\r\n a very nice state at the end of the \nday.\n&gt; \n&gt; I noticed on the next day t=\r\nhat the previous day was Akshaya \nTriteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is=\r\n considered a very \nauspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhan=\r\na on that day \nis 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had=\r\n not \nnoticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was \nexc=\r\nited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days \nlater, he=\r\n said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell \nyou because kno=\r\nwing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been \nexcited at doing the =\r\nsadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement \nwould&#39;ve changed the menta=\r\nl focus and brought more rajas into the \nsadhana.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was absolutely r=\r\night. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a \nsadhana. The ego and pride br=\r\nought rajas and limited the mental \nfocus on the mantra. If I was aware tha=\r\nt I was doing this sadhana on \na powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pr=\r\nide and excitement, \nbrought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on man=\r\ntra further. \nEgo is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellen=\r\nt \nprogress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing \nManis=\r\nh&#39;s words, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive \nand kickin=\r\ng and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious \nfood!\n&gt; \n&gt; Lucky=\r\n are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what \nis useful rath=\r\ner than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a \nguru (or someone else=\r\n) who can go to the heart of their problem and \npoint it out, so that they =\r\ncan weed it out through further \nintrospection and weaken it through consci=\r\nous effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I remember one more similar incident. Before th=\r\ne shata chandi \nhomam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a=\r\n Siddha \n(a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned th=\r\ne \nname of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and \ntha=\r\nt I would do some important work in this birth.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I saw Manish late=\r\nr that day, I mentioned this to him. He \nimmediately became serious and sai=\r\nd &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more \nidentity? Your ego is already strong wi=\r\nth the identity \nof &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the \nast=\r\nrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual \nseeker&#39; etc=\r\n. It will take great effort to overcome those identities \nand find True Sel=\r\nf. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you \nreally need yet another =\r\nnew identity to feed your ego further? See, \nwhat he said may very well be =\r\ncorrect. But it is not useful for your \nprogress. You have to rise above al=\r\nl identities.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; How true and wise!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as a fat and mi=\r\nghty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and \nget all the food given by th=\r\ne master, ahamkara (ego or the sense \nof &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spiri=\r\nt of detachment and gets all \nthe energy possible. Just as a good master ma=\r\ny chain the fat dog and \nfeed the lean dog specially, we too must conscious=\r\nly try to restrain \nego and increase detachment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish has a unique w=\r\nay of looking at things and some simple \npoints he made brought so much cla=\r\nrity to my thinking and sped up my \nspiritual evolution in this life. Even =\r\nwithout giving any specific \nmantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he=\r\n lit the lamp of \nknowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light we=\r\nre already \nthere and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blockin=\r\ng the \nlight. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick \nla=\r\nyer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that \nencloses the l=\r\namp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may \nbe too caught up to=\r\n notice that dirt ourselves..\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Homam and other spiritual sad=\r\nhana tools are very helpful. But one \nshould also try to introspect and cha=\r\nnge one&#39;s thinking, on an \nongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most =\r\npeople, this does \nnot take just a single moment or day or month or year. I=\r\nt CAN take a \nlong time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on =\r\nthe \npath and not worry about the progress and the distance left. One who \n=\r\nkeeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.\n&gt; \n&gt; The point I wa=\r\nnt to emphasize is that the external rituals (like \nhomam) and the internal=\r\n introspection (to change attitude) should go \nhand in hand. After a while,=\r\n there will be synergy between them and \nthey will start to work together v=\r\nery effectively.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comc=\r\nast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; -----=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- naara=\r\nayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSome ramblings ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anythin=\r\ng similar to it), \nit\n&gt; &gt; happens with all beginners and its only practice =\r\nwhich makes one\n&gt; &gt; perfect.

Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along=\r\n \nwith\n&gt; &gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best path for \nmo=\r\nst. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru wh=\r\nom \nI also\n&gt; &gt; consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shat=\r\na \nChandi\n&gt; &gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really \nj=\r\noking!\n&gt; &gt; When I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded me. \n=\r\nIt then\n&gt; &gt; occured to me he was really being serious. So, I started \nsearc=\r\nhing on\n&gt; &gt; the net and I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless =\r\nI \ntook\n&gt; &gt; it up and performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; reminded me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was \nentirel=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish \nbetween=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around this time, Narasimha \noccasionally=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; performed a longer version of the homam and I particpated in it, \nbut\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide me, which \nhe\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n did, but still it did not get through my really dense brains :). \nI\n&gt; &gt; fe=\r\nlt really helpless, but the stars were such that I never gave \nup,\n&gt; &gt; inst=\r\nead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he \nreally\n&gt; &gt; intends=\r\n that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show me \nthe\n&gt; &gt; way. In ar=\r\nound two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has \ndecided\n&gt; &gt; to document=\r\n the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just \ncouldnt\n&gt; &gt; believe my luc=\r\nk and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for \nhis\n&gt; &gt; grace. Well ... i=\r\nts been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking\n&gt; &gt; baby-steps and making =\r\nprogress everyday.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the div=\r\nine forces for \nhelping\n&gt; &gt; me progress.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My request, pls dont give=\r\n it up, persist with it no matter what. \nWe\n&gt; &gt; are humans and prone to mis=\r\ntakes. But then nobody got perfect \nthe very\n&gt; &gt; first time, unless he has =\r\nworked on it a lot in his previous \nlives.\n&gt; &gt; Its all a continuum. Dont wo=\r\nrry about time, we have future \nlives ...\n&gt; &gt; plenty of time. These things =\r\ntake their own sweet time, doesnt \nhappen\n&gt; &gt; overnight. No matter what, co=\r\nmplete your homa everyday, that \nshould be\n&gt; &gt; the primary goal ... nothing=\r\n else. Pls dont waver from it, \nwhether you\n&gt; &gt; get or dont get anything. S=\r\nlowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana \nand\n&gt; &gt; move on to higher things. I wi=\r\nsh all the best.

Should he abandon the \nproject \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or atleast carry th=\r\ne remaining milk to the destination?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; As Narayan said, fire going away can signal the bhutagni \nbeing weak.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, one is better off ignoring those things and not \nthinkin=\r\ng too \n&gt; &gt; &gt; much about the significance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend doing homam without worrying about how well or \nbadly it=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; went and what results it brought. Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sa=\r\ndhana you do and your other activities are your way to serve \nyour \n&gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\naster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many b=\r\nig checks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail=\r\n \nothers. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to t=\r\nhe \nbank and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anyt=\r\nhing in \nthis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s=\r\n agenda \nin this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu h=\r\nimself) and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now and t=\r\nhen. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through various physica=\r\nl \npersons \n&gt; &gt; &gt; present on earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other =\r\nspiritual sadhana, purify ourselves \nand try \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to help others, because=\r\n that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant \ncarries \n&gt; &gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to t=\r\nhe bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded =\r\nby others as good work tends to \npromote ego \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and we need to guard ag=\r\nainst it. A servant carrying a million \ndollar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; check to the bank and=\r\n cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to th=\r\ne bank and cashing it. Both are \nmerely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work an=\r\nd do not own anything. Both are \njust \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the mast=\r\ner to carry out his agenda. \nSimilarly, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one who does what are consid=\r\nered great deeds in this world and \none \n&gt; &gt; &gt; who does what are considered=\r\n meagre deeds in this world are \nboth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; servants of god helping god ex=\r\necute god&#39;s agenda in this \nworld. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One=\r\n may consider oneself \nsuperior to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds a=\r\nre considered superior by the \nworld, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish =\r\nas a servant who considers \n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another serva=\r\nnt carrying something \nless \n&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If this attit=\r\nude of being a servant of god fully penetrates \none&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attitude, thin=\r\nking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; situations his previo=\r\nus karmas place one in. One can remain \nhappy and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; blissful in pleasu=\r\nre and pain, in praise and criticism and in \nlight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and darkness.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It \ni=\r\ns a job \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own =\r\n\nnothing. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You are doing it for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------\n- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ \nhomam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rol=\r\noger.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.com=\r\ncast. \nnet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \nro=\r\nloger.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \n=\r\nnath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---\n- - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajar=\r\nshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursd=\r\nay, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regardin=\r\ng Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Re=\r\nading your response another question came into my mind. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You said:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not good that the fire gets exti=\r\nnguished by rain, or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; regularly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extin=\r\nguished while the homa is still on..happened with me \ncouple of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time=\r\ns... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one \nmember \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in=\r\n this list had suggested to me, i relight the fire and keep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; continui=\r\nng with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - =\r\nShiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sub=\r\nject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@ &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; N=\r\namaste Phani,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top o=\r\nf a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; floors) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging=\r\n red bricks, with sand base be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper on=\r\ne?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open i=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize \nthat a=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect \nthe fi=\r\nre \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire \nis=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes=\r\n, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the bottom=\r\n. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the=\r\n Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; man=\r\ntras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mentall=\r\ny while listening attentively (not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even listeni=\r\nng to mantras with all the \nattention \n&gt; &gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as sayi=\r\nng mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thin=\r\nking of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listeni=\r\nng \nto it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then =\r\nthe \nmantra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit=\r\n from \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind=\r\n&quot;.. \nOne can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. Th=\r\ne key \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the =\r\n\nmantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between meditation=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation \n=\r\nand it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So \nmak=\r\ning some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed t=\r\no \nsilent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditi=\r\nons/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain =\r\nfood?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremon=\r\ny) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is \nirrelevant.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stri=\r\nctly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food \non the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; da=\r\ny of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; recomme=\r\nnd is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before \nhomam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam for s=\r\npiritual progress, I am willing to take \nresponsibility and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; allow th=\r\nem to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru \nas guru \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and p=\r\nerform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred \nin the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pro=\r\ncess until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of \npurity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thr=\r\nough homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or \nno \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sacre=\r\nd thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not \nmatter \n&gt; &gt; &gt; after=\r\n a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; goal =\r\nof upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed \nthis up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As long =\r\nas one desires no specific material benefits (and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ready to receive w=\r\nhatever god gives) and does homam for \nspiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; progress, I am will=\r\ning to help, even if it means some \nsuffering for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; M=\r\nentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nraveled together to several places (on a specific project). \nWe ended \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we \nwere). \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. \nAs \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; seriou=\r\nsly. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rooftop =\r\nof the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. \nManish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me,=\r\n &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city \nafter \n&gt; &gt; &gt; our hom=\r\nam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did rain a=\r\ns soon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it sudde=\r\nnly started \nraining \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a sma=\r\nll \ntowel/blanket on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it o=\r\nn top of the \ntwo small \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. =\r\nWe held the cloth \ncover \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two ho=\r\nma kundas went off \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We lef=\r\nt for Kurukshetra \nlater \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rai=\r\nn continued for a \nfew days \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us =\r\non that trip as we \ncovered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. It ra=\r\nined in every place we \nwent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that pla=\r\nce and prepared to move \non.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rolog=\r\ner.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastr=\r\no. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Phanikum=\r\nar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nave few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam =\r\nbe performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; floors) ?
