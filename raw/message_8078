For\nimperfect beings,=A0the amoun=\r\nt of time that we *regularly* spend in\nfront of the sacred fire matters. Th=\r\ne size of the fire and=A0the\nmaterials we offer do matter. By spending incr=\r\neasing amounts of time\nin front of a bigger fire, concentration and belief =\r\nwill increase. As\na result, shorter times will be more effective in the fut=\r\nure. The\nheart of a bhaktiless person will melt, and wisdom will dawn on a\n=\r\nfool. Slowly, but surely.\n\nSpend as much time as you can afford, offering m=\r\naterials within your\nfinancial constraints, to the biggest fire that you ca=\r\nn safely manage\nin your living space. For most of us,=A0a short 15 minute d=\r\naily or\nweekly=A0homam offering small pieces of copra to a small fire is go=\r\nod. A\nfew people might *regularly* spend 3 hours in front of the sacred\nfir=\r\ne. That must be terrific !\n\nsasneham,\n\n=A0 =A0ajit\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Mar 26, 201=\r\n2 at 2:24 AM, pavan kumar &lt;cvspavan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe t=\r\nhat it doesn&#39;t matter if you perform homam for 3hrs or 3 mins and with many=\r\n materials or little materials.
