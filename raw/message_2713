Th=\r\nere has to be a reason why he defined the realization levels of classificat=\r\nion into 5, right? Consequently, the &quot;rising of kundalini&quot; must also give a=\r\nt some level of classification the same set of realizations, no? It would s=\r\neem at least superficially to fit on the 5 lower chakras. From that point o=\r\nf view, the 6th chakra would be after the anandamayakosa. Clearly the anand=\r\namayakosa would be the final level of egoity, since by being released from =\r\nit would leave one out of the linga sarira, but yet possibly still in the k=\r\narana sarira (gunas level). It would seem that any realization levels after=\r\n getting into the karana sarira would be ahamkara free (and of course tattw=\r\na free), yet guna bound. Final releas from gunas of course would lead to pu=\r\nre awakening of Brahman.\n\nThe point above is - if the mayakosas are not rel=\r\nated to the kundalini chakras, what are they? They must be experienced at s=\r\nome level of realization, no?\n\nRegards,\n\nSundeep\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am only=\r\n addressing the five elements mentioned in upanishads.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In Sahasrara c=\r\nhakra lies undifferentiated consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), where there =\r\nare no I-ness or any objectification.

It seems=\r\n to be his extrapolation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What you quoted from Taittariya Upa=\r\nnishad is the traditional view that I am familiar with. Other scriptures re=\r\nfer to the same order of creation, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, where Maha=\r\nrshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction and liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic understandi=\r\nng is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five c=\r\nhakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ethe=\r\nr, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth el=\r\nement within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effac=\r\ned in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water el=\r\nement within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are effac=\r\ned in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and water etc=\r\n, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element =\r\nshows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid =\r\nstate of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing=\r\n (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and ma=\r\nde of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a ca=\r\nr, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. =\r\nThus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five element=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that =\r\nlooks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart from the physical asp=\r\nect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qualities, certain nee=\r\nds, certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has about who one is, fo=\r\nrm one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kunda=\r\nlini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nat=\r\nure within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalin=\r\ni cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fl=\r\nuid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remainin=\r\ng. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many people who talk about experiences of Kunda=\r\nlini in higher chakras are often talking merely about some amount of vaayus=\r\n flowing in those chakras (which may still be a nice experience) and have *=\r\nnot* experienced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves=\r\n Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notion=\r\ns of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each el=\r\nement is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the physical as=\r\n well as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface even one eleme=\r\nnt (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of ti=\r\nme, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are effac=\r\ned as one progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether=\r\n. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced elements return to work in the rev=\r\nerse order - ether, air, fire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Does physics describe reality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe=\r\n/model reality at the gross physical level, as perceived by the external se=\r\nnses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses=\r\n playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and g=\r\net a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversa=\r\ntion between them. In another example, a yogi may be meditating with a mant=\r\nra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. Thes=\r\ne things cannot be perceived by the external senses and hence cannot be stu=\r\ndied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as=\r\n something that can be perceived by the external senses, because different =\r\npeople can experience the same reality using their senses individually and =\r\nverify the observation. However, some experiences of the mind that cannot b=\r\ne perceived by senses are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-alt=\r\nering and sometimes liberating influence on people. Inability to study and =\r\nmodel them is a big drawback of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams and internal yogic experienc=\r\nes as imaginations or hallucinations, because there is no independent valid=\r\nation, and call them unworthy of a study. But there are cases that make one=\r\n wonder. For example, see the following messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above =\r\nmessage, one person had a specific yogic experience that was described in d=\r\netail and another person seemed to know about it and supplied one tangible =\r\ndetail relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the ex=\r\nperience of the first person, though it was beyond the external senses of e=\r\nither person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/391\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message als=\r\no, one person had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail =\r\nand another person seemed to know about it and supplied a couple of tangibl=\r\ne details relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the=\r\n experience of the first person, though it was beyond the external senses o=\r\nf either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; In the above message, one person had a specific yogic experience involvin=\r\ng a deity and another person perceived with his external senses a vision in=\r\nvolving the same deity, though others in the room could not perceive anythi=\r\nng with their external senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot;=\r\n the experience of the first person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but the=\r\ny do suggest that perhaps *some* experiences that cannot be measured or per=\r\nceived by the external senses are observable by others, though not everyone=\r\n may be able to observe. Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some=\r\n* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses b=\r\neing a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, how c=\r\nan modern science study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can b=\r\ne studied and measured is the reality involving the gross body and its sens=\r\nes, one may suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be studied by o=\r\nbserving various parts of the gross physical body. For example, one can loo=\r\nk at the nervous signals flowing through various parts of the brain and try=\r\n to correlate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; O=\r\nn the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle bod=\r\ny and causal body are redundant. Though there is some correspondence betwee=\r\nn what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many=\r\n mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept of causal =\r\nand subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model can be moder=\r\nled using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive through a neighbo=\r\nrhood and observe the houses from the road, you can have *some* idea of wha=\r\nt is going on. A particular house with a lot of lights and sound and many c=\r\nars parked outside may be having a party. People in one particular house wi=\r\nth no lights are probably out of town. But you can never be sure what is go=\r\ning on in the house, how many people are inside, what exactly they are doin=\r\ng etc, by merely looking at the house from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly=\r\n, by looking at the nervous signals in various points of the brain, you may=\r\n be able to see some basic things, but not much. The experiences of the sub=\r\ntle mind are beyond your reach and study, if your tools are limited to the =\r\ngross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfo=\r\nrtunately, modern science cannot study that part of the reality which is be=\r\nyond the scope of external senses, unless scientists become yogis and devel=\r\nop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient tim=\r\nes had mastery of the internal world (which is the microcosm of the entire =\r\nuniverse) and could observe any space-time point, even the greatest yogis o=\r\nf today cannot control their state completely. When Kundalini rises, it may=\r\n go somewhere and one may experience some part of the Infinite Reality. But=\r\n one cannot control exactly where Kundalini goes and exactly which part of =\r\nthe Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed to have a perfect control.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagann=\r\nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry=\r\n the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamachar=\r\nun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest order) - it maybe of some he=\r\nlp to you.

As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; in=\r\nteracted with the chaos, it produced some universal energies which are more=\r\n commonly known as the universal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then c=\r\name the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are the actual physical elements a=\r\ns we see it, but more the essence of the element, hence his use of the word=\r\n &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction with the chaos resulted in some=\r\n more energy states. Thus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each on=\r\ne resulting from the previous and each one resulting in some energy states,=\r\n which in the end resulted in 33 crore possible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get=\r\n at it.. I feel there may be some correlation between that and the 11-dimen=\r\nsional physics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a nice idea and I would like to know more about it.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I=\r\n have the ability to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stan=\r\nds now, it is quite half formed. There being multiple theories of the Strin=\r\ng variety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional =\r\none) is one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of t=\r\nhe physical world. Finding a correlation between this and the idea of the f=\r\nive elements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can understand =\r\nsome correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan =\r\nInterpretation), non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a=\r\n link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta?!..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with =\r\nthe kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know more about how exact=\r\nly you can link these two, because I myself with my limited understand fail=\r\n to see any viable correlation at all as of now, specially, since the M-the=\r\nory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one m=\r\nust think about is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics de=\r\nscribe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two are differ=\r\nent. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exa=\r\nctly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quo=\r\nted that everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what i=\r\nt really is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation =\r\nis almost the essence of everything. The day physics gets THAT deep, there =\r\nwould be really nothing  more left to do.

They do help make the mind mo=\r\nre receptive toward the benefits of sadhana..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also wanted =\r\nto assure you that I really want to know the answer to the question. I am n=\r\not interested in a he-said/she- said type game (if perhaps that is what you=\r\n were hinting at?). I am extremely curious as to why there is an order and =\r\nnot a parallelism, for e.g. why are the mahabhutas not simultaneously forme=\r\nd. There is some lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it=\r\n.. I feel there may be some correlation between that and the 11-dimensional=\r\n physics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With all due respect to your quer=\r\ny, I wanted to ask, how does it matter? Can anyone here really know for sur=\r\ne which came after which? We can only speculate and guess and retrofit logi=\r\nc and quote one scripture vs another scripture. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only =\r\npractical way to really find out the truth is sadhana.

I have heard differing opinions though, perhaps in Sanjay Rathji=\r\n&#39;s Brhat Nakshtra but since I dont have the book in front of me, I cant con=\r\nfirm. Do you agree with the interpretation above, if not what is your belie=\r\nf, source and justification?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
