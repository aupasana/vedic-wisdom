As a result, agni became\ndistressed. Through his yogic power, agni always divided himself and\nremained present in all homas and other sacrifices. He took the offerings\nmade in the fire to the respective beings. But, he did not want to eat\nanything that was impure. After bhrigu&#39;s curse, he decided to withdraw\nhimself from all homas.\n\nBoth the rishis who made offerings in agni and the devas who received these\nofferings were distressed and went to Brahma. They asked Brahma how agni\ncould eat both sacred and vulger things.\n\nBrahma now summons agni and asks him how he could withdraw himself from\nhoma and other sacrifices, as agni was the creator, sustainer and destroyer\nof the three lokas. He then advises agni and tells him that he would not\nhave to consume vulgar offerings with his entire body. Only a particular\nportion of agni would have to consume impure offerings. Even those\nofferings would become pure the moment they were consumed by agni, and agni\nhimself would remain pure. Brahma thus asked agni to remain the &#39;eater of\nall things&#39;, and agni agreed.\n\n\n**********\n\n\nThrough this divine play between Bhrighu, Agni and Brahma, all of us have\nbenefited. Though we make both pure and impure offerings (both physical and\nmental), the ever pure Agni remains present in our homas. He remains\nunaffected, and purifies each and every one of our offerings. As we spend\nmore and more time with Agni, the impure within us slowly becomes pure.\n\nsasneham,\n\n    ajit\n\r\n--001a11c347721b804704e2bd810d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;namaste,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt;=\r\n I chanted mantras in anger and had given aahutis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the beginning of the mahabharata, bhrigu curses agni (fir=\r\ne) to become the &#39;eater of all things&#39;, both sacred and vulgar.
