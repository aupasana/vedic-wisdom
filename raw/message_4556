The similar thought\n=\r\nthat you are a sannyasi will haunt you even if you go forth as one. Whether=\r\n\nyou continue in the household or renounce it and go to live in the forest,=\r\n\nyour mind haunts you. The ego is the source of thought. It creates the bod=\r\ny\nand the world and makes you think of being a householder. If you renounce=\r\n,\nit will only substitute the thought of renunciation for that of the famil=\r\ny\nand the environment of the forest for that of the household. But the ment=\r\nal\nobstacles are always there for you. They even increase greatly in the ne=\r\nw\nsurroundings. Change of environment is no help. The one obstacle is the\nm=\r\nind, and this must be overcome whether in the home or in the forest. If you=\r\n\ncan do it in the forest why not in the home? So why change the environment=\r\n?\nYour efforts can be made even now, whatever be the environment.\n\nDevotee:=\r\n Is it possible to enjoy samadhi while busy with worldly work?\n\nSri Bhagava=\r\nn: It is the feeling `I work&#39; that is the hindrance. Ask\nyourself: `Who wor=\r\nks?&#39; Remember who you are. Then the work will not bind\nyou. It will go on a=\r\nutomatically. Make no effort either to work or to\nrenounce; your effort is =\r\nthe bondage. What is destined to happen will\nhappen. If you are destined to=\r\n work, you will not be able to avoid it; you\nwill be forced to engage in it=\r\n. So leave it to the Higher Power. It is not\nreally your choice whether you=\r\n renounce or retain.\n\nSource: From The Teachings of Bhagavan in His Own Wor=\r\nds\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00163649a5a733c2660489d66818\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Sri Bhagavan&lt;/span&gt;: Why do you think you are a householder?
