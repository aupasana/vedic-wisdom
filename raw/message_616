I have narrated this incident to very few people who are loving Thakur a=\r\nnd when I told this incident they all were weeping. But I am sorry that you=\r\nr mail disappointed me. You have given analysis of this incident on intelle=\r\nctual level or it=C2=A0was more logical and less devotional. I was expectin=\r\ng the excitement in your mail but you just justified that it is possible as=\r\n our faith is working...!!!\nDear Sir, for your information I would write th=\r\nat when this incident happened I was not knowing Thakur, nor was any devoti=\r\non towards Him. It was due to Mr. Patel I had just taken the decision to ac=\r\ncept HIM as my Guru. I was also upset in the morning after discussion with =\r\nmy wife and started thinking that my decision was hasty. I just taken a cha=\r\nnce as I was told by Mr. Patel that you can test Thakur before you accept h=\r\nim as your Guru. I remembered his words that morning and told my wife that =\r\nif my decision is right, Mr. Patel should come to my house. I was not knowi=\r\nng then actually Mr. Patel will come to my place within 10 minutes and Thak=\r\nur will show him the way to my home. \nYou have written that Thakur might ha=\r\nve taken rebirth after 100 years. I think=C2=A0this was his desire and not =\r\nnecessary he is already born now.It is His will to take 100 years or 150 ye=\r\nars for re-birth. I am now strongly believe that Thakur is still alive on e=\r\narth because my another incidents are also leading me to believe that He is=\r\n coming to this earth. Mr. Patel was experiencing him very offen. \nIt was a=\r\n miracle and whenever I remember this day I am excited. I am not his staunc=\r\nh devotee even today but still He is with me, He loves me rather. Oh, what =\r\nto say !\n\nDr.Ashwin Rawal\n\n--- On Thu, 6/11/08, Narasimha P.V.R.

Thank you for sharing it.\n=C2=A0\nAfter Ramakrishna l=\r\neft his body, several people saw him in embodied form.\n=C2=A0\nThat is entir=\r\nely possible. When someone who did not identify with a body but identified =\r\nwith the entire universe lives in a body and leaves, it is not like he has =\r\nleft. He is still there, in every atom and in everything. If someone is att=\r\nached to him with that body of his and he has compassion for that person, h=\r\ne *can* give darshan to that person in that body. It is not that he is &quot;ali=\r\nve&quot; or &quot;dead&quot;. It is just that he is in every atom or sub-atomic particle o=\r\nf this creation because he has realized the true nature of Self while livin=\r\ng in the previous body and that realization was intact even while leaving t=\r\nhat body.\n=C2=A0\nAccording to Sarada Mata, Ramakrishna told her and Lakshmi=\r\n that he would be back after 100 years and that all of them would have to b=\r\ne reborn when he is reborn after 100 years. Thus, he may have already come =\r\nto earth in a different body. But that does not matter. Those who have an a=\r\nttachment to Ramakrishna and stuck at the lower level form may still be abl=\r\ne to access his previous form.\n=C2=A0\nEven after the form of Rama left this=\r\n=C2=A0world and the form of=C2=A0Krishna was born, a devotee of Rama who do=\r\nes great tapascharya for Rama may be able to realize a darshan of the form =\r\nof Rama.\n=C2=A0\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa was almost certainly an avatara.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nF=\r\nree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre =\r\n(SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n=\r\nFrom: Ashwin Rawal \nTo: Vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \nCc: pvr@charter. ne=\r\nt \nSent: Wednesday, November 05, 2008 10:25 AM\nSubject: Shri Shri THAKUR is=\r\n still alive today\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\nDear Sir, I would like to share one of my gre=\r\nat Devine experience about shri Ramkrishnadev. This is an unbelievable expe=\r\nrience that I have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing=\r\n exactly as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of 1973/=\r\n74. Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood. \n\n=C2=A0 \n\nI was =\r\nworking as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka. My duty was f=\r\nrom 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for extra duty. There=\r\n was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post office and due to same Dep=\r\n=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone operators. One Mr. Ramanbh=\r\nai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was working as Operator. He was a=\r\n staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was me=\r\neting him he was always talking about shri Thakur. We came close day by day=\r\n. There was a weekly gathering at his home called SATSANGA. He was singing =\r\ndevotional songs created by him and was weeping while singing. He was readi=\r\nng Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly=\r\n meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30 =\r\nthen. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours and wer=\r\ne talking only about Thakur. \n\nOne day when we were at sea shore he suddenl=\r\ny told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have come to my home and my wife =\r\nis remembering me. My son will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall ha=\r\nve to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to =\r\ncall him. \n\nAt one another incident he told me that there will be a plane c=\r\nrash tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about him. =\r\nHe could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told =\r\nme not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I went to Bus =\r\nstation but bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured on the way. This =\r\nwas surprising. \n\nThis all incidents made me to believe that he had some su=\r\nper power and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted t=\r\no shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri Thakur =\r\nand the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself to Thakur a=\r\nt Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him deeply from=\r\n my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. \n\nNext day mor=\r\nning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning while taking the tea. =\r\nAs my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up at 5.45 morning. I told t=\r\no my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Guru=\r\ndev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a lot. =E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWh=\r\ny should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devote=\r\ne of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint but our Guru should be livi=\r\nng one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa fro=\r\nm Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--. \n\n=\r\nHer arguments were right at her place as people in general not know much ab=\r\nout Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken hasty decision.=\r\n I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- \n\nBut I remember that Mr. Patel ha=\r\nd told me that Thakur was telling their disciples to test him before accept=\r\ning him. I also decided to test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2=\r\n=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come to our home. You have also not=\r\n seen him. He has never asked me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is co=\r\nming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my select=\r\nion for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D-- \n\nShe laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9C=\r\nHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D-- \n\nI prayed Shri Tha=\r\nkur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my decision and convince my wi=\r\nfe. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even today.=E2=80=99 \n\nTo our gr=\r\neat surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the morning with angry m=\r\nood. What he told? \n\n=E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you kn=\r\now what happened? Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my hom=\r\ne at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Tha=\r\nkur pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99=\r\ns house. He is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his ho=\r\nuse=E2=80=9D \n\nI immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the=\r\n way to your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are disturbin=\r\ng him in such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99 \n\nWe both =\r\nwere so excited and surprised that we had no words that Morning. \n\nI will n=\r\never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. There were some more =\r\nDevine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will write it sometime. \n\nDear S=\r\nir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the earth. This is a=\r\n fact I have written and no word is added to exaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Tha=\r\nkur bless all of us. \n\nDr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      =\r\nAdd more friends to your messenger and enjoy!

T=\r\nhere was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post office and due to same =\r\nDep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone operators. One Mr. Rama=\r\nnbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was working as Operator. He wa=\r\ns a staunch devotee of&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;shri Ramkrishnadev. W=\r\nhenever I was meeting him he was always talking about shri Thakur. We came =\r\nclose day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his home called SATSANGA.=\r\n He was singing devotional songs created by him and was weeping while singi=\r\nng. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were atten=\r\nding this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. =\r\nPatel was of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after du=\r\nty\n hours and were talking only about Thakur.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P=\r\n class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;One =\r\nday when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some=\r\n guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me.

I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with =\r\nmy surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;=\r\nAt one another incident he told me that there will be a plane crash tomorro=\r\nw and that also happened. I was very much impressed about him. He could for=\r\nesee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me not to go=\r\n through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I went to Bus station but =\r\nbus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured on the way.

I was =\r\nattracted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of s=\r\nhri Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself =\r\nto Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture.
