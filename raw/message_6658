It is a tradeoff ... =\r\nif you want less smoke, it is better\n&gt; &gt; to clean it, but there are also li=\r\nkely to be some partially burnt\n&gt; &gt; particles in the ash. If you leave it, =\r\nsome small partially burnt\n&gt; &gt; particles may finish burning, but there is l=\r\nikely to be a little more\n&gt; &gt; smoke.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (3) Disposing of ashes. As Na=\r\nrasimha has written, you want to\n&gt; &gt; distribute the energy in the ashes bac=\r\nk to nature in a respectful way.\n&gt; &gt; Do whatever is possible given your con=\r\nstraints. If no other\n&gt; &gt; alternative presents itself, throw them out in th=\r\ne garbage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (4) Twigs & Ghee -- The twigs are dipped in ghee before=\r\n they are\n&gt; &gt; offered. After that you offer ghee ahutis to the fire (and th=\r\nus, the\n&gt; &gt; twigs) until they burn.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (5) Copper vs Iron -- Narasimh=\r\na has told us that iron is unlikely to\n&gt; &gt; have a good mix of gunas, and co=\r\npper is a much better choice. If you\n&gt; &gt; have to get a new kunda, why not g=\r\net a copper one?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (6) Size -- The size of the homa kinda is a matte=\r\nr of preference based\n&gt; &gt; on the size of the fire that you light. With a sm=\r\naller kunda, you may\n&gt; &gt; have trouble exposing all sides of all ahutis to a=\r\nir, which might\n&gt; &gt; prevent them from burning well. With a larger kunda, if=\r\n you don&#39;t keep\n&gt; &gt; an equivalently large fire ablaze, you may have more sm=\r\noke. Once you\n&gt; &gt; do homam repeatedly, you will figure out if you need (or =\r\nwant) a kunda\n&gt; &gt; of a different size.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (7) Washing & Cleaning -- Y=\r\nou do not have to wash the kunda daily\n&gt; &gt; (though you can if you choose to=\r\n). It is a good idea to keep the\n&gt; &gt; prayer area relatively clean ... you s=\r\nhould be comfortable with it.\n&gt; &gt; Using something like aluminum foil can ma=\r\nke regular cleanup easy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (8) Bali -- After puja, bali is offered t=\r\no animals, and is not\n&gt; &gt; consumed by us. If this is not possible, you can =\r\nthrow it out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (9) Base of the kunda -- Putting the kunda on newspa=\r\nper is a bad idea\n&gt; &gt; ... it may easily catch on fire. A wooden plank may w=\r\nork, though it is\n&gt; &gt; better if it is raised (i.e. has a gap of air between=\r\n the main plank\n&gt; &gt; and the ground). Even with a wooden plank, two bricks b=\r\netween the\n&gt; &gt; plank and kunda is a good idea.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you have extra=\r\n free time, consider searching the group archives\n&gt; &gt; for these same questi=\r\nons. You&#39;ll come across many other interesting\n&gt; &gt; points from previous dis=\r\ncussions on the same topics.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0aj=\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Jun 24, 2011 at 11:45 PM,=\r\n Rama V &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh ! and lastly, what do I do with the =\r\n&quot;bali&quot; fruit pieces ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rAma\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Als=\r\no, I bought a metal homa kund (not copper, probably iron), 6x6 inches in th=\r\ne interior and probably a sq.ft exterior.

I learnt that the twigs need to be cut vertically for them =\r\nto burn better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Secondly, the full dry coconut did not burn comple=\r\ntely in the poornahuti and if I put a half one or a piece it would have bur=\r\nnt completely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Also, the dharbhas I have were a bit bent and I cou=\r\nld not put them pointed to north or south or the other directions correctly=\r\n. Hope that was ok too !\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now some questions (I am sure th=\r\nese have been answered, I apologize, but would appreciate if you respond ag=\r\nain); btw, if these could be put in FAQ, will be much obliged.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. =\r\nwhat do I do with the partially burnt poornahuti ? Can I use it tomorrow ? =\r\nAlso, what does one do with all the ash and the burnt part? What is the hol=\r\ny way to dispose it off ? No lakes or river by in Bangalore ! Do I put them=\r\n under a tree and pour water ? Not many trees, only plants, in the apts I l=\r\nive here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. If there are any unburnt part of the twigs, can I use=\r\n them again? Or do they need to be disposed off ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. Is it advisab=\r\nle to dip (not pour) the twigs in the ghee so that they burn well ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Let me know of other points I might have known for a beginner.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Finally, a million thanks and appreciations for all who ar=\r\ne responsible (Sh MMP, Sh PVR, etc.) for the KT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; regards\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rAma\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
