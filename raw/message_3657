I am here.&quot;\n\nThe following string of reminiscences were=\r\n collected from devotees who had\nthe rare good fortune of coming under the =\r\nbenign glance of the Master.\n\nThe unique manifestation of Divine Grace on e=\r\narth known and loved by us as\nBhagavan Sri Ramana receded into its Reality =\r\nas night set in on Friday,\nApril 14th, 1950.The very moment that Bhagavan e=\r\nntered into Maha-Nirvana, at\n8:47 that night, the skies announced the great=\r\n event with a long, slow trail\nof light.\n\nBhagavan Ramana moved with us, as=\r\n one of us, though he had, even as a lad of\n17, found his Unity with the Re=\r\nality underlying all appearance and had\nremained ever since as that resplen=\r\ndent Pure Consciousness, the Self. Though\nhe never left Arunachala after hi=\r\ns first arrival there, the power of his\nLight spread silently through the w=\r\norld during the half century and more of\nhis stay there. Many earnest seeke=\r\nrs approached him and some found spiritual\nillumination in his presence. Hi=\r\ns mode of life was natural, his ways were\ngracious, his smile brought peace=\r\n to the heart. His look was an initiation\ninto Divine Mystery; his teaching=\r\n was simple, direct and profound, based on\nman&#39;s natural experience of I-ne=\r\nss. He directed all to seek and find for\nthemselves the Source of the ego, =\r\nthe Reality behind their individuality,\nfrom which all thoughts and actions=\r\n proceed.His luminous abidance in the\nSelf was itself a teaching conveyed f=\r\nrom heart to heart in silence. As all\nhis actions were waves from the Light=\r\n within, the grace of which attracted\nand uplifted all who came in contact =\r\nwith him.\n\nRajapalayam Ramani Ammal\n\nI was at Rajapalayam at the time of Bh=\r\nagavan&#39;s Mahanirvana. That night, I\nsaw a beautiful blue light going up in =\r\nthe sky and I knew Bhagavan had left\nthe body. I did not want to live after=\r\n that and so I started fasting, hoping\nto drop the body that way. For five =\r\nor six days, I did not touch food. But\nduring that time, I had several visi=\r\nons, and in one of them, I was taken\ninside a cave on the Hill and saw Rish=\r\nis performing Yagnas. Sri Bhagavan was\nseated there. Bhagavan said, &quot;Why ar=\r\ne you crying? You say that I have gone\naway, but where have I gone? I am he=\r\nre.&quot; Some Rishis brought some Prasad to\nBhagavan. Sri Bhagavan took some an=\r\nd gave it to me. I could not remember in\nthe dream that I was fasting. For =\r\nfive days afterwards, the smell of that\nPrasad was with me. Now was that a =\r\ndream or reality? I consider it to be\nBhagavan&#39;s Grace.\n\nThe aroma of that =\r\nPrasad even spread around my house. My brother wondered\nwhat I had eaten. T=\r\nhat aroma was simply out-of-the-world. The morning after\nthe dream, I start=\r\ned taking food and coffee. My brother and sister were also\nfasting with me,=\r\n deciding to give up their bodies if I were to give up mine.\nIn the dream, =\r\nBhagavan was seated near a tank and Kamadhenu (the celestial\ncow) was near =\r\nhim. Rishis and Munis were serving him. Bhagavan was looking\nsplendid, like=\r\n Lord Siva. It was a divine sight indeed. The smell of the\nPrasad remained =\r\nfor five days. How can I take it to be a dream? From that\nday onwards I had=\r\n no thought at all that Bhagavan had left us. He is all\npervading. I felt n=\r\no more sorrow in my heart. He is here too. See how we all\nare gathered here=\r\n. What have we done to deserve this?2\n\nMajor Chadwick\n\nOn the last night, B=\r\nhagavan was lying in the small room which had originally\nbeen built as a st=\r\noreroom when he had moved into the big hall. We were all\nseated along the v=\r\nerandah of the temple opposite. Our only view of the room\nwas through a sma=\r\nll ventilator window about six feet from the ground.\nNaturally, seated as w=\r\ne were on the ground, we had no view of the interior\nof the room where he l=\r\nay; all we could see was the constant movement of a\nfan backwards and forwa=\r\nrds. This fan was anxiously watched by everybody, for\nwhen it stopped we wo=\r\nuld know that the end had come.\n\nThe Ashram authorities were afraid that th=\r\nere might be some trouble from the\nwaiting crowds, as a certain clique had =\r\narranged, if possible, to remove the\nbody and bury it outside the Ashram. I=\r\nt would have been quite impossible to\ndo this. There were lots of police ab=\r\nout and the majority of opinion was\nnaturally against such a scandal. Howev=\r\ner the powers were scared. For this\nreason about an hour before the end the=\r\n D.M.O., who was present, was\nprompted by the Manager to come out and annou=\r\nnce that there was no immediate\ndanger of anything happening that night. It=\r\n was a scandalous thing to do.\nNaturally many of the people went home for t=\r\nheir evening meal and so missed\nthe last moments.\n\nThere were some American=\r\n reporters and photographers, who were there just\nout for a scoop. They wer=\r\ne living less than half a mile away. One of them\nstanding outside the house=\r\n suddenly looked up and saw very bright star or\nmeteor move slowly across t=\r\nhe sky towards the North over the top of the\nHill. He called out to the res=\r\nt of the party, who ran out and saw the same\nphenomenon. One and all agreed=\r\n that something had happened to Bhagavan. Even\nthough they were without spe=\r\ncial faith in him, by some intuition they were\ncertain that this must have =\r\nbeen the case. It happened exactly at the time\nof the passing (8:47 p. m. o=\r\nn April l4th, 1950) and was seen by many people,\nall of whom strangely enou=\r\ngh, associated it with the same thing. People in\nMadras also saw it and som=\r\ne got into their cars immediately and made their\nway to the Ashram. This is=\r\n a fact which I will not attempt to explain, but\nmust accept it as it happe=\r\nned.\n\n&quot;Go! Where can I go? I shall always be here.&quot;\n\nThe power of Sri Raman=\r\na, who gave up his physical form has not diminished.\nHe is everywhere, like=\r\n the light in a room shed by an electric bulb. But the\nlight is found to be=\r\n far stronger near the bulb, the source of light, than\nin any other part of=\r\n the room, though no spot is in darkness. What wonder,\nthen, if the power o=\r\nf our Guru is found near the place where his body is\ninterred?\n\nAttendant K=\r\nrishnaswami\n\nBhagavan gave several indications that he wanted no treatment.=\r\nOne day he\nthreatened to drop his body by not eating anything. I pleaded wi=\r\nth Bhagavan\nthat I would take care of all his bodily needs, and that he sho=\r\nuld eat and\nstay put inside that room. One day Bhagavan refused to drink wa=\r\nter, but the\nnext day he demanded huge amounts of water. I pleaded with him=\r\n to moderate\nhis intake of food and water. So many things like this happene=\r\nd in those\nlast days.\n\nTwo days after he drank lots of water, the end was t=\r\no come. I was with him\non that day, too. In the afternoon, I gave him the e=\r\nssence of pomegranate,\nwhich Bhagavan could swallow. At 5 o&#39;clock in the ev=\r\nening Satyananda Swami\ngave him orange juice, which was advised by the doct=\r\nors, but Bhagavan had\nsome difficulty swallowing it.\n\nOn the day of the Mah=\r\nasamadhi, O.P. Ramaswami Reddiyar, the retired Chief\nMinister, was attendin=\r\ng to the affairs of the Ashram. A police officer came\nto inquire about Bhag=\r\navan&#39;s condition on behalf of the District Police\nSuperintendent, who wante=\r\nd to have Bhagavan&#39;s darshan. I told him to ask the\nSarvadhikari. They said=\r\n that only I would be able to give them the correct\npicture. So I told them=\r\n that as far as I was concerned, I did not think\nBhagavan&#39;s body would last=\r\n beyond 10 O&#39;clock in the night. So they sent word\nto the District Police S=\r\nuperintendent to come and see Bhagavan.\n\nThere was another problem. Devotee=\r\ns wanted to have the darshan of their\nGuru. I did not want to incur their a=\r\nnger by denying them one last darshan\nof their Guru. I requested them to co=\r\nme in a queue and not put any questions\nor expect any words of wisdom from =\r\nBhagavan. Darshan continued till 5\np.m.devotees came in large numbers, and =\r\nalthough police kept the line moving\nfast, they went back and stood in line=\r\n again, weeping and crying. It was a\nsight that moved me very deeply.\n\nSeei=\r\nng the difficulty that Bhagavan was experiencing, I drew a screen across\nan=\r\nd didn&#39;t allow any more darshan. O. P. Ramaswani Reddiyar came, and I told\n=\r\nhim that he could come in, but he declined. Seeing how much Bhagavan&#39;s body=\r\n\nwas suffering, O. P. Reddiyar requested the devotees to sing\n&quot;Aksharamanam=\r\nalai.&quot; He did this because Bhagavan&#39;s body was suffering and he\ndidn&#39;t want=\r\n anybody to notice it.\n\nBhagavan had told me that a Jnani does not mind how=\r\n his body is dropped, for\nthe body idea has already died. It was only for t=\r\nhe naked eye that Bhagavan\nwas suffering. In reality there was no suffering=\r\n since Bhagavan had no\ndehatma buddhi (I-am-the-body idea). Lots of pillows=\r\n were placed to prop up\nhis head and He was sitting with his legs stretched=\r\n. Suddenly, Bhagavan\nasked me to seat him in padmasana pose, and in that po=\r\nse the last breath\nwent out of him, and he became still.\n\nWhen Bhagavan dro=\r\npped the body, I was holding the head, and Subramanian was\nstanding next to=\r\n me. I was looking at Bhagavan&#39;s face, and when the lower\njaw dropped, I kn=\r\new that he had left the body. The women outside sensed it\nsomehow and, beat=\r\ning their breasts, tried to come inside and have one last\ndarshan. But the =\r\npolice prevented it. I helped carry the body to the\nMandapam of the mother&#39;=\r\ns temple. My service to Bhagavan ended there.\n\nS.S.Cohen\n\n5th April: Yester=\r\nday, Monsieur Cartier-Brassen, the expert French\nphotographer, took a photo=\r\ngraph of Sri Bhagavan, which may prove to be the\nlast one of him.\n\nMaharshi=\r\n&#39;s health has remained more or less stationary since about a week.\nHis naus=\r\nea and scanty urination have not been persistent, yet there has been\nno imp=\r\nrovement in his general condition, which continues to prevent his\ncoming ou=\r\nt for darshan.\n\nYesterday morning, His Excellency the Governor of Madras, t=\r\nhe Maharaja of\nBhavanagar, and his wife had Sri Bhagavan&#39;s darshan in the s=\r\nmall room, then\nworshipped in the Ashram&#39;s temple, inquired after the two w=\r\nhite peacocks\nthey had presented some weeks back and left.\n\n6th April, 1950=\r\n: Symptoms of definite toxaemia have set in Maharshi&#39;s body.\nFor the whole =\r\nday his urinary secretion did not exceed one ounce.... Doctors\ngently argue=\r\n with him that scanty urination can be relieved only by an\nincreased intake=\r\n of fruit juice and water. &#39;And if I can&#39;t take?&#39; he would\nanswer, and ther=\r\ne the matter must end. He leaves his body to manage its\nhealth or diseases =\r\nas best it can, without the slightest effort of\ncooperation on his part. Hi=\r\ns mind is ever sunk in bliss. It is true that his\nbody is suffering, but th=\r\nat is no reason why he should disturb his mind to\noblige it. If it dies, we=\r\nll and good; if it remains, so much the worse for\nit: it is the business of=\r\n Him who made it to keep or take it away and do all\nthe worrying-it is none=\r\n of his own business to interfere and inconvenience\nhimself on its behalf.\n=\r\n\n13th April, 1950: Tamil New Year, 2 p.m., Morning observations : Maharshi&#39;=\r\ns\ndiastole climbed up to 46, but the systole remained stationary at 68, pul=\r\nse\n94, temperature 98.4 (normal! what an irony!), breathing 22 per minute.\n=\r\n\nMorning darshan ran for half an hour, during which Maharshi&#39;s eyes remaine=\r\nd\nclosed and when he occasionally opened them, they looked in front rather\n=\r\nthan to the left where the devotees were filing past him. His diet consists=\r\n\nnow of only buttermilk.\n\n10 p.m.: Owing to the very heavy attendance of vi=\r\nsitors from all over the\nSouth, nearly 1500, the evening darshan had to be =\r\nlengthened to 45 minutes.\n\nMany devotees remained till late in the evening =\r\nto receive the final medical\noral report for the day. At 9:30, Dr. Krishnam=\r\nurti, a local physician and a\ngreat devotee, walked up to me and said: &#39;My =\r\nown impression is that there is\nno immediate danger. Bhagavan has just told=\r\n the attendants to go to sleep as\nhe himself was going to do. His breathing=\r\n is not laboured, and there is no\ngasping in evidence.&#39;\n\nFriday, 14th April=\r\n: Maharshi is in a very precarious condition. The whole\nmorning has been sp=\r\nent by devotees in hushed gloom and with bated breath.\nAfter evening darsha=\r\nn, the unanimous verdict is that it is positively the\nlast. The Master is n=\r\now propped on large pillows, almost in a sitting\nposture, the head resting =\r\nbackward with open mouth, and two attendants\nbriskly fanning him, to enable=\r\n him to breathe freely-the battle for air, has\nthus started. At 7 p.m., oxy=\r\ngen is administered to him for about five\nminutes, but seeing that it gave =\r\nhim no relief, he feebly asked that it\nshould be stopped.\n\nThe situation wa=\r\ns tense: about five-hundred devotees were outside in sad\nexpectation of the=\r\n solemn last moment. Blood relations, Ashram workers, a\nfew old disciples, =\r\nand some new aspirants went in by turn to have a last\nsight of him. When th=\r\ne end was known to be approaching, the whole\ncongregation with one voice st=\r\narted chanting the Tamil hymns he had many\nyears ago composed in praise of =\r\nLord Arunachala: &quot;Arunachala Shiva,\nArunachala Shiva, Arunachala!&quot; till it =\r\ncame at about 8:47. Many devotees,\ngrief-stricken and beating their breasts=\r\n, lost control of their feelings and\nrushed en masse to the small room wher=\r\ne the sacred body lay, but police\nofficers immediately cordoned off the are=\r\na till it was brought out and\nplaced in the centre of the big darshan hall =\r\nin yoga asana for all the\npeople to pay their last respects to it. The news=\r\n spread like wildfire to\nthe town and the neighboring villages and drew hug=\r\ne crowds. By 9:15, the\ncrowd grew so thick, that it became necessary to giv=\r\ne a chance to all to pay\ntheir homage and pass the body in an orderly manne=\r\nr. A queue was thus\nformed- seven to ten broad-at a quick-march pace. It is=\r\n still (11:55 p.m.)\ncontinuing unabatingly.\n\nAround the sofa sat dozens of =\r\ndisciples, some chanting Maharshi&#39;s verses and\nother devotional hymns, but =\r\nothers remained in silent contemplation.\nSandalwood paste and jasmine flowe=\r\nrs now cover the body and incense burns by\nits side.\n\nAt about 9 p.m.,Monsi=\r\neur Cartier-Brassen, the French photographer, who has\nbeen here for about a=\r\n fortnight with his wife, related an experience of his\nto me. &quot;It is a most=\r\n astonishing experience,&quot; he said. &quot;I was in the open\nspace in front of my =\r\nhouse, when my friends drew my attention to the sky,\nwhere I saw a vividly-=\r\nluminous shooting star with a luminous tail, unlike\nany shooting star I had=\r\n before seen, coming from the South, moving slowly\nacross the sky and, reac=\r\nhing the top of Arunachala, disappeared behind it.\nBecause of its singulari=\r\nty we all guessed its import and immediately looked\nat our watches - it was=\r\n 8:47 - and then raced to the Ashram only to find\nthat our premonition had =\r\nbeen only too sadly true: the Master had passed\ninto Mahanirvana at that ve=\r\nry minute.&quot; Several other devotees in the Ashram\nand in the town later told=\r\n me that they too had seen the tell-tale meteor.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.

Sri Bhagavan was seated there. Bhagavan said, &quot;Why are you crying=\r\n? You say that I have gone away, but where have I gone? I am here.&quot; So=\r\nme Rishis brought some Prasad to Bhagavan. Sri Bhagavan took some and gave =\r\nit to me. I could not remember in the dream that I was fasting. For five da=\r\nys afterwards, the smell of that Prasad was with me. Now was that a dream o=\r\nr reality? I consider it to be Bhagavan&#39;s Grace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The aroma of =\r\nthat Prasad even spread around my house. My brother wondered what I had eat=\r\nen. That aroma was simply out-of-the-world. The morning after the dream, I =\r\nstarted taking food and coffee. My brother and sister were also fasting wit=\r\nh me, deciding to give up their bodies if I were to give up mine. In the dr=\r\neam, Bhagavan was seated near a tank and Kamadhenu (the celestial cow) was =\r\nnear him. Rishis and Munis were serving him. Bhagavan was looking splendid,=\r\n like Lord Siva. It was a divine sight indeed. The smell of the Prasad rema=\r\nined for five days. How can I take it to be a dream? From that day onwards =\r\nI had no thought at all that Bhagavan had left us. He is all pervading. I f=\r\nelt no more sorrow in my heart. He is here too. See how we all are gathered=\r\n here. What have we done to deserve this?2&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold&quot;&gt;Major Chadwick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the last night, Bhagavan was lyin=\r\ng in the small room which had originally been built as a storeroom when he =\r\nhad moved into the big hall. We were all seated along the verandah of the t=\r\nemple opposite. Our only view of the room was through a small ventilator wi=\r\nndow about six feet from the ground. Naturally, seated as we were on the gr=\r\nound, we had no view of the interior of the room where he lay; all we could=\r\n see was the constant movement of a fan backwards and forwards. This fan wa=\r\ns anxiously watched by everybody, for when it stopped we would know that th=\r\ne end had come.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Ashram authorities were afraid that there migh=\r\nt be some trouble from the waiting crowds, as a certain clique had arranged=\r\n, if possible, to remove the body and bury it outside the Ashram. It would =\r\nhave been quite impossible to do this. There were lots of police about and =\r\nthe majority of opinion was naturally against such a scandal. However the p=\r\nowers were scared. For this reason about an hour before the end the D.M.O.,=\r\n who was present, was prompted by the Manager to come out and announce that=\r\n there was no immediate danger of anything happening that night. It was a s=\r\ncandalous thing to do. Naturally many of the people went home for their eve=\r\nning meal and so missed the last moments.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold&quot;&gt;There were some American reporters and photographers, who were the=\r\nre just out for a scoop.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0They were living less than half a mile=\r\n away.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;One of them standing outside t=\r\nhe house suddenly looked up and saw very bright star or meteor move slowly =\r\nacross the sky towards the North over the top of the Hill.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0He c=\r\nalled out to the rest of the party, who ran out and saw the same phenomenon=\r\n. One and all agreed that something had happened to Bhagavan. Even though t=\r\nhey were without special faith in him, by some intuition they were certain =\r\nthat this must have been the case. It happened exactly at the time of the p=\r\nassing (8:47 p. m. on April l4th, 1950) and was seen by many people, all of=\r\n whom strangely enough, associated it with the same thing.=C2=A0&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;People in Madras also saw it and some got into their =\r\ncars immediately and made their way to the Ashram.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0This is a fa=\r\nct which I will not attempt to explain, but must accept it as it happened.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Go! Where can I go? I shall always be here.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The=\r\n power of Sri Ramana, who gave up his physical form has not diminished. He =\r\nis everywhere, like the light in a room shed by an electric bulb. But the l=\r\night is found to be far stronger near the bulb, the source of light, than i=\r\nn any other part of the room, though no spot is in darkness. What wonder, t=\r\nhen, if the power of our Guru is found near the place where his body is int=\r\nerred?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Attendant Krishnaswami&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan gave several indications that he wanted no treatment.&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;One day he threatened to drop his body by no=\r\nt eating anything. I pleaded with Bhagavan that I would take care of all hi=\r\ns bodily needs, and that he should eat and stay put inside that room. One d=\r\nay Bhagavan refused to drink water, but the next day he demanded huge amoun=\r\nts of water.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0I pleaded with him to moderate his intake of food =\r\nand water. So many things like this happened in those last days.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Two days after he drank lots of water, the =\r\nend was to come. I was with him on that day, too. In the afternoon, I gave =\r\nhim the essence of pomegranate, which Bhagavan could swallow. At 5 o&#39;cl=\r\nock in the evening Satyananda Swami gave him orange juice, which was advise=\r\nd by the doctors, but Bhagavan had some difficulty swallowing it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On the day of the Mahasamadhi, O.P. Ramaswami Reddiyar, the retired =\r\nChief Minister, was attending to the affairs of the Ashram. A police office=\r\nr came to inquire about Bhagavan&#39;s condition on behalf of the District =\r\nPolice Superintendent, who wanted to have Bhagavan&#39;s darshan. I told hi=\r\nm to ask the Sarvadhikari. They said that only I would be able to give them=\r\n the correct picture. So I told them that as far as I was concerned, I did =\r\nnot think Bhagavan&#39;s body would last beyond 10 O&#39;clock in the night=\r\n. So they sent word to the District Police Superintendent to come and see B=\r\nhagavan.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;There was another problem. Devotees wanted to have the da=\r\nrshan of their Guru. I did not want to incur their anger by denying them on=\r\ne last darshan of their Guru. I requested them to come in a queue and not p=\r\nut any questions or expect any words of wisdom from Bhagavan. Darshan conti=\r\nnued till 5 p.m.devotees came in large numbers, and although police kept th=\r\ne line moving fast, they went back and stood in line again, weeping and cry=\r\ning. It was a sight that moved me very deeply.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Seeing the difficul=\r\nty that Bhagavan was experiencing, I drew a screen across and didn&#39;t al=\r\nlow any more darshan. O. P. Ramaswani Reddiyar came, and I told him that he=\r\n could come in, but he declined. Seeing how much Bhagavan&#39;s body was su=\r\nffering, O. P. Reddiyar requested the devotees to sing &quot;Aksharamanamal=\r\nai.&quot; He did this because Bhagavan&#39;s body was suffering and he didn=\r\n&#39;t want anybody to notice it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan had told me that a Jnan=\r\ni does not mind how his body is dropped, for the body idea has already died=\r\n. It was only for the naked eye that Bhagavan was suffering. In reality the=\r\nre was no suffering since Bhagavan had no dehatma buddhi (I-am-the-body ide=\r\na). Lots of pillows were placed to prop up his head and He was sitting with=\r\n his legs stretched. Suddenly, Bhagavan asked me to seat him in padmasana p=\r\nose, and in that pose the last breath went out of him, and he became still.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When Bhagavan dropped the body, I was holding the head, and Subra=\r\nmanian was standing next to me. I was looking at Bhagavan&#39;s face, and w=\r\nhen the lower jaw dropped, I knew that he had left the body. The women outs=\r\nide sensed it somehow and, beating their breasts, tried to come inside and =\r\nhave one last darshan. But the police prevented it. I helped carry the body=\r\n to the Mandapam of the mother&#39;s temple. My service to Bhagavan ended t=\r\nhere.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;S.S.Cohen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5th=\r\n April: Yesterday, Monsieur Cartier-Brassen, the expert French photographer=\r\n, took a photograph of Sri Bhagavan, which may prove to be the last one of =\r\nhim.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Maharshi&#39;s health has remained more or less stationary si=\r\nnce about a week. His nausea and scanty urination have not been persistent,=\r\n yet there has been no improvement in his general condition, which continue=\r\ns to prevent his coming out for darshan.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Yesterday morning, His Ex=\r\ncellency the Governor of Madras, the Maharaja of Bhavanagar, and his wife h=\r\nad Sri Bhagavan&#39;s darshan in the small room, then worshipped in the Ash=\r\nram&#39;s temple, inquired after the two white peacocks they had presented =\r\nsome weeks back and left.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;6th April, 1950:=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Symptoms of definite toxaemia have set in Maharshi&#39;s bod=\r\ny. For the whole day his urinary secretion did not exceed one ounce.... Doc=\r\ntors gently argue with him that scanty urination can be relieved only by an=\r\n increased intake of fruit juice and water. &#39;And if I can&#39;t take?&#=\r\n39; he would answer, and there the matter must end. He leaves his body to m=\r\nanage its health or diseases as best it can, without the slightest effort o=\r\nf cooperation on his part. His mind is ever sunk in bliss.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0It i=\r\ns true that his body is suffering, but that is no reason why he should dist=\r\nurb his mind to oblige it. If it dies, well and good; if it remains, so muc=\r\nh the worse for it: it is the business of Him who made it to keep or take i=\r\nt away and do all the worrying-it is none of his own business to interfere =\r\nand inconvenience himself on its behalf.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;13th April, 1950: Tamil N=\r\new Year, 2 p.m., Morning observations : Maharshi&#39;s diastole climbed up =\r\nto 46, but the systole remained stationary at 68, pulse 94, temperature 98.=\r\n4 (normal! what an irony!), breathing 22 per minute.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Morning darsh=\r\nan ran for half an hour, during which Maharshi&#39;s eyes remained closed a=\r\nnd when he occasionally opened them, they looked in front rather than to th=\r\ne left where the devotees were filing past him.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;His diet consists now of only buttermilk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;10 p.m=\r\n.: Owing to the very heavy attendance of visitors from all over the South, =\r\nnearly 1500, the evening darshan had to be lengthened to 45 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Many devotees remained till late in the evening to receive the final medic=\r\nal oral report for the day. At 9:30, Dr. Krishnamurti, a local physician an=\r\nd a great devotee, walked up to me and said: &#39;My own impression is that=\r\n there is no immediate danger. Bhagavan has just told the attendants to go =\r\nto sleep as he himself was going to do. His breathing is not laboured, and =\r\nthere is no gasping in evidence.&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Friday, 14th April: Maharshi=\r\n is in a very precarious condition. The whole morning has been spent by dev=\r\notees in hushed gloom and with bated breath. After evening darshan, the una=\r\nnimous verdict is that it is positively the last. The Master is now propped=\r\n on large pillows, almost in a sitting posture, the head resting backward w=\r\nith open mouth, and two attendants briskly fanning him, to enable him to br=\r\neathe freely-the battle for air, has thus started.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold&quot;&gt;At 7 p.m., oxygen is administered to him for about five minut=\r\nes, but seeing that it gave him no relief, he feebly asked that it should b=\r\ne stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The situation was tense: about five-hundred devo=\r\ntees were outside in sad expectation of the solemn last moment. Blood relat=\r\nions, Ashram workers, a few old disciples, and some new aspirants went in b=\r\ny turn to have a last sight of him. When the end was known to be approachin=\r\ng, the whole congregation with one voice started chanting the Tamil hymns h=\r\ne had many years ago composed in praise of Lord Arunachala: &quot;Arunachal=\r\na Shiva, Arunachala Shiva, Arunachala!&quot; till it came at about 8:47. Ma=\r\nny devotees, grief-stricken and beating their breasts, lost control of thei=\r\nr feelings and rushed en masse to the small room where the sacred body lay,=\r\n but police officers immediately cordoned off the area till it was brought =\r\nout and placed in the centre of the big darshan hall in yoga asana for all =\r\nthe people to pay their last respects to it. The news spread like wildfire =\r\nto the town and the neighboring villages and drew huge crowds. By 9:15, the=\r\n crowd grew so thick, that it became necessary to give a chance to all to p=\r\nay their homage and pass the body in an orderly manner. A queue was thus fo=\r\nrmed- seven to ten broad-at a quick-march pace. It is still (11:55 p.m.) co=\r\nntinuing unabatingly.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Around the sofa sat dozens of disciples, som=\r\ne chanting Maharshi&#39;s verses and other devotional hymns, but others rem=\r\nained in silent contemplation. Sandalwood paste and jasmine flowers now cov=\r\ner the body and incense burns by its side.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold&quot;&gt;At about 9 p.m.,Monsieur Cartier-Brassen, the French photographer=\r\n, who has been here for about a fortnight with his wife, related an experie=\r\nnce of his to me. &quot;It is a most astonishing experience,&quot; he said.=\r\n &quot;I was in the open space in front of my house, when my friends drew m=\r\ny attention to the sky, where I saw a vividly-luminous shooting star with a=\r\n luminous tail, unlike any shooting star I had before seen, coming from the=\r\n South, moving slowly across the sky and, reaching the top of Arunachala, d=\r\nisappeared behind it. Because of its singularity we all guessed its import =\r\nand immediately looked at our watches - it was 8:47 - and then raced to the=\r\n Ashram only to find that our premonition had been only too sadly true: the=\r\n Master had passed into Mahanirvana at that very minute.&quot; Several othe=\r\nr devotees in the Ashram and in the town later told me that they too had se=\r\nen the tell-tale meteor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;F=\r\nootnotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.
