This is wonderful. Thank you for sharing these =\r\ndaily inspirational gems with us..I feel that your words certainly help us =\r\nalong our spiritual journey in some way or another. I got goosebumbs while =\r\nreading the section about the Dakshina Kaali homam. Incidentally, it remind=\r\ned me of something that I had read before about a concept of &#39;Crystal Child=\r\nren&#39; - A new generation of children born to ease us into a new era of spiri=\r\ntuality:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Children-Doreen-Virtue/dp/140190229=\r\n4\n\n&quot;As babies, Crystal Children may take longer than normal to begin talkin=\r\ng. They are highly telepathic, and their tuned-in mothers communicate with =\r\nthem nonverbally. Because they&#39;re so sensitive, the Crystal Children babies=\r\n may fuss and cry a lot in crowded places. They&#39;re also very fond of nature=\r\n. Doreen once watched one Crystal Child walk from tree to tree, giving each=\r\n one a big hug.\n\nCrystal Children are beautiful inside and out, like magnif=\r\nicent little high-priests and priestesses. One look in their eyes, and you&#39;=\r\nll recognize Divine love and wisdom. Their auras are bright, radiant, and o=\r\npalescent=97they seem to glow from the inside! They talk about past lives, =\r\ndistant galaxies, and profound insights concerning peace and love. Most Cry=\r\nstal Children&#39;s parents are aware that their kids are special, and they&#39;re =\r\nthrilled to be parenting such delightful children.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
