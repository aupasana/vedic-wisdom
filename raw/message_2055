When you do sandhi, \n&quot;aaH + U&quot; becomes &quot;aaU&quot;, i.e. visarga after &quot;aa&quot; disappeares. So it becomes \n&quot;deevaaUchuH&quot;. The visarga at the end (after Uchu) cannot be skipped.\n\nWhen one pronounces visarga as ha, hi, hu etc (e.g. raamaha, harihi, guruhu, \ndevaaha, devyaha, devaihi etc), it may add a letter and break the flow and \nrhythm. If you pronounce visarga correctly, it should not break the flow.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 27, 2009 4:24 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Proper Gayatri Mantra Pronunciation and \nIntonation - Audio Source\n\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in \n&gt;&gt; &gt;Sanskrit as &quot;:&quot; and notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga &gt;means &quot;letting \n&gt;&gt;go&quot;. You are supposed to let air go from you lungs &gt;in a quick exhalation.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&gt;&gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words, \n&gt;&gt; respectively\n&gt;&gt; (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as\n&gt;&gt; letting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3\n&gt;&gt; words.\n&gt;\n&gt; I had this query in my mind since long time but i didn&#39;t ask you. also in \n&gt; the past, few questions which i wanted to ask you but didn&#39;t has been \n&gt; always answered by you by means of this forum.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now coming back to the Visarga -\n&gt; I was convinced when i read your above paragraph regarding pronunciation \n&gt; of Visarga (:, Ha). Technical also it looked correct.\n&gt;\n&gt; but when i was reciting CP yesterday i was having some doubts which are \n&gt; mentioned below along with some other related queries.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) I came across Deva Uchu: in the 4th chapter. Now i am convinced about \n&gt; DevaaH, RaamaH. IN This two words when you let go the air, you can \n&gt; naturally (effortlessly-without affecting the flow) pronuonce Ha (Not \n&gt; Haa). and i thought it is the same for others but when i came across \n&gt; Uchu:, i was in doubt for the consistency of the rule. What i mean here is \n&gt; that when i pronounce Uchu and then let go the air, the natural \n&gt; pronunciation seems to be &#39;Hu&#39;. for Uchu--Ha, i have to do some extra \n&gt; efforts. it does not seem natural.\n&gt; Likewise for the word, Devaei:, when you let go, natural following voice \n&gt; seems to be &#39;Hi..&#39;\n&gt; Surprisingly for Dewaa:, Ha seems to follow naturally and no need for Haa.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) More importantly, when i recite CP or any other Shlokaas, i have found \n&gt; that, many a times it obstruct the rythm when you try to pronounce \n&gt; Visargaas. Especially when Visarga come in between a shloka. what is the \n&gt; basic purpose of the Visarga in Sanskrit language? and what if i avoid \n&gt; some of the Visargaas which obstruct the flow?.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Please ignore if these questions are like unnecessary hair splitting \n&gt; analysis because I also feel that way at the moment. But I thought of \n&gt; asking you finally because the topic is relevant and the points I \n&gt; mentioned are practically experienced.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I cannot point to any audio that I found satisfactory.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please buy the book &quot;Mantrapushpam&quot; by Ramakrishna Mutt. It gives Gayatri\n&gt;&gt; mantra with intonation marked correctly. It has many other veda mantras \n&gt;&gt; too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I will point out a few standard mistakes I have seen people make:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (1) People normally pronounce anudattas and svaritas (letters with lines\n&gt;&gt; below or above) correctly, but mess up when a few udattas come in a row. \n&gt;&gt; For\n&gt;&gt; example, all the three letters in &quot;dheemahi&quot; are without any lines below \n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt; above. They have to be pronounced in the same pitch. People end up\n&gt;&gt; introducing some pitch variation and mispronouncing them. In veda \n&gt;&gt; mantras,\n&gt;&gt; pronouncing all udattas in the same pitch is the most important thing. Do\n&gt;&gt; not stress any letter or take the pitch up/down when pronouncing a string \n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; udattas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (2) The last syllable of &quot;prachodayaat&quot; is &quot;yaat&quot;. It is supposed to be \n&gt;&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; syllable. When you pronounce it correctly, &quot;t&quot; is hardly audible. If you\n&gt;&gt; artificially add an vowel at the end of it and make it &quot;prachodayaatu&quot;, \n&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; will end up introducing an extra syllable (&quot;tu&quot;) and mess up everything. \n&gt;&gt; A\n&gt;&gt; lot of people do not pronounce &quot;t&quot; correctly. Probably some guru sometime\n&gt;&gt; back started the practice of adding a brief vowel at the end of words \n&gt;&gt; ending\n&gt;&gt; in a consonant, so that his sishyas could listen clearly what consonant \n&gt;&gt; he\n&gt;&gt; was saying. Unfortunately, it became a standard practice. This is good \n&gt;&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; teaching, but wrong for sadhana. If a word ends in a consonant, end it \n&gt;&gt; with\n&gt;&gt; a consonant (which cannot be heard clearly unless one tried hard) and do \n&gt;&gt; NOT\n&gt;&gt; add a brief vowel after that consonant.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in \n&gt;&gt; Sanskrit\n&gt;&gt; as &quot;:&quot; and notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;. You are\n&gt;&gt; supposed to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation. \n&gt;&gt; Pronunciation\n&gt;&gt; of &quot;naH&quot; is very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again, this is\n&gt;&gt; supposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south Indians, \n&gt;&gt; make\n&gt;&gt; it &quot;naha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is added \n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; the mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In this style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is \n&gt;&gt; pronounced\n&gt;&gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&gt;&gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words, \n&gt;&gt; respectively\n&gt;&gt; (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as\n&gt;&gt; letting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3\n&gt;&gt; words.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Watch out for these 3 common mistakes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, as I keep saying, the pronunciation is only a small percentage \n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; it. Creating the right mental images and the perfect mental focus is more\n&gt;&gt; important. If you lose awareness of your body, successfully shut down all\n&gt;&gt; other thoughts in the mind and achieve a perfect mental focus on any veda\n&gt;&gt; mantra with correct pronunciation, it will be a fantastic experience. \n&gt;&gt; Please\n&gt;&gt; note that correct pronunciation is not difficult to achieve, but the \n&gt;&gt; other\n&gt;&gt; things I mentioned here are not that easy!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 8:57 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Proper Gayatri Mantra Pronunciation and \n&gt;&gt; Intonation -\n&gt;&gt; Audio Source\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Could you point me towards any easily obtainable audio recording of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Gayatri mantra which you deem to be correctly executed?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Also, would you mind typing it out here, phonetically?
