OR.\nOne can try to be as close to her as one can be and push t=\r\nhe limit.Wouldnt that be a right thing for a person who has a yet to shed a=\r\n load of karmas ??? \n\n*****************************************************=\r\n****************\n\n2.Where lies our own responsibility in handling our lives=\r\n ?? If most (99%) of what we do,is a result of conditioning and dominated b=\r\ny the law of cause and effect,wherein lies our share of responsibility ?? \n=\r\n\nAre we mere puppets in the hands of our past karmas ??....What is the solu=\r\ntion ???\n\n*****************************************************************=\r\n*****\n3.Keeping love towards a specific diety,what shud be our attitude tow=\r\nards the mantras,tantras ,homas etc ???..\nAre we supposed to view them as m=\r\nerely tools,roadways that lead to our goal or are they \nAre supreme denying=\r\n which even the deities cannot act ??\n\nI ask this question because of two f=\r\nactors :\nA) I have  read about some sadhanas requiring the sadhak to wear a=\r\n specific coloured cloth ,sit on a asan of certain colour,use a specific ma=\r\nla(rudraksha,padmabeeja etc) and do a specific no of repitations,which keep=\r\n varying.\n\n\nB)Why is sadhana important ??? Can ever increasing love for one=\r\n&#39;s diety be called a sadhana too ??? Does this help us to diminish karmas f=\r\nrom our causal body ??\n\n***************************************************=\r\n*******************\n\nI am a man who doesn&#39;t have much spiritual experiences=\r\n.So I have to ask the ones who might have some experiences and are more ele=\r\nvated than me and know if I am on the right path and where do I need correc=\r\ntions ?? :-)\n\nWith Warm Regards,\nParijat Dutta\n\n\n\n"}}
