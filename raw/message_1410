These and several other remedy prin=\r\nciples being advanced in recent years are merely principles taught in ONE p=\r\narampara. Moreover, this is a parampara represented by a single individual =\r\ntoday. There is no opportunity for cross-checking the presumed teachings of=\r\n this parampara with another representative to whom knowledge was passed in=\r\ndependently. Thus, they are not a part of what one would call &quot;tried and te=\r\nsted remedies&quot; of Indian astrologers for centuries.\n \n*        *        *\n =\r\n\nSimple and pure-hearted astrologers and religious people across India have=\r\n given simple remedies to &quot;average men&quot; successfully for ages. You have deb=\r\nt problems? Ok, then do Rina Vimochaka Angaraka stotra n times a day for m =\r\ndays. You want children? Ok, then do Santana Gopala mantra n times a day fo=\r\nr m days. Also, who is your 5th lord? Mars? Ok, then do Subrahmanyashtakam =\r\nn times everyday for m days. You want to get married? Who is your 7th lord?=\r\n Mercury? Ok, then do Vishnu sahasra naam everyday for n days.\n \nSimple stu=\r\nff like that. And it worked for ages for many faithful &quot;average men&quot;!\n \nThe=\r\ny used very few horoscopic factors and different groups of Jyotishis used d=\r\nifferent sets of common remedies successfully. This shows that there ARE ma=\r\nny paths, not just for spiritual progress but also for material progress th=\r\nrough prayer. In the same chart, various deities and various mantras can gi=\r\nve the desired material result. Most of them did not follow the strict &quot;dos=\r\n and don&#39;ts&quot; suggested in this specific parampara that I am questioning.\n \n=\r\n*        *        *\n \nIf a village astrologer gave a person a mantra to get=\r\n married, the person did it faithfully and devotedly and got married, how e=\r\nxactly did it work?\n \nIf the mantra works to the fullest, the person experi=\r\nences the mantra or mantra devata. This experience changes depending on the=\r\n mantra and mantra devata, but this is an absolutely tremendous experience =\r\nwhen and if it happens. However, this does not happen to most people, as th=\r\ney are not ready. If such a complete experience of a mantra were the goal, =\r\nvarious dictums of mantra shastra, a precise science, would be relevant.\n \n=\r\nInstead, if the person simply uses the mantra as a tool for begging the com=\r\npassionate Lord to give the little thing he asked for (a child or marriage =\r\nor a job etc), the Lord may give it when the karmik push behind the prayer =\r\nexceeds the karmic obstacles. It is not the precision of mantra shastra tha=\r\nt works, but the devotion, faith, surrender and desire of the astrologer an=\r\nd the person doing the mantra, creating the karmik push behind the mantra. =\r\nThe force of devotion, faith, surrender and desire in BOTH the persons are =\r\nimportant contributing factors.\n \nI suggest that it is the latter that happ=\r\nens in most of the &quot;tried and tested remedies&quot; given by astrologers and rel=\r\nigious people for ages. The guidelines they used are very few and the desir=\r\ne to help, devotion and faith are primary, while the actual mantra is secon=\r\ndary. That is why it does not matter that they are inconsistent and non-uni=\r\nform in the mantras given.\n \nI loosely used the terms commanding vs begging=\r\n for the above two approaches and said that most people are beggars.\n \nPeop=\r\nle are mixing up knowledge meant for the former approach with the latter ap=\r\nproach and also adding a lot of further complicated new astrology rules to =\r\nthe subject rather than sticking to &quot;tried and tested remedies for average =\r\nman&quot; used by many for ages. I am not the one mixing up, but they. I am actu=\r\nally suggesting to take a step back and appreciate how astrologers have suc=\r\ncessfully given &quot;tried and tested remedies for average man&quot; for ages and no=\r\nt complicate things now unnecessarily. The complications being introduced n=\r\now distract us from the main problem rather than solving it. What is our ma=\r\nin problem in astrological remedies today?\n \nAstrologers are increasingly b=\r\necoming more egoistic, less spiritually developed and less pure-hearted now=\r\n, compared to the simple, pure-hearted and saintly astrologers of old days.=\r\n Faith and devotion in general populace are also going down. So the effecti=\r\nveness of remedies is going down compared to centuries or even decades back=\r\n and people are slowly losing faith even more. For this reason, what we nee=\r\nd to emphasize is *faith and devotion*, and *not* complicated new technical=\r\nities WITHOUT WHICH many astrologers have been giving &quot;tried and tested rem=\r\nedies for average man&quot; for ages!\n \n*        *        *\n \nI think my main po=\r\nint finally came out the way I wanted. I think I have fulfilled my dharma w=\r\nith this topic and can now move on. Adios.\n \nBTW, regarding religious psych=\r\nology part at the end: This was just ONE analogy. My writings on spirituali=\r\nty on vedic-wisdom yahoogroup are filled with tens of analogies. I use anal=\r\nogies heavily. You can do a better psycho-analysis if you study all of them=\r\n, rather than a one-off analogy!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.ne=\r\nt\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------- \n \n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear Bharatji,\n=\r\n&gt; In essence, I dont see where we disagree? You seem to be exactly echoing =\r\nwhat I say. Is it simply the term idol worship? An idol is a *material* rep=\r\nresentation of a deity with some sense of sacredness attached to that mater=\r\nial representation. Of course most Hindus do that (why else are idols kept =\r\nin temples.. the majority dont have a clue of Advaita Vedanta, if that&#39;s wh=\r\nere you&#39;re going with this discussion). And there is nothing wrong with it =\r\nfrom my point of view. Exactly as you say, *most* human beings need materia=\r\nl symbols to focus their faith, and many Hindus choose idols, and Christian=\r\ns use christ-on-a-cross, and Muslims have the koran, and Sikhs keep the gur=\r\nu-granth-sahib on a pillow in the gurudwara etc etc. And they all have thei=\r\nr sacred places of worship (all of them are material representations..).Psy=\r\nchologically speaking, they *all* unconsciously project the power of the Se=\r\nlf/Atma, which they see as God (or a deity), into different material symbol=\r\ns. Nothing wrong with that, IMHO. Did you by chance mistake my presenting A=\r\nbraham&#39;s attitude as my own? \n&gt; \n&gt; Getting back to my real point, which is =\r\ncompletely orthogonal to yours (as I said I agree with all your points). Th=\r\nat is this: I think that as one spiritually progresses, their need for symb=\r\nols and doing specific rituals on certain dates etc decreases as their own =\r\nsense of submission to, and their awareness of, their true Self increases. =\r\nBut that doesnt mean that all these facts that Sanjayji, Michal, Zoran etc =\r\npresent are wrong for *the average person*. My view is that Narasimhaji is =\r\nmixing up the results of his own personal spiritual progress with the tried=\r\n and tested remedies *for the average man* given by Jyotishis. Put differen=\r\ntly, an average ego-obsessed person does probably need to do all the right =\r\nthings on all the right dates and times to cultivate the beginnings of a se=\r\nnse of submission. And as that sense grows, he can afford to relax the rule=\r\ns. So Jyotishis should give remedies for the person at *his/her* level of s=\r\npiritual progress, not *theirs*.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is what I think, but of course I=\r\n may be wrong.. Do you have some disagreement with this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Sundeep\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, Bharat - Hindu Astrology &lt;ast=\r\nrologyhindu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sundeep\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please pardon my inte=\r\nrvention. Hindus are not idol worshipers. And it is the\n&gt; &gt; Hindus who know=\r\n that Lord only is. They do not use the word &quot;one&quot;, since\n&gt; &gt; &quot;one&quot; presupp=\r\noses &quot;two&quot; and &quot;three&quot;... and so on. Since Lord only is, the\n&gt; &gt; entirety i=\r\ns contained within in including all time, space and causation.\n&gt; &gt; Every ob=\r\nject, every being is contained within the Lord. For an untrained\n&gt; &gt; mind, =\r\nit is difficult to consume this. To focus one&#39;s attention to this\n&gt; &gt; princ=\r\niple he needs something tangible. So an object that can signify this\n&gt; &gt; pr=\r\ninciple to the person becomes an object of worship. Once this shape is\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ngiven to the object... it is never considered an Idol. It is worshipped as\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; God itself. Noone goes to the temple and says &quot; Hey Idol, ....&quot; , every=\r\none\n&gt; &gt; fold their hands and say &quot;Hey Krishna or Hey Rama or Hey Shiva ....=\r\n.&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The people who wrongly call hindus idol worshippers are themse=\r\nlves\n&gt; &gt; worshipping the idols. What is a cross? What is a the book Koran o=\r\nr the\n&gt; &gt; image of Mecca or the words &quot;Allah Hu Akbar&quot; inscribed on a plate=\r\n? These all\n&gt; &gt; are Idols. Aren&#39;t they?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So long is there a world a=\r\nnd realization does not dawn upon oneself, one\n&gt; &gt; would need something to =\r\nfocus their mind with. This in our scriptures have\n&gt; &gt; been suggested throu=\r\ngh various ways:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Shapes and Symbols\n&gt; &gt; 2. Elements\n&gt; &gt; 3. Upas=\r\nanas: Observing the nature and relating it to the Truth. Like endless\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\ns the space and time and relating the quality of endless to the Truth.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n4. Mantra Japa- Herein the sound reverberates with the certain\n&gt; &gt; element/=\r\naspect of nature. To that root is added our request. For those who\n&gt; &gt; seek=\r\n the truth, the mantra japa serves as a constant reminder of the what\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe Truth is. For those how seek certain ends from it, they gain only that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; much.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Therefore Sundeep, I request you to study our culture mor=\r\ne and you shall\n&gt; &gt; find nothing that is sane and truthful missing from it.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Narasimha is suggesting that we do not command the Lord and w=\r\norship him\n&gt; &gt; undertaking any appealing mantra - which essentially means t=\r\nhat the more we\n&gt; &gt; understand its meaning the idea of the Lord shall becom=\r\ne clearer and clearer\n&gt; &gt; in our minds. This approach is for spiritual aspi=\r\nrants who are willing to\n&gt; &gt; &quot;let go themselves in the hands of the lord&quot;. =\r\nThis is something that one has\n&gt; &gt; to realize for oneself and not impose on=\r\n others. Furthermore, it should not\n&gt; &gt; be called &quot;begging&quot;. There is no di=\r\nfference between the Lord and our True\n&gt; &gt; Self. To call ourselves beggars =\r\nis to defile us and Srimad Bhagavad Gita\n&gt; &gt; warns against such a self judg=\r\nement.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most people do not use the above approach, they want s=\r\npecific remedies for\n&gt; &gt; their specific problems and that too quickly. The =\r\nMantra Shastra helps both\n&gt; &gt; approaches. For the students, I think it is t=\r\nhis part they should learn as\n&gt; &gt; Jyotishas and the above part shall come a=\r\nutomatically with their spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &quot;growth&quot; and understanding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHope this helps\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards\n&gt; &gt; Bharat\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Mar=\r\n 3, 2009 at 4:07 AM, vedicastrostudent &lt;\n&gt; &gt; vedicastrostudent@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji (and it might help others to read this fully too,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trust me you may well be satisfied),\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; First, let me say I =\r\nam not about to either agree/disagree with you. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am only standing ba=\r\nck and observing/categorizing your approach, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comparing it histori=\r\ncal events that will give me a sense of the final\n&gt; &gt; &gt; import of your appr=\r\noach.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you read about Abraham, the supposed &quot;father&quot; of the t=\r\nhree\n&gt; &gt; &gt; religions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam) that have together h=\r\nad the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most following among all religions in the world (ever). As far=\r\n as I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know, he lived in a time of deities and ritual. He is supposedl=\r\ny the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first to have actively sought to bring the notion of one God to=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; masses. He destroyed idols much to the dissatisfaction of lots a=\r\nround\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him. Apparently God revealed himself to Abraham several times.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Abraham submitted himself completely to the will of God, always,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; without question. It seems logical to conclude that he destroyed and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; denounced idolatry because he felt, at the very least, that focus on\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; the multiplicity of deity and webs of rituals took *away* a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; focus from the real thing - submission to the one and only God (which\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; is what Abraham was really about i.e. submission to the one and only\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; God). Before jumping to any conclusions about what I am trying to say,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; please read on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Me, I&#39;m fascinated by religious psychology=\r\n, i.e. what drives people to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe in God and how. I *dont seek to =\r\ndenounce* either Abraham or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the idolaters (Hindus would obviously com=\r\ne to mind here), only to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understand them. The way I have found to uni=\r\nfy these two seemingly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; contradictory approaches is the following, and=\r\n perhaps it will help\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you as well: God is *eventually only one* of co=\r\nurse and &quot;resides&quot; deep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within us, and projects himself (I use &quot;proje=\r\nct&quot; in exactly the sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Michal describes) in various ways into human=\r\n experience. As people get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritually elevated, the projections beco=\r\nme less necessary and they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are able to have a more and more direct ex=\r\nperience of God.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Consequently, they start forgetting the role the pro=\r\njections\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *originally had in the beginning of their path* and consider=\r\n the most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important thing to be the complete submission to the *growi=\r\nng* inner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; light of God within themselves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My feeling is t=\r\nhat that is what happened to Abraham, and is what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happening to you=\r\n as well. Psychologically and astrologically speaking,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the examples y=\r\nou choose to illustrate your point betray your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; psychology. You have u=\r\nnconsciously chosen an example of a mountain,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the *final God exp=\r\nerience* sitting on top. That final God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience is the Sun, astrol=\r\nogically speaking i.e. the source, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; symbol of the growing inner li=\r\nght within *you*. The various paths to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the top that you talk about re=\r\npresent, I think, Mercury, with its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; various forms and distinctions (P=\r\nrithvi tattwa?). As you behold the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sun, the king, in all his magnific=\r\nence, everything else pales in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comparison.

You seem to be \nexactly echoing what I say. Is it si=\r\nmply the term idol worship? An idol is a \n*material* representation of a de=\r\nity with some sense of sacredness attached to \nthat material representation=\r\n. Of course most Hindus do that (why else are idols \nkept in temples.. the =\r\nmajority dont have a clue of Advaita Vedanta, if that&#39;s \nwhere you&#39;re going=\r\n with this discussion). And there is nothing wrong with it \nfrom my point o=\r\nf view. Exactly as you say, *most* human beings need material \nsymbols to f=\r\nocus their faith, and many Hindus choose idols, and Christians use \nchrist-=\r\non-a-cross, and Muslims have the koran, and Sikhs keep the \nguru-granth-sah=\r\nib on a pillow in the gurudwara etc etc. And they all have their \nsacred pl=\r\naces of worship (all of them are material \nrepresentations..).Psychological=\r\nly speaking, they *all* unconsciously project \nthe power of the Self/Atma, =\r\nwhich they see as God (or a deity), into different \nmaterial symbols. Nothi=\r\nng wrong with that, IMHO. Did you by chance mistake my \npresenting Abraham&#39;=\r\ns attitude as my own? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&gt; Getting back to my real point, which is completely=\r\n \northogonal to yours (as I said I agree with all your points). That is thi=\r\ns: I \nthink that as one spiritually progresses, their need for symbols and =\r\ndoing \nspecific rituals on certain dates etc decreases as their own sense o=\r\nf submission \nto, and their awareness of, their true Self increases. But th=\r\nat doesnt mean that \nall these facts that Sanjayji, Michal, Zoran etc prese=\r\nnt are wrong for *the \naverage person*. My view is that Narasimhaji is mixi=\r\nng up the results of his own \npersonal spiritual progress with the tried an=\r\nd tested remedies *for the average \nman* given by Jyotishis. Put differentl=\r\ny, an average ego-obsessed person does \nprobably need to do all the right t=\r\nhings on all the right dates and times to \ncultivate the beginnings of a se=\r\nnse of submission. And as that sense grows, he \ncan afford to relax the rul=\r\nes. So Jyotishis should give remedies for the person \nat *his/her* level of=\r\n spiritual progress, not *theirs*.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&gt; &lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&gt; This is what I think, but of course I =\r\nmay be wrong..

It seems logica=\r\nl to conclude \nthat he destroyed and&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; denounced idolatry because he felt, at the very \nleast, that focu=\r\ns on&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the multiplicity of de=\r\nity and webs of rituals \ntook *away* a person&#39;s&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; focus from the real thing - submission to the \none and=\r\n only God (which&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is what Ab=\r\nraham was really about i.e. \nsubmission to the one and only&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; God).
