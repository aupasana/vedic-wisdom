I remember an old story. In India, taking wine is\nconsi=\r\ndered very bad. There were two brothers who wished, one night, to drink\nwin=\r\ne secretly; and their uncle, who was a very orthodox man was sleeping in\na =\r\nroom quite close to theirs. So, before they began to drink, they said to\nea=\r\nch other, &quot;We must be very silent, or uncle will wake up.&quot;\n\nWhen they were =\r\ndrinking, they continued repeating to each other &quot;Silence!\nUncle will wake =\r\nup&quot;, each trying to shout the other down. And, as the\nshouting increased, t=\r\nhe uncle woke up, came into the room, and discovered\nthe whole thing. Now, =\r\nwe all shout like these drunken men,&quot; Universal\nbrotherhood! We are all equ=\r\nal, therefore let us make a sect.&quot; As soon as you\nmake a sect you protest a=\r\ngainst equality, and equality is no more. Mohammedans\ntalk of universal bro=\r\ntherhood, but what comes out of that in reality? Why,\nanybody who is not a =\r\nMohammedan will not be admitted into the brotherhood;\nhe will more likely h=\r\nave his throat cut. Christians talk of universal\nbrotherhood; but anyone wh=\r\no is not a Christian must go to that place where\nhe will be eternally barbe=\r\ncued.\n\nSo far we see that it is hard to find any universal features in rega=\r\nrd to\nreligion, and yet we know that they exist. We are all human beings, b=\r\nut are\nwe all equal? Certainly not. Who says we are equal? Only the lunatic=\r\n. Are we\nall equal in our brains, in our powers, in our bodies? One man is =\r\nstronger\nthan another, one man has more brain power than another. If we are=\r\n all\nequal, why is there this inequality? Who made it? We. Because we have =\r\nmore\nor less powers, more or less brain, more or less physical strength, it=\r\n must\nmake a difference between us. Yet we know that the doctrine of equali=\r\nty\nappeals to our heart.\n\nThe unity of sameness can come only when this uni=\r\nverse is destroyed,\notherwise such a thing is impossible.\n\nWe must learn th=\r\nat truth may be expressed in a hundred thousand ways, and\nthat each of thes=\r\ne ways is true as far as it goes.We must learn that the\nsame thing can be v=\r\niewed from a hundred different standpoints, and vet be\nthe same thing. Take=\r\n for instance the sun. Suppose a man standing on the\nearth looks at the sun=\r\n when it rises in the morning; he sees a big ball.\nSuppose he starts on a j=\r\nourney towards the sun and takes a camera with him,\ntaking photographs at e=\r\nvery stage of his journey, until he reaches the sun.\nThe photographs of eac=\r\nh stage will be seen to be different from those of the\nother stages; in fac=\r\nt, when he gets back, he brings with him so many\nphotographs of so many dif=\r\nferent suns, as it would appear; and yet we know\nthat the same sun was phot=\r\nographed by the man at the different stages of his\nprogress.\n\nEven so is it=\r\n with the Lord. Through high philosophy or low, through the\nmost exalted my=\r\nthology or the grossest, through the most refined ritualism\nor arrant fetis=\r\nhism, every sect, every soul, every nation, every religion,\nconsciously or =\r\nunconsciously, is struggling upward, towards God; every\nvision of truth tha=\r\nt man has, is a vision of Him and of none else. Suppose\nwe all go with vess=\r\nels in our hands to fetch water from a lake. One has a\ncup, another a jar, =\r\nanother a bucket, and so forth, and we all fill our\nvessels. The water in e=\r\nach case naturally takes the form of the vessel\ncarried by each of us. He w=\r\nho brought the cup has the water in the form of a\ncup; he who brought the j=\r\nar =97 his water is in the shape of a jar, and so\nforth; but, in every case=\r\n, water, and nothing but water, is in the vessel. So\nit is in the case of r=\r\neligion; our minds are like these vessels, and each\none of us is trying to =\r\narrive at the realisation of God. God is like that\nwater filling these diff=\r\nerent vessels, and in each vessel the vision of God\ncomes in the form of th=\r\ne vessel. Yet He is One. He is God in every case.\nThis is the only recognit=\r\nion of universality that we can get.\n\nI have also my little plan. I do not =\r\nknow whether it will work or not, and I\nwant to present it to you for discu=\r\nssion. What is my plan? In the first\nplace I would ask mankind to recognise=\r\n this maxim, &quot;Do not destroy&quot;.\nIconoclastic\nreformers do no good to the wor=\r\nld. Break not, pull not anything down, but\nbuild. Help, if you can; if you =\r\ncannot, fold your hands and stand by and see\nthings go on. Do not injure, i=\r\nf you cannot render help. Say not a word\nagainst any man&#39;s convictions so f=\r\nar as they are sincere. Secondly, take man\nwhere he stands, and from there =\r\ngive him a lift.\n\nEach of us is naturally growing and developing according =\r\nto his own nature;\neach will in time come to know the highest truth for aft=\r\ner all, men must\nteach themselves.\n\nWhat can you and I do? Do you think you=\r\n can teach even a child? You cannot.\nThe child teaches himself. Your duty i=\r\ns to afford opportunities and to\nremove obstacles. A plant grows. Do you ma=\r\nke the plant grow? Your duty is to\nput a hedge round it and see that no ani=\r\nmal eats up the plant, and there\nyour duty ends. The plant grows of itself.=\r\n So it is in regard to the\nspiritual growth of every man. None can teach yo=\r\nu; none can make a spiritual\nman of you. You have to teach yourself; your g=\r\nrowth must come from inside.\n\nWhat can an external teacher do? He can remov=\r\ne the obstructions a little,\nand there his duty ends. Therefore help, if yo=\r\nu can; but do not destroy.\nGive up all ideas that you can make men spiritua=\r\nl. It is impossible. There\nis no other teacher to you than your own soul. R=\r\necognise this. What comes of\nit? In society we see so many different nature=\r\ns. There are thousands and\nthousands of varieties of minds and inclinations=\r\n. A thorough generalisation\nof them is impossible, but for our practical pu=\r\nrpose it is sufficient to\nhave them characterised into four classes.\n\nTo be=\r\ncome harmoniously balanced in all these four directions is my ideal of\nreli=\r\ngion. And this religion is attained by what we, in India, call Yoga =97\nuni=\r\non. To the worker, it is union between men and the whole of humanity; to\nth=\r\ne mystic, between his lower and Higher Self; to the lover, union between\nhi=\r\nmself and the God of Love; and to the philosopher; it is the union of all\ne=\r\nxistence. This is what is meant by Yoga. This is a Sanskrit term, and these=\r\n\nfour divisions of Yoga have in Sanskrit different names. The man who seeks=\r\n\nafter this kind of union is called a Yogi. The worker is called the\nKarma-=\r\nYogi. He who seeks the union through love is called the Bhakti-Yogi.\nHe who=\r\n seeks it through mysticism is called the R=E2ja-Yogi. And he who seeks\nit =\r\nthrough philosophy is called the Jn=E2na-Yogi So this word Yogi comprises\nt=\r\nhem all.\n\nThe first test of true teaching must be, that the teaching should=\r\n not\ncontradict reason. And you may see that such is the basis of all these=\r\n\nYogas. We take the Raja-Yoga, the psychological Yoga, the psychological wa=\r\ny\nto union. It is a vast subject, and I can only point out to you now the\nc=\r\nentral idea of this Yoga. We have but one method of acquiring knowledge.\nFr=\r\nom the lowest man to the highest Yogi, all have to use the same method;\nand=\r\n that method is what is called concentration.\n\nNow take Karma-Yoga, the att=\r\nainment of God through work. It is evident that\nin society there are many p=\r\nersons who seem to be born for some sort of\nactivity or other, whose minds =\r\ncannot be concentrated on the plane of\nthought alone, and who have but one =\r\nidea, concretised in work, visible and\ntangible. There must be a science fo=\r\nr this kind of life too.\n\nKarma-Yoga teaches us how to work for work&#39;s sake=\r\n, unattached, without\ncaring who is helped, and what for.\n\nThere is then th=\r\ne Bhakti-Yoga for the man of emotional nature, the lover. He\nwants to love =\r\nGod, he relies upon and uses all sorts of rituals, flowers,\nincense, beauti=\r\nful buildings, forms and all such things. Do you mean to say\nthey are wrong=\r\n? One fact I must tell you. It is good for you to remember, in\nthis country=\r\n especially, that the world&#39;s great spiritual giants have all\nbeen produced=\r\n only by those religious sects which have been in possession of\nvery rich m=\r\nythology and ritual. All sects that have attempted to worship God\nwithout a=\r\nny form or ceremony have crushed without mercy everything that is\nbeautiful=\r\n and sublime in religion.\n\nWe lastly come to the Jnana-Yogi, the philosophe=\r\nr, the thinker, he who wants\nto go beyond the visible. He is the man who is=\r\n not satisfied with the little\nthings of this world. His idea is to go beyo=\r\nnd the daily routine of eating,\ndrinking, and so on; not even the teaching =\r\nof thousands of books will\nsatisfy him. Not even all the sciences will sati=\r\nsfy him; at the best, they\nonly bring this little world before him.\n\nUpon t=\r\nhe same tree there are two birds, one on the top, the other below. The\none =\r\non the top is calm, silent, and majestic, immersed in his own glory; the\non=\r\ne on the lower branches, eating sweet and bitter fruits by turns, hopping\nf=\r\nrom branch to branch, is becoming happy and miserable by turns. After a\ntim=\r\ne the lower bird eats an exceptionally bitter fruit and gets disgustful\nand=\r\n looks up and sees the other bird, that wondrous one of golden plumage,\nwho=\r\n eats neither sweet nor bitter fruit, who is neither happy nor miserable,\nb=\r\nut calm, Self-centred, and sees nothing beyond his Self.\n\nThe lower bird lo=\r\nngs for this condition but soon forgets it, and again\nbegins to eat the fru=\r\nits. In a little while, he eats another exceptionally\nbitter fruit, which m=\r\nakes him feel miserable, and he again looks up, and\ntries to get nearer to =\r\nthe upper bird. Once more he forgets and after a time\nhe looks up, and so o=\r\nn he goes again and again, until he comes very near to\nthe beautiful bird a=\r\nnd sees the reflection of light from his plumage playing\naround his own bod=\r\ny, and he feels a change and seems to melt away; still\nnearer he comes, and=\r\n everything about him melts away, and at last he\nunderstands this wonderful=\r\n change.\n\n\nThe lower bird was, as it were, only the substantial-looking sha=\r\ndow, the\nreflection of the higher; he himself was in essence the upper bird=\r\n all the\ntime. This eating of fruits, sweet and bitter, this lower, little =\r\nbird,\nweeping and happy by turns, was a vain chimera, a dream: all along, t=\r\nhe real\nbird was there above, calm and silent, glorious and majestic, beyon=\r\nd grief,\nbeyond sorrow. The upper bird is God, the Lord of this universe; a=\r\nnd the\nlower bird is the human soul, eating the sweet and bitter fruits of =\r\nthis\nworld. Now and then comes a heavy blow to the soul. For a time, he sto=\r\nps the\neating and goes towards the unknown God, and a flood of light comes.=\r\n He\nthinks that this world is a vain show. Yet again the senses drag hint d=\r\nown,\nand he begins as before to eat the sweet and bitter fruits of the worl=\r\nd.\nAgain an exceptionally hard blow comes.\n\nHis heart becomes open again to=\r\n divine light; thus gradually he approaches\nGod, and as he gets nearer and =\r\nnearer, he finds his old self melting away.\nWhen he has come near enough, h=\r\ne sees that he is no other than God, and he\nexclaims, &quot;He whom I have descr=\r\nibed to you as the Life of this universe, as\npresent in the atom, and in su=\r\nns and moons =97 He is the basis of our own\nlife, the Soul of our soul. Nay=\r\n, thou art That.&quot; This is what this\nJnana-Yoga teaches. It tells man that h=\r\ne is essentially divine. It shows to\nmankind the real unity of being, and t=\r\nhat each one of us is the Lord God\nHimself, manifested on earth. All of us,=\r\n from the lowest worm that crawls\nunder our feet to the highest beings to w=\r\nhom we look up with wonder and awe\n=97 all are manifestations of the same L=\r\nord.\n\nLastly, it is imperative that all these various Yogas should be carri=\r\ned out\nin, practice; mere theories about them will not do any good. First w=\r\ne have\nto hear about them, then we have to think about them. We have to rea=\r\nson the\nthoughts out, impress them on our minds, and we have to meditate on=\r\n them,\nrealise them, until at last they become our whole life.\n\nNo longer w=\r\nill religion remain a bundle of ideas or theories, nor an\nintellectual asse=\r\nnt; it will enter into our very self. By means of\nintellectual assent we ma=\r\ny today subscribe to many foolish things, and\nchange our minds altogether t=\r\nomorrow. But true religion never changes.\nReligion is realisation; not talk=\r\n, nor doctrine, nor theories, however\nbeautiful they may be. It is being an=\r\nd becoming, not hearing or\nacknowledging; it is the whole soul becoming cha=\r\nnged into what it believes.\nThat is religion.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource=\r\n.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Practical_Vedant=\r\na_and_other_lectures/The_Ideal_of_a_Universal_Religion\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagava=\r\nte Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--0014853dfa8bb1da720471ca5118\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family=\r\n:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75e=\r\nm;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;We all hear about universal brotherhoo=\r\nd, and how societies stand up especially to preach this.

So, before=\r\n they began to drink, they said to each other, &quot;We must be very silent=\r\n, or uncle will wake up.&quot;=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;When they were drinking, they c=\r\nontinued repeating to each other &quot;Silence! Uncle will wake up&quot;, e=\r\nach trying to shout the other down. And, as the shouting increased, the unc=\r\nle woke up, came into the room, and discovered the whole thing. Now, we all=\r\n shout like these drunken men,&quot; Universal brotherhood! We are all equa=\r\nl, therefore let us make a sect.&quot; As soon as you make a sect you prote=\r\nst against equality, and equality is no more.=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:i=\r\ntalic&quot;&gt;Mohammedans talk of universal brotherhood, but what comes out of tha=\r\nt in reality? Why, anybody who is not a Mohammedan will not be admitted int=\r\no the brotherhood; he will more likely have his throat cut. Christians talk=\r\n of universal brotherhood; but anyone who is not a Christian must go to tha=\r\nt place where he will be eternally barbecued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;So far we se=\r\ne that it is hard to find any universal features in regard to religion, and=\r\n yet we know that they exist.=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;We are all=\r\n human beings, but are we all equal?

One man is stronger than another, one man has more brain power than an=\r\nother. If we are all equal, why is there this inequality? Who made it? We. =\r\nBecause we have more or less powers, more or less brain, more or less physi=\r\ncal strength, it must make a difference between us. Yet we know that the do=\r\nctrine of equality appeals to our heart.&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The unity of sameness can come only when this universe i=\r\ns destroyed, otherwise such a thing is impossible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We must le=\r\narn that truth may be expressed in a hundred thousand ways, and that each o=\r\nf these ways is true as far as it goes.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;We=\r\n must learn that the same thing can be viewed from a hundred different stan=\r\ndpoints, and vet be the same thing. Take for instance the sun. Suppose a ma=\r\nn standing on the earth looks at the sun when it rises in the morning; he s=\r\nees a big ball. Suppose he starts on a journey towards the sun and takes a =\r\ncamera with him, taking photographs at every stage of his journey, until he=\r\n reaches the sun. The photographs of each stage will be seen to be differen=\r\nt from those of the other stages; in fact, when he gets back, he brings wit=\r\nh him so many photographs of so many different suns, as it would appear; an=\r\nd yet we know that the same sun was photographed by the man at the differen=\r\nt stages of his progress.&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:ita=\r\nlic&quot;&gt;Even so is it with the Lord.&lt;/span&gt;=A0Through high philosophy or low, =\r\nthrough the most exalted mythology or the grossest, through the most refine=\r\nd ritualism or arrant fetishism, every sect, every soul, every nation, ever=\r\ny religion, consciously or unconsciously, is struggling upward, towards God=\r\n; every vision of truth that man has, is a vision of Him and of none else. =\r\nSuppose we all go with vessels in our hands to fetch water from a lake.

To the worker, it =\r\nis union between men and the whole of humanity; to the mystic, between his =\r\nlower and Higher Self; to the lover, union between himself and the God of L=\r\nove; and to the philosopher; it is the union of all existence. This is what=\r\n is meant by Yoga. This is a Sanskrit term, and these four divisions of Yog=\r\na have in Sanskrit different names. The man who seeks after this kind of un=\r\nion is called a Yogi. The worker is called the=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold&quot;&gt;Karma-Yogi&lt;/span&gt;. He who seeks the union through love is called the=\r\n=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhakti-Yogi&lt;/span&gt;. He who seeks it thr=\r\nough mysticism is called the=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;R=E2ja-Yogi=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;. And he who seeks it through philosophy is called the=A0&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Jn=E2na-Yogi&lt;/span&gt;=A0So this word Yogi comprises the=\r\nm all.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;The first test of true teaching must be, that the teaching=\r\n should not contradict reason. And you may see that such is the basis of al=\r\nl these Yogas. We take the Raja-Yoga, the psychological Yoga, the psycholog=\r\nical way to union. It is a vast subject, and I can only point out to you no=\r\nw the central idea of this Yoga. We have but one method of acquiring knowle=\r\ndge. From the lowest man to the highest Yogi, all have to use the same meth=\r\nod; and that method is what is called concentration.=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Now take Karma-Yoga, the attainment of God through =\r\nwork.&lt;/span&gt;=A0It is evident that in society there are many persons who see=\r\nm to be born for some sort of activity or other, whose minds cannot be conc=\r\nentrated on the plane of thought alone, and who have but one idea, concreti=\r\nsed in work, visible and tangible. There must be a science for this kind of=\r\n life too.=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Karma-Yoga teaches=\r\n us how to work for work&#39;s sake, unattached, without caring who is help=\r\ned, and what for.&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is then the=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nweight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhakti-Yoga&lt;/span&gt;=A0for the man of emotional nature, the love=\r\nr. He wants to love God, he relies upon and uses all sorts of rituals, flow=\r\ners, incense, beautiful buildings, forms and all such things. Do you mean t=\r\no say they are wrong? One fact I must tell you. It is good for you to remem=\r\nber, in this country especially, that the world&#39;s great spiritual giant=\r\ns have all been produced only by those religious sects which have been in p=\r\nossession of very rich mythology and ritual. All sects that have attempted =\r\nto worship God without any form or ceremony have crushed without mercy ever=\r\nything that is beautiful and sublime in religion.=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;We lastly co=\r\nme to the=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Jnana-Yogi&lt;/span&gt;, the philoso=\r\npher, the thinker, he who wants to go beyond the visible. He is the man who=\r\n is not satisfied with the little things of this world. His idea is to go b=\r\neyond the daily routine of eating, drinking, and so on; not even the teachi=\r\nng of thousands of books will satisfy him. Not even all the sciences will s=\r\natisfy him; at the best, they only bring this little world before him.=A0&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Upon the same tree there are two =\r\nbirds, one on the top, the other below. The one on the top is calm, silent,=\r\n and majestic, immersed in his own glory; the one on the lower branches, ea=\r\nting sweet and bitter fruits by turns, hopping from branch to branch, is be=\r\ncoming happy and miserable by turns. After a time the lower bird eats an ex=\r\nceptionally bitter fruit and gets disgustful and looks up and sees the othe=\r\nr bird, that wondrous one of golden plumage, who eats neither sweet nor bit=\r\nter fruit, who is neither happy nor miserable, but calm, Self-centred, and =\r\nsees nothing beyond his Self.=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;The lower bird longs for this condition but soon forgets it, and ag=\r\nain begins to eat the fruits. In a little while, he eats another exceptiona=\r\nlly bitter fruit, which makes him feel miserable, and he again looks up, an=\r\nd tries to get nearer to the upper bird. Once more he forgets and after a t=\r\nime he looks up, and so on he goes again and again, until he comes very nea=\r\nr to the beautiful bird and sees the reflection of light from his plumage p=\r\nlaying around his own body, and he feels a change and seems to melt away; s=\r\ntill nearer he comes, and everything about him melts away, and at last he u=\r\nnderstands this wonderful change.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lower bird was, =\r\nas it were, only the substantial-looking shadow, the reflection of the high=\r\ner; he himself was in essence the upper bird all the time. This eating of f=\r\nruits, sweet and bitter, this lower, little bird, weeping and happy by turn=\r\ns, was a vain chimera, a dream: all along, the real bird was there above, c=\r\nalm and silent, glorious and majestic, beyond grief, beyond sorrow.=A0&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The upper bird is God, the Lord of this univers=\r\ne; and the lower bird is the human soul, eating the sweet and bitter fruits=\r\n of this world.&lt;/span&gt;=A0Now and then comes a heavy blow to the soul.=A0&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;For a time, he stops the eating and goes towa=\r\nrds the unknown God, and a flood of light comes. He thinks that this world =\r\nis a vain show. Yet again the senses drag hint down, and he begins as befor=\r\ne to eat the sweet and bitter fruits of the world. Again an exceptionally h=\r\nard blow comes.&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;His heart becomes open again to divine =\r\nlight; thus gradually he approaches God, and as he gets nearer and nearer, =\r\nhe finds his old self melting away. When he has come near enough, he sees t=\r\nhat he is no other than God, and he exclaims, &quot;He whom I have describe=\r\nd to you as the Life of this universe, as present in the atom, and in suns =\r\nand moons =97 He is the basis of our own life, the Soul of our soul. Nay, t=\r\nhou art That.&quot;=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;This is what this Jn=\r\nana-Yoga teaches. It tells man that he is essentially divine. It shows to m=\r\nankind the real unity of being, and that each one of us is the Lord God Him=\r\nself, manifested on earth. All of us, from the lowest worm that crawls unde=\r\nr our feet to the highest beings to whom we look up with wonder and awe =97=\r\n all are manifestations of the same Lord.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Lastly, it is im=\r\nperative that all these various Yogas should be carried out in, practice; m=\r\nere theories about them will not do any good. First we have to hear about t=\r\nhem, then we have to think about them. We have to reason the thoughts out, =\r\nimpress them on our minds, and we have to meditate on them, realise them, u=\r\nntil at last they become our whole life.=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;No longer will religi=\r\non remain a bundle of ideas or theories, nor an intellectual assent; it wil=\r\nl enter into our very self. By means of intellectual assent we may today su=\r\nbscribe to many foolish things, and change our minds altogether tomorrow. B=\r\nut true religion never changes. Religion is realisation; not talk, nor doct=\r\nrine, nor theories, however beautiful they may be. It is being and becoming=\r\n, not hearing or acknowledging; it is the whole soul becoming changed into =\r\nwhat it believes. That is religion.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Wo=\r\nrks_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Practical_Vedanta_and_other_lectures/The_=\r\nIdeal_of_a_Universal_Religion&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/w=\r\niki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Practical_Vedanta_and_=\r\nother_lectures/The_Ideal_of_a_Universal_Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:bot=\r\nh;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line=\r\n-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size=\r\n:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;l=\r\nine-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Raman=\r\naya&lt;br&gt;Prasanth Jalasutram&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Love And Love Alone&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0014853dfa8bb1da720471ca5118--\r\n\n"}}
