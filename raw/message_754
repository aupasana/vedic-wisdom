However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me until =\r\nmuch later. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really needed to d=\r\no homam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to him.\n\nI expe=\r\nrimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I started doi=\r\nng a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months, I fin=\r\nally got down to the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a d=\r\netailed manual for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, a=\r\ns many people in addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the manual =\r\nnow! I and many other people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as=\r\n far as my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time f=\r\nor Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started with =\r\nhim. What a fortunate soul..\n\n* * *\n\nIt was probably for a reason that Mani=\r\nsh did not tell me at the onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My =\r\nattitude and mental state would&#39;ve been different while working on the manu=\r\nal. I would&#39;ve been more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only t=\r\nhing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the =\r\ncorrect balance and also wrote it down without many pretensions. The whole =\r\neffort ended up being more saattwik and I really benefited from the exercis=\r\ne. If I had known the full story, it would have had more rajas given my men=\r\ntal state then and I would not have had made the same progress I made, whil=\r\ne preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.\n\nManish told me the full stor=\r\ny only when I was better prepared to handle the information and, of course,=\r\n I added it to the preface of the manual as asked by him then.\n\n* * *\n\nA go=\r\nod guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc=\r\n with the ego. I remember another incident.\n\nOne day in the spring of the s=\r\name year, I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra dur=\r\ning the coming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediate=\r\nly latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and d=\r\no it&quot;. I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 br=\r\neaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch and anothe=\r\nr 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the sam=\r\ne place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. =\r\nI was in a very nice state at the end of the day.\n\nI noticed on the next da=\r\ny that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It =\r\nis considered a very auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadha=\r\nna on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had=\r\n not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excit=\r\ned. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, he sa=\r\nid calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing=\r\n it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been excited at doing the sadha=\r\nna on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would&#39;ve changed the mental focu=\r\ns and brought more rajas into the sadhana.&quot;\n\nHe was absolutely right. As su=\r\nch, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas =\r\nand limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing=\r\n this sadhana on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride and excite=\r\nment, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. Eg=\r\no is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent progress, it c=\r\nan suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish&#39;s words, I intro=\r\nspected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and that he was w=\r\nise not to feed it with more delicious food!\n\nLucky are those who have a gu=\r\nru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather than what sounds good.=\r\n Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can go to the heart =\r\nof their problem and point it out, so that they can weed it out through fur=\r\nther introspection and weaken it through conscious effort.\n\n* * *\n\nI rememb=\r\ner one more similar incident. Before the shata chandi homam in early 2006, =\r\na priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). =\r\nWhen he looked at me, he mentioned the name of one of the saptarshis and sa=\r\nid that I very close to him and that I would do some important work in this=\r\n birth.\n\nWhen I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He imme=\r\ndiately became serious and said &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more identity? =\r\nYour ego is already strong with the identity of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit sc=\r\nholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the astrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha,=\r\n the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. It will take great effort to overcome those ide=\r\nntities and find True Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you =\r\nreally need yet another new identity to feed your ego further? See, what he=\r\n said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for your progress. You=\r\n have to rise above all identities.&quot;\n\nHow true and wise!\n\n* * *\n\nJust as a =\r\nfat and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food gi=\r\nven by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over t=\r\nhe spirit of detachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good ma=\r\nster may chain the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must con=\r\nsciously try to restrain ego and increase detachment.\n\nManish has a unique =\r\nway of looking at things and some simple points he made brought so much cla=\r\nrity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. Even w=\r\nithout giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he l=\r\nit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light were =\r\nalready there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blocking th=\r\ne light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of=\r\n dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Se=\r\nlf) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to notice =\r\nthat dirt ourselves..\n\n* * *\n\nHomam and other spiritual sadhana tools are v=\r\nery helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinkin=\r\ng, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does =\r\nnot take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long t=\r\nime. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path and not wor=\r\nry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walking without =\r\ndistractions will reach the goal.\n\nThe point I want to emphasize is that th=\r\ne external rituals (like homam) and the internal introspection (to change a=\r\nttitude) should go hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy betwe=\r\nen them and they will start to work together very effectively.\n\nBest regard=\r\ns,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pit=\r\nri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality=\r\n: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.=\r\nSriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -\n\n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste F=\r\nriends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Some ramblings ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (o=\r\nr anything similar to it), it\n&gt; happens with all beginners and its only pra=\r\nctice which makes one\n&gt; perfect.

Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along with\n&gt; Homa, surrend=\r\nering to ones chosen deity is the best path for most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me share on=\r\ne incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom I also\n&gt; consider my Guru,=\r\n asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata Chandi\n&gt; Homa) to learn Mahaga=\r\nnapthi homam, I thought he was really joking!\n&gt; When I got back to the US, =\r\nhe called me again and reminded me. It then\n&gt; occured to me he was really b=\r\neing serious. So, I started searching on\n&gt; the net and I found a really fli=\r\nmsy document, but nevertheless I took\n&gt; it up and performed it. But, I was =\r\nnot satisfied. Manishji then\n&gt; reminded me of the book he gifted me, but ev=\r\nen in that it was entirely\n&gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn=\r\n&#39;t distinguish between\n&gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around this time, Nar=\r\nasimha occasionally\n&gt; performed a longer version of the homam and I particp=\r\nated in it, but\n&gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide me,=\r\n which he\n&gt; did, but still it did not get through my really dense brains :)=\r\n. I\n&gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were such that I never gave up,\n&gt;=\r\n instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he really\n&gt; inten=\r\nds that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show me the\n&gt; way. In aro=\r\nund two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has decided\n&gt; to document the=\r\n Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt\n&gt; believe my luck and t=\r\nhanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his\n&gt; grace. Well ... its been ex=\r\nactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking\n&gt; baby-steps and making progress eve=\r\nryday.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces for h=\r\nelping\n&gt; me progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it=\r\n no matter what. We\n&gt; are humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got=\r\n perfect the very\n&gt; first time, unless he has worked on it a lot in his pre=\r\nvious lives.\n&gt; Its all a continuum. Dont worry about time, we have future l=\r\nives ...\n&gt; plenty of time. These things take their own sweet time, doesnt h=\r\nappen\n&gt; overnight. No matter what, complete your homa everyday, that should=\r\n be\n&gt; the primary goal ... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it, whether yo=\r\nu\n&gt; get or dont get anything. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and\n&gt; mo=\r\nve on to higher things. I wish all the best. We should really thank\n&gt; our s=\r\ntars that people like Manishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding\n&gt; us ... wh=\r\nat would be life without them!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for listening.\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; -Nara=\r\nyan-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedi=\r\nc_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu !!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;A servant carryi=\r\nng a million dollar check to the bank and cashing it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;is NOT superior =\r\nto a servant carrying a $100 check to the bank and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;cashing it.

Should he aband=\r\non the project \n&gt; &gt; or atleast carry the remaining milk to the destination?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Narayan said, fire going away can signa=\r\nl the bhutagni being weak.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, one is better off ignoring tho=\r\nse things and not thinking too \n&gt; &gt; much about the significance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend doing homam without worrying about how we=\r\nll or badly it \n&gt; &gt; went and what results it brought. Let me give an analog=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as =\r\na \n&gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to serve your \n&gt; &gt; m=\r\naster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big c=\r\nhecks \n&gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail other=\r\ns. \n&gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank a=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in this=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; v=\r\narious rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. The \n&gt; &gt; suprem=\r\ne god of this world operates through various physical persons \n&gt; &gt; present =\r\non earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ours=\r\nelves and try \n&gt; &gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a se=\r\nrvant carries \n&gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to promote =\r\nego \n&gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million doll=\r\nar \n&gt; &gt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncarrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely \n&gt; &gt; doin=\r\ng their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just \n&gt; &gt; *instrume=\r\nnts* used by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, \n&gt; &gt; one who do=\r\nes what are considered great deeds in this world and one \n&gt; &gt; who does what=\r\n are considered meagre deeds in this world are both \n&gt; &gt; servants of god he=\r\nlping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \n&gt; &gt; Neither really owns anyt=\r\nhing. One may consider oneself superior to \n&gt; &gt; the other because his/her d=\r\needs are considered superior by the world, \n&gt; &gt; but he/she is just as fooli=\r\nsh as a servant who considers \n&gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another serv=\r\nant carrying something less \n&gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of=\r\n being a servant of god fully penetrates one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and =\r\ninstincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas p=\r\nlace one in. One can remain happy and \n&gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, i=\r\nn praise and criticism and in light \n&gt; &gt; and darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have th=\r\ne same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job \n&gt; &gt; you are d=\r\noing for god. You do the best you can. But you own nothing. \n&gt; &gt; You are do=\r\ning it for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Hom=\r\nam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sen=\r\nt: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\negarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rea=\r\nding your response another question came into my mind. \n&gt; &gt; You said:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; &gt; middle o=\r\nf a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by r=\r\nain, or \n&gt; &gt; the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa \n&gt; &gt; regularly, there=\r\n can be instances when the homa agni gets \n&gt; &gt; extinguished while the homa =\r\nis still on..happened with me couple of \n&gt; &gt; times... i seriously dont knbo=\r\nw what to make of it but as one member \n&gt; &gt; in this list had suggested to m=\r\ne, i relight the fire and keep \n&gt; &gt; continuing with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n-Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of c=\r\nonsciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/1=\r\n2/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsvery=\r\nsimple@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste Phani,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top o=\r\nf a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red=\r\n bricks, with sand base be \n&gt; &gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is \n&gt; &gt; actua=\r\nlly better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a \n&gt; &gt; rain can =\r\ncause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire \n&gt; &gt; if it rain=\r\ns while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is \n&gt; &gt; extinguished by=\r\n rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a homa =\r\nkundam with bricks and sand \n&gt; &gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma ku=\r\nnda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally while listening attentively (not \n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nasually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attention \n&gt; &gt; f=\r\nocused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is c=\r\nhanting a mantra and thinking of \n&gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Supp=\r\nose person Y is listening to it \n&gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra =\r\nand its deity. Then the mantra \n&gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet per=\r\nson Y may benefit from the \n&gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that pro=\r\ntects the mind&quot;.. One can \n&gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be pr=\r\notected. The key is \n&gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused=\r\n on the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between meditat=\r\nion and \n&gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation =\r\nand it \n&gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making=\r\n some \n&gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to sil=\r\nent \n&gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3=\r\n)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n&gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas th=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) \n&gt; &gt; has been per=\r\nformed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One shoul=\r\nd follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s=\r\n guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one shoul=\r\nd eat only vegetarian food on the \n&gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bath before =\r\nhomam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; recommend is to avoid eating any solid food=\r\n 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thr=\r\nead wants to do \n&gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take res=\r\nponsibility and \n&gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or =\r\nmy guru as guru \n&gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma i=\r\nncurred in the \n&gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimum threshhol=\r\nd of purity \n&gt; &gt; through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread=\r\n or no \n&gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not mat=\r\nter \n&gt; &gt; after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As l=\r\nong as one desires no specific material benefits (and \n&gt; &gt; ready to receive=\r\n whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual \n&gt; &gt; progress, I am willi=\r\nng to help, even if it means some suffering for \n&gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)A=\r\nny good date to start the Homam? or any day would be \n&gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n&gt; &gt; But any da=\r\ny is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning rain and rooft=\r\nop homam reminded me of my India \n&gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I went to Ind=\r\nia in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; &gt; traveled together to several plac=\r\nes (on a specific project). We ended \n&gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in =\r\nseveral places (wherever we were). \n&gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to=\r\n carry an umbrella with me. As \n&gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in Indi=\r\na, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We p=\r\nroceeded to the \n&gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a h=\r\nomam. Manish \n&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this =\r\ncity after \n&gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To my surp=\r\nrise, it did rain as soon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poor=\r\nnaahuti, it suddenly started raining \n&gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, t=\r\nhere was a small towel/blanket on \n&gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, w=\r\ne held it on top of the two small \n&gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and med=\r\nitated. We held the cloth cover \n&gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the t=\r\nwo homa kundas went off and \n&gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We l=\r\neft for Kurukshetra later \n&gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rain=\r\n continued for a few days \n&gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on t=\r\nhat trip as we covered \n&gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. It rained in=\r\n every place we went \n&gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that place and pre=\r\npared to move on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pi=\r\ntri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. \n&gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nee Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNamasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam dai=\r\nly, and \n&gt; &gt; have few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Ca=\r\nn Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ?

However, Manish did not reve=\r\nal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that time was th=\r\nat Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should teach a sim=\r\nple procedure to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I experimented with homam, started doing occas=\r\nionally and liked it. I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doi=\r\nng it daily for a few months, I finally got down to the original task - tea=\r\nching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In hind=\r\nsight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to Narayan are=\r\n able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other people have benefi=\r\nted (and will benefit). However, as far as my\n mind concerned, all this sta=\r\nrted for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to start doing homam, many p=\r\neople across the world started with him. What a fortunate soul..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* *=\r\n *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the o=\r\nnset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state w=\r\nould&#39;ve been different while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve been more eg=\r\noistic and also hurried more. Because the only thing I was told was to teac=\r\nh Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wr=\r\note it down without many pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more =\r\nsaattwik and I really benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full =\r\nstory, it would have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would =\r\nnot have had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself to teach=\r\n homam to Narayan.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish told me the full story only when I was bet=\r\nter prepared to handle the information\n and, of course, I added it to the p=\r\nreface of the manual as asked by him then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A good guru =\r\nprotects a sishya from unnecessary information that can wreak havoc with th=\r\ne ego. I remember another incident.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One day in the spring of the sam=\r\ne year, I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra durin=\r\ng the coming weekend. The inspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately=\r\n latched on to it. When I told Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do =\r\nit&quot;. I started before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 brea=\r\nks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch and another =\r\n10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basically sitting in the same =\r\nplace and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was a very good experience. I =\r\nwas in a very nice state at the end of the day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I noticed on the nex=\r\nt day that the previous day was Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya).=\r\n It is considered a very\n auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual =\r\nsadhana on that day is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though =\r\nI had not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was =\r\nexcited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days later, =\r\nhe said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because kn=\r\nowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been excited at doing the =\r\nsadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement would&#39;ve changed the mental=\r\n focus and brought more rajas into the sadhana.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He was absolutely r=\r\night. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride bro=\r\nught rajas and limited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that =\r\nI was doing this sadhana on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride=\r\n and excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra =\r\nfurther. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent pro=\r\ngress, it can\n suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish&#39;s wo=\r\nrds, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and t=\r\nhat he was wise not to feed it with more delicious food!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lucky are t=\r\nhose who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather than=\r\n what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who ca=\r\nn go to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they can weed =\r\nit out through further introspection and weaken it through conscious effort=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I remember one more similar incident. Before the shat=\r\na chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha=\r\n (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the name o=\r\nf one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and that I would =\r\ndo some important work in this birth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I saw Manish later that d=\r\nay, I mentioned this to him. He immediately became serious and said &quot;Narasi=\r\nmha, do\n you need one more identity? Your ego is already strong with the id=\r\nentity of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the astrologer&#39;, &#39;=\r\nNarasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. It will ta=\r\nke great effort to overcome those identities and find True Self. As if that=\r\n challenge is not sufficient, do you really need yet another new identity t=\r\no feed your ego further? See, what he said may very well be correct. But it=\r\n is not useful for your progress. You have to rise above all identities.&quot;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How true and wise!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as a fat and mighty dog m=\r\nay win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the master, a=\r\nhamkara (ego or the sense of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit of detachm=\r\nent and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the f=\r\nat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to rest=\r\nrain ego and increase detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish has a unique way of looking=\r\n\n at things and some simple points he made brought so much clarity to my th=\r\ninking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. Even without giving=\r\n any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp o=\r\nf knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light were already there=\r\n and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blocking the light. That=\r\n is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick layer of dirt (condit=\r\nioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the lamp (Self) that is l=\r\nit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to notice that dirt our=\r\nselves..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are ve=\r\nry helpful. But one should also try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking=\r\n, on an ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does n=\r\not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a long ti=\r\nme. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the path and\n not wor=\r\nry about the progress and the distance left. One who keeps walking without =\r\ndistractions will reach the goal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The point I want to emphasize is t=\r\nhat the external rituals (like homam) and the internal introspection (to ch=\r\nange attitude) should go hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy=\r\n between them and they will start to work together very effectively.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ve=\r\ndicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A\n href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:nar=\r\nayan.iyer%40gmail.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.c=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some ramblings=\r\n ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anything simi=\r\nlar to it), it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; happens with all beginners and its only practice whi=\r\nch makes one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; perfect.

Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homa, surrendering to ones cho=\r\nsen deity is the best path for most. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let me share one inc=\r\nident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom I also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; consider my Guru=\r\n, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata Chandi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homa) to learn=\r\n Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really joking!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I got bac=\r\nk to the US, he called me again and reminded me. It then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; occured to=\r\n\n me he was really being serious. So, I started searching on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the ne=\r\nt and I found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it =\r\nup and performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; remind=\r\ned me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was entirely&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in=\r\n Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish between&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nan instruction and sloka :). Around this time, Narasimha occasionally&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; performed a longer version of the homam and I particpated in it, but&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide me, which he&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; did, but still it did not get through my really dense brains :). I&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were such that I never gave up,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he really&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; intends that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show me the&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has\n decided=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; baby-steps and making progress everyday.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I thank M=\r\nanishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces for helping&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me pro=\r\ngress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it no=\r\n matter what. We&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody =\r\ngot perfect the very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; first time, unless he has worked on it a lot i=\r\nn his previous lives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Its all a continuum. Dont worry about time, w=\r\ne have future lives ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; plenty of time. These things take their own=\r\n sweet time, doesnt happen&lt;BR&gt;&gt; overnight. No matter what, complete your=\r\n homa everyday, that should be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the primary goal ... nothing else. P=\r\nls dont waver from it, whether you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; get or dont get\n anything. Slowl=\r\ny we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; move on to higher things. I wis=\r\nh all the best. We should really thank&lt;BR&gt;&gt; our stars that people like M=\r\nanishji and Narasimhaji are here guiding&lt;BR&gt;&gt; us ... what would be life =\r\nwithout them!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks for listening.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; -Narayan-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ y=\r\nahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu !!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n;A servant carrying a million dollar check to the bank and cashing it &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;is NOT superior to a servant carrying a $100 check to the bank=\r\n and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;cashing it.

Should he =\r\nabandon the project &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; or atleast carry the remaining milk to th=\r\ne destination?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Narayan said, fire going away can signal the bhutag=\r\nni being weak.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But, one is better off =\r\nignoring those things and not thinking too &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; much about the sig=\r\nnificance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend doing homam without worrying about how well or =\r\nbadly it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; went and what results it brought. Let me give an ana=\r\nlogy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as =\r\nthe master and yourself as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves=\r\n the master. Similarly, all the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other=\r\n activities are your way to serve your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; master.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many bi=\r\ng checks &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday t=\r\no mail others. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yet, he may\n need a servant to physically carr=\r\ny papers to the bank and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is ca=\r\npable of doing anything in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human=\r\n beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world. That is why v=\r\narious gods (including Vishnu himself) and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; various rishis kee=\r\np coming back to earth every now and then. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; supreme god of=\r\n this world operates through various physical persons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; present=\r\n on earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiri=\r\ntual sadhana, purify ourselves and try &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to help others, becaus=\r\ne that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carries &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; master&#39;s pape=\r\nrs to the bank, we do such work for god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to promote ego &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million dol=\r\nlar &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; check to the\n bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a se=\r\nrvant &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both =\r\nare merely &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything.=\r\n Both are just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry out =\r\nhis agenda. Similarly, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one who does what are considered great=\r\n deeds in this world and one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; who does what are considered mea=\r\ngre deeds in this world are both &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; servants of god helping god =\r\nexecute god&#39;s agenda in this world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Neither really owns anyth=\r\ning. One may consider oneself superior to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the other because h=\r\nis/her deeds are considered superior by the world, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but he/she=\r\n is just as foolish as a servant who considers &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; himself/hersel=\r\nf superior to another servant carrying something less &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; valuabl=\r\ne.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant=\r\n of god fully penetrates\n one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instin=\r\ncts, one is safe no matter what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; situations his previous karma=\r\ns place one in. One can remain happy and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure=\r\n and pain, in praise and criticism and in light &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and darkness.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your s=\r\nadhana like homam. It is a job &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do =\r\nthe best you can. But you own nothing. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You are doing it for g=\r\nod.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nrasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yours=\r\nelf: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank\n re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.=\r\ncomcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nan=\r\ndy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Su=\r\nbject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rea=\r\nding your response another question came into my mind. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You sa=\r\nid:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is not good if fire is extingui=\r\nshed by rain in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing ho=\r\nma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regularly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; extinguished while the homa is still on..happened with me cou=\r\nple of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; times... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but=\r\n as one\n member &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in this list had suggested to me, i relight t=\r\nhe fire and keep &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; continuing with the homa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao=\r\n &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha P=\r\nVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding=\r\n Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@ &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Phani,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house=\r\n(3-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; floors) ? Can a homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made b=\r\ny arranging red bricks, with sand base be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; used instead of a&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes,=\r\n you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; actually=\r\n better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rai=\r\nn can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 aud=\r\nio file, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; should one repeat the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras=\r\n\n mentally along with the audio?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One c=\r\nan repeat mentally while listening attentively (not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; casually)=\r\n. Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attention &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nfocused is as powerful as saying mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; som=\r\ne mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from =\r\nthe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind=\r\n&quot;.. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protect=\r\ned. The key is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind foc=\r\nused on the mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is =\r\na difference between meditation and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is\n submitt=\r\ned in the internal fire in meditation and it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is submitted in =\r\nthe external fire as well in a homam. So making some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; external=\r\n sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; c=\r\nhanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; conditions/niyamas that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apar=\r\nt from having vegeterain food?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. An=\r\nybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; has been perf=\r\normed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bath before homam.\n Another rule I wi=\r\nll &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before=\r\n homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a s=\r\nacred thread wants to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am w=\r\nilling to take responsibility and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a=\r\n person can think of me or my guru as guru &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and perform homam.=\r\n I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; process \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
