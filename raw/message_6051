And that too b=\r\nased on astrology? \n&gt; \n&gt; If you want spiritual progress alone, forget astro=\r\nlogically trying to judge \n&gt; spiritual things for some time and=C2=A0focus =\r\nonly on homas. Meditate more when the \n&gt; fire is burning. Try and make sure=\r\n that the upperpart of your body is as still \n&gt; as possible when the perfor=\r\nming the homa/meditating. Keep the spinal cord \n&gt; straight. Only movement s=\r\nhould be hand movements for ahutis. Discipline your \n&gt; self into following =\r\nthis, even if the mind wavers here and there. Eventually it \n&gt; will bear go=\r\nod result. Additionally, if you want, then whenever you sit on the \n&gt; floor=\r\n try and sit with your back straight. This can slowly become a habit.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI can tell you my personal experiences when I had started homas for the fir=\r\nst \n&gt; time. Before that I had been chanting a certain mantra of Bhairava fo=\r\nr nearly a \n&gt; year. Then I decided to experiment with fire rituals. This wa=\r\ns in 2007. I did \n&gt; not know Narasimha or Manish or even the existence of t=\r\nhis forum. Till then I \n&gt; had seen only one homa in my whole life, a priest=\r\n was performing a Vishnu homa \n&gt; and I was sitting in the crowd of people.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; So without much of an idea of how to go about things, I bought an iron=\r\n kunda \n&gt; from a blacksmith, got some wood, some ghee and started of with t=\r\nhe experiments \n&gt; of giving ahutis of the Bhairava mantra in fire.=C2=A0Aro=\r\nund my 11th homa, while it \n&gt; was going on, I felt a sudden pain in my leg.=\r\n The heat of the fire had singed my \n&gt; leg. I was sitting exactly at the sa=\r\nme distance from the fire as I had always \n&gt; sat and I still sit. I got up =\r\nfrom the homa, there was a little bit of pain, I \n&gt; ignored it. A day later=\r\n the leg started swelling, next day it turned blue and \n&gt; the 4th day I cou=\r\nld not walk. My friends took me to a local doctor who \n&gt; immediately cut op=\r\nen the skin and started digging out the flesh with a scalpel, \n&gt; without an=\r\nesthesia. I was screaming like mad from pain. He advised that I should \n&gt; b=\r\ne taken to a bigger hospital immediately. The doctors there decided I neede=\r\nd an \n&gt; operation. Obviously, I was very scared and had=C2=A0no clue what w=\r\nas happening and \n&gt; why it was happening. I started praying mentally, event=\r\nually a senior doctor \n&gt; came and said he would use some intraveneous antib=\r\niotics and see for a couple of \n&gt; hours if there is any improvement. If not=\r\n, operation is a must. Thankfully it \n&gt; worked, but I had to stay in the ho=\r\nspital for 4 days and for the next one month \n&gt; I could not walk properly.=\r\n=C2=A0 I have a permanent mark on my right leg from that \n&gt; incident.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAfter that I did not go close to the homa kunda for a few months. However, =\r\nI \n&gt; love fire and fire rituals. Eventually I came across this forum and wi=\r\nth some \n&gt; guidance from Narasimha I started doing Bhairava homas again. Bu=\r\nt I kept doing \n&gt; it in an iron kunda. After sometime=C2=A0suddenly one day=\r\n during homa I found myself \n&gt; surrounded by spiders and scorpions. This wa=\r\ns quite disturbing, specifically \n&gt; because I have a dislike for spiders. T=\r\nhen a thought came to me that I must \n&gt; change the homa kunda. I bought a c=\r\nopper one and everything was fine from that \n&gt; day onwards. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; After =\r\nI had completed my 85th homa of Bhairava, I was sitting at night and \n&gt; med=\r\nitating. I saw something - or maybe my mind projected something - which \n&gt; =\r\nalmost kept me transfixed for half an hour. I could not get up from my seat=\r\n even \n&gt; if I wanted to. That time I also got a thought very strongly that =\r\nI must stop \n&gt; the Bhairava homas for now and worship a female deity. About=\r\n 15 days from that \n&gt; experience, I got a call from Manish for the first ti=\r\nme. He told me was to stop \n&gt; the Bhairava homas immediately and start Chan=\r\ndipath. He said, &quot;you have been \n&gt; dailing His (Bhairava&#39;s) number, line la=\r\ng gya hai, but you are just not prepared \n&gt; to take His energy&quot;. If Bhairav=\r\na appears infornt of you, you may get a complete \n&gt; nervous breakdown. Then=\r\n slowly I started Chandi homas with Manish&#39;s guidance. \n&gt; Later on I have d=\r\none Bhairava homas and had good meditations. I still sit at the \n&gt; same dis=\r\ntance from the fire, and often light a huge fire, but never did I \n&gt; experi=\r\nence anything like what I went through=C2=A0after the=C2=A0first few Bhaira=\r\nva homas.\n&gt; \n&gt; The point is simple. An Ugra deity=C2=A0can test you to your=\r\n limits. A milder \n&gt; deity=C2=A0won&#39;t test you to the limits. A deity knows=\r\n very well where you limit \n&gt; lies.=C2=A0There is a jolly good reason why o=\r\nur Rishis have classified different \n&gt; deities differently. And Baglamukhi =\r\nor Narasimha are very ugra forms. It is not \n&gt; that there arn&#39;t people who =\r\nworship these forms, but you or I may not be able to \n&gt; do it. It is=C2=A0b=\r\netter to choose what is practical and doable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Patience is very importa=\r\nnt. Unless you have done at least 108 homas of Ganapati, \n&gt; what is the use=\r\n of shifting to another form? And if you have done 108, then \n&gt; focus on ma=\r\nking each homa to be a unique experience. Meditate more, extent the \n&gt; homa=\r\n for a longer period. Try out doing a 2/3 hours Ganapati homa when you can =\r\n\n&gt; find time. See the effects yourself. Give more than one supari in the ho=\r\nma.=C2=A0 In \n&gt; one shot Ganapati=C2=A0can take your normal=C2=A0mind to a =\r\ndifferent plane completely. The \n&gt; ganas are the sense inputs, and=C2=A0Gan=\r\napati is the lord of these. He can cut off \n&gt; the sense inputs and pull the=\r\n mind inwards very easily. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Decide what is most convenient for you.=\r\n But understand the facts involved before \n&gt; experimenting. Achieve some su=\r\nccess/communion in the worship of one form=C2=A0before \n&gt; you decide to mov=\r\ne on to another. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Bazeecha-e-a=\r\ntfal hain duniya mere aage.\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-mas=\r\niah mere aage.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Naras=\r\nimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sun, 27 M=\r\narch, 2011 8:20:27 PM\n&gt; Subject: RE: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Whats Wrong With Ho=\r\nmam???\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Though intentions for specif=\r\nically invoking Mother Bagalamukhi is not\n&gt; &gt; known, I believe that it was =\r\nfor some or the other Saatwik desire\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If the intentions are &quot;not =\r\nknown&quot;, then how can one &quot;believe&quot; one way or the \n&gt; other? :-)\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; My comments were generic and not just directed at=\r\n Biswajit. There are a lot of \n&gt; people worshipping Mahavidyas without a go=\r\nod understanding. Even if one believes \n&gt; one is doing a sadhana for a &quot;saa=\r\ntwik desire&quot;, any attachments one has at the \n&gt; mundane level can affect on=\r\ne&#39;s intentions at the sub-conscious level!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Moreover, the questio=\r\nn is not just of whether the desire is saattwik or not, but \n&gt; of whether o=\r\nne is ready for a specific path for fulfilling that desire. If a \n&gt; barefoo=\r\nted person is not ready for a path with a lot of sharp thorns and nails, \n&gt;=\r\n one may have to take a longer path that has fewer nails or thorns. Each pa=\r\nth \n&gt; will finally reach the same place anyway.

But then, \n&gt; one will not worry about a stolen motorbike=\r\n or troubles at work. Even if far \n&gt; worse things happen, one will not worr=\r\ny.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Instead of submitting oneself to a very tough taskmaster who =\r\ndemands perfect \n&gt; surrender, and then struggling with an imperfect surrend=\r\ner, it is better in some \n&gt; cases to submit oneself to a more lenient taskm=\r\naster who can deal with imperfect \n&gt; surrender (and slowly works on improvi=\r\nng it).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Mahavidyas were worshipped by very few sadhakas in the o=\r\nld days. People of today \n&gt; know less about them and yet more try to worshi=\r\np them.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Ganapathi, Lakshmi and Vishnu ARE capable of finally giv=\r\ning whatever a Mahavidya \n&gt; can give you.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Bottomline: I will neither encourage nor discourage anyone from any s=\r\npecific \n&gt; sadhana.

He got it from some source \n&gt; &gt;and=\r\n started giving Ahutis with the Mantra during his Maha-Ganapati Homam. As h=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt;has written, First day he had troubles in office and 2nd day his bike=\r\n was stolen \n&gt; &gt;resulting in his shaken confidence due to obvious worries. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looking at the situation, IMHO, it is very early to think abo=\r\nut stopping the \n&gt; &gt;same. Though intentions for specifically invoking Mothe=\r\nr Bagalamukhi is not \n&gt; &gt;known, I believe that it was for some or the other=\r\n Saatwik desire (Even it may \n&gt; &gt;have been mundane and not speeding up spir=\r\nitual progress). Also, it defies the \n&gt; &gt;logic to attach incidences to Homa=\r\nm with experiences of just a couple of days. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For that matter, even=\r\n Maha-Ganapati Homam was not easy if I take my own \n&gt; &gt;personal experiences=\r\n. I have chiefly performed Maha-Ganapati Homas as well as \n&gt; &gt;Chandi homas =\r\nand I have had many set backs and some good things as well but \n&gt; &gt;again th=\r\nose are all part & parcel of life. Even without Homam, one may \n&gt; &gt;experien=\r\nce such dualistic situations. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I understand your insistence an=\r\nd your prudent advice to worship Soumya Devatas \n&gt; &gt;and I agree to your log=\r\nic which is most probably out of your experiences, \n&gt; &gt;however I also think=\r\n that Ugra Devata should not be that fearful while Soumya \n&gt; &gt;Devatas are n=\r\not that Goody-goody. Ultimately, it is all about attraction/liking \n&gt; &gt;for =\r\na particular deity. It is my personal view that one needs to decide upon a =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Homam of a deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or Ugra-Soumya in external Natu=\r\nre) to \n&gt; &gt;which one feels most attracted and then forget about the rest. I=\r\nt would be a \n&gt; &gt;destabilizing effect on mind of a person to start judging =\r\nand relating day to \n&gt; &gt;day experiences with homam. The chosen deity can be=\r\n Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or \n&gt; &gt;Krishna or Shiva or Hanuman or any other de=\r\nity. Once person starts surrendering \n&gt; &gt;to the chosen deity, one is in saf=\r\ne hands. Even if things starts going wrong, \n&gt; &gt;one need not despair and sh=\r\nould keep faith till it is impossible because if God \n&gt; &gt;exist, there never=\r\n would be a breaking point and that holds true for all of us \n&gt; &gt;whether we=\r\n have families to look after or not. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I completely tend to agree an=\r\nd hence repeat for benefits of others that \n&gt; &gt;Ganapati is not a Lower deva=\r\nta. He is capable of everything. If one has a great \n&gt; &gt;liking for him, one=\r\n can keep on performing his homam without need of switching. \n&gt; &gt;Actually t=\r\no switch from Maha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is NOT changing \n&gt; &gt;o=\r\nf Levels (especially from Lower to upper) which some may think. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Best Regards, \n&gt; &gt; Utpal \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nNarasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n The point raised by Biswajit is a genuine one. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual pro=\r\ngress requires freedom from the burden of some key blocking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmas. =\r\nOne way to be free from a karma is to experience the reaction to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it =\r\nin full (in due course of time). Another way is to burn it in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhan=\r\na. When one meditates or helps people or engages in various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritua=\r\nl practices also, some karmas are getting burnt and being taken \n&gt; &gt; &gt; off =\r\none&#39;s kaarmik pipeline. Sadhanas like homam accelerate that process. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Homam of ugra devatas accelerates it further. The distinction is between \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; soumya devatas and ugra devatas is a very important one. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; I gave this analogy a few times before. Suppose there is a basket \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncontaining fruits (your karmas). Suppose a good fruit (good karma) is \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; stuck under some rotten fruits (bad karmas). When you do sadhana, the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; deity (personification of certain good qualities within you, which are =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being=C2=A0 strengthened as you do the sadhana) re-arranges the kaar=\r\nmik \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pipeline. In terms of the analogy, some rotten fruits are taken =\r\nout and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thrown in garbage and the good fruit is given to you to eat.=\r\n If this is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; done slowly and carefully, it takes longer to take the g=\r\nood fruit out, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but the spillage of rotten fruit pieces on the floor =\r\nis minimized. This \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is the way of soumya devatas (gentle deities). If=\r\n this is done fast and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; aggressively, the good fruit comes out faster=\r\n, but the spillage of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rotten fruit pieces is more. This is the way o=\r\nf ugra devatas (fierce \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deities). It is a tradeoff. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I recommended before, those who want their =\r\nmaterial life to go \n&gt; &gt; &gt; smoothly and not in a hurry for spiritual progre=\r\nss should stick to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; soumya devatas. Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Vi=\r\nshnu, Krishna etc can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be worshipped in fire. Once one starts worship=\r\nping fierce forms like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chandi, Durga, Narasimha, Rudra, Bhiarava, Ma=\r\nhakala etc, especially in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire, things CAN be too fast for them to h=\r\nandle. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, it is a good idea to just stick to Ganapathi =\r\nhomam for a few \n&gt; &gt; &gt; months, before starting to worship any other deity. =\r\nThere is no need to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be in a hurry to &quot;graduate&quot; from Ganapathi to so=\r\nmebody else. Ganapathi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is now lower and is capable of giving everyth=\r\ning. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most people today do not =\r\nunderstand Mahavidyas at all. For example, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on literal meanings=\r\n of some scriptural sayings, they think that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bagalamukhi is for succ=\r\ness over enemies and success in litigation etc. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some people suggest =\r\nspecific Mahavidya sadhanas for material benefits \n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on horoscopi=\r\nc combinations. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vidya means knowledge. Mahavidya means suprem=\r\ne knowledge. No knowledge \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that enables one to win court cases or def=\r\neat enemies or to get other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporary material results can be termed=\r\n as &quot;supreme&quot; knowledge. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavidyas are far more serious. They stand=\r\n for different aspects of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge of Self, which is the only s=\r\nupreme knowledge. They are the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; liberating forms of the divine Mother=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most people on earth today are unready for their worship. P=\r\neople today \n&gt; &gt; &gt; need deities who can take care of material things and gi=\r\nve some push \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritually. That&#39;s it. Serious liberating forces such =\r\nas Mahavidyas are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inappropriate for one who worries about little thi=\r\nngs. I mean no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; disrespect - worrying about little things is not unus=\r\nual for most people \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and is ok - but then think twice before worshipp=\r\ning Mahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; especially in a fruitful medium such as fire. Fire a=\r\nmplifies the impact \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the mantra and surrounding thoughts on the su=\r\nbtle body and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; accelerates the results, compared to normal meditation=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Consider the above words car=\r\nefully and skip ugra devatas and Mahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; atleast for a while in =\r\nthe beginning. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, in the beginning, some mistakes may be m=\r\nade. Just as Shiva drank \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the poison that came out first during the c=\r\nhurning of milky ocean, Guru \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gives protection in the beginning. If y=\r\nou have a spiritual guru, think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of him/her before the homam. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t, you may think of me or my guru Dr Manish Pandit. Bette=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet, think of Shri Tembe Swami (Shri Vasudevananda Saraswati Mahar=\r\naj), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Gulwani Maharaj (Yogiraj Shri Vaman Rao Dattatreya Gulwani=\r\n), Shri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nakhate Maharaj and Manish Pandit. That is my Guru parampara=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, you can also think of Dattatreya or Krishna or S=\r\nhiva as your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru based on your inclination. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best rega=\r\nrds, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n------------ \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://Saraswa=\r\ntiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Jyotish writing=\r\ns: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @homam108 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On F=\r\nri, Mar 25, 2011 at 1:30 PM, biswa108 wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 NAMASKAR \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, got the point... but my point is Whe=\r\nther I am ready for burning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kermik debit with this kind of speed... =\r\nI am a family man after all... \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It would not be a problem at all if I=\r\n am a Sadhu... but I am not, I have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some responsibilitis (Rnabandhan=\r\na) left for my family...
