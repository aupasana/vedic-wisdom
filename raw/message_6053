That [reality], by which all things insentient shine,\n=\r\nis self-shining, being consciousness by nature.\n\nHere the light meant is no=\r\nt that of the sun, moon, or lamps, but the light\nof consciousness.\n\nIn the =\r\ndefinition of reality two conditions were set out: continuous,\nuninterrupte=\r\nd shining and the capacity for being self-shining. The two are\nonly one, be=\r\ning inseparable. The first was shown to be fulfilled by the\nsupreme reality=\r\n alone. The second condition also is here shown to be\nfulfilled by it alone=\r\n. Therefore, it alone can be vedantically real. Nothing\nelse, neither the m=\r\nind, nor the world, meets this definition.\n\n161 We know from the words of o=\r\nur divine Guru that that alone is real which\nsurvives in the state of peace=\r\n, which is the highest, and that all else is\nunreal.\n\nThus, by the applicat=\r\nion of the vedantic test of reality, it has been shown\nthat the inseparable=\r\n pair, the mind and the world, is unreal, and that the\nreal Self, which is =\r\nBrahman, is alone real.\n\nNow a doubt is raised and is set at rest in the fo=\r\nllowing verses:\n\n162 =E2=80=98If even the mind is unreal, then it will foll=\r\now that what remains is\nonly a void, since in deep sleep there is nothing a=\r\nt all.=E2=80=99 Those who raise\nthis contention are committing the mistake =\r\nof forgetting themselves!\n\n163 How can this void be known at all if there i=\r\ns no one to witness it? This\nvoid is certainly not without a witness. Hence=\r\n, this void is not the final\nreality.\n\n164 This doctrine of the void has th=\r\nus been clearly refuted by the most holy\none. For us, there is not the leas=\r\nt doubt on this point because [as\ndemonstrated by Bhagavan], there is the r=\r\neal Self, the sole survivor, in the\nsupreme state.\n\n165 In the Heart of eve=\r\nry living creature the self-shining real Self shines\nby its own light [of c=\r\nonsciousness] as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. Hence, everyone knows himself to\nbe r=\r\neal. Who is there in the world of men who says, =E2=80=98I do not exist!=E2=\r\n=80=99\n\nThus it is made clear that the Self is self-revealed. This means th=\r\nat\nknowledge of the Self is by direct experience and not by inference. But =\r\nmany\nphilosophers seem to be unaware of this.\n\n166 The existence of their o=\r\nwn Self is inferred by some from mental\nfunctioning, by the reasoning, =E2=\r\n=80=98I think, therefore I am=E2=80=99. These men are like\nthose dull-witte=\r\nd ones who ignore the elephant when it goes past, and become\nconvinced afte=\r\nrwards by looking at the footprints!\n\n167 Indeed, everyone experiences his =\r\nown existence during deep sleep, where\nthe mind is absent. Also, the sleepe=\r\nr manifests remembrance of the happiness\n[of sleep], saying, =E2=80=98I sle=\r\npt happily=E2=80=99.\n\n168 How can anyone remember the happiness experienced=\r\n by someone else? The\nhappiness of sleep was surely enjoyed by oneself. Doe=\r\ns anyone say, =E2=80=98He that\nexisted prior to sleep is not the same perso=\r\nn as I am now=E2=80=99?\n\nAs Bhagavan himself has pointed out, when Johnson =\r\ngoes to sleep, Benson does\nnot awake, but only Johnson.\n\n169 The mind, alon=\r\ng with the universe, merges in it [the Self] in deep\nsleep, and from there =\r\nit rises again [along with the universe] on waking.\nHence the creed of the =\r\nvoid is untrue.\n\n170 Without a supporting substratum, how can the two, the =\r\nuniverse and the\nmind, appear at all? Is there anyone who sees the serpent =\r\nwithout its basis,\nthe rope, or one who sees silver without its basis, the =\r\noyster shell?\n\n171 Surely there does exist a reality-consciousness that len=\r\nds [an\nappearance of] existence and shining to the universe [including the =\r\nmind]?\nHow else can worldly people have the notion that this unreality exis=\r\nts and\nshines?\n\n172 Because these two shine only by the light [of the Self]=\r\n, therefore that\none is self-shining consciousness. Apart from [that] Self =\r\nthere is nothing\nelse, anywhere, which is self-shining.\n\n173 When the real =\r\nSelf shines on the dawn of right awareness, neither the\nsun nor the moon no=\r\nr the stars shine. By its light alone do these shine here\nfor the ignorant =\r\none, whose mind is turned outwards.\n\n174 There is not the least doubt about=\r\n the existence of the real Self,\nbecause that same [pure] consciousness, by=\r\n which the whole world shines, and\nby whose light the mind becomes mind, is=\r\n the Self.\n\n175 Ignorance does not obstruct the awareness of =E2=80=98I am=\r\n=E2=80=99, but only the\nawareness of the fact =E2=80=98I am awareness=E2=80=\r\n=99. Everyone =E2=80=93 with the exception of\nthose deluded by the scientif=\r\nic creed =E2=80=93 knows of his own existence.\n\n176 The eternal, unchanging=\r\n ever-shining Self persists continuously as the\nreal through all the varyin=\r\ng states. Superimposed on it, the substratum, the\nwhole world shines.\n\n177 =\r\nIt is by borrowing the reality of this reality, which is perfect\nconsciousn=\r\ness, that this world and the mind appear as real to all those\nwhose minds a=\r\nre deluded on account of their ignorance of their own selves.\n\nBhagavan=E2=\r\n=80=99s own pronouncement is next quoted.\n\n178 Here is the utterance of the=\r\n most holy one: =E2=80=98Brahman, which is only one,\nitself shines inside [=\r\nin the Heart] of all creatures as the real Self, in\nthe form of, =E2=80=9CI=\r\n=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D. There is no other Self.=E2=80=99\n\n179 He al=\r\nso said: =E2=80=98This same [truth] is the meaning of the utterance of the\n=\r\nfamous, heavenly voice that told Moses, =E2=80=9CMy real nature is just the=\r\n\nconsciousness, =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D.=E2=80=99\n\n180 The sages, b=\r\necoming aware of that which is Brahman, shining in the\nsupreme state as the=\r\n real Self, are ever contented. It is as if they have\nhad all their desires=\r\n fulfilled simultaneously.\n\nThe perfect happiness in which the sages live i=\r\ns inexplicable in any other\nway.\n\n181 This pure consciousness, which is the=\r\n real Self, appears to the one who\ndoes not know himself as the world. This=\r\n misunderstanding of the true nature\nof the real Self is rooted in the igno=\r\nrance of one=E2=80=99s own Self.\n\n182 This world, the outcome of ignorance,=\r\n of course conceals the truth of\nthat [Self]. The intellect, the senses and=\r\n the mind are the servants of\n[that] ignorance.\n\n183 Hence it is that the w=\r\norldly means of proof, namely direct perception,\ntradition and inference, s=\r\nerve only to deceive the creature. They do not at\nall serve the attainment =\r\nof right awareness.\n\n184 Where is the wonder that the ignorant, thinking th=\r\ne world to be real in\nits own right, also become persuaded that the real Se=\r\nlf =E2=80=93 which is ever\nblissful, desireless, unrelated to anything and =\r\nalone =E2=80=93 is in bondage to\nworldliness?\n\n185 The unreality of the wor=\r\nld, which has thus been expounded, is not easy\nto understand by the aid of =\r\nthe one single simile. Hence, to make this\nintelligible to the sadhaka, the=\r\n holy Guru gives three similes in\nsuccession.\n\n186 When it is explained tha=\r\nt the illusory appearance of the world is like\nthat of the serpent in the r=\r\nope, a doubt occurs to the disciple, because he\nthinks that the simile does=\r\n not apply in all cases.\n\n187 The illusory notion of the serpent ceases whe=\r\nn the rope is known [to be\nthe truth]. The world-illusion does not cease fo=\r\nr the aspirant [when he\nunderstands that it is unreal]. Even after the trut=\r\nh [of the unreality of\nthe world] is known by the help of revelation and by=\r\n arguments, still the\nworld continues to appear [as if real].\n\nThere is an =\r\nexplanation of this apparent anomaly, which is given next.\n\n188 The world-i=\r\nllusion does not come to an end by theoretical knowledge, and\nhence there i=\r\ns no room for this doubt. Yet in order to remove this doubt the\nGuru gives =\r\na second simile.\n\n189 Even after the truth of it becomes known, there persi=\r\nsts the vision of\nwater in the mirage. But even when this doubt is cleared,=\r\n another doubt\narises [in its place].\n\n190 It is objected: =E2=80=98Worldly=\r\n objects serve some useful purposes, but the\nwater of the mirage does not.=\r\n=E2=80=99 To this the reply is: =E2=80=98Things seen in a dream\nare useful =\r\n[in the dream], but all the same they are unreal.=E2=80=99\n\n191 In the same=\r\n way, the objects of the world, though useful [while they\nappear to exist],=\r\n are unreal. This state called waking is really a dream\nseen by the creatur=\r\ne who is a victim of a sleep that consists of ignorance\nof the real Self.\n\n=\r\n192 As long as this sleep of ignorance does not cease by direct experience\n=\r\n[of the truth of the Self], this dream called waking, wherein the world\napp=\r\nears as real, will continue.\n\nThe test of reality is again repeated in this=\r\n context.\n\n193 It must be understood that reality is freedom from being con=\r\ntradicted\nand unreality is being subject to extinction. The Self alone is r=\r\neal because\nit never ceases to be. The world is unreal because it ceases to=\r\n appear when\nthere is awareness of the Self.\n\nThe nature of the world=E2=80=\r\n=99s unreality is next further clarified.\n\n194 The whole universe appears a=\r\ns a superimposition on the real Self, the\nsubstratum, which is the reality,=\r\n and hence it is not like a man=E2=80=99s horn. But\nit is taught that it is=\r\n not real in its own right.\n\nThis distinction is important. There are two k=\r\ninds of unreality. The utterly\nunreal, which is never conceivable as real, =\r\nis one which has no substratum,\nlike a man=E2=80=99s or hare=E2=80=99s horn=\r\n. The other kind is that which can and does\nappear as real, like the rope-s=\r\nnake. The world=E2=80=99s unreality is of the latter\nkind. It is not real i=\r\nn its own right, since it owes its appearance of\nreality to its substratum.=\r\n This point will be dealt with later.\n\nSo far the question of the reality o=\r\nf the world as a whole has been\ndiscussed and the conclusion has been reach=\r\ned as stated above. Bhagavan next\ndeals with the same question in detail an=\r\nd thus confirms this conclusion.\n\n195 This whole world appears divided up i=\r\nnto an endless variety of parts.\nOur holy Guru makes it clear that all thes=\r\ne parts also are unreal [when\ntaken separately].\n\n196 It is the mind that k=\r\nnows the difference between the individual soul and\nGod and all other diffe=\r\nrences. It is the nature of the mind to perceive\ndifferences. In the mind-f=\r\nree state there are no differences.\n\nDifferences are perceived in waking an=\r\nd in dream, where the mind is present,\nnot in deep sleep, nor in the suprem=\r\ne state, because there the mind is\nabsent, as shown already.\n\nThis appearan=\r\nce of differences is next traced to its root, which is stated.\n\nSource: htt=\r\np://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae0cf5ea049f839a85\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n160 Whatever shines intermittently is insentient and therefore s=\r\nhines by the light of another.

The intellect, the senses and the mind are the se=\r\nrvants of [that] ignorance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;183 Hence it is that the worldly means o=\r\nf proof, namely direct perception, tradition and inference, serve only to d=\r\neceive the creature. They do not at all serve the attainment of right aware=\r\nness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;184 Where is the wonder that the ignorant, thinking the worl=\r\nd to be real in its own right, also become persuaded that the real Self =E2=\r\n=80=93 which is ever blissful, desireless, unrelated to anything and alone =\r\n=E2=80=93 is in bondage to worldliness?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;185 The unreality of the w=\r\norld, which has thus been expounded, is not easy to understand by the aid o=\r\nf the one single simile. Hence, to make this intelligible to the sadhaka, t=\r\nhe holy Guru gives three similes in succession.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;186 When it is exp=\r\nlained that the illusory appearance of the world is like that of the serpen=\r\nt in the rope, a doubt occurs to the disciple, because he thinks that the s=\r\nimile does not apply in all cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;187 The illusory notion of the se=\r\nrpent ceases when the rope is known [to be the truth]. The world-illusion d=\r\noes not cease for the aspirant [when he understands that it is unreal]. Eve=\r\nn after the truth [of the unreality of the world] is known by the help of r=\r\nevelation and by arguments, still the world continues to appear [as if real=\r\n].&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;There is an explanation of this apparent anomaly, which is give=\r\nn next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;188 The world-illusion does not come to an end by theoretica=\r\nl knowledge, and hence there is no room for this doubt. Yet in order to rem=\r\nove this doubt the Guru gives a second simile.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;189 Even after the =\r\ntruth of it becomes known, there persists the vision of water in the mirage=\r\n. But even when this doubt is cleared, another doubt arises [in its place].=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;190 It is objected: =E2=80=98Worldly objects serve some useful purp=\r\noses, but the water of the mirage does not.=E2=80=99 To this the reply is: =\r\n=E2=80=98Things seen in a dream are useful [in the dream], but all the same=\r\n they are unreal.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;191 In=\r\n the same way, the objects of the world, though useful [while they appear t=\r\no exist], are unreal. This state called waking is really a dream seen by th=\r\ne creature who is a victim of a sleep that consists of ignorance of the rea=\r\nl Self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;192 As long as this sleep of ignorance does not cea=\r\nse by direct experience [of the truth of the Self], this dream called wakin=\r\ng, wherein the world appears as real, will continue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The test of rea=\r\nlity is again repeated in this context.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;193 It must be understood =\r\nthat reality is freedom from being contradicted and unreality is being subj=\r\nect to extinction. The Self alone is real because it never ceases to be. Th=\r\ne world is unreal because it ceases to appear when there is awareness of th=\r\ne Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The nature of the world=E2=80=99s unreality is next furthe=\r\nr clarified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;194 The whole universe appears as a superimposition on =\r\nthe real Self, the substratum, which is the reality, and hence it is not li=\r\nke a man=E2=80=99s horn. But it is taught that it is not real in its own ri=\r\nght.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This distinction is important. There are two kinds of unreali=\r\nty. The utterly unreal, which is never conceivable as real, is one which ha=\r\ns no substratum, like a man=E2=80=99s or hare=E2=80=99s horn. The other kin=\r\nd is that which can and does appear as real, like the rope-snake. The world=\r\n=E2=80=99s unreality is of the latter kind. It is not real in its own right=\r\n, since it owes its appearance of reality to its substratum. This point wil=\r\nl be dealt with later.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;So far the question of the reality of the w=\r\norld as a whole has been discussed and the conclusion has been reached as s=\r\ntated above. Bhagavan next deals with the same question in detail and thus =\r\nconfirms this conclusion.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;195 This whole world appears divided up =\r\ninto an endless variety of parts. Our holy Guru makes it clear that all the=\r\nse parts also are unreal [when taken separately].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;196 It is the mind=\r\n that knows the difference between the individual soul and God and all othe=\r\nr differences. It is the nature of the mind to perceive differences. In the=\r\n mind-free state there are no differences.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold&quot;&gt;Differences are perceived in waking and in dream, where the mind =\r\nis present, not in deep sleep, nor in the supreme state, because there the =\r\nmind is absent, as shown already.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;This appearance of differe=\r\nnces is next traced to its root, which is stated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/=\r\nrpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_in=\r\ntro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margi=\r\nn-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;mar=\r\ngin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=\r\n=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae0cf5ea049f839a85--\r\n\n"}}
