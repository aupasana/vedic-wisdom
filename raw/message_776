Thakur said he was one of Lord \nKrishna&#39;s eternal playmates.\n\nWords and actions of great masters like Swami Brahmananada are not always \neasy to understand. He may have had some subtle motivations when he said \nthat.\n\nThere are many people who are prone to pride and do not realize god despite \nabstinence and other wonderful ascetic practices. They let those ascetic \npractices fill them with pride and never reach the final goal. If he wanted \nto subtly remind such people the final goal and remove the mental focus on \nintermediate steps, he may say something like that.\n\nIf he wanted someone to ponder over whether someone else can give one god or \none has to do sadhana and individual effort, then also he may something like \nthat.\n\nIf he wanted to dismiss the notion that his blessings would remove lust from \npeople, with hidden and subtle sircasm that he was quite capable of, then \nalso he may have said that. It is subtler than sircastically saying &quot;while \nwe are at it, why not ask for god? I may as well grant you god&quot;. He may have \nwanted to make the person understand the need of individual effort as \nopposed to getting something (say, brahmacharya) with his blessings.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBrahmacharya and other practices give higher and higher control over self. \nWhen the control over self is *perfect*, one may find god.\n\nAnother person may find god due to the grace of a guru and brahmacharya and \nother practices may come to one in a perfect form *along with* that. That is \nalso possible. It is not necessary to engage in a certain practice for a \nlong duration to realize god. If one is already very pure from all previous \nlife efforts and the impurities of this life exist only on the surface, it \nmay be possible for a sadguru to free such a person in a moment and make him \nrealize god.\n\nHowever, one should start climbing the mountain when there is no certainty \nthat one will suddenly disappear at the base and find oneself on the peak in \na blessed moment, though that is possible!\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen Swami Brahmananda was doing several penances in Vrindavan, Vijaykrishna \nGoswami, who had know him for a long time in Calcutta, asked &quot;The Master \ngave you all that is covetable in spiritual life: visions and samadhi. Why \nthen do you still practise so much austerity?&quot; Brahmananda humbly answered: \n&quot;The experiences and visions I got by his grace, I am now trying to attain \nas my permanent possession.&quot;\n\nDespite visions of gods and samadhi, he know that his realization was not \nperfect and there was more to be perfected!\n\nObserving his hardship, rigorous disciplines, and long meditation and \nprayer, Swami Subodhananda once told him &quot;The Master looked upon you as his \nson. You are the veritable son of the Lord. It does not befit you to sit \nlike a beggar seeking his grace.&quot; Brahmananda replied: &quot;What you say, \nbrother, is true. The Master loved us so dearly that he gave us everything \nhe had to give. Still we have not attained peace. This shows that it now \nlies with us to do the rest for the fulfillment of life&#39;s objective. Uddhava \nwas Krishna&#39;s dear friend, you Krishna said to him: &#39;If you want to properly \nrealize any spiritual truth, you must go to some solitary place and practise \nausterity. I can grant you some miraculous visions, if you like. But that \nwon&#39;t be enough. It is much greater to concentrate and meditate on Him.&#39; \nIndeed, without meditation and contemplation none can know anything about \nGod.&quot;\n\nSome may climb a small hill, think it is Mt Everest and start calling \nthemselves realized. But the disciples of Ramakrishna like Swami Brahmananda \nwere different.\n\nIn order to understand the motivation behind specific words, you have to \nunderstand him better.\n\n*        *        *\n\nMost sishyas of Ramakrishna did not marry. Some married, but never had \nsexual relations with wives (e.g. Swami Yogananda, who married forcefully, \nand Swami Shivananda). Swami Brahmananda was one who not only married but \nhad a child too! He was at one stage troubled by lust and found it very \ndifficult to conquer it. Thakur placed his hand on his heart and chanted a \nmantra. Swami Brahmananda revealed that he never felt lust after that.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, December 16, 2008 2:21 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya\n\n&gt; Dear Members\n&gt;\n&gt; I was re reading this thread on the light of something I had come\n&gt; across very recently. This is regarding Swami Brahmananda. I was\n&gt; reading a book on his life and various incidents connected to him as\n&gt; observed by other saints and his brother disciples.\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Brahmananda or Rakhal Maharaj was the spiritual son of Thakur.\n&gt; And no doubt a great spiritual super giant. Thakur used to say he\n&gt; was one of Sri Krishna&#39;s eternal playmates who had reincarnated on\n&gt; this plane.\n&gt;\n&gt; During his stay in various monastaries of the Ramakrishna Mission,\n&gt; often other monks used to send new initiates to Rakhal Maharaj for\n&gt; hios blessings. It was a generally accepted idea among the disciples\n&gt; of Thakur that any one who is blessed by Rakhal Maharaj will never\n&gt; again be troubled by problems of lack of Brahmacharya.\n&gt;\n&gt; One day an individual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking for his\n&gt; blessings and said &quot;Maharaj, please give me brahmacharya as a\n&gt; blessing&quot;. Hearing this suddenly Rakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you\n&gt; people always come asking for Brahmacharya? Was does not any one\n&gt; come to me asking me to give him/her God? Isn&#39;t God the final aim of\n&gt; everything.. &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it possible for someone who cannot maintain brahmacharya to reach\n&gt; God? I am puzzled...\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot;\n&gt; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can remove my identity from this that would be appreciable\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ok..\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Vimalananda may have overcome lust after having his deity with\n&gt; him. Someone\n&gt;&gt; else may have to first overcome his lust even to have a vision of\n&gt; the deity.\n&gt;&gt; What is good for goose is not good for gander. In general, it is\n&gt; good to try\n&gt;&gt; to overcome lust if it is possible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Several &quot;normal college going people&quot; were taken under his wings\n&gt; by\n&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and transformed into spiritual giants.\n&gt; Swami\n&gt;&gt; Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Yogananda etc were college\n&gt; students\n&gt;&gt; when they met Ramakrishna.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But it is not easy to overcome lust at all. Several of\n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; disciples also struggled with it initially and overcame lust with\n&gt; his\n&gt;&gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and not at all easy\n&gt; to kill\n&gt;&gt; completely.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go out of the\n&gt; mind. Set a\n&gt;&gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some period like that\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; maintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overcoming\n&gt; the basic\n&gt;&gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; True, suppressing desire will make the desire come back later.\n&gt; But, if one\n&gt;&gt; keeps fulfilling desires, they never end!!  This is the nature of\n&gt; desire.\n&gt;&gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other than\n&gt; Self) or\n&gt;&gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter how much\n&gt; one gets.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Removing desire from the root often requires suppressing the\n&gt; desire\n&gt;&gt; temporarily. But the thing to remember from the Aghora book is\n&gt; that just\n&gt;&gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing\n&gt; desires, but do\n&gt;&gt; remember that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep\n&gt; working on it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That is the right spirit!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is\n&gt; one thing.\n&gt;&gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not become\n&gt; attached to\n&gt;&gt; things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions and\n&gt;&gt; developing a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are several things in spiritual progress. They all come\n&gt; together! One\n&gt;&gt; person may develop detachment to actions and possessions and\n&gt; brahmacharya\n&gt;&gt; may become easy as a result. One person may achieve brahmacharya\n&gt; first and\n&gt;&gt; detachment may become easy as a result and come later. Various\n&gt; signs of\n&gt;&gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact order can\n&gt; change from\n&gt;&gt; person to person. Thus, do not be disappointed by your inability\n&gt; to get\n&gt;&gt; something. It may be possible to work it out from another angle!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; Namaste sir\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i know you are lot busy but since i couldn;t ask this question on a\n&gt;&gt; public forum as it may probably offend others.\n&gt;&gt; If you have time ,if you could please reply.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking this for many days\n&gt;&gt; that as mentioned in recent thread on brahamcharya,\n&gt;&gt; it was important to maintain brahamcharya but i wanted to ask that\n&gt;&gt; even vimalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming lust though\n&gt;&gt; he had his deity with him from the very early in life.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; how can normal college going people like me who don&#39;t even have a\n&gt;&gt; deity obtain this goal.\n&gt;&gt; Though i try to maintain physical brahamcharya for few months but\n&gt;&gt; after that i am not able to hold it ,\n&gt;&gt; and even if i maintain some physical chastity it refuses to go out\n&gt;&gt; of mind\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt;&gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my mind\n&gt;&gt; Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of\n&gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt;&gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progress in maintaing\n&gt;&gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt;&gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if\n&gt;&gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove my\n&gt;&gt; identity from this that would be appreciable\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; if what i worte offended you please delete this mail\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; regards\n&gt;&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
