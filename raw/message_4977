However, for us they are forms and most sacred representations of t=\r\nhe Ultimate Truth, The absolute ideals through which we call parabrHMam as =\r\n=E2=80=98God=E2=80=99. They are the object of worship by millions of people=\r\n whom you may call =E2=80=98Hindus=E2=80=99. We look upon these deities as =\r\nthe Ultimate TRUTH, the Absolute one, in your words the =E2=80=9CGod=E2=80=\r\n=9D Himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, we view this latest episode of selling shoes with t=\r\nhese pictures as a blatant denigration of oldest living Spirituality from w=\r\nhich all the religions originated. Therefore, I like to point out to you th=\r\nat your actions are very insulting to all =E2=80=9CHindus=E2=80=9D and =E2=\r\n=80=9CHinduism=E2=80=9D. It is extremely hurting the pace loving people, th=\r\ne so-called Hindus all over the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is puzzling to us how a repu=\r\nted company like Converse can be so irresponsible and childish to put such =\r\npictures on the shoes. If you are very much interested in doing so, i.e., p=\r\nutting pictures why do not you put a picture of Christ or Mohammad on the s=\r\nhoes and see what happens? I am sure you will not put a picture of the Cros=\r\ns or Jesus Christ or Virgin Mary or Mohammed on any of your product, especi=\r\nally on shoes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your intention may not have been to hurt us, but that i=\r\ns what you did. You hurt sentiments of a large part of the citizens of this=\r\n world who are very peace loving. Your company=E2=80=99s actions victimized=\r\n the adherents of the oldest Spirituality of the world. It might have been =\r\nan oversight and perhaps a case of an overenthusiastic marketing department=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore, on behalf of the Billion-plus people of the world, I requ=\r\nest you to do the following:\n&gt; (1) immediately stop the sale of these shoes=\r\n all over the world.\n&gt; (2) Destroy the manufactured shoes\n&gt; (3) Stop future=\r\n production of shoes of this nature.\n&gt; (4)Train your employees in cultural =\r\nsensitivity training program and let them understand the importance of resp=\r\necting sentiments of other cultures.\n&gt; (5) Issue and Publish a statement of=\r\n apology. Last but not least,\n&gt; \n&gt; (6) Teach the basics of the oldest livin=\r\ng Spirituality to at least the top management of your company. I am willing=\r\n to come and teach them that.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am confident that Converse manag=\r\nement will address this matter with utmost urgency.

However, for us they are forms and most sacred represen=\r\ntations of the Ultimate Truth, The absolute ideals through which we call pa=\r\nrabrHMam as =E2=80=98God=E2=80=99. They are the object of worship by millio=\r\nns of people whom you may call =E2=80=98Hindus=E2=80=99. We look upon these=\r\n deities as the Ultimate TRUTH, the Absolute one, in your words the =E2=80=\r\n=9CGod=E2=80=9D Himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thus, we view this latest episode=\r\n of selling shoes with these pictures as a blatant denigration of oldest li=\r\nving Spirituality from which all the religions originated. Therefore, I lik=\r\ne to point out to you that your actions are very insulting to all =E2=80=9C=\r\nHindus=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CHinduism=E2=80=9D. It is extremely hurting the=\r\n pace loving people, the so-called Hindus all over the world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; It is puzzling to us how a reputed company like Converse can be so irre=\r\nsponsible and childish to put such pictures on the shoes.\n If you are very =\r\nmuch interested in doing so, i.e., putting pictures why do not you put a pi=\r\ncture of Christ or Mohammad on the shoes and see what happens? I am sure yo=\r\nu will not put a picture of the Cross or Jesus Christ or Virgin Mary or Moh=\r\nammed on any of your product, especially on shoes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Your in=\r\ntention may not have been to hurt us, but that is what you did. You hurt se=\r\nntiments of a large part of the citizens of this world who are very peace l=\r\noving. Your company=E2=80=99s actions victimized the adherents of the oldes=\r\nt Spirituality of the world. It might have been an oversight and perhaps a =\r\ncase of an overenthusiastic marketing department.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Therefor=\r\ne, on behalf of the Billion-plus people of the world, I request you to do t=\r\nhe following:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (1) immediately stop the sale of these shoes all over=\r\n the world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) Destroy the manufactured shoes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) Stop fut=\r\nure production of shoes of this nature.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (4)Train\n your employees in=\r\n cultural sensitivity training program and let them understand the importan=\r\nce of respecting sentiments of other cultures.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (5) Issue and Publis=\r\nh a statement of apology. Last but not least,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (6) Teach th=\r\ne basics of the oldest living Spirituality to at least the top management o=\r\nf your company. I am willing to come and teach them that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am confident that Converse management will address this=\r\n matter with utmost urgency. I look forward to further word from you.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sincerely,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajyalaxmi&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-1978222460-1285573268=:96338--\r\n\n"}}
