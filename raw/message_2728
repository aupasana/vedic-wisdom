Transfer your consciousness to you=\r\nr Causal-body or Causal-cosmos. They are constituted of SuperEther (mind-st=\r\nuff), which is why it is a tattva at all!\n\n  About Causal Cosmos, Sri Yukte=\r\nswar says in Autobiography of a Yogi:\n\n...&quot;The causal world is indescribabl=\r\ny subtle,&quot; he replied. &quot;In order to understand it, one would have to posses=\r\ns such tremendous powers of concentration that he could close his eyes and =\r\nvisualize the astral cosmos and the physical cosmos in all their vastness-t=\r\nhe luminous balloon with the solid basket-as existing in ideas only. \n\n   I=\r\nf by this superhuman concentration one succeeded in converting or resolving=\r\n the two cosmoses with all their complexities into sheer ideas, he would th=\r\nen reach the causal world and stand on the borderline of fusion between min=\r\nd and matter....\n\n&gt; (b) Does this state have Ahamkara or not/does it corres=\r\npond to any &gt; well known chakra?\n\n2. It doesn&#39;t have Ahamkara, but Chitta a=\r\ns the basis of sense of I-ness. Read my previous mail on &quot;Gyan Marg&quot; to Nar=\r\nasimha.\n\nAntahkaran  Dominates sense of I-ness\n            \nAhamkara - domi=\r\nnant in Physical body/Cosmos [Adhibhautik]\nManas    - dominant in Astral bo=\r\ndy/Cosmos   [AdhiDaivik]\nChitta   - dominant in Causal body/Cosmos   [Adhya=\r\ntmic]\n\n  Medulla, the 6th Chakra - presiding consciouness ISHWAR or Causal =\r\nMacrocosmic consciousness.\n\n&gt; in the VC framework, it seems logical to infe=\r\nr that the material \n&gt; carrier is some combination of the 5 tattwas.\n\n  The=\r\nre is only one framework, only the terminologies are different.

At least I understand it in a consistent framework n=\r\now. Technically speaking, to unify both frameworks into a common ground, bo=\r\nth frameworks seem to agree that the chitta of sookshma-sarira is not the p=\r\nure chitta of brahman. The chitta of sookshma sarira has material impurity =\r\nin it/has a material carrier. Your framework calls this material carrier th=\r\ne 6th tattwa, whereas in the VC framework, it seems logical to infer that t=\r\nhe material carrier is some combination of the 5 tattwas. Also, your framew=\r\nork (by your own words), seems to imply that the 6th tattwa is the source o=\r\nf all the other 5, which are formed out of it *in parallel*, so to say. To =\r\ncut a long line of reasoning short and get to the meat of the matter, I hav=\r\ne one more question (so I can continue to unify the frameworks): (a) Is the=\r\nre a level of realization in which the 5 tattwas are calm, and only the 6th=\r\n is active (b) Does this state have Ahamkara or not/does it correspond to a=\r\nny well known chakra?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yeeahoo_99&quot; &lt;nitish.arya@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT=\r\n ||\n&gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    I have not read VC, no use telling me all=\r\n that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Enumerating what I know about it :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. &quot;SuperEth=\r\ner&quot; - a term coined by Paramahansa Yogananda for\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. an infinitely =\r\nfiner &quot;non-material&quot; tattwa, of which the causal cosmos - Isvara - is compo=\r\nsed of.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. It dissolves and creates Aakash tattwa, which constitut=\r\nes and separates various layers of vibratroy material as the astral and phy=\r\nsical cosmos.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4. It is supported by Sankhya in the creation of the=\r\n 4 antahkarana principles - Buddhi, Manas, Ahamkara, and Chitta. These are =\r\nnon-material conscious principles, while any of the rest of 20 principles d=\r\no not carry consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5. It is created as a result of &quot;Satvic=\r\n-Tamas&quot; Guna Combination.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6. Whether you find a mention to this no=\r\nn-material tattwa or not, is immaterial. The indescribable consciousness of=\r\n Soul, reflects through the help of this tattwa alone - you call it Mind-et=\r\nher as Sri Ramana Maharishi or superEther as Yogananda, it doesn&#39;t matter. =\r\nThats it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7.  For your interest, I am giving you the reference of =\r\ntalks with Sri Ramana Maharishi - please, don&#39;t drag me in a discussion bec=\r\nause am clear about it, but you may resolve all your doubts by reading the =\r\ntalks. Here is an Excerpt (Page 560):\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;...Chidakasa (chit-ether) i=\r\ns Pure Knowledge only, It is the source\n&gt; &gt; of mind. Just at the moment of =\r\nrising up, the mind is only light;\n&gt; &gt; only afterwards the thought &quot;I am th=\r\nis&quot; rises up; this `I-thought&#39;\n&gt; &gt; forms the jiva and the world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n  The first light is the pure mind, the mind ether or Isvara. Its modes man=\r\nifest as objects. Because it contains all these objects within itself it is=\r\n called the mind-ether. Why ether? Like ether containing objects it contain=\r\ns the thoughts, therefore it is the mind-ether.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Again, just as =\r\nthe physical ether though accommodating all the gross objects (the whole un=\r\niverse) is itself the content of the mind-ether, so also the latter is itse=\r\nlf the content of Chit-ether. The last one is Chit Itself. There are no thi=\r\nngs contained in it. It remains as Pure Knowledge only....&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; O=\r\nN 3 GUNAS\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Satva is the light,\n&gt; &gt; Rajas is the subject, and\n&gt; &gt; Ta=\r\nmas is the object.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Even the satva light is only reflected light.=\r\n Were it pure, original Light, there would be no modification in it. The ma=\r\nnokasa (mind-ether) is reflected as bhootakasa (element-ether) and objects =\r\nare seen as being separate from the subject.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedi=\r\ncastrostudent@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You clearly contrad=\r\nict Adi Sankara&#39;s Vivekacudamani (VC from here on). Please tell us why we s=\r\nhould listen to you, not him. Specifically, you insist chitta is a tattwa. =\r\nWhereas when VC uses the word Chitta as a verb, i.e. consciousness, then th=\r\nis property is only possessed by Brahman because only it is Sat-chitta-anan=\r\nda. When VC uses this word as a noun, it is used as a modification of antah=\r\nakarana (whose other three modifications are manas, ahamkara and buddhi). S=\r\no to put this is context, VC clearly implies that at the material level of =\r\ntattwas, we see the Linga Sarira. One of the constructs of Linga sarira is =\r\nantahakrana. One of its &quot;modifications&quot; is chitta. I take this to mean (sin=\r\nce I take that only Brahman can have true chitta (verb))it is that property=\r\n of the antahakarana that, when enlivened by Brahman, gives awareness/consc=\r\niousness to the Linga sarira.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; How exactly am I wrong.

The normal-hu=\r\nman- experience happens by the 5 modifications/ movement of Chitta (finest =\r\ncreation).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How would the Soul become aware of the more mat=\r\nerial Aakash Tattwa (and thus a single coherent self pervading the material=\r\n physical body), if it were not standing behind the Chitta (SuperEther) ?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, all our experiences of matter are through non-materia=\r\nl Chitta, and it doesn&#39;t imply that 6th tattwa doesn&#39;t exist. If you could =\r\ncalm all those modifications of Chitta, you would have your self-realized.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Aajnaa chakra lies the primordial state of the univer=\r\nse where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is just space and time, but no five elements.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing comes out from nothing.
