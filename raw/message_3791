God does a fine j=\r\nob in doing that.\n \nYes, the goal of life is to pay off karmik debts. But, =\r\nthe way most of us live, we are constantly accumulating new debts.\n \nTrue, =\r\nGod does a fine job. But it also depends on us. Just as a master director m=\r\naking an epic movie with a superb script may not give a meaty role to a bad=\r\n actor, god cannot help you clear all your debts if you do not have the rig=\r\nht attitude.\n \nIt is all fine to make a *theoretical* statement &quot;god is doi=\r\nng though me whatever I do. I am not doing anything&quot; and then go on to enjo=\r\ny all kinds of sense pleasures, but one cannot trick god like that. God wil=\r\nl then say, &quot;yes, it is *I* who is making you engage in all these sense ple=\r\nasures. But, you know what, I will also make you suffer the consequences la=\r\nter.&quot; If you read scriptures, imbibe their essence in your thinking, spend =\r\ntime with the holy people, spend time doing sadhana and make a conscious ef=\r\nfort to overcome weaknesses, then God will help you pay off your debts fast=\r\ner. What God does with each person depends on the attitude, conditioning an=\r\nd efforts of that person.\n \n&gt; If on the other hand, we were to ask God to l=\r\net us pay more of it,\n&gt; won&#39;t we be in effect be asking the Lord for even a=\r\n more severe\n&gt; drubbing to pay off karmas faster?\n \nYou need not ask God to=\r\n give either less or more suffering. As you said, &quot;God does a fine job&quot;. Wh=\r\nat you need to ask god is strength and faith to withstand suffering coming =\r\nas a result of previous karmas and wisdom to engage in the right karmas *no=\r\nw*.\n \n&gt; If I may ask....do you have such an art?\n \nNo, I do not.\n \nBut I kn=\r\now one person who considers Aghora series of books by Robert Svoboda (about=\r\n Vimalananda) to be a practical manual, albeit coded. He claims to have fig=\r\nured out specific detials about specific sadhanas from those books and trie=\r\nd them out to find some specific results that are quite amazing.\n \n&gt; I bele=\r\nive that there is nothing impossible for the lord to do, it is\n&gt; all about =\r\nmaking oneself worthy of HIS attention or blessings. \n \nYes. One should imp=\r\nrove the devotion one may have and surrender to the Lord. Whatever one is i=\r\nnspired from within to do, one should do to the best of one&#39;s ability. What=\r\never happens as a result, one should accept it as the will of the Lord and =\r\ntake good and bad with an equal vision. If one does it, one is worthy of Lo=\r\nrd&#39;s attention and blessings. However, when and in what form Lord&#39;s blessin=\r\ngs and attention come depends on Lord&#39;s will and plan. One can only patient=\r\nly wait.\n \nIf there are ten vessels at our house, we may use one for making=\r\n tea, one for cooking dal, one for making rice, one for storing sweets and =\r\nso on. But, if there is a dirty vessel, we do not use it.\n\nSimilarly, Lord =\r\nmay use clean vessels at his disposal for various tasks. One person may be =\r\nused for building temples. One person may be used for reviving one specific=\r\n kind of knowledge. One person may be used for teaching Sanskrit to childre=\r\nn. One person may be used for spreading homam. One person may be used for t=\r\neaching praanaayaama. And so on. First, become a clean vessel and then wait=\r\n for Lord to use you.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Ho=\r\nmam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n   =\r\n  Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n--------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Bhup=\r\nendra Jamnadas \n  To: Narasimha PVR Rao \n  Sent: Tuesday, February 23, 2010=\r\n 11:44 AM\n  Subject: Re: Specific materials in homam (To Narasimha Rao Ji -=\r\n Siva Homa Question)\n\n\n  Namaste Narasimha Rao Ji,,\n\n  Let me clarify at th=\r\nis point that my queries below are not meant at disputing but rather unders=\r\ntanding the extent and intent af any sadhana. I will be most grateful for y=\r\nour patience and time and answering some of these questions.\n\n  You say:\n  =\r\nSimilarly, one can ask god to make one&#39;s life meaningful and worthwhile, en=\r\nable one to pay off one&#39;s kaarmik debts\n\n  But isn&#39;t anyones present life a=\r\nll about paying off one&#39;s karmik debt? God does a fine job in doing that. I=\r\nt is only when we begin to feel the pain of our past deeds...deeds that we =\r\nare not even aware of becuase they have happened over a past few lives, tha=\r\nt we have to ask god for help in making things more manageable. If on the o=\r\nther hand, we were to ask God to let us pay more of it, won&#39;t we be in effe=\r\nct be asking the Lord for even a more severe drubbing to pay off karmas fas=\r\nter? That will only be asked of by people who have a greate degree of self-=\r\nconfidence. Very few people with high level of self-confidence choose to bo=\r\nw their heads before the Lord.\n\n  You also say:\n  I will put it slightly di=\r\nfferently. That art is *nearly* extinct, but not fully extinct. Nevertheles=\r\ns, for all practical purposes, it is extinct.\n\n  If I may ask....do you hav=\r\ne such an art? Do not worry, I will not be bugging you for details. How doe=\r\ns siddhi help in acheiving this art? How does dhyana yoga help achieve sidd=\r\nhi and where does Siva Homa (or any homa) play a role in this? I have read =\r\nthat a good channel of communication with the Lord tremendously helps in fi=\r\nghting conflicts (over here I am talking about conflicts between desires an=\r\nd lifes reality) and help keep a balance between material progress and spri=\r\nritual progress, and a good line of communication with Lord is acheived thr=\r\nough siddhi. I beleive that there is nothing impossible for the lord to do,=\r\n it is all about making oneself worthy of HIS attention or blessings. Pleas=\r\ne let me know if my understanding is correct or if I am building my castle =\r\nin dreamland. \n\n  Thanks,\n  Bhupendra.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n  From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pv=\r\nr@...&gt;\n  To: sivacharya@yahoogroups.com; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom\n  Cc: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n  Sent: Mon, February 22,=\r\n 2010 7:29:23 PM\n  Subject: Re: Specific materials in homam (To Narasimha R=\r\nao Ji - Siva Homa Question)\n\n  Namaste,\n\n  &gt; I do share your viewpoint. But=\r\n does the Lord give without asking?\n\n  Let us go back to the analogy I gave=\r\n. Let us say a master director is making an epic movie and you have a small=\r\n role in the movie. Only the director knows the entire script and you only =\r\nknow your scene. Instead of telling the director how your scane should be, =\r\nyou should just leave it to the director.\n\n  At the same time, it does not =\r\nhurt to tell the director, &quot;I am willing to work hard, rehearse well and do=\r\n the best job I can. If possible, please give me a good role&quot;. Exactly what=\r\n that &quot;good role&quot; should be is better left to the director.\n\n  Similarly, o=\r\nne can ask god to make one&#39;s life meaningful and worthwhile, enable one to =\r\npay off one&#39;s kaarmik debts, help increase dharma in the world and make pro=\r\ngress towards liberation. Other specific requests may not be helpful. Howev=\r\ner, I realize that many people will find the need to make other specific re=\r\nquests.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  &gt; I have learnt from experience that the =\r\nart of getting specific\n  &gt; results from rituals is simply not there or los=\r\nt forever.\n\n  I will put it slightly differently.

Unaware of Mother&#39;s t=\r\nhinking, child may ask for Kaju katli and may suffer with cold and cough fo=\r\nr several days.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Instead of trying to get specific results, the bes=\r\nt approach is to leave it to Him/Her and do homam/japam without any specifi=\r\nc desires. Instead of being an older child who knows a lot of things and ha=\r\ns to fend for himself, be a small child who does not know much and who depe=\r\nnds on parents.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; This simple approach will optimize the results you=\r\n get from your sadhana. Sometimes (many times) what you want may not be the=\r\n right thing for you. God is the Director with the full script of the movie=\r\n in hand, while we are two cent actors who act in one or two scenes and kno=\r\nw nothing about the rest of the movie. Why not leave it to the Director, in=\r\nstead of taking charge and trying to dictate how a particular scene should =\r\nbe handled, when we know nothing about the whole movie and how our characte=\r\nr fits in the whole script?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; (2) Shastras do prescribe specific mat=\r\nerials for specific results. However, I suggest that it is not so simple as=\r\n offering a specific material. Offering a specific material is only one asp=\r\nect in getting a result.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Just for reference, I will mention a few =\r\nthings given in shastras.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; * * *\n  &gt; \n  &gt; For getting money, use th=\r\ne leaves of bilva (bel) tree. To extend longevity, use darbhas (sacred gras=\r\ns). For getting physical strength, use the canes of vetas (rattan palm or C=\r\nalamus rotang) tree. For getting married and marital bliss, use parched ric=\r\ne. For getting a child, use the seeds of shaali tree (also known as kaalonj=\r\ni or krishna jeera or black cumene seeds). For cattle and well-being, use g=\r\nhee. For knowledge, use the wood of Palaasha tree (palash/modugu/ Butea mon=\r\nosperma). For success in agriculture, use barley grains. For overcoming ene=\r\nmies, use guggul (a resin with anti-cholesterol properties in ayurveda). Fo=\r\nr good health, use sesame seeds - white for mental (and spiritual) health a=\r\nnd black for physical. For general happiness and prosperity, use various gr=\r\nains such as rice, juwar dhani etc. For good relations and attracting other=\r\ns, use the flowers or seeds of daadimi (anaar/daanimma/ pomegranate) .\n  &gt; =\r\n\n  &gt; Similarly, Shiva taught Parvati specific materials for the six activit=\r\nies: shaanti (peace-making) , stambhana (paralyzing) , maarana (killing), u=\r\nchchaatana (explusion), vashikarana (creating attraction between people) an=\r\nd vidveshana (creating hatred between people). For example, one can use dar=\r\nbha (sacred grass) dipped in ghee made with cow&#39;s milk for shanti (peace-ma=\r\nking) . These activities (other than peace-making) entail bad karma and not=\r\n for normal sadhakas. These activities are justified only when a highly ele=\r\nvated sadhaka performs them for the greater good of the world. So I will no=\r\nt even mention those specific materials.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; * * *\n  &gt; \n  &gt; The art of=\r\n getting specific results through rituals has almost disappeared and will b=\r\necome more extinct as time passes. Within Kali yuga, we are entering a rene=\r\nwal/redefinitio n phase where knowledge will be re-established for the upco=\r\nming phase of further decay of dharma. There will be re-establishment of dh=\r\narma in the next 200-400 years, but with focus on setting rules and procedu=\r\nres that will be the guiding light for the next 1-2 thousand years when dha=\r\nrma will decay more. In that upcoming phase of decay, this art will become =\r\neven more extinct and the ground will be (is being) set. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n  &gt; Narasimha\n  &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- -\n  &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writ=\r\nings,\n  &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana=\r\n:\n  &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n  &gt; Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n  &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/v=\r\nedic- wisdom\n  &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishW=\r\nri tings\n  &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -\n  &gt; \n  &gt; ---- Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@yahoo. ca&gt; wrote: \n  &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste,\n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; I have been performing the Siva homa based on the metho=\r\nds you have mentioned.

You have reminded me again and \n  put me back to present reality so =\r\nI have to thank you for that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bhupendra=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ________________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Narasim=\r\nha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@...&quot; \n  ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:p=\r\nvr@...&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:si=\r\nvacharya@yahoogroups.com&quot; \n  ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nsivacharya@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;; &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; \n  ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Cc: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:b_=\r\njamnadas@...&quot; \n  ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:b_jamnadas@...&quot;&gt;b_jamnadas@yah=\r\noo.ca&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: \n  Mon, February 22, 2010 1:37:54 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Su=\r\nbject: [sivacharya] Specific \n  materials in homam (To Narasimha Rao Ji - S=\r\niva Homa Question)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Two points:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  (1) A mother may sense that a child is=\r\n about to catch cold and she may prepare \n  a bitter medicine for the child=\r\n to suppess cold in the early stage. Unaware of \n  Mother&#39;s thinking, child=\r\n may ask for Kaju katli and may suffer with cold and \n  cough for several d=\r\nays.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Instead of trying to get specific \n  results, the bes=\r\nt approach is to leave it to Him/Her and do homam/japam \n  without any spec=\r\nific desires. Instead of being an older child who knows a lot \n  of things =\r\nand has to fend for himself, be a small child who does not know much \n  and=\r\n who depends on parents.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This simple approach will \n  opti=\r\nmize the results you get from your sadhana. Sometimes (many times) what \n  =\r\nyou want may not be the right thing for you. God is the Director with the f=\r\null \n  script of the movie in hand, while we are two cent actors who act in=\r\n one or \n  two scenes and know nothing about the rest of the movie. Why not=\r\n leave it to \n  the Director, instead of taking charge and trying to dictat=\r\ne how a particular \n  scene should be handled, when we know nothing about t=\r\nhe whole movie and how \n  our character fits in the whole script?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; (2) Shastras do \n  prescribe specific materials for specific result=\r\ns. However, I suggest that it \n  is not so simple as offering a specific ma=\r\nterial. Offering a specific material \n  is only one aspect in getting a res=\r\nult.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Just for reference, I \n  will mention a few things gi=\r\nven in shastras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For getting mon=\r\ney, use the leaves of bilva (bel) tree. To extend \n  longevity, use darbhas=\r\n (sacred grass). For getting physical strength, use the \n  canes of vetas (=\r\nrattan palm or Calamus rotang) tree. For getting married and \n  marital bli=\r\nss, use parched rice. For getting a child, use the seeds of shaali \n  tree =\r\n(also known as kaalonji or krishna jeera or black cumene seeds). For \n  cat=\r\ntle and well-being, use ghee. For knowledge, use the wood of Palaasha tree =\r\n\n  (palash/modugu/ Butea monosperma). For success in agriculture, use barle=\r\ny \n  grains. For overcoming enemies, use guggul (a resin with anti-choleste=\r\nrol \n  properties in ayurveda). For good health, use sesame seeds - white f=\r\nor mental \n  (and spiritual) health and black for physical. For general hap=\r\npiness and \n  prosperity, use various grains such as rice, juwar dhani etc.=\r\n For good \n  relations and attracting others, use the flowers or seeds of d=\r\naadimi \n  (anaar/daanimma/ pomegranate) .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, Shiva=\r\n taught \n  Parvati specific materials for the six activities: shaanti (peac=\r\ne-making) , \n  stambhana (paralyzing) , maarana (killing), uchchaatana (exp=\r\nlusion), \n  vashikarana (creating attraction between people) and vidveshana=\r\n (creating \n  hatred between people). For example, one can use darbha (sacr=\r\ned grass) dipped \n  in ghee made with cow&#39;s milk for shanti (peace-making) =\r\n. These activities \n  (other than peace-making) entail bad karma and not fo=\r\nr normal sadhakas. These \n  activities are justified only when a highly ele=\r\nvated sadhaka performs them for \n  the greater good of the world. So I will=\r\n not even mention those specific \n  materials.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The art of getting specific \n  results through rituals has almo=\r\nst disappeared and will become more extinct as \n  time passes. Within Kali =\r\nyuga, we are entering a renewal/redefinitio n phase \n  where knowledge will=\r\n be re-established for the upcoming phase of further decay \n  of dharma. Th=\r\nere will be re-establishment of dharma in the next 200-400 years, \n  but wi=\r\nth focus on setting rules and procedures that will be the guiding light \n  =\r\nfor the next 1-2 thousand years when dharma will decay more. In that upcomi=\r\nng \n  phase of decay, this art will become even more extinct and the ground=\r\n will be \n  (is being) set. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasim=\r\nha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free \n  Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writing=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It \n  Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; \n  rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A \n  h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://saraswatifil/&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFil&lt;/A&gt; \n  ms.=\r\norg&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups/&quot; \n  target=3D_blank&gt;htt=\r\np://groups&lt;/A&gt;. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Jyotish writings:=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups/&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups&lt;/A&gt;. \n  yahoo.com=\r\n/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- \n  ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- Bhupendra Jamnadas \n  &lt;b=\r\n_jamnadas@yahoo. ca&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; I have been performing the Siva homa based on the methods you \n  h=\r\nave mentioned.
