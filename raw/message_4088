I went\n&gt; shopping today and =\r\nspent probably more than I should have, but I think\nthat\n&gt; I am nearly read=\r\ny to start thinking about preparations for possibly\ndoing a\n&gt; homam. (I am =\r\na little nervous, can you tell?) Additionally, I found my\n&gt; image of Shiva =\r\nand Parvati over the weekend, and was lucky enough to\nfind a\n&gt; beautiful si=\r\nvalingam at a wonderful price today.\n\n\nGreat.  A murti of any size (idol) o=\r\nf the diety is preferred during the\nhomam but a picture will do as well in =\r\ncase you don&#39;t have one.  As far\nas I know the shivalingam is not required =\r\nas part of the homam but do\nworship it on a regular basis now that you have=\r\n it.\n\n\n&gt; 1. First, I have some dhoop incense. Wonderful smells, I love it.\n=\r\n&gt; It will not stay lit. Or rather it does stay lit but when I blow it\nout t=\r\no\n&gt; let it smolder and give off the wonderful smells, it goes out after a\nf=\r\new\n&gt; minutes (maximum). Am I doing something wrong? I am first forming it\ni=\r\nnto\n&gt; a cone (pyramid) shape. Is that incorrect? Should I be dipping it in\n=\r\noil\n&gt; or something first? Should I be putting it onto some sort of hot coal=\r\n?\n\n\nNormally, dhoop should burn on its own and should not get extinguished.=\r\n \nMaybe the dhoop is not of very good quality or has gone dry or perhaps\nyo=\r\nu are not lighting a big enough portion initially that it gets\nextinguished=\r\n after a while.  Experiment with different brands or\ntechniques of lighting=\r\n to see what works.  Alternatively, use incense\nsticks (Agarbatti) and they=\r\n should not have this problem.\n\n\n&gt; 2. I have never used camphor before (exc=\r\nept maybe in some medicines).\n&gt; I have never seen camphor used before (that=\r\n I know of). I did not even\n&gt; really know what camphor *was* until I looked=\r\n it up on the Internet\nthis\n&gt; morning. I now have bought some camphor. The =\r\ncamphor I have is in\nlittle\n&gt; pieces, a bit less than the diameter of an Am=\r\nerican dime. Is this too\n&gt; small? I am thinking specifically of the instruc=\r\ntion to &quot;Take a piece\nof\n&gt; camphor, light it from the lamp and place it in =\r\nthe middle of the homa\n&gt; kundam.&quot; How quickly does the camphor burn? Is it =\r\nmore of a &quot;light it\nfrom\n&gt; the lamp and then hurry and drop it in the middl=\r\ne of the homa kundam\nbefore\n&gt; you burn your fingers?&quot;\n\n\nCamphor burns very =\r\nquickly so you need to be careful in handling it.  I\nnormally light the ghe=\r\ne lamp with matchstick first and then I place a\nsmall piece of camphor on w=\r\nooden ladle, at the edge, and bring it near\nthe ghee lamp flame so that the=\r\n camphor catches fire and then after\nshowing it to the diety as offering yo=\r\nu can place it in the homam to\nstart the fire.  The size sold in stores can=\r\n be used as is but note that\nCamphor leaves no residue but does give out a =\r\nblack carbon smoke so the\namount that you want to use is a function of the =\r\namount required to\nstart the fire vs. any smoke restrictions in your place.=\r\n   In my case, I\ntake 1/2 of the size commercially sold to start the Homam =\r\nfire and you\nmay want to experiment a few times to right size it to your ne=\r\neds.\n\n&gt; 3. Is &#39;turmeric powder&#39; the same thing as ground turmeric, the spic=\r\ne\n&gt; used in cooking?\n\n\nYes, but keep the one used for Homam separate from t=\r\nhe one used for\ncooking.\n\n\n&gt; 4. When it is said, &quot;In fact, do not eat eggs,=\r\n meat and seafood on the\n&gt; day of homam,&quot; does that mean prior to or even a=\r\nfter if you do it in\nthe\n&gt; morning? I am transitioning to pure lacto-vegeta=\r\nrianism, but am not\nalways\n&gt; as conscientious as I could be.\n\n\nThis is a go=\r\nod question.  I recently had a group of friends who were\nboth non-vegetaria=\r\nn go on a pigrimage and one of the friends who did ate\nmeat 24 hours prior =\r\nto the pilgrimage was making fun of the other who\nate meat about 12 hours b=\r\nefore.  So which one is more devout or pious is\na relative question.  At a =\r\nminimum don&#39;t have eggs, meat, and seafood on\nthe day you do Homam which is=\r\n from one Sunrise to the next.\n\n&gt; 5. Page 12 says to &quot;If you can, put dhenu=\r\n mudra [in the tumbler with\n&gt; the water] (else, don&#39;t worry).&quot; What is dhen=\r\nu mudra? I bought\nsomething\n&gt; while out today called &quot;navdana.&quot; It is also =\r\ncalled &quot;Mother&#39;s Pride T&quot;\nand\n&gt; is specifically designated as a puja item f=\r\nor religions purposes only.\nIs\n&gt; appears to be small nuts and beans, sort o=\r\nf. If this is not it, can\nyou\n&gt; tell me what is dhenu mudra, and what is th=\r\nis navdana used for please?\nI\n&gt; got a strong feeling that I should buy it f=\r\nor some reason.\n\n\nA mudra is usually a hand gesture which has a specific me=\r\naning.  There\nare several types of Dhenu mudras out there.  One form is als=\r\no called\nSurabhi Mudra and you can see the instructions below.  There is a =\r\nYou\nTube video also for another type.\n\nhttp://healing.about.com/od/east/ig/=\r\nMudra-Gallery/Surabhi.htm\n&lt;http://healing.about.com/od/east/ig/Mudra-Galler=\r\ny/Surabhi.htm&gt;\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Draj5q2U8C9c\n&lt;http://www.yo=\r\nutube.com/watch?v=3Draj5q2U8C9c&gt;\n\nI cannot tell you what Navadana is but if=\r\n it is vegetarian and does not\ncontain any spices and you strongly believe =\r\nthat there was a reason you\npurchased it and it is fit to be offered to a d=\r\niety then you can use a\nsmall portion in your offering in the fire.   If yo=\r\nu have some doubt on\nany of these then play it safe and use only the ingred=\r\nients listed on\nNarasimhaji&#39;s website.\n\n&gt; 6. I bought three dried coconut h=\r\nalves today. Roughly how many of\n&gt; these rituals can I expect this supply t=\r\no last?\n\n\nFor a small homam such as Mahaganapati homam 0.5 to 0.75 of a who=\r\nle\ncoconut may be sufficient (cut into pieces of 1-2 inches each) whereas\nf=\r\nor bigger homams such as Vishnu Sahasranaama 0.75 to 1.0 coconut is\nrequire=\r\nd and for Chandi Homam usually 1.5 to 2 whole coconuts are\nrequired.   Agai=\r\nn, these are my personal experiences and you have to try\non your own and se=\r\ne what works.  If you plan to do Homam on a regular\nbasis you will need mor=\r\ne dry coconuts for sure.  If you have a wood\nfirelplace in your home or are=\r\n able to do homam in the open you could\nconsider wood also instead of cocon=\r\nuts but if you are doing this inside\nof the house then coconut is better.  =\r\nTry to do a couple of dry runs to\nbuild confidence and get a hang of things=\r\n.\n\n&gt; 7. When the instructions say &quot;You can offer just a raisin or a little\n=\r\n&gt; sugar also,&quot; how much is &quot;a little?&quot; A pinch? A teaspoon?\n\n\nI usually off=\r\ner anywhere from 2-3 rasins each time I make an offering. \nIn the Poorna Aa=\r\nhuti you can put 5 or more depending on the size of your\nhomam.  Similarly =\r\nfor sugar a pinch is good enough  (quantity which can\nbe captured between y=\r\nour right hand ring finger, middle finger, and\nthumb)\n\n&gt; 8. Is there ever a=\r\n problem, when offering ghee onto an open flame with\n&gt; a wooden spoon, of t=\r\nhe spoon catching fire?\n\n\nNo, I have never experienced that.  It should be =\r\na non-issue as long as\nyou are putting a limited quantity of ghee (anywhere=\r\n from 2-10 drops per\noffering)\n\n\n&gt; Also, just kind of general questions abo=\r\nut a few things:\n\n&gt; 9. I have a copper bracelet with Sanskrit lettering on =\r\nit reading &quot;OM\n&gt; Namah Sivaya.&quot; I have been normally wearing this on my lef=\r\nt wrist,\nsince\n&gt; that is where it feels natural to do so. Is that where suc=\r\nh are\nnormally\n&gt; worn?\n\n\nI cannot say much on this except that the left sid=\r\ne of your body is the\nMoon channel which is cool and both copper and Shiva =\r\nare associated with\nthe Sun channel.  If you are wearing it on the left sid=\r\ne and it feels\ngood then perhaps you needed to fire up your left hand side.=\r\n  Try to\nflip the wrist and see how you feel.\n\n&gt; 10. OOC, where it says &quot;Th=\r\ne rakshaa (holy ash) can be mixed with a\ndrop of\n&gt; ghee and applied on the =\r\nforehead as a dot or a line,&quot;\n&gt; do I remember correctly that it is traditio=\r\nnal for Saivites to use\nthree\n&gt; horizontal lines on the forehead instead of=\r\n the single dot? Or is that\na\n&gt; misunderstanding? And if that is the case, =\r\nwhat is the symbolism\nthere?\n\n\nBased on my limited understanding, the Homam=\r\n ash is energized with the\nmantras and the presence of the diety whom you i=\r\nnvoked into the fire and\ntaking a portion of that offering and putting in o=\r\nn your forehead is to\ngain both protection (tilaka) as well as to ask for b=\r\nlessings to open\nthe third eye of wisdom.\n\n&gt; Thank you for any comments.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n--8-1213214348-2248536083=:0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Dear Davyd&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Comments below...Sumeet&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&gt; Namaste, friends.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have some questions about some of the procedures of homam.

(I am a little nervous, can you tell?=\r\n) Additionally, I found my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; image of Shiva and Parvati over the week=\r\nend, and was lucky enough to find a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; beautiful sivalingam at a wonde=\r\nrful price today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Great.&nbsp; A murti of any&nbsp;size&nbsp;(id=\r\nol) of the diety is preferred during the homam but a picture will do as wel=\r\nl in case you don&#39;t have one.&nbsp; As far as I know the shivalingam is not=\r\n required as part of the homam but do worship it on a regular basis now tha=\r\nt you have it.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1. First, I have some dhoop inc=\r\nense. Wonderful smells, I love it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It will not stay lit. Or rather =\r\nit does stay lit but when I blow it out to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; let it smolder and give =\r\noff the wonderful smells, it goes out after a few&lt;BR&gt;&gt; minutes (maximum)=\r\n. Am I doing something wrong? I am first forming it into&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a cone (py=\r\nramid) shape. Is that incorrect? Should I be dipping it in oil&lt;BR&gt;&gt; or s=\r\nomething first? Should I be putting it onto some sort of hot coal?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;P&gt;Normally, dhoop should burn on its own and should not get extinguished.&=\r\nnbsp; Maybe the dhoop is not of very good quality or has gone dry or perhap=\r\ns you are not lighting a big enough portion initially that it gets extingui=\r\nshed after a while.&nbsp; Experiment with different brands or techniques of=\r\n lighting to see what works.&nbsp; Alternatively, use incense sticks (Agarb=\r\natti) and they should not have this problem.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2.

Is &#39;turmeric powder&#39; the same thing as ground turmeric, t=\r\nhe spice&lt;BR&gt;&gt; used in cooking?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Yes, but keep the one used for=\r\n Homam separate from the one used for cooking.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n 4. When it is said, &quot;In fact, do not eat eggs, meat and seafood on the&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; day of homam,&quot; does that mean prior to or even after if you do it in t=\r\nhe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; morning? I am transitioning to pure lacto-vegetarianism, but am =\r\nnot always&lt;BR&gt;&gt; as conscientious as I could be.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;This is a goo=\r\nd question.&nbsp; I recently had a group of friends who were both non-veget=\r\narian go on a pigrimage and one of the friends who did ate meat&nbsp;24 hou=\r\nrs prior to the pilgrimage was making fun of the other who ate meat about 1=\r\n2 hours before.&nbsp; So which one is more devout or pious is a relative qu=\r\nestion.&nbsp; At a minimum don&#39;t have eggs, meat, and seafood on the day yo=\r\nu do Homam which is from one Sunrise to the next.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&gt; 5. Pag=\r\ne 12 says to &quot;If you can, put dhenu mudra [in the tumbler with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the =\r\nwater] (else, don&#39;t worry).&quot; What is dhenu mudra? I bought something&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; while out today called &quot;navdana.&quot; It is also called &quot;Mother&#39;s Pride T&quot; an=\r\nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is specifically designated as a puja item for religions purposes =\r\nonly. Is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; appears to be small nuts and beans, sort of. If this is no=\r\nt it, can you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; tell me what is dhenu mudra, and what is this navdana=\r\n used for please? I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; got a strong feeling that I should buy it for s=\r\nome reason.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;A mudra is usually a hand gesture which has a specif=\r\nic meaning.&nbsp; There are several types of Dhenu mudras out there.&nbsp; =\r\nOne form is also called Surabhi Mudra and you can see the instructions belo=\r\nw.&nbsp; There is a You Tube video also for another type.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://healing.about.com/od/east/ig/Mudra-Gallery/Surabhi.htm&quot;&gt;http=\r\n://healing.about.com/od/east/ig/Mudra-Gallery/Surabhi.htm&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Draj5q2U8C9c&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/w=\r\natch?v=3Draj5q2U8C9c&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;I cannot tell you what Navadana is but if i=\r\nt is vegetarian and does not contain any spices and you strongly believe th=\r\nat there was a reason you purchased it and it is fit to be offered to a die=\r\nty then you can use a small portion in your offering in the fire.&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; If you have some doubt on any of these then play it safe and use only th=\r\ne ingredients listed on Narasimhaji&#39;s website.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&gt; 6. I boug=\r\nht three dried coconut halves today. Roughly how many of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; these ritu=\r\nals can I expect this supply to last?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;For a small homam such as =\r\nMahaganapati homam&nbsp;0.5 to 0.75 of a whole&nbsp;coconut may be sufficie=\r\nnt (cut into pieces of 1-2 inches each) whereas for bigger homams such as V=\r\nishnu Sahasranaama&nbsp;0.75 to 1.0 coconut is required and for Chandi Homa=\r\nm usually 1.5 to 2 whole coconuts are required.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, these ar=\r\ne my personal experiences and you have to try on your own and see what work=\r\ns.&nbsp; If you plan to do Homam on a regular basis you will need more dry =\r\ncoconuts for sure.&nbsp; If you have a wood firelplace in your home or are =\r\nable to do homam in the open you could consider wood also instead of coconu=\r\nts but if you are doing this inside of the house then coconut is better.&nb=\r\nsp; Try to do a couple of dry runs to build confidence and get a hang of th=\r\nings.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&gt; 7. When the instructions say &quot;You can offer just a=\r\n raisin or a little&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sugar also,&quot; how much is &quot;a little?&quot; A pinch? A=\r\n teaspoon?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;I usually offer anywhere from 2-3 rasins each time I =\r\nmake an offering.&nbsp; In the Poorna Aahuti you can put 5 or more dependin=\r\ng on the size of your homam.&nbsp; Similarly for sugar a pinch is good enou=\r\ngh&nbsp; (quantity which can be captured between your right hand ring finge=\r\nr, middle finger, and thumb)&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&gt; 8. Is there ever a problem, when o=\r\nffering ghee onto an open flame with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a wooden spoon, of the spoon c=\r\natching fire?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;No, I have never experienced that.&nbsp; It should=\r\n be a non-issue as long as you are putting a limited quantity of ghee (anyw=\r\nhere from 2-10 drops per offering) &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, just kind of gene=\r\nral questions about a few things:&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 9. I have a copper brac=\r\nelet with Sanskrit lettering on it reading &quot;OM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namah Sivaya.&quot; I hav=\r\ne been normally wearing this on my left wrist, since&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that is where =\r\nit feels natural to do so. Is that where such are normally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; worn?&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;I cannot say much on this except that the left side of your body i=\r\ns the Moon channel which is cool and both copper and Shiva are associated w=\r\nith the Sun channel.&nbsp; If you are wearing it on the left side and it fe=\r\nels good then perhaps you needed to fire up your left hand side.&nbsp; Try =\r\nto flip the wrist and see how you feel.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&gt; 10. OOC, where i=\r\nt says &quot;The rakshaa (holy ash) can be mixed with a drop of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ghee and=\r\n applied on the forehead as a dot or a line,&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; do I remember correct=\r\nly that it is traditional for Saivites to use three&lt;BR&gt;&gt; horizontal line=\r\ns on the forehead instead of the single dot? Or is that a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; misunders=\r\ntanding? And if that is the case, what is the symbolism there?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;B=\r\nased on my limited understanding, the Homam ash is energized with the mantr=\r\nas and the presence of the diety whom you invoked into the fire and taking =\r\na portion of that offering and putting in on your forehead is to gain both =\r\nprotection (tilaka) as well as to ask for blessings to open the third eye o=\r\nf wisdom.&nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&gt; Thank you for any comments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n\r\n--8-1213214348-2248536083=:0--\r\n\n"}}
