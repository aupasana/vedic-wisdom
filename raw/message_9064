Do as you would be done by as they say. \n\nIf it is God&#39;s will that =\r\nher suffering must continue, then so be it. But one has to try to alleviate=\r\n it- it is impossible to do nothing. If her karma comes to me, then so be i=\r\nt. I&#39;ll trust in God to guide me. :p \n\nIncidentally, my father recently had=\r\n a severe heart attack and I had to visit India to care for him on emergenc=\r\ny leave(last month). I did Mahamrityunjaya homam on his behalf, and also ja=\r\npa for his physical, mental and spiritual well-being- asking God to help me=\r\n accept whatever happens. Through God&#39;s Grace he is recovering well. I do p=\r\nray that my faith grows stronger day-by-day regardless of the good and bad =\r\nthat happens to me. If I didn&#39;t care about my father&#39;s karma coming to me, =\r\nI shouldn&#39;t care about this woman&#39;s karma coming to me either as, on a spir=\r\nitual level, she is family too. :)\n \nMy thanks to you and to the others who=\r\n have replied too.

But how is a doctor to tell apart k=\r\nundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include simil=\r\nar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot e=\r\nxperience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;.

Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis=\r\n&quot; and will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope th=\r\nis will not harm them, though I doubt it will help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Advice and thought=\r\ns from all members would be much appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Om Dum Durgayai Namaha\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

It is ju=\r\nst A SMALL\n&gt; &gt;  STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small d=\r\nilapidated house (this\n&gt; &gt;  body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized S=\r\nelf) may first construct the palace over time and move into it when it is C=\r\nOMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace stil=\r\nl under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini =\r\nrise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former appro=\r\nach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towar=\r\nds complete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These are=\r\n not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting su=\r\nfficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in=\r\n a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be ge=\r\ntting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want i=\r\nt!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try n=\r\not to fancy too many specific\n&gt; &gt;  desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in=\r\n granting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you =\r\nright now, arising from YOUR\n&gt; &gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature sometime=\r\ns gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want somethin=\r\ng else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be =\r\nborn as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealt=\r\nh and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very h=\r\nealthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another \n&gt; &gt; case, one may =\r\ndeeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn \n&gt; &gt; as a tiger or=\r\n a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \n&gt; &gt; experience.=\r\n Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;see=\r\nking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back =\r\nto Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a ri=\r\nsing Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in TH=\r\nIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire destined to=\r\n fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily sc=\r\nary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap.

If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am =\r\nthe body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;=\r\ns awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scho=\r\nlar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden =\r\ndeep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he =\r\nis a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-aw=\r\nareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause ha=\r\nvoc. The person may show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance=\r\n and get stuck badly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system =\r\nwith undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong not=\r\nions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I recomm=\r\nend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, ov=\r\nercome your\n&gt; &gt;  weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I=\r\n want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/thin=\r\ngs/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It i=\r\ns a negative attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about \n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nhether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to res=\r\nist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or \n&gt; &gt; no=\r\nt. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. E=\r\nVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When y=\r\nou completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) \n&gt; &gt; will auto=\r\nmatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal=\r\n deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They =\r\nsimply do business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, thi=\r\ns is the plain and bare fact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to =\r\nyou and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray =\r\nto you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is =\r\nsomething you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for =\r\nagendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself=\r\n in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is acceptin=\r\ng anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painf=\r\nul) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinkin=\r\ng of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) D=\r\neath.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desire=\r\ns and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped,=\r\n despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;p=\r\nrotect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If yo=\r\nu go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying =\r\nto protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *=\r\nrun away* from God&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;  protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a condit=\r\nioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom =\r\nor surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is t=\r\nemporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep do=\r\ning your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment =\r\nand a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can=\r\n protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning=\r\n and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awarene=\r\nss) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is=\r\n how light your conditioning is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Th=\r\nursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundal=\r\nini syndrome\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=\r\n=A0 , perfectly correct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranaga=\r\nthi=C2=A0 makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of=\r\n the hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any perso=\r\nnal deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner pla=\r\nnes who play havoc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the prot=\r\nection of=C2=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will defini=\r\ntely=C2=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various ele=\r\nments that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this tra=\r\nnslates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, contr=\r\nol of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awake=\r\nning happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater for=\r\nce. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care=\r\n of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF an=\r\nd when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various ot=\r\nher things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some=\r\n of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individua=\r\nl for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and n=\r\nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even =\r\nmore\n&gt; &gt;  vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an expe=\r\nrience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psy=\r\nchology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west tod=\r\nay is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also poss=\r\nible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from vario=\r\nus subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get=\r\n &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyl=\r\nes, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the m=\r\nind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are ver=\r\ny complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list do=\r\nwn every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very=\r\n few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim =\r\nthey can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be a=\r\nchieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient=\r\n Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |par=\r\nam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fr=\r\nom: sunrise_1080 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: T=\r\nhursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini=\r\n syndrome\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn pe=\r\nople of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mi=\r\nne. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the c=\r\nare of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of th=\r\neir kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences an=\r\nd surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never h=\r\neard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explan=\r\nation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (al=\r\nl tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Man=\r\ny people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual cri=\r\nsis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered intere=\r\nst and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately the=\r\nse patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no =\r\ntreatments for deranged\n&gt; &gt;  kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogi=\r\ns try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirm=\r\ned my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wan=\r\nts to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy =\r\nis so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot es=\r\ncape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logi=\r\ncal one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to=\r\n relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the =\r\nstrength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pra=\r\ny for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their sufferi=\r\nng really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to en=\r\nd up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is t=\r\nhe safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leav=\r\ne the kundalini\n&gt; &gt;  rising bit to God&#39;s will.
