Though this is not an astrological forum (a=\r\ns u rightly emphasised), but for sake of sprituality, what are general indi=\r\ncations in one&#39;s chart which indicates sprituality?\nRegards,\nsanjeev sharma=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I was reading a small interview by Deepak Chopra on M=\r\nichael Jackson. Mr Chopra was talking about how doctors suck people into pr=\r\nescription medicines and how that ruins some people&#39;s lives. That somehow r=\r\neminded me of a story.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sometime back, mother of a young man came to m=\r\ne to show his chart. She was asking about his studies etc. But the chart wa=\r\ns brilliant from the spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale com=\r\nbinations. I declared, &quot;this is not the chart of a materialistic person, bu=\r\nt that of a sannyasi (ascetic/monk).&quot; She broke down into tears and gave me=\r\n some background. I found out that he indeed wants to leave material life a=\r\nnd his mother does not want him to.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This boy had been calm, peaceful,=\r\n contented and an introvert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage da=\r\nys, he had an interesting experience. He was in his room upstairs. His fath=\r\ner was teaching math to some students downstairs. He was hearing all those =\r\nvoices. Suddenly, he stopped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anyth=\r\ning for a while. His mind was completely blacked out. After a while, his mi=\r\nnd returned to normalcy and he saw and heard everything. But he felt a trem=\r\nendous sense of bliss and contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he f=\r\nelt then.\n&gt;  \n&gt; He realized that what people pursue as happiness is nothing=\r\n in front of what he experienced then. He did not want to study or do anyth=\r\ning anymore. He only wanted to experience that state. His parents became wo=\r\nrried and took him to doctors. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brain =\r\nand found nothing. He was also confined to a mental facility for one month.=\r\n They put him on powerful drugs and kept him under observation. He kept tel=\r\nling the doctors that there was nothing wrong with him and that they would =\r\nnot understand what he experienced. After a month, those doctors concluded =\r\nhe was normal and had no problem. The powerful drugs he received during the=\r\n month wreaked havoc on him, but he was not angry or mad at his parents or =\r\ndoctors. He says he understands his parents love him and hence they did all=\r\n this. He does not want to hurt them. He also says he knows what he wants b=\r\nut does not know how to get it. But he knows that regular studies and regul=\r\nar material life will not get him what he wants.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When I chatted with =\r\nhim alone, I realized that he is a brilliant young man with clear thinking.=\r\n He is certainly not a mad person. He just needs someone to show him a spir=\r\nitual path to make something permanent, which temporarily came to him and l=\r\neft him! To get it permanently now, he needs to do serious sadhana. His par=\r\nents also took him to many so-called swamijis, but he was not satisfied wit=\r\nh the advice given anyone. He started reading Ramana Maharshi and a few oth=\r\ners and liked some of them. But he is still without a clear direction.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Interestingly, just when I was about to chat with this person after makin=\r\ng his parents leave, my guru Manish called me. He asked me what was going o=\r\nn. I mentioned that I was about to talk to a teenager who had a nice chart.=\r\n He asked for the birthdata, checked it out and confirmed my feeling that t=\r\nhis boy had great spiritual potential.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Unfortunately, the system we h=\r\nave in place looked at him with suspicion and gave powerful drugs to mess u=\r\np his mind for one full month! He is lucky and survived the ordeal. This is=\r\n a sign of the times we live in that someone who realizes, albeit momentari=\r\nly, the essence of scriptures, is labeled as a mentally disturbed person an=\r\nd powerful drugs are given to him, instead of clear spiritual direction to =\r\nmake that realization more permanent.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Shor=\r\nt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas =\r\nYourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath=\r\n.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
