For example, Han dyn=\r\nasty declared Confucianism as the official state \nculture and Taoism as the=\r\n official religion. Thus, worship of deities, demigods, \nxians, supernatura=\r\nl beings (e.g. dragon) and ancestors (pitris!) as practiced in \nthese folk =\r\nreligions were not replaced by Confucian philosophy but they \nco-existed. M=\r\noreover, Confucianism stressed honesty, rituals and rites (which \nextended =\r\nto proper social behavior), sacrifice and filial piety.\n\nThus, even if Chin=\r\nese may not explicitly believe in a specific definition of \nGod, an implici=\r\nt concept of god has influenced the evolution of the value \nsystem, philoso=\r\nphy and culture they so faithfully followed.\n\n* * *\n\nOf course, communist r=\r\nule changed things.

That i=\r\ns why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I said in a recent post that the world does not deserve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe service of paramhamsas now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am afraid our understanding of th=\r\ne word &quot;paramahamsa&quot; is not the same..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swan is supposed to able to=\r\n remove water from milk. Similarly, a paramahamsa \n&gt;(absolute swan) is one =\r\nwho can extract out the bad in a person and leave him \n&gt;with the good that =\r\nis already in him. In other words, a paramahamsa is one who \n&gt;can interact =\r\nwith ANYONE (with any degrees of good and bad) and transform one \n&gt;into an =\r\nideal person. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa associated with \n&gt;drunka=\r\nrds and womanizers like Girish and Kalipad and transformed them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nf one thinks the world does not deserve one&#39;s services and lives in a cave,=\r\n \n&gt;one may be great and realized, but not a paramahamsa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; In fact, look at Parasara&#39;s directives on finding a paramahamsa. He s=\r\naid \n&gt;Mercury in 5th from karakamsa makes one a paramahamsa. Why Mercury an=\r\nd why not \n&gt;Jupiter?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jupiter is wise, but Mercury is flexible and =\r\nadaptive. Mercury can identify \n&gt;with anyone. Mercury is compassionate and =\r\ncan place himself in the shoes of \n&gt;anyone and think/feel like that person.=\r\n That is also why Mercury is the karaka \n&gt;for good communication skills. A =\r\ngood communicator can visualize from the angle \n&gt;of his audience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nRamakrishna once identified with grass so strongly that when a crow walked =\r\non \n&gt;the grass, there were bloody scratches on his body. Such ability to id=\r\nentify \n&gt;with someone else is needed for transforming someone else. That is=\r\n why Parasara \n&gt;mentioned Mercury for Paramahamsa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; //There is no dearth of Chanakyas even today.

Creating a Chandragupta is easy for someon=\r\ne of Chanakya&#39;s \ncaliber.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree with Rajarshi on this.

However, the \n&gt;bottomline is that it is never p=\r\nossible to articulate this knowledge perfectly, \n&gt;using vaikhari.

But \n&gt;then, words spoken=\r\n in vaikhari can serve the important purpose of inspiring one, \n&gt;perhaps to=\r\n investigate and/or to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is no alternative to sadh=\r\nana, whether meditation or homam or \n&gt;contemplation or hatha yoga or whatev=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhetorical Question, Vinay_ji...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n If ALL references of GOD were to be possibly wiped out from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coll=\r\nective memory of humanity -- All kinds and forms of Gods and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their NA=\r\nMES really ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; How would the world and society look, feel, beh=\r\nave, act or react?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Religion has two purposes: (1) Enable some seek=\r\ners to experience Self and \n&gt;become liberated and (2) maintain some sanity,=\r\n righteousness and order in the \n&gt;world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If there is no concept of=\r\n god, no faith in god and no faith in after-life, \n&gt;world can then degenera=\r\nte into adharmik, selfish and animalistic pursuit of \n&gt;selfish needs of eac=\r\nh person.

To LIVE in limelight as a g=\r\neneral rule is foolishness for a \n&gt;Gyani, but sometimes Gyanis may come int=\r\no limelight for some specific cause; it \n&gt;is the cause they care for and no=\r\nt the limelight or lack of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; //What a gyani does *after* sel=\r\nf-realization varies from one gyani to \n&gt;another.//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Your =\r\nkeyword in &quot;What a gyani does&quot; is &quot;DOES&quot;, ie, Karma of a Gyani. \n&gt;It is ver=\r\ny difficult to understand KARMA, as Gita says. Proper definitions of \n&gt;Karm=\r\na, Akarma, Vikarma, etc, are needed. Since nobody can live without doing \n&gt;=\r\nsomething, as Gita says, what is Akarma in fact? Whatever be the mode or ty=\r\npe of \n&gt;action of a Gyani, it is done without any desire of fruit for self,=\r\n and \n&gt;therefore the actions of a Gyani should not be included in general K=\r\narma. The \n&gt;Karma which does not produce phala for the performer is Akarma.=\r\n Brahmasutra \n&gt;speaks of four types of Moksha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; //What a self-r=\r\nealized person does is dependent on the previous history of \n&gt;that soul and=\r\n what Nature expects from one.//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Both YES and NO! A self-reali=\r\nzed soul has to bear whatever is written in \n&gt;his/her birthchart for THIS L=\r\nIFE.

They gain nothing in return. Rgveda says &quot;..Ad=\r\nit-Suryas \n&gt;tapati Tapyatu vrithaa.&quot; Mortals perform Tapa for gaining somet=\r\nhing material or \n&gt;spiritual. But why the Surya is performing Tapa? What Su=\r\nrya will gain? \n&gt;Loka-samgraha, because the Surya perceives all other souls=\r\n as its own parts and \n&gt;wants their well being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; //to remain in=\r\n duality, with the senses perceiving objects of duality, and \n&gt;yet remain i=\r\nn oneness with the underlying oneness//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, this is the prope=\r\nr way of living in this world for a self realized \n&gt;soul.

It is not advisable to discuss real Samadhi in a public fora. \n&gt;These thi=\r\nngs are taught by a spiritual Guru to the disciple according to the \n&gt;prope=\r\nnsity and ability of the latter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As you have used the term &quot;hi=\r\ngher state&quot;, let me say that the highest state \n&gt;of samadhi is indeed that =\r\ntype of samadhi which was attained in battlefield by \n&gt;entire dynasty of Ra=\r\nma, and for sometime by Arjuna. It is &quot;Yoga of the \n&gt;Rajarshis&quot; according t=\r\no Gita, which had vanished from this world after Ikshvaku \n&gt;dynasty and was=\r\n temporarily given to Arjuna after a long absence during entire \n&gt;Dvapar yu=\r\nga.

Remaining in duality with \n&gt;a perfect=\r\n understanding of the underlying oneness of all objects and perceiving \n&gt;al=\r\nl those objects of duality without experiencing attraction or repulsion for=\r\n \n&gt;any single object of duality is almost impossible. Most spiritual aspira=\r\nnts try \n&gt;to reach the state of oneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state=\r\n in which there \n&gt;is no duality and no objectification - and become absorbe=\r\nd in that state \n&gt;forever. That is the advaitic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa s=\r\namadhi&quot; and what \n&gt;happens in &quot;moksha&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, maharshis=\r\n have described higher states. It is possible to be in \n&gt;oneness with manif=\r\nested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at the same time. It is \n&gt;possible t=\r\no remain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects of duality, \n&gt;and y=\r\net remain in oneness with the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all obejcts \n=\r\n&gt;and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either attraction or repulsion for=\r\n any \n&gt;object of duality. Mere perception of objects by the senses is not t=\r\nhe problem. \n&gt;The tendency of mind to be find some attractive and find some=\r\n repulsive is the \n&gt;problem. It is possible to remain in a state where ther=\r\ne is neither attraction \n&gt;nor repulsion for any object is possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a state is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna Param=\r\nahamsa, \n&gt;Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekananda =\r\nalso \n&gt;experienced it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rishis are beings who are always in=\r\n a very high state. They are always \n&gt;alert to the maya and yet not stuck i=\r\nn it. They perceive objects of duality and \n&gt;yet are not attracted or repel=\r\nled by anything. If one overcomes attraction and \n&gt;repulsion and yet remain=\r\ns in duality, one can pretty much do anything. But \n&gt;because one is neither=\r\n attracted or repelled by anything, it means one has no \n&gt;personal ego and =\r\none has no reason to do anything for personal ego. Then one \n&gt;becomes an in=\r\nstrument of nature (Prakriti) and implements the wish of nature \n&gt;through o=\r\nne&#39;s actions, which are performed without any attachment or personal \n&gt;iden=\r\ntification. One who has a personal ego can do limited things. One who has a=\r\n \n&gt;very very small ego can do great things. One who has no ego can do ANY t=\r\nhing. \n&gt;But such a being does things that are desired by Nature - the natur=\r\nal order of \n&gt;the universe. They can change the course of history of nation=\r\ns and planets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rishi in this state may engage in various=\r\n actions of great consequence \n&gt;for the world. Yet, there is no attachment =\r\nwith the actions. He is just an \n&gt;unattached instrument of Nature.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifeste=\r\nd \n&gt;Brahman forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vi=\r\nsion of \n&gt;unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated)=\r\n. Thus, he will \n&gt;freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion=\r\n. Amsa of such a rishi \n&gt;may even be born again as a separate person, just =\r\nas a process running in a \n&gt;computer may spawn off a separate thread to do =\r\nsome focussed task. Even if the \n&gt;computer process has finished all the ini=\r\ntialization and early work, the newly \n&gt;spawned thread has to go through in=\r\nitialization etc again. Similarly, the person \n&gt;born with amsa has to go th=\r\nrough the process of overcoming weaknesses and \n&gt;realizing self all over ag=\r\nain. When a Vivekananda is born from the amsa of a \n&gt;rishi, he may have to =\r\nstruggle initially and overcome the weaknesses and realize \n&gt;self all over =\r\nagain. But he is the amsa of an ever free and liberated being and \n&gt;will fi=\r\nnd his way again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a liberated rishi, with the force =\r\nof his liberated consciousness \n&gt;and with the force of his reborn amsas, wi=\r\nll act as an unattached instrument of \n&gt;Nature performing actions of tremen=\r\ndous consequences without any personal ego \n&gt;driving those actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Ramakrishna specifically said six of his disciples were ever=\r\n \n&gt;liberated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The full message can =\r\nbe read at:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/mes=\r\nsage/438\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Rishis&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ..spiri=\r\ntual Guru of Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vasishtha, Vis=\r\nwamitra and Rama were all gyanis.

One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another good \n&gt;sa=\r\nint \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested that she is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata.=\r\n Satya Sai \n&gt;Baba said \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he identified a particular young=\r\n man as the reincarnation of \n&gt;Swami \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda. Ramakrishn=\r\na was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than \n&gt;twenty \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disci=\r\nples of a very high caliber and different aptitudes. Together, \n&gt;they nearl=\r\ny \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moulded the direction of spiritual India for the next cent=\r\nury. None \n&gt;of the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claimants of rebirthhood are surrounded b=\r\ny people of such caliber or \n&gt;fit the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bill.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a powerful and logically correct observation by Narasimh=\r\na. \n&gt;Anyone who \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claims to be Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada, MUST =\r\nBE associated and \n&gt;surrounded by a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bunch of ATLEAST 15/20 v=\r\nery high caliber sadhakas.=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 These very \n&gt;hi=\r\ngh caliber \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhakas=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 who wil=\r\nl surround a reborn Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada \n&gt;will each be like \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; spiritual stalwarts in their own rights, like each of Ramakrishna and =\r\n\n&gt;Ma \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarada&#39;s disciples were (Swami Brahmananda, Swami Prema=\r\nnanda, Swami \n&gt;Sivananda \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc etc) when they had=C3=83=C6=92=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 incarnated. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So unless this =\r\ncondition is met, (which Ramakrishna himself had \n&gt;specified in his \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last birth), most of the Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada \n&gt;reincarnation-c=\r\nlaimants have \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be dis-qualified. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Some people have an impression that if and when Ramakrishna and Ma \n&gt;Sarad=\r\na and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swamiji reincarnate, they would have an association wi=\r\nth the \n&gt;Ramakrishna \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mission. This is, in my opinion, an inc=\r\norrect assumption. When Lord \n&gt;Krishna was \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; born, he did not =\r\nspend his time trying to find out where is Ayodhya \n&gt;since he \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; was=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 also=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=\r\n=A1 Lord Rama is his=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 past life. Similarly,=\r\n=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt;these souls (Ramakrishna and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Ma=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 Sarada and their disciples)=C3=83=\r\n=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 are of such high caliber \n&gt;that they do come ba=\r\nck \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when it is designed and needed for them to come back and =\r\nperform some \n&gt;strong \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objectives and set in motion a spiritu=\r\nal impulse in this land based \n&gt;on the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessities of the sp=\r\necific desh-kaal-patra. Therefore what they do \n&gt;will be \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bas=\r\ned purely on the zeitgeist - spirit of the times - when they \n&gt;incarnate.=\r\n=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 For \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all one knows, Ramakri=\r\nshna may not incarnate as a simple rustic \n&gt;villager any \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mor=\r\ne, but rather=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 as a well-educated,=C3=83=C6=\r\n=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 city-bred individual \n&gt;with the practical \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence of ten Chanakyas who might end up changing the politica=\r\nl \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual future of this land for centuries to come,=\r\n which is what \n&gt;the necessity \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the present=C3=83=C6=92=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 times really are. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We already h=\r\nave an overdose of Swamis and Babas and Mas and Bhagwans \n&gt;and their \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ashrams and their teeming millions as followers.

And only a=\r\n soul of Ramakrishna or Ma \n&gt;Sarada&#39;s \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caliber can do it. Any=\r\none lesser, would only fizz out=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 with \ntime=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not that=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 they (=\r\nRamakrishna or Ma Sarada or=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 Swamiji) will =\r\n\n&gt;find the work to be \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy at all. For startes, the dunces w=\r\nould be in confederacy against \n&gt;them. When \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekanada, befo=\r\nre he became world famous, had gone to Kasi, he was \n&gt;bitterly \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; opposed by the &#39;scholarly&#39; pandits of the city on various issues. \n&gt;Then=\r\n a young \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not-yet-famous Vivekananda got angry and decided he=\r\n will leave Kasi \n&gt;and never \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return to that city untill he &quot;=\r\nfalls on society like a thunderbolt&quot;. \n&gt;Well, that \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is precis=\r\nely what he did. He fell on Indian society like a \n&gt;thunderbolt, after \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which those very pandits of Kasi wrote to him, asking him to com=\r\ne and \n&gt;grace \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their city! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let u=\r\ns keep our fingers crossed and not=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 focus o=\r\nn emtpy \n&gt;speculations, rather \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wait for the most interesting=\r\n coming=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 decade to unfold in all \n&gt;its=C3=\r\n=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 sound and fury.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Ranjan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you die, what would be your name and religion and=\r\n \nnationality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Name can change on rebirth. Though r=\r\neligion usually stays the same, \n&gt;it CAN \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change. Nationality=\r\n can of course change too. Job, skills, external \n&gt;nature, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nooks, gender, even yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger etc) can \n&gt;all ch=\r\nange \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from birth to birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically=\r\n, the seed of one&#39;s new birth is formed at the time of one&#39;s \n&gt;death. As \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s connection is severed with the body, the last \n&gt;desires/=\r\nthoughts/ponderings \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the mind become the seed for the next=\r\n life. Nature chooses for one \n&gt;a future \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course that allows =\r\none to pursue those desires, as much as allowed by \n&gt;one&#39;s \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nrevious karmas and debts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is able to not en=\r\ntertain ANY desire as one element after \n&gt;another \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaporates=\r\n in one&#39;s existence, one becomes liberated. All the \n&gt;spiritual sadhana \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we do is a dress rehearsal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when we see you again and do you know how we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nf I and you like each other and your rebirth and my rebirth meet \n&gt;each oth=\r\ner, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they will start off taking a liking to each other. If I =\r\nand you \n&gt;dislike each \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other and your rebirth and my rebirth=\r\n meet each other, they will \n&gt;start off \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disliking each other=\r\n. This will happen without either being \n&gt;consciously aware of \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; who one was and who the other person was, in the last life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, if your question is how we can recognize that so and =\r\nso \n&gt;person is a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rebirth of Swami Vivekananda, so and so per=\r\nson is a rebirth of \n&gt;Paramahamsa \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yogananda etc, the answer =\r\nis complex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reborn person may not look like th=\r\ne old person or do similar work \n&gt;or have \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much *external* si=\r\nmilarity. So it is difficult to &quot;recognize&quot; one. \n&gt;After all, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Rama advocated eka patni vrata (one wife principle), while Krishna \n&gt;had =\r\nthousands \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of wives. Rama was a great warrior and killed Rava=\r\nna in the biggest \n&gt;war of his \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times. Krishna was a key play=\r\ner in the biggest war of his time, but \n&gt;did not take \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a weap=\r\non at all. The game can be diffent in each coming..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When it comes to recognizing the rebirth o=\r\nf a great soul, it can \n&gt;become a trap.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishn=\r\na explicitly told Sarada Mata that he would be back after \n&gt;100 years \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and that everybody else who came with him would have to come back=\r\n \n&gt;with him. When \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he=\r\n said they did not have a \n&gt;choice! Even \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda s=\r\naid once in USA, &quot;I have to come back once more. \n&gt;The Master \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; said I am to come back once more with him&quot;. When questioned &quot;you have \n&gt;t=\r\no come \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back because Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;, he replied, &quot;=\r\nsouls like that \n&gt;have great \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power, Madam&quot;. On another occas=\r\nion, Ramakrishna said that people \n&gt;would get \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberated en m=\r\nasse during his next coming and that would be the last \n&gt;opportunity \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a long time to come.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, t=\r\nwo good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of \n&gt;Ramakrishna \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; since then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another good \n&gt;saint=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested that she is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Sa=\r\ntya Sai \n&gt;Baba said \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he identified a particular young ma=\r\nn as the reincarnation of \n&gt;Swami \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda. Ramakrishna w=\r\nas surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than \n&gt;twenty \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disciple=\r\ns of a very high caliber and different aptitudes. Together, \n&gt;they nearly \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moulded the direction of spiritual India for the next century=\r\n. None \n&gt;of the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claimants of rebirthhood are surrounded by p=\r\neople of such caliber or \n&gt;fit the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bill.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, there can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of a great \n&gt;so=\r\nul! It is not \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that they are lying. They may simply be deludi=\r\nng themselves and of \n&gt;course ego is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the root of delusion!\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, is it necessary to recognize whether X is =\r\na rebirth of Y, \n&gt;given that X \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Y are different and play =\r\na different game? A small discussion on \n&gt;this point \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vis-a-v=\r\nis Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s example can be found in:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/807\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though external factors like nation=\r\nality, religion, name, job, looks, \n&gt;gender etc \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can change, =\r\nsome internal factors may remain the same. Moreover, who \n&gt;one likes, \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who one dislikes, what values one is attracted to internally, etc=\r\n, \n&gt;may remain \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; essentially the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; For example, suppose rajput king Prithviraj was reborn as Muslim \n&gt;empero=\r\nr Akbar \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (as said by Vimalananda). One was a Hindu and the ot=\r\nher was a Muslim. \n&gt;However, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both were very brave, unafraid =\r\nof death, inherently spiritual, had a \n&gt;refined \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste in fin=\r\ne arts and had deep conviction. The previous connections \n&gt;with \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; rajputs resulted in Akbar being born and raised when his mother was \n&gt;h=\r\niding at a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rajput household, before moving to Delhi. Despite=\r\n being a Muslim, he \n&gt;actually \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; helped the Hindu causes (to t=\r\nhe extent possible at that time) by \n&gt;putting an end \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to barb=\r\naric practices like killing defeated Hindu kings and all Hindu \n&gt;priests in=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conquered places. He promoted acceptance of other faiths, c=\r\nanceled \n&gt;pilgrimage \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taxes on Hindus and even came up with h=\r\nis own religion of humanity \n&gt;towards the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end of his life by=\r\n integrating various religions. In one life, he \n&gt;tried to save \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; India from invading barbarians. In another, he was born as a cultured \n=\r\n&gt;man amid \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; barbarians and tried to save India by changing the=\r\n ways of his own \n&gt;people.

For example, Han dynasty decl=\r\nared Confucianism as the official state culture and Taoism as the official =\r\nreligion. Thus, worship of deities, demigods, xians, supernatural beings (e=\r\n.g. dragon) and ancestors (pitris!) as practiced in these folk religions we=\r\nre not replaced by Confucian philosophy but they co-existed. Moreover, Conf=\r\nucianism stressed honesty, rituals and rites (which extended to proper soci=\r\nal behavior), sacrifice and filial piety.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, even if Chinese may =\r\nnot explicitly believe in a specific definition of God, an implicit concept=\r\n of god has\n influenced the evolution of the value system, philosophy and c=\r\nulture they so faithfully followed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, communis=\r\nt rule changed things. Any society has to receive the fruits of its collect=\r\nive karmas when the right time comes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I&#39;ve never been t=\r\no China, but I went to Seoul, South Korea on office work a couple of years =\r\nback. As I could not do my daily homam in the hotel room there, I mentally =\r\ndid the homam procedure in the fire that is within and then meditated. I fe=\r\nlt nice energy as I meditated. Though Korea is not as good as India, it is =\r\nbetter than US in spiritual energy.

Similarly, a paramahamsa (absolute swan) is one who can extract ou=\r\nt the bad in a person and leave him with the good that is already in him. I=\r\nn other words, a paramahamsa is one who can interact with ANYONE (with any =\r\ndegrees of good and bad) and transform one into an ideal person. For exampl=\r\ne, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa associated with drunkards and womanizers like Gi=\r\nrish and Kalipad and transformed them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one th=\r\ninks the world does not deserve one&#39;s services and lives in a cave, one may=\r\n be great\n and realized, but not a paramahamsa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n* * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, look at Parasara&#39;s directives on =\r\nfinding a paramahamsa. He said Mercury in 5th from karakamsa makes one a pa=\r\nramahamsa. Why Mercury and why not Jupiter?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jupi=\r\nter is wise, but Mercury is flexible and adaptive. Mercury can identify wit=\r\nh anyone. Mercury is compassionate and can place himself in the shoes of an=\r\nyone and think/feel like that person. That is also why Mercury is the karak=\r\na for good communication skills. A good communicator can visualize from the=\r\n angle of his audience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna once identif=\r\nied with grass so strongly that when a crow walked on the grass, there were=\r\n bloody scratches on his body. Such ability to identify with someone else i=\r\ns needed for transforming someone else. That is why Parasara mentioned Merc=\r\nury for Paramahamsa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n &gt; &gt; //There is no dearth of Chanakyas even today. There is, however=\r\n, not a single &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Chandragupta now. Few &quot;experts&quot;, if any, =\r\nknow that Chanakya was a paramhamsa &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhu. He went to ju=\r\nngle after saving the nation.//&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I woul=\r\nd disagree. Infact no real Chanakya exists today which is the real &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; problem. Creating a Chandragupta is easy for someone of Chanakya=\r\n&#39;s caliber.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree with Rajarshi on this. If a =\r\nChanakya is on earth and ready to guide Chandragupta, a Chandragupta would =\r\nautomatically come. If a Samartha Ramadas is on earth and ready too guide S=\r\nhivaji, a Shivaji would automatically come.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In f=\r\nact, Swami Vivekananda once humbly said that Ramakrishna could have created=\r\n one thousand Vivekanandas from sand!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; All your statements in this thread are\n true, b=\r\nut sometimes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; differences in our language create unnecessa=\r\nry confusions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, I find your st=\r\natements to be absolutely true.

But I was presenting a different perspective to balance the presentation =\r\nof ideas. However, the bottomline is that it is never possible to articulat=\r\ne this knowledge perfectly, using vaikhari. Knowledge like this can be dige=\r\nsted and absorbed only though experience and not through reading or hearing=\r\n words spoken in vaikhari.

To\n LIVE in limelight as=\r\n a general rule is foolishness for a Gyani, but sometimes Gyanis may come i=\r\nnto limelight for some specific cause; it is the cause they care for and no=\r\nt the limelight or lack of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; //What =\r\na gyani does *after* self-realization varies from one gyani to another.//&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Your keyword in &quot;What a gyani does=\r\n&quot; is &quot;DOES&quot;, ie, Karma of a Gyani. It is very difficult to understand KARMA=\r\n, as Gita says. Proper definitions of Karma, Akarma, Vikarma, etc, are need=\r\ned. Since nobody can live without doing something, as Gita says, what is Ak=\r\narma in fact? Whatever be the mode or type of action of a Gyani, it is done=\r\n without any desire of fruit for self, and therefore the actions of a Gyani=\r\n should not be included in general Karma. The Karma which does not produce =\r\nphala for the performer is Akarma. Brahmasutra speaks of four types of Moks=\r\nha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; //What\n a self-realized person doe=\r\ns is dependent on the previous history of that soul and what Nature expects=\r\n from one.//&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Both YES and NO! A self-r=\r\nealized soul has to bear whatever is written in his/her birthchart for THIS=\r\n LIFE. But a self-realized soul burns away his/her entire previous history =\r\nof Karmas and Samskaaras and therefore does not NEED rebirth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Liberated souls and incarnations of divine agencies=\r\n come again and again NOT for obeying Prakriti blindly, but for Loka-samgra=\r\nha, for which the entire Creation was created. They gain nothing in return.=\r\n Rgveda says &quot;..Adit-Suryas tapati Tapyatu vrithaa.&quot; Mortals perform Tapa f=\r\nor gaining something material or spiritual. But why the Surya is performing=\r\n Tapa? What Surya will gain? Loka-samgraha, because the Surya perceives all=\r\n other souls as its own parts and wants their well being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; //to remain in\n duality, with the senses perceiving obj=\r\nects of duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness//&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, this is the proper way of living in=\r\n this world for a self realized soul. There is no alternative in this world=\r\n. One cannot remain in perpetual nirvikalpa samadhi in this world. But it i=\r\ns not proper to call the former as a &quot;higher state&quot;. It is not advisable to=\r\n discuss real Samadhi in a public fora. These things are taught by a spirit=\r\nual Guru to the disciple according to the propensity and ability of the lat=\r\nter.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As you have used the term &quot;higher=\r\n state&quot;, let me say that the highest state of samadhi is indeed that type o=\r\nf samadhi which was attained in battlefield by entire dynasty of Rama, and =\r\nfor sometime by Arjuna. It is &quot;Yoga of the Rajarshis&quot; according to Gita, wh=\r\nich had vanished from this world after Ikshvaku dynasty and was temporarily=\r\n given to Arjuna after a\n long absence during entire Dvapar yuga. There wer=\r\ne many rishis and paramhamsa in Dvapar. But only Arjuna attained Rajarshi-y=\r\noga. Lord Krishna was not a yogi, He was and is the aim of all yogas (=3DCo=\r\nmmunion).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, I find your statements=\r\n to be absolutely true. But greater clarity is needed at some points to war=\r\nd off possible confusions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -VJ&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D =3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedi=\r\nc-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Namaste Vinay ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Gyani should live like a fool, away from limelight&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Limelight is a problem if it distracts one (an=\r\nd it does\n distract most). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhen electricity is turned off, a lamp may go off immediately.

What a gyani does *after* self-realization varies from one gya=\r\nni to another.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A self-realiz=\r\ned Janaka may rule a kingdom, a self-realized Arjuna may fight a battle, a =\r\nself-realized Vasishtha may become a rajaguru, a self-realized Vivekananda =\r\nmay tour the world and teach vedanta, another self-realized yogi may remain=\r\n hidden in a cave in Himalayas, and another self-realized yogi may live lik=\r\ne a fool begging outside a temple. What a self-realized person does is depe=\r\nndent on the previous history of that soul and what Nature expects from one=\r\n. As one&#39;s individual Ego and individual Will efface, one becomes an\n instr=\r\nument of nature, like a dry leaf floating in the air.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Though rishis and gods such as Shiva and Vishnu are liberated, their am=\r\nshas still come down to earth now and then to affect important changes, in =\r\naccordance with the will of Nature and Natural Order (niyati). They retain =\r\ntheir identity till the end of the creation cycle and yet are ever liberate=\r\nd.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am quoting a relevant w=\r\nriteup from message 438 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup titled &quot;Rishis&quot;:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that our senses perceive is Maya (delusion) that is c=\r\nreated by the power of duality. If the veil of delusion is removed, there i=\r\ns no duality and all is ONE uniform and undivided consciousness, known vari=\r\nously as Aatman or Brahman or Narayana or Sadashiva. This one\n uniform and =\r\nundivided consciousness is known as &quot;unmanifested Brahman&quot;. The world of du=\r\nality, where there are many different objects, is also actually Brahman onl=\r\ny, but Brahman that went through some modification and manifestation. It is=\r\n known as &quot;manifested Brahman&quot;. Both are Brahman only.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Normally, living in the domain of duality withou=\r\nt being deluded by some aspect of duality or the other is near to impossibl=\r\ne. Remaining in duality with a perfect understanding of the underlying onen=\r\ness of all objects and perceiving all those objects of duality without expe=\r\nriencing attraction or repulsion for any single object of duality is almost=\r\n impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try to reach the state of oneness wit=\r\nh unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is no duality and no object=\r\nification - and become absorbed in that state forever. That is the advaitic=\r\n experience of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and what happens in\n &quot;moksha&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, maharshis have described hi=\r\ngher states. It is possible to be in oneness with manifested Brahman and un=\r\nmanifested Brahman at the same time. It is possible to remain in duality, w=\r\nith the senses perceiving objects of duality, and yet remain in oneness wit=\r\nh the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. =\r\nnot experience either attraction or repulsion for any object of duality. Me=\r\nre perception of objects by the senses is not the problem. The tendency of =\r\nmind to be find some attractive and find some repulsive is the problem. It =\r\nis possible to remain in a state where there is neither attraction nor repu=\r\nlsion for any object is possible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Such a state is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa, Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekananda also e=\r\nxperienced it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Rishis are b=\r\neings who are always in a very high state. They are always alert to the may=\r\na and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of duality and yet are not=\r\n attracted or repelled by anything. If one overcomes attraction and repulsi=\r\non and yet remains in duality, one can pretty much do anything. But because=\r\n one is neither attracted or repelled by anything, it means one has no pers=\r\nonal ego and one has no reason to do anything for personal ego. Then one be=\r\ncomes an instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implements the wish of nature =\r\nthrough one&#39;s actions, which are performed without any attachment or person=\r\nal identification. One who has a personal ego can do limited things. One wh=\r\no has a very very small ego can do great things. One who has no ego can do =\r\nANY thing. But such a being does things that are desired by Nature - the na=\r\ntural order of the universe. They can change the course of history of natio=\r\nns and planets.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rishi in =\r\nthis state may engage in various actions of great consequence for the world=\r\n. Yet, there is no attachment with the actions. He is just an unattached in=\r\nstrument of Nature.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one g=\r\nets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested Brahman forever=\r\n, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision of unmanifeste=\r\nd and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thus, he will freel=\r\ny interact with duality without any fear or aversion. Amsa of such a rishi =\r\nmay even be born again as a separate person, just as a process running in a=\r\n computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed task. Even if=\r\n the computer process has finished all the initialization and early work, t=\r\nhe newly spawned thread has to go through initialization etc again. Similar=\r\nly, the person born with amsa has to go through the process of overcoming w=\r\neaknesses and realizing self all\n over again. When a Vivekananda is born fr=\r\nom the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initially and overcome the =\r\nweaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is the amsa of an ever f=\r\nree and liberated being and will find his way again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a liberated rishi, with the force of his lib=\r\nerated consciousness and with the force of his reborn amsas, will act as an=\r\n unattached instrument of Nature performing actions of tremendous consequen=\r\nces without any personal ego driving those actions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Ramakrishna specifically said six of his disci=\r\nples were ever liberated.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The full message can be =\r\nread at:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/438&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n target=3D_b=\r\nlank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/438&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &quot;Rishis&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ..spiritual Guru of Swam=\r\ni Ramakrishna Paramhamsa..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; V=\r\nasishtha, Viswamitra and Rama were all gyanis.
