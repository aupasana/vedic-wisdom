C. Desai at Sri Ramanasramam,\nTiruva=\r\nnnamalai, South India, on August 8, 1944, at 9 a.m. and published in\nthe Oc=\r\ntober 1969 issue of the Mountain Path.\n\nD: I am often baffled and depressed=\r\n during or outside my meditation by\nthinking that there are millions of sou=\r\nls who are either quite ignorant or\nquite innocent, and are suffering intol=\r\nerable pains and tortures in this\nworld, e.g., (a) starvation of the poor b=\r\ny famine, poverty or unemployment;\n(b) pain and suffering through diseases =\r\nof ignorant people caused by\nignorance of laws of hygiene, diet or poverty;=\r\n (c) bombing of innocent women\nand children; (d) suffering through floods, =\r\nearthquakes, etc., of innocent\nand poor persons; (e) killing of animals for=\r\n food; (f) insects and lower\nanimals being eaten up by higher animals in na=\r\nture, and so on. I try to\nconvince myself that all this must be due to thei=\r\nr bad karma in past lives,\nbut doubts still arise as to how and by whom the=\r\nir freewill was so directed\nas to force them to commit such actions. If it =\r\nwas due to desire, why or how\ndid they come to get it, or such tendencies o=\r\nriginally? If it is due to\navidya, dehadhyas (body idea), etc., how can the=\r\ny be held responsible for\nthe same?\n\nM: First find out whether the ego exis=\r\nts, who is depressed by these\nthoughts. Find out how you got the idea of th=\r\ne body, solve this problem of\nyour ego, and then see if anything remains to=\r\n be solved.\n\nD: Is it helpful in the enquiry to sit in siddhasana, keeping =\r\nthe spine\nerect, sitting on deerskin, kushasana, etc. during the meditation=\r\n, or are\nthey not quite necessary? Will they expedite the progress?\n\nM: The=\r\n real asana is being established in the Self-Reality or the Source.\nSit in =\r\nyour Self. Where can the Self go and sit? Everything sits in the\nSelf. Find=\r\n out the source of I and sit there. Do not have the idea that the\nSelf cann=\r\not be realized without the help of asanas, etc. They are not at all\nnecessa=\r\nry. The chief thing is to enquire and reach the source of the ego. These\nde=\r\ntails such as posture, etc., may distract the mind towards them or to the\nb=\r\nody. D: Which books are most helpful in swadhyaya (self-study) during spare=\r\n\ntime (for quick training of the mind for the enquiry)?\n\nM: You may read wh=\r\nichever book you like. Self (Atma) is the real book. You\ncan look into it w=\r\nhenever you like. Nobody can take it away. It is always at\nhand, to be read=\r\n. Hold on to your Self in your spare time also, and then you\ncan read any b=\r\nook.\n\nD: If doubts, fears and worries harass me during meditation, how can =\r\nthey be\nmost effectively removed?\n\nM: Ask yourself &quot;To whom do these doubts=\r\n, fears and worries occur?&quot; and they\nwill vanish. Cease to pay attention to=\r\n them. Pay attention to the Self\nwithin. Fears, etc., can only arise when t=\r\nhere are two, or when anybody else\nexists apart from, or separate from, or =\r\noutside of you. If you turn the mind\ninward towards the Self, fears, etc., =\r\nwill disappear.\n\nIf you try to remove a doubt or fear, another doubt or fea=\r\nr will arise.\nThere will be no end to it. The best method to annihilate the=\r\nm is to ask &quot;To\nwhom do they occur?&quot; and they will disappear. Destroying a =\r\ntree by plucking\nits leaves one by one is impossible. Other leaves will gro=\r\nw by the time you\npluck a few. Remove the root of the tree - the ego - and =\r\nthe whole tree with\nits leaves and branches will be destroyed. Prevention i=\r\ns better than cure.\n\nD: Should I look for the source within the body?\n\nM: T=\r\nhe ego arises within the body. Hence, in the first instance you may look\nwi=\r\nthin the body for its source. When you reach the source there will be no\nin=\r\nside or outside, because the source or the Self is all-pervading. After\nrea=\r\nlization everything will be inside the Self.\n\nD: Is the source on the right=\r\n side of the middle line of the chest?\n\nM: The Heart is defined as the plac=\r\ne from which the I-thought arises.Heart\nmeans the Centre (of consciousness)=\r\n. It cannot be identified with any part\nof the physical body.\n\nD: What can =\r\nI do to increase the receptivity of the mind to your spiritual\nvibrations w=\r\nhile sitting in the hall, and to increase the frequency and\nduration of the=\r\n efforts at enquiry in the hall, or to ease such efforts?\n\nM: Keep the mind=\r\n quiet. That is enough. Sitting in this hall will help you.\nThe purpose of =\r\nefforts is to get rid of all efforts. The force will be\nclearly felt when t=\r\nhe stillness is achieved. Spiritual vibrations exist\neverywhere. They will =\r\nmanifest when the mind is stilled.\n\nD: Will it be helpful if I gaze from ti=\r\nme to time on your eyes or face\nduring the effort at meditation, or should =\r\nI keep the eyes closed? If\nclosed, should I concentrate them on the ajna-ch=\r\nakra, or deep down in the\nheart? When practicing the enquiry at one&#39;s own p=\r\nlace should the eyes be\nclosed or fixed on some object of devotion?\n\nM: Loo=\r\nk at your Self or Atma rather than anywhere else. The eyes may be kept\nopen=\r\n or closed. It is immaterial. There is only one I, whether you spell it\n&#39;I&#39;=\r\n or &#39;eye&#39;. There is no point in opening or closing the eyes. Attention\nmust=\r\n be focused on the inner &#39;I&#39;. You are not an &#39;I&#39; that can be opened or\nclos=\r\ned. You may open or close the eyes according to your liking or\ninclination.=\r\n It is immaterial, and not important. You will cease to think of\nthe world =\r\nwhen you think of the Self. If you are in a room and close your\neyes and do=\r\n not look out, it is immaterial whether you close the windows or\nkeep them =\r\nopen. The body is the room; the eyes are the windows.\n\nLooking at ajna chak=\r\nra, etc., is not necessary in this method. It may be\nhelpful in keeping the=\r\n mind from going out towards external objects.\nConcentrate on the Self with=\r\nout which there are no chakras. They do not\nexist without you. You are all =\r\nof them. All centres (chakras) are in the\nHeart. The Heart is not the anaha=\r\nta chakra. The latter is in the spinal\ncord. Heart is I.\n\nSource: http://ww=\r\nw.arunachala.org/newsletters/2001/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e6465048a578e1048ab345a8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nThe following is an excerpt from questions and answers exchanged=\r\n between Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and Sri D.
