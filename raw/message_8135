Kindly=\r\n do not judge me based on my condition, rather give me some positive soluti=\r\non and perspective to what I am going through.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a very strong belo=\r\nved of god and a very strong devotee. I love to worship him as much as I ca=\r\nn.however, all my passion, interest seems to get drained and discouraged du=\r\ne to my mindset and the hell I go through because of it. I always , always =\r\nget negative & abusive thoughts and tie those to the god. For ex, if I hear=\r\n a foul language, see a negative thing, bad or foul my mind relates or ties=\r\n it to god. My mind start abusing god with the same foul language.\n&gt; When I=\r\n do Japam, =A0my mind would not get concentration, but goes into this evil =\r\nmode with racing thoughts.\n&gt; I can&#39;t see directly into the eyes of god with=\r\n the fear of my mind abusing him I can&#39;t focus my drishti on god statues. M=\r\ny thoughts are extremely foul...most specially foul language. However, I ba=\r\nttle my thoughts with my worship, which means I don&#39;t give up praying him. =\r\nI requested him several times to relive me from such pain so that I can inc=\r\nrease my devotion and prayers. I love him. I want to pray him.=A0\n&gt; Current=\r\nly, my mind and it&#39;s racing evil & foul thoughts have become a road block i=\r\nn my devotion and trying to keep me away from him as much as possible. At o=\r\nne point of time, they dominated me and I had to stay away from praying him=\r\n for a while.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now my questions are\n&gt; Am I a Maha papi or ghora papi th=\r\nat this is happening to me?\n&gt; Why does it happen to me?\n&gt; Is it some kind o=\r\nf disorder\n&gt; Am in incurring wrath of god=A0\n&gt; I am scared to death that I =\r\nam accumulating the greatest sin enough for some 100 births\n&gt; What can I do=\r\n to get out of this perversion and be able to concentrate on him\n&gt; I want t=\r\no worship god like every one does\n&gt; I am highly stressed because of this co=\r\nnstant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always in pain because of this st=\r\nress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please help me , but do no hate me. Please do not disregard or d=\r\niscard my email. This is a situation I can&#39;t disclose to anyone in person w=\r\nith the fear of hatred and resentment. I am hoping to get some relief from =\r\nlearned scholars like yourself.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
