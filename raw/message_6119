Alocohol is triple cursed ( Curses from Brihaspa=\r\nti, Shukracharya and Lord Krishna ) and so do rest of the intoxicants carry=\r\n powerful curses.\n\nIn the battle between the intoxicant and you only one ca=\r\nn win. If it wins it will start to consume you and if you can win ...please=\r\n note the word if , you can harness the power of the intoxicant to break th=\r\nrough some of the logical shackles of the brain.\n\nRecently some studies wer=\r\ne by neurologists and they have found controlled application of intoxicants=\r\n like marijuana to help alzheimer&#39;s patients ( search in nytimes ) and othe=\r\nr people with broken neurological systems.\n\nAnywaz long story short.Please =\r\nsteer widely clear of intoxicants. It is simply not worth the risk . \n\n:) I=\r\nt is just like Shava sadhana,undoubtedly a very powerful technique but with=\r\nout the right guidance of the guru one will scare himself to death when the=\r\n spirits play mischeif with the corpse and one will die of sheer nervous br=\r\neakdown and since the  moment of leaving the body is of sheer importance ..=\r\n.one will end up as an spirit rather than having achieved the great fruit o=\r\nf the sadhana.\n\nIt would be much better to stick to the path of surrender t=\r\no the deity and doing daily homa.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; NAMASKAR\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Gurujans,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have learned recently that there is very useful =\r\neffects of intoxicants in sadhana like Nicotine, Cannabis etc...Could anyon=\r\ne help out how to use them so that to minimize the hermful effect of it...\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Biswajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
