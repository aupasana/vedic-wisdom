I said to him, there are countless stori=\r\nes of devotees having Darshan of their God, is it actually possible today, =\r\nin this day and age?\n\nHe said, yes most certainly! But he said Darshan of G=\r\nod means feeling the Divine Presence in yourself, and all things, living an=\r\nd non-living, in every atom, everywhere. This, he said, is Darshan.\n\nI am c=\r\nontinuing with japa in the hope of one day getting to this stage of feeling=\r\n the presence of God everywhere at all times. \n\nHowever, having said that, =\r\nI have not given up the idea of &#39;seeing&#39; God (may be with the &#39;inner eye&#39;) =\r\nin the form of Vishnu and Krishna- yes, with mace, discus, flute and all!!\n=\r\n\nThe Bhagavatam says that Dhruva, Prahlad, even the elephant king Gajendra =\r\nsaw Vishnu....then why not me?!! Of course I&#39;ll have to do a lot of japa, a=\r\n lot of sadhana, remove all negative emotions, become a paragon of virtue (=\r\nOh god!) but I believe that if I do, it&#39;s bound to happen. May take a few l=\r\nifetimes though (but I&#39;m going to try and do it this time, you&#39;ve got to tr=\r\ny at least!).\n\nIf ulta Rama nama could transform rogue Ratnakar into saint =\r\nValmiki, and grant him Darshan of Sri Rama, then why cannot Om Namo Narayan=\r\na convert rogue Aparna into saint Aparna one day and give her Darshan of Vi=\r\nshnu/Krishna....I believe that the mantra can do anything. Anything. We&#39;ll =\r\nall be saints one day....ain&#39;t got no choice, He&#39;ll see to it. :)\n\nThanks f=\r\nor the message. :)\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi N=\r\narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; =A0 =A0 I still cannot underst=\r\nand why it is wrong to have a spiritual experiences or to think about them.=\r\n After all we cannot go to a shop and just buy them. If we are doing sadhan=\r\na and we need support they are going to happen. Why deny them? Suppose some=\r\none is doing the complete purscharan =A0of mantra, is to wrong =A0not to ex=\r\npect something amazing might happen at the end of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some years ago t=\r\nhere was a Hindi author who was well off and had a Temple in their home for=\r\n several generations. Something happened in this authors life and he felt l=\r\not of trauma and could not find mental peace. In his later life he took up =\r\ndoing prayers and japa etc as he was taught in his younger days. One night =\r\nhis daughter said to him, you are doing so much prayers etc, have you had a=\r\nny experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; The author became upset and said, no, he had not any e=\r\nxperiences. Many times he thinks that he is siting in front of a stone in t=\r\nhe temple and it is all useless. But he will not give up his prayers as his=\r\n time is coming nearer.\n&gt; Next morning when this author was in his Temple a=\r\nnd priest was doing ManglaAarti, The Deity\n&gt; Spoke to him and comforted him=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0Several days later when he went to a famous Temple in Rajasthan, =\r\nagain the Divine Lord spoke to him there and comforted him and said there i=\r\ns no difference between Him and Deities in his home Temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I rea=\r\nd this story I knew immediately it was a true story. Very similar things ha=\r\nve happened with me to help me and comfort me.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; We are going from A =\r\nto B. Is it a relentless journey? Are there no breaks, petrol stations or s=\r\nhops where we can get out and stretch ourselves. Are there any road signs. =\r\nSpiritual experiences are like these. They guide us and show us if we are o=\r\nn a right path.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was thinking of writing to this devotee who had this=\r\n powerful experience in Temple. Please write about it. What you experienced=\r\n and what really happened. It will give knowledge to others. But then I rea=\r\nlised that I am a lone ranger here and many times go against the stream.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; =A0Many people are very young here and take NarasimhaBhai as their guru =\r\nor spiritual adviser. So if guruji is saying something, chela and clients c=\r\nannot go against it. Othewise their fire-pot, ghee-pot and coco-pot will be=\r\n confiscated.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; I was also like this in my life. I took diksha=A0 fro=\r\nm my Late Uncle who was famous in his days.\n&gt; When I tried to talk to him a=\r\nbout Darshan of Divine Lord, he became very negative and said it is not pos=\r\nsible. I kept very quite. I did not try to give examples of saints like Tul=\r\nsidas or others who had Darshan. I had not done any spiritual sadhana and s=\r\no no personal experiences.\n&gt; .=A0\n&gt; Since then my life has changed due to d=\r\nifferent spiritual experiences. Sure I am still in lot of pain and not in a=\r\n complete bliss all the the time but I know Divine Beings can very easily g=\r\nive Darshan And having spiritual experiences are very helpful for spiritual=\r\n growth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
