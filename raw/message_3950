They always wish we=\r\nll for their disciples and have good amount of patience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many Sadgurus=\r\n take care of their disciples for many life times, helping and guiding in e=\r\nach life time.\n&gt; \n&gt; They always preach many things and show value for diffe=\r\nrent types of sadhanas depending on their state, time, and type of disciple=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; For householders always there are challanges and one should request =\r\nGod to look into it and give guidance and help, whether it is food, house, =\r\nmarriage, car, or any material issue. There is nothing wrong in doing this,=\r\n even if sadhana done for materialistic benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; Today even those who=\r\n have renounced householder life have to pray god to fulfill some of their =\r\nmaterial needs.\n&gt; \n&gt; We live in very difficult and challanging times and it=\r\n appears it is going to become more challenging.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some material gain ca=\r\nn at times make a person better or more balanced or be more prepared to do =\r\nsadhana for spiritual benefits. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even during an eclipse many people do=\r\n mantras etc to solve problems or improve material conditions, there is not=\r\nhing wrong about it. I have read messages in the past on this group suggest=\r\ning natives not to do it or it is wrong. These type of messages are not cor=\r\nrect, it only confuses people. Time during the eclipse is very good for get=\r\nting results for any sadhana done during that time. it is equally good for =\r\nmaterial or spiritual type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone has right to have a opinion and s=\r\nhare their views but one needs to also understand the influence aspect of t=\r\nhose views.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every Shotra or prayer or even Geeta or Ramayan, there are=\r\n riders at the end for results like becoming wealthy, overcoming challenges=\r\n, enemies etc.\n&gt; If it were inappropriate the Seers from the past would not=\r\n write it.\n&gt; Are they wrong in writing that?\n&gt; \n&gt; They write it to motivate=\r\n people to read them as one reads more times there is a possibility that ma=\r\ny lead to change in the person&#39;s attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving to original set of q=\r\nuestions,\n&gt; \n&gt; Every one is born with accumulated sanskars out of which as =\r\na native interacts with the world some of these accumulated or sanchit sans=\r\nkars take the form of prarabdh sanskara, these type of sanskars give pleasu=\r\nre, pain and challanges to the native. Sanchit Sanskars are like seeds and =\r\nPrarabdh sanskars are like a tree that bears fruit.\n&gt; \n&gt; All human beings a=\r\nre also born with another quality and that is known as will power. They say=\r\n will power can change destiny ...\n&gt; \n&gt; When one does sadhana like say Homa=\r\nam or Japam. Many things happen\n&gt; at many levels, at times there is improve=\r\nment in materialistic situation, problems get solved or if the problems rem=\r\nain that state of sadhaka becomes such that he or she pays less attention t=\r\no the problem or attaches less importance to the problem. God or Guru or Sh=\r\nakti shows the sadhaka a path to move forward. Sadhana does increase will p=\r\nower and makes one more tolerant and \n&gt; Sadhana also help in eliminating th=\r\ne sanchit sanskars, in fact one Saint use to say, do your sadhana and your =\r\nsanchit sanskars will get crushed such that they can never germinate or fru=\r\nitify into prarabdh sanskars.\n&gt; \n&gt; So yes doing sadhana can help one overco=\r\nme many things at different levels and help one move in the right direction=\r\n. At times one moves faster or very slowly. The important thing is moving a=\r\nnd if one falls down, than one should immediately get up.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are ma=\r\nny ways to improve and move faster towards spirtuality,\n&gt; Vimalanda is not =\r\njust one saint, there are many who have reached similar or higher or lower =\r\nrealizations adopting different methods and have written very good books to=\r\no. Sprituality is much bigger, deeper and broader than what Vimalanada has =\r\ndescribed in his books.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find it little cultish to just refer him all=\r\n the time in the group. Spirituaity is atleast not a narrow cult.\n&gt; \n&gt; Plea=\r\nse note that I have nothing against Him, I respect him as I respect other s=\r\naints from the bottom of my heart. I did spent money to get his books and p=\r\nlan to read in near future.\n&gt; \n&gt; I urge all the readers of this group to re=\r\nad more books from different sects, different saints and try to get appropr=\r\niate influence. Get broader and deeper views as that helps forming a good b=\r\nase for spirituality. Spirtuality is about tolerance and remaining neutral =\r\nin different situations.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Nath Sampradaya, Shiviates from Kashmir, =\r\nthe lineage of Ramananda,\n&gt; Datta Sampradaya, the sufis, even some christai=\r\nn saints (The book of Mirdad) and many more sects some of the Lhamas of Bud=\r\ndhism had very deeper realizations and experiance. There are many sects in =\r\nsouth india too, kerala, tamil nadu, andhra pradhesh, maharastra,rajastha n=\r\n, gujarat and other states, all of them had great saints.\n&gt; \n&gt; Generally th=\r\nese saints never bothered to write or explain or were not able to explain. =\r\nBut some did write and a lot of good work is out there to explore along wit=\r\nh doing sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; We live in times where there is very little guidance =\r\navailable on the path of spirituality. So in these times we have to make up=\r\n with reading good books written by saints of yestaryers and surrender more=\r\n to god.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is scarcity of Sadgurus and good Sadhaks, we have many =\r\nentry level and confused situation :-) ....\n&gt; \n&gt; If you look at sikhism, th=\r\ne last sadguru dev from their sect made the book &quot;granth saheb&quot; as the guru=\r\n instead of making anyone else take his seat.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Lahiri Mahashaya me=\r\nt a famoius saint of kashi, he got lot of respect from him. Some of the fam=\r\nous saint&#39;s disciple were upset,\n&gt; at that the saint reminds them that to r=\r\neach his own spiritual state he took 400 or so years but Lahiri Mahashaya d=\r\nid it in one birth.\n&gt; His name slips my tongue, he was big and very strong =\r\nlived in water many hours at a time, his name starts with tri. They say tha=\r\nt one is not able to stare at the eyes of the statue of the saint at his sa=\r\nmadhi mandir.\n&gt; \n&gt; One must always try to broaden ones perspective, all of =\r\nus have a long long way to go, even if some may feel that oh I only have so=\r\nme more things left so I may be done in some years, even that is an interes=\r\nting situation as there is always a chance of falling down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even for S=\r\naint Bharathari one of the nav naths, he was so elevated but he also had so=\r\nme sanskars that forced him to take birth and enjoy first and than suffer d=\r\nue to pingala. He was already realized before his birth as the rajah.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI did not intend to offend anyone or thier veiws, If I inadvertantly did it=\r\n I appologize in advance, Narashima has written very well many times and of=\r\n late has written some good stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Raju,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It seems honest outburst.

The breaking limit may =\r\nchange and then god may push further.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To use the analogy from =\r\nthe other mail of today, god the teacher does not test the 5th grade studen=\r\nt with 6th grade questions. Of course, a 5th grade student passing from 5th=\r\n grade to the 6th grade will now be tested with 6th grade questions. As one=\r\n advances from one grade to another, one is tested more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Les=\r\nsons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films tha=\r\nt make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- shashi_nambisan &lt;shashin=\r\n@gmail. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This depends on the selec=\r\ntion of diety.
