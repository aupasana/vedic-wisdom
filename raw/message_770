This is regarding Swami Brahmananda. I was \n\n&gt; reading a book on h=\r\nis life and various incidents connected to him  \n\n&gt; observed by other saint=\r\ns and his brother disciples.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Swami Brahmananda or Rakhal Maharaj was=\r\n the spiritual son of \n\nThakur. \n\n&gt; And no doubt a great spiritual super gi=\r\nant. Thakur used to say he \n\n&gt; was one of Sri Krishna&#39;s eternal playmates w=\r\nho had reincarnated on \n\n&gt; this plane.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; During his stay in various mo=\r\nnastaries of the Ramakrishna Mission, \n\n&gt; often other monks used to send ne=\r\nw initiates to Rakhal Maharaj for \n\n&gt; hios blessings. It was a generally ac=\r\ncepted idea among the \n\ndisciples \n\n&gt; of Thakur that any one who is blessed=\r\n by Rakhal Maharaj will never \n\n&gt; again be troubled by problems of lack of =\r\nBrahmacharya. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; One day an individual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking f=\r\nor his \n\n&gt; blessings and said &quot;Maharaj, please give me brahmacharya as a \n\n=\r\n&gt; blessing&quot;. Hearing this suddenly Rakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you \n\n&gt; peo=\r\nple always come asking for Brahmacharya? Was does not any one \n\n&gt; come to m=\r\ne asking me to give him/her God?

In general, it is \n\n&gt; good to try \n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; to overcome lust if it is possible.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Several &quot;normal college=\r\n going people&quot; were taken under his wings \n\n&gt; by \n\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramaha=\r\nmsa and transformed into spiritual giants. \n\n&gt; Swami \n\n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda, Swa=\r\nmi Brahmananda, Swami Yogananda etc were college \n\n&gt; students \n\n&gt; &gt; when th=\r\ney met Ramakrishna.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; But it is not easy to overcome lust at all. =\r\nSeveral of \n\n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s \n\n&gt; &gt; disciples also struggled with it initia=\r\nlly and overcame lust \n\nwith \n\n&gt; his \n\n&gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic =\r\nhuman instinct and not at all \n\neasy \n\n&gt; to kill \n\n&gt; &gt; completely.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go out of the \n\n&gt; min=\r\nd. Set a \n\n&gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some period like =\r\nthat \n\n&gt; and \n\n&gt; &gt; maintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts =\r\ncome.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overc=\r\noming \n\n&gt; the basic \n\n&gt; &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; su=\r\nppress desires but remove them from the root\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; True, suppressing d=\r\nesire will make the desire come back later. \n\n&gt; But, if one \n\n&gt; &gt; keeps ful=\r\nfilling desires, they never end!!  This is the nature \n\nof \n\n&gt; desire. \n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other than \n\n&gt; Self) =\r\nor \n\n&gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter how much \n=\r\n\n&gt; one gets.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root often requires suppre=\r\nssing the \n\n&gt; desire \n\n&gt; &gt; temporarily. But the thing to remember from the =\r\nAghora book is \n\n&gt; that just \n\n&gt; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. Pr=\r\nactice suppressing \n\n&gt; desires, but do \n\n&gt; &gt; remember that the final goal i=\r\ns to uproot it fully and keep \n\n&gt; working on it.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only reas=\r\non for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took s=\r\nuch a long time probasbly i can also do it , \n\nif\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at =\r\nleast in 10-12 years\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; That is the right spirit!\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Spirit=\r\nual progress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is \n\n&gt; one thing. \n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not become \n\n&gt; attach=\r\ned to \n\n&gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions =\r\n\n\nand \n\n&gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing.\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; There are several things in spiritual progress. They all come \n\n=\r\n&gt; together! One \n\n&gt; &gt; person may develop detachment to actions and possessi=\r\nons and \n\n&gt; brahmacharya \n\n&gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One person may =\r\nachieve brahmacharya \n\n&gt; first and \n\n&gt; &gt; detachment may become easy as a re=\r\nsult and come later. Various \n\n&gt; signs of \n\n&gt; &gt; spiritual progress come alm=\r\nost together, but the exact order can \n\n&gt; change from \n\n&gt; &gt; person to perso=\r\nn. Thus, do not be disappointed by your inability \n\n&gt; to get \n\n&gt; &gt; somethin=\r\ng.

Please advise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajesh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Tue, 16/12/08, utpal pathak &lt;i&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;/i=\r\n&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255=\r\n); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_patha=\r\nk@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya&lt;br&gt;To=\r\n: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Tuesday, 16 December, 2008, 2:12 PM=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv30487598&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n          =\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLet me put some thoughts and i&#39;ll continue writng as=\r\n it keeps on &lt;br&gt;\noccuring to me...&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n1) Thakur&#39;s marraige was never=\r\n a marriage in physical sense&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n2) The author of &#39;Autobiography of a=\r\n Yogi&#39;, Paramhamsa Yogananda has &lt;br&gt;\nmentioned in the same book that his p=\r\narents lived like a Husband &amp; &lt;br&gt;\nwife only once a year to biget child=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n3) I&#39;ve read some where that our ancient Rishis though married, =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nlived extremely restarined married life and that too only to beget &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nchildren.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n4) Adi Shankaracharya, Swami Vivekananda and all monas=\r\ntic disciples &lt;br&gt;\nof Thakur, Swami Sivanada, Gnaneshwar, SainBaba, Aurobin=\r\ndo, Sri Sri &lt;br&gt;\nRavishankar and countless known realised souls never marri=\r\ned (We &lt;br&gt;\nassume that they maintained perfect brahmacharya) .&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n5)=\r\n Many saints such as Tukaaram, Eknaath, Narasee Mehta, Jalaaram, &lt;br&gt;\nRishi=\r\ns of yore, Ekanaath, Mirabai, Jana Bai, and many other saints &lt;br&gt;\nwere mar=\r\nried. but i am confident that at some stage in their life &lt;br&gt;\nthey would h=\r\nave ended, forever, the physical relationship with their &lt;br&gt;\nspouses.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n6)complete Brahmachaya includes Physical &amp; Mental. physical &lt;br&gt;\nb=\r\nrahmacharya includes Restrain of all the indriyaas and not just the &lt;br&gt;\npr=\r\nocreative organs.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere are many things looks contradictory in abo=\r\nve but if one see &lt;br&gt;\ndeeper then there is a wonderful synergy. there is a=\r\n common truth. &lt;br&gt;\nwhat i&#39;ve started believing from the above written thou=\r\nghts as well &lt;br&gt;\nas many unwritten thoughts is that Brahmachrya is one of =\r\nthe most &lt;br&gt;\nimportant vertue for realisation. but it seems that even marr=\r\nied &lt;br&gt;\npeople will also start maintaining that, knowingly or unknowingly =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nbefore final realisation. actually, it seems that Like realisation, &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nBrahmachrya aslo DAWNS !!!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWarm Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUtpal &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;ra=\r\njarshi14@ ...&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nwrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear Members&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I was re reading this thread on the light of something I had come &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; across very recently. This is regarding Swami Brahmananda. I was &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; reading a book on his life and various incidents connected to him  &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; observed by other saints and his brother disciples.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Swami Brahmananda or Rakhal Maharaj was the spiritual son of &lt;br&gt;\nThaku=\r\nr. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And no doubt a great spiritual super giant. Thakur used to say=\r\n he &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was one of Sri Krishna&#39;s eternal playmates who had reincarnat=\r\ned on &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; this plane.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; During his stay in various m=\r\nonastaries of the Ramakrishna Mission, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; often other monks used to =\r\nsend new initiates to Rakhal Maharaj for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hios blessings. It was a=\r\n generally accepted idea among the &lt;br&gt;\ndisciples &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of Thakur that =\r\nany one who is blessed by Rakhal Maharaj will never &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; again be trou=\r\nbled by problems of lack of Brahmacharya. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One day an in=\r\ndividual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking for his &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; blessings and said=\r\n &quot;Maharaj, please give me brahmacharya as a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; blessing&quot;. Hearing th=\r\nis suddenly Rakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; people always come a=\r\nsking for Brahmacharya? Was does not any one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; come to me asking me=\r\n to give him/her God?

Someone &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; else may have to first overcome his lust even=\r\n to have a vision &lt;br&gt;\nof &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the deity. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What is good =\r\nfor goose is not good for gander. In general, it is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; good to try &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to overcome lust if it is possible.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; Several &quot;normal college going people&quot; were taken under his wings &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; by &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and transformed into spiritua=\r\nl giants. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Swami &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Sw=\r\nami Yogananda etc were college &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; students &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; when they =\r\nmet Ramakrishna.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But it is not easy to overcom=\r\ne lust at all. Several of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; disciples=\r\n also struggled with it initially and overcame lust &lt;br&gt;\nwith &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; his=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and not at a=\r\nll &lt;br&gt;\neasy &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to kill &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; completely.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go out of th=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mind. Set a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 d=\r\nays or some period like that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; maintain physical=\r\n brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; F=\r\neeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overcoming &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; th=\r\ne basic &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thin=\r\ng is not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the desire =\r\ncome back later. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But, if one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling desi=\r\nres, they never end!!  This is the nature &lt;br&gt;\nof &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; desire. &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other than &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Self) or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end=\r\n no matter how much &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; one gets.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Removi=\r\nng desire from the root often requires suppressing the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; desire &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; temporarily. But the thing to remember from the Aghora book is =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that just &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. Pr=\r\nactice suppressing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; desires, but do &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; remember that t=\r\nhe final goal is to uproot it fully and keep &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; working on it.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for br=\r\nahamcharya is if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time proba=\r\nsbly i can also do it , &lt;br&gt;\nif&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least =\r\nin 10-12 years&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is the right spirit!&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot of things and bra=\r\nhmacharya is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; one thing. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing=\r\n is to overcome ego and not become &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; attached to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; thi=\r\nngs. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions &lt;br&gt;\nand &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are several things in spiritual progress. T=\r\nhey all come &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; together! One &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; person may develop deta=\r\nchment to actions and possessions and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; brahmacharya &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n may become easy as a result. One person may achieve brahmacharya &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n first and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; detachment may become easy as a result and come l=\r\nater. Various &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; signs of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; spiritual progress come alm=\r\nost together, but the exact order can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; change from &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nperson to person. Thus, do not be disappointed by your inability &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nto get &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; something. It may be possible to work it out from ano=\r\nther angle!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -&lt;br&gt;\n-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\npirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/=\r\na&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro. home=\r\n.comcast. net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;=\r\nnofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.o=\r\nrg&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;\n- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste sir&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; i know you are lot busy but since i couldn;t ask this question =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\non a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; public forum as it may probably offend others.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; If you have time ,if you could please reply.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; I was thinking this for many days&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that as mentioned =\r\nin recent thread on brahamcharya,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; it was important to maintai=\r\nn brahamcharya but i wanted to ask &lt;br&gt;\nthat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; even vimalananda=\r\n had to work for 6 years for overcoming lust &lt;br&gt;\nthough&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; he h=\r\nad his deity with him from the very early in life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; how can normal college going people like me who don&#39;t even have a&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; deity obtain this goal.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though i try to maintain ph=\r\nysical brahamcharya for few months but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; after that i am not ab=\r\nle to hold it ,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and even if i maintain some physical chastity=\r\n it refuses to go &lt;br&gt;\nout&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of mind&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my mind&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though =\r\ni have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Brahamcharya&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progress in maintai=\r\nng&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Brahamcharya&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and sometimes it=\r\n makes me guilt ridden.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The only reason for wh=\r\nich i keep trying for brahamcharya is if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; vimalananda took suc=\r\nh a long time probasbly i can also do it , if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not in 6 years =\r\nat least in 10-12 years&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; you can also reply on =\r\nVEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; identity from thi=\r\ns that would be appreciable&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; if what i worte of=\r\nfended you please delete this mail&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt; =\r\n \n\n\n\t \n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--6--&gt;&lt;hr size=\r\n=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy! &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nin.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_messenger_6/*http://messenger.yahoo.com/invite/&quot;&gt; I=\r\nnvite them now.&lt;/a&gt;\r\n--0-862060169-1229492029=:45019--\r\n\n"}}
