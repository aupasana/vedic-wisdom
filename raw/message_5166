This is=\r\n one of the most incredible stories\nof personal commitment.\n\nNarayanan Kris=\r\nhnan, all of 29 years old now, does what he was\nprofessionally trained to d=\r\no as a chef. Feed people. Only Krishnan\ndoes not do this in the swanky conf=\r\nines of a 5-star hotel. Every day,\nhe wakes up at 4 am, cooks a simple hot =\r\nmeal and then, along with his team, loads it in a van and travels about 200=\r\n km feeding the homeless in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Krishnan feeds, often with=\r\n his hands, almost 400 destitute people every day. And for those who need i=\r\nt, he provides a free haircut too.\n\nAccording to CNN, eight years ago, this=\r\n award-winning chef with a\nfive-star hotel chain was all set\n to go to Swit=\r\nzerland for a\nhigh-profile posting. On a visit to a Madurai temple, he came=\r\n across a\nhomeless, old man eating his own human waste. That stark sight ch=\r\nanged Krishnan&#39;s life. Much to the dismay of his parents, CNN says, Krishna=\r\nn abandoned his career plans and decided to spend his life and his professi=\r\nonal training in looking after those who could not care for themselves. He =\r\nhas provided more than 1.2 million hot meals through his nonprofit organisa=\r\ntion Akshaya Trust, and now hopes to extend this to shelter for the homeles=\r\ns too.\n\nKrishnan is the only Indian in a list of 10 heroes that CNN has pic=\r\nked\nworldwide to honour. One of them will be chosen CNN Hero of the Year, s=\r\nelected by the public through an online poll. If many Indians get together =\r\nto vote for this inspiring man, he can win by a long mile.\n\nIf Krishnan win=\r\ns he will get $100,000 in addition to the $25,000 that\nhe gets for being sh=\r\nortlisted for the Top 10.\n Akshaya Trust needs all\nthe monetary support it =\r\ncan get to build on Krishnan&#39;s dream.
