At one time, one\nth=\r\ning is pleasing and at other times, the same thing is nauseating.\n\nD.: How?=\r\n\n\nM.: Take a woman, for instance. When the man is lustful,she is fancied\nto=\r\n be pleasing; when he suffers from fever, she is not wanted; for a\nman grow=\r\nn desireless, she is of no interest at all. According to\ncircumstances the =\r\nsame woman can be pleasing,unwanted, or of no\ninterest. The same applies to=\r\n all other objects of enjoyment. Thus the\nnon-self cannot be pleasing.\n\nSou=\r\nrce: ADVAITA BODHA DEEPIKA\n\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\n"}}
