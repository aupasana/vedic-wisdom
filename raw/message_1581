Aurobindo&#39;s commentaries on Veda and Upanishat are =\r\nthe best and most insightful that you can find today. He is undoubtedly a r=\r\nishi. His diagnosis of the situation is very appropriate even today and bea=\r\nutiful to read. I am copying it below.\n \nWhen I say we need spiritual sadha=\r\nkas who achieve detachment and equanimity and become instruments of Mother =\r\nand when Aurobindo says we need a &quot;nucleus of men in whom Shakti is develop=\r\ned to its uttermost extent&quot;, we are essentially saying the same thing in di=\r\nfferent words. I am confident that the day will come when Aurobindo&#39;s desir=\r\ne is fulfilled, within the next few decades. Unfortunately, I sometimes see=\r\n people who have the potential to be in the &quot;nucleus&quot; that Aurobindo refers=\r\n to joining the frustrated crowds on the periphery.\n \nRahul asked anna to &quot;=\r\nempower&quot; him and others. A vessel of mud has to be baked before one can pou=\r\nr water in it. Even a rishi like Vivekananda needed to do intense sadhana t=\r\no purify himself for several years before he could be empowered by Ramakris=\r\nhna.\n \nIf one really wants to strengthen sanatana dharma, one needs to accu=\r\nmulate spiritual shakti (and not waste it). I suggest the following. Take a=\r\n homam (e.g. Chandi homam or Ganapathi homam or Rama homam etc) and do it e=\r\nveryday with some niyamas. Or take a mantra or prayer (e.g. Chandipath or V=\r\nishnu sahasra naam or manahamantra etc) and do it everyday for 2-3 hours wi=\r\nth some niyamas. I can suggest the following niyamas - close the eyes, keep=\r\n the back straight during meditation and minimize body movement. Do the rit=\r\nual at the same time everyday at the same place (as much as possible). Main=\r\ntain physical brahmacharya atleast and eventually mental too. Strive to get=\r\n control over emotions and not become angry or jealous or lustful etc, as o=\r\nne&#39;s shakti leaks (gets wasted) whenever one loses self control.\n \nSadhakas=\r\n engaging in intense sadhana, purifying themselves and achieving utter equa=\r\nnimity and detachment will accumulate so much spiritual and mental shakti t=\r\nhat they will combine and shake the world in the coming decades and establi=\r\nsh sanatana dharma for a few centuries to come. It is for this purpose that=\r\n Mother asked my guru Manish Pandit, when She appeared in front of him in M=\r\narch 2006 at the Kalikambal temple in Chennai, to teach a very simple homam=\r\n procedure to interested sadhakas across the world without differentiating =\r\non the basis of class, caste and creed. Homam will enable several people to=\r\n purify themselves and accumulate spiritual shakti.\n \nOK, now read what Aur=\r\nobindo says.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@yah=\r\noo.co.in&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, April 01, 200=\r\n9 1:49 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Some lines from Sri Aurobindo&#39;s India&#39;s r=\r\nebirth\n \n\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; Following are some lines from Sri Aurobindo&#39;s book=\r\n India&#39;s rebirth.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;India, the ancient Mother, is indeed striving to be=\r\n reborn, striving with agony and tears, but she strives in vain. What ails =\r\nher, she who is after all so vast and might be so strong? There is surely s=\r\nome enormous defect, something vital is wanting in us, nor is it difficult =\r\nto lay our finger on the spot. We have all things else, but we are empty of=\r\n strength, void of energy. We have abandoned Shakti and are therefore aband=\r\noned by Shakti. The Mother is not in our hearts, in our brains, in our arms=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it love, enthusiasm, Bhakti that is wanting? These are ingrained =\r\nin the Indian nature, but in the absence of Shakti we cannot concentrate, w=\r\ne cannot direct, we cannot even preserve it. Bhakti is the leaping flame, S=\r\nhakti is the fuel. If the fuel is scanty how long can the fire endure?...\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The deeper we look, the more we shall be convinced that the one thing w=\r\nanting, which we must strive to acquire before all others, is strength?stre=\r\nngth physical, strength mental, strength moral, but above all strength spir=\r\nitual which is the one inexhaustible and imperishable source of all the oth=\r\ners. If we have strength everything else will be added to us easily and nat=\r\nurally. In the absence of strength we are like men in a dream who have hand=\r\ns but cannot seize or strike, who have feet but cannot run....\n&gt; \n&gt; What is=\r\n our mother-country? It is not a piece of earth, nor a figure of speech, no=\r\nr a fiction of the mind. It is a mighty Shakti, composed of the Shaktis of =\r\nall the millions of units that make up the nation, just as Bhawani Mahisha =\r\nMardini sprang into being from the Shakti of all the millions of gods assem=\r\nbled in one mass of force and welded into unity. The Shakti we call India, =\r\nBhawani Bharati, is the living unity of the Shaktis of three hundred millio=\r\nn people,[3] but she is inactive, imprisoned in the magic circle of Tamas, =\r\nthe self-indulgent inertia and ignorance of her sons....\n&gt; \n&gt; We have to cr=\r\neate strength where it did not exist before; we have to change our natures,=\r\n and become new men with new hearts, to be born again....

When we chann=\r\nel it properly, we fulfil our dharma successfully. When the fire is unchann=\r\neled and beset with impurities, we waste energy and fail to fulfil our dhar=\r\nma.\n\n  Fire in conjunction with sattwa guna generates knowledge (jnaana sha=\r\nkti). Fire in conjunction with rajo guna generates actions (kriyaa shakti).=\r\n Fire in conjunction with tamo guna generates desires (ichchhaa shakti). We=\r\n need people who mainly have sattwa and also some rajas. Such people have c=\r\nlear thinking backed by correct knowledge and engage in fruitful actions. I=\r\nt is more important to engage in a few fruitful actions than to engage in t=\r\noo many mis-directed actions and be left with unfulfilled desires and frust=\r\nration, which is what happens when there is too much tamas and rajas. There=\r\n are many self-styled &quot;Hindutva&quot; warriors today who fall in the latter cate=\r\ngory. They yell from rooftops in shrill voices, but do not accomplish much.=\r\n Do we need some more such people?\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  What Hindutva =\r\nneeds today is a few detached Arjunas who destroy mighty armies without hat=\r\nred for anyone in their heart. What Hindutva needs today is a few detached =\r\nVivekanandas who inspire millions with their magnetic personality without a=\r\nny passion in their heart.\n\n  Act like a passionate man, but have no passio=\r\nn in your heart. Fight unwaveringly, but have no hatred for anyone.\n\n  If o=\r\nne is fighting a war with passion, frustration or hatred in one&#39;s heart, on=\r\ne will only go so far and achieve only so much. What such a person achieves=\r\n will be short-lived. If one first overcomes attractions and repulsions, ha=\r\ns a stable and unperturbed heart without passion and hatred and becomes a d=\r\netached instrument of Nature engaging in spontaneous actions without any at=\r\ntachment, one will achieve much more and what one achieves will be long-liv=\r\ned.\n\n  I am writing this to this group of people because my intuition tells=\r\n me that there are some on this group who have the potential to become such=\r\n instruments of Mother.\n\n  Do some spiritual sadhana first and overcome the=\r\n weaknesses. Have a stable, unperturbed and equanimous heart. Then Nature w=\r\nill show you the way.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  Ceturies ago, western invad=\r\ners went about their business with great dexterity and patience to affect t=\r\nhe psyche of Hindus, especially intelligentsia. Their slow, patient, dexter=\r\nous and systematic propaganda is bearing fruit even today. To undo their wo=\r\nrk, one needs to be equally dexterous and patient. This is not the work for=\r\n hot-blooded, angry and frustrated people. One needs to be cool-headed, sma=\r\nrt and patient.\n\n  Another thing is that sanatana dharma is broken today. I=\r\nn pursuit of modern education, the cream of Indian intelligentsia stopped e=\r\nngaging in our traditional knowledge. This brought a discontinuity in knowl=\r\nedge. We have some faithful Hindus engaging in superstitious and/or purpose=\r\nless practices. We have many priests who are corrupted by money and fame, d=\r\non&#39;t do any sadhana and don&#39;t have any spiritual strength. Many intelligent=\r\n people either dissociate themselves from religion or follow religion passi=\r\nvely without much faith and with some shame or misgivings. At the root of t=\r\nhis is the broken knowledge and purposeless practices.\n\n  Also, we have man=\r\ny bad practices that afflict Hinduism due to Kali, which need to be gotten =\r\nrid of. For example, caste system of today is so different from old days. T=\r\nhe concept of caste mobility is gone now - one would start with father&#39;s ca=\r\nste, but get a caste later on based on one&#39;s aptitude and attitude in old d=\r\nays. For example, Valmiki was a shudra by birth who lived by killing birds =\r\nand he became a brahmana and a brahmarshi later. Vishwamitra was a kshatriy=\r\na by birth but became a brahmana and a brahmarshi later and even became one=\r\n of saptarshis. If lower caste and untouchable Hindus feel aversion to Hind=\r\nuism which is exploted by Christian missionaries who offer money and respec=\r\nt to convert, some fault lies with Hinduism too. We need to reform casteism=\r\n.\n\n  There are many things that need to be done. At one level, some propaga=\r\nnda needs to be done on the greatness of Hinduism. This needs to be done wi=\r\nth a cool, scholarly and patient attitude (as opposed to yelling in shrill =\r\nvoice from rooftops like some Hindutva activists foolishly do). At another =\r\nlevel, broken links within Hinduism need to be rediscovered so that the kno=\r\nwledgebase of our philosophy is correctly represented to sway the intellige=\r\nntsia. While other religions are based on &quot;faith&quot; in the words of a messiah=\r\n, Hinduism has a wide-ranging and sophisticated philosophy and methods that=\r\n can enable anyone to become a messiah. However, the knowledge has become c=\r\norrupted and incomplete and some intelligent people are justified in not ha=\r\nving faith. At yet another level, we need to reform some social and cultura=\r\nl aspects of Hindusm and undo some changes brought in by Kali.\n\n  There are=\r\n many things to do and this will take many decades of focused and concerted=\r\n effort.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  Personally, I have no doubt that the tim=\r\ne of weakening (or even fall) of certain faiths has come. In the next few d=\r\necades, some faiths will be weakened considerably and sanatana dharma will =\r\nbe strengthened. However, this being Kali yuga, such a change will not be p=\r\nermanent.\n\n  Best regards,\n  Narasimha\n  ----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n  Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org/homam\n  Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org/tarpana\n  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\n  Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n  Free J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n  Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n  ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n   \n  --- On Tue, 3/31/09, Rahul=\r\n Chaturvedi &lt;rahul@...&gt;

That-if she received divine inspiration she would go to Kandhama=\r\nl.The first one of describing conversions as God&#39;s work is the usual clich=\r\n=E9 which comes handy to all those involved in conversion. Conversion is to=\r\n Christianity what Jehad is to Islam. Sr Prema further explained that, &#39;Eve=\r\nry human being has the right to believe. Each person is born with dignity. =\r\nReligious conversion is God&#39;s work&#39;. The contradictions galore within the t=\r\nwo sentences are glaring. If every person has the right to believe then whe=\r\nre is the need to initiate that person to something new and strange and in =\r\nsomething in which that person is not born in? Should one god be exorcised =\r\nout of the person and another god be installed to uphold the dignity with w=\r\nhich this person was born with?This is actually what conversion is all abou=\r\nt. Why this rupturing of the person from what he/she was .So what Sr Prema =\r\nreally means is that every person has a right to be converted and hence the=\r\n right of the person to believe is conditioned  and restrictedto only belie=\r\nving in the god in whom Sr Prema and her whole church believes in. This is =\r\nwhat Sr Prema articulated when she so naively asserted that every person ha=\r\ns a right to believe and every person is born with dignity. That this god i=\r\ns only 2000 years old and somehow seems to be always in the company of thos=\r\ne who invade the land of others is another dimension which needs a longer t=\r\nreatise.\n\n      If conversion is God&#39;s work then whose work is re-conversio=\r\nn?  Sr Prema-the Superior General of the MoC and the whole armies of Christ=\r\nian missionaries involved in conversion has failed this god miserably-becau=\r\nse their god has failed them. If conversion is God&#39;s work he seems to be ra=\r\nther slow and inefficient. The Catholic Church has the biggest army of nuns=\r\n and priests and the Christian evangelical churches have their own brand of=\r\n evangelists, the Southern Baptists alone as a group has nearly 100,00 care=\r\ner missionaries in North India. Yet this God seem to be hardly having an im=\r\npact. This god also seem to be scared-does not direct their efforts to the =\r\nIslamic countries. Is He afraid of terrorists?It is the simple unarmed, pov=\r\nerty stricken tribals and passive Hindus that this God and his divine inspi=\r\nred missionaries  target at . And yet not so easy given the enormous funds =\r\nthat flow and the armies at the disposal of this god he had to give divine\n=\r\n      inspiration to a Christian agency to massacre an unarmed poor swamiji=\r\n whom he found a great hurdle to spread his kingdom.\n      Sr Prema has unw=\r\nittingly exposed the bluff of the Congress and the UPA leaders. We are told=\r\n that conversion is not taking place. Conversion takes different forms-glob=\r\nally, it is  disguised as a military coup, violence and very often a decept=\r\nion of service and development is the sheen given to this violent conversio=\r\nn. Yes conversion is violence wrought on a person-to deprive the person of =\r\nhis/her dignity which according to Sr Prema every person is born with-to te=\r\nar the person off his affinity, his religious heritage and made him/her an =\r\nalien is a psychological bleeding to death. Christianity and conversion are=\r\n two sides of the same coin. Where ever Christianity went it was bloodshed-=\r\ndestruction, and a hidden agenda of political power, economic aggrandizemen=\r\nt, and pauperization of the victims. In the words of the Kenyatta (the Keny=\r\nan freedom fighter) &#39;when the missionaries came they had the Bible and we h=\r\nad the land. They said, &#39;Let us pray,&#39; We\n      closed our eyes, when we op=\r\nened them, they had our lands and we had the Bible&#39;. This is true not only =\r\nin Africa but all over the globe. Those countries which broke away from the=\r\n stranglehold of Vatican became progressive-like Canada, Australia, England=\r\n but those colonized by the catholic powers like Spain, Portugal Mexico, Ar=\r\ngentina, Cuba, Italy are mired in military rule and church tyranny. Christi=\r\nanity today likes to be seen as a peace loving, compassionate religion of b=\r\nrotherhood. But far from it-the religion was born in blood and grew in bloo=\r\ndshed. Economic and political powers are its hidden agenda covered with ser=\r\nvice organizations, education institutions etc.\n      May be Sr Prema is to=\r\no na=EFve to understand and she as all nuns and priests are ignorant of chu=\r\nrch history. These nuns and priests are brainwashed into this service and l=\r\nove of the poor mission.Many soon realize but then it is too late for them =\r\nespecially in India to be courageous to act and pull out. They become like =\r\nvoices in the wilderness and the church is too powerful an organization to =\r\nfight against by ordinary innocent and truthful persons.\n      This brings =\r\nme to Sr Prema&#39;s pious wish-that she would visit Kandhamal if she receives =\r\n&#39;divine inspiration&#39; and she would definitely intervene. One wonder what in=\r\ntervention is she talking about-intervene for whom and with whom? Sr Prema =\r\nwould do a greater service if she visited the ex nun Jesme in Kerala and li=\r\nstened to her tale of sexual harassment within the convent-how she was betr=\r\nayed by her own and even had to submit herself to priests to be stripped na=\r\nked. This is nothing new. and not a singular case but happenings that have =\r\nbeen on for ages-these sexual escapades -including rape and murder have bee=\r\nn happenings within the confines of the convents and the church compound .O=\r\nnly when a nun is raped outside these confines then all hell breaks loose. =\r\nSr Prema could direct her divine inspired mission to empathize with Sr Jesm=\r\ny and many like her and intervene with the church authorities .Sr Prema the=\r\n Superior General of the MoC should be aware\n      that nuns are on contrac=\r\neptives, nuns have begotten children of bishops and priests-whole dioceses =\r\nhave been sold in the USA to pay the compensation for the sexual violation =\r\non alter boys by priests. A Jesuit province in the USA has declared itself =\r\ninsolvent because it cannot garner the huge funds to pay the compensation t=\r\no the sexual victims by its perpetrators-the priests. Be it in India or in =\r\nother parts of the world all this pales into nothing-only Kandhamal occupie=\r\ns and covers the whole vision of the pious Christians and Sr Prema is no ex=\r\nception.  I suggest that she first visit the Ashram of Swami Lakshmanada an=\r\nd soothe the terror stricken children in whose presence the 84 year Swamiji=\r\n was brutally butchered. Three nuns who were with him were also killed. Wil=\r\nl Sr Prema intervene with those murderers and see that justice is done? One=\r\n last request Sr Prema and her MoC work for the poor she asaserts-then why =\r\nshould the money meant for the  poor of\n      this country find its way to =\r\nthe confers of Rome? It is very difficult to divest conversion and money. A=\r\nre the accounts of the MoC being audited? If not why? Why should the lands =\r\nand the church properties be exempted from tax and auditing? This is someth=\r\ning anti-national .Money cannot change its value simply because it is held =\r\nin the hands of a particular community-All monies must be accounted for. Is=\r\n it not strange that those working in Minority Education institutions and d=\r\nrawing the UGC pay scales are Income tax assesses but the priests and the n=\r\nuns working in the same institutions are exempted from paying Income tax. T=\r\nhey too draw the same salaries-if not more for less work-they too hold indi=\r\nvidual bank accounts and they too draw their pensions till their death-all =\r\nfrom the taxpayers monies. Why should they be exempted from paying the Inco=\r\nme tax? This is just one area to show that the workings of the poor of whic=\r\nh Sr Prema and all missionaries are\n      engaged and other service organiz=\r\nations are a big money spinning business. A special vocabulary must be code=\r\nd to understand the language of the Christians. Power is sugar coated and c=\r\nalled service. Forgiveness is easily extended to those who hurt them-to sho=\r\nw how compassionate they are. But they refuse to stop hurting others-they r=\r\nefuse to stop dehumanizing the tribals and the poor. Why don&#39;t they leave t=\r\nhe poor alone? If in spite of  the enormous funds which have flowed and are=\r\n flowing  from abroad combined with  the government&#39;s Five Year Plans and a=\r\n globally  powerful God by  their side the missionaries are not able to dim=\r\ninish  poverty, to reduce hunger and assetlessness, then is it not time to =\r\npause take stock of  what is fundamentally wrong? Who is swindling whom? Wh=\r\ny are the poor kept in poverty? Why should the poor continue to be poor, wh=\r\ny should backwardness be ever growing? Account for the work that has been s=\r\no far carried on and stop the\n      pauperization and the plunder of this c=\r\nountry and its poor. Should we wait for Sr Prema and the likes of her for d=\r\nivine inspiration to be just logical and sensible? \n      Tailpiece-\n      =\r\nEven the Pope has lost his ability to pray that he has now assigned the Arc=\r\nhbishop of Gawhati to script prayers for him! The Catholic Church needs pra=\r\nyer scripters- for it is unable to turn the hearts and souls of its followe=\r\nrs to that spirit within themselves and seek redemption and justice.\n      =\r\nDr Mrs Hilda Raja,\n      Vadodara\n\n\n\n            Get your own website and d=\r\nomain for just Rs.1,999/year.* Go to http://in.business.yahoo.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n =\r\n     -- \n      &quot;Sree Maa Kali Kambal&#39;s Aasirvatham&#39;s&quot;\n              &quot;aum Sa=\r\nkthi Aum&quot;\n             &quot;Swami Satha Sivom&quot;\n               Renuka S sivom.\n =\r\n               Harsha S sivom .\n      www.swamisathasivom.org\n\n\n\n\n\n    -- \n=\r\n    best regards,\n\n    Rahul Chaturvedi, MD\n    CEO\n    Total Care Rewards =\r\nGroup\n\n     Direct: (USA)  508 568 0070\n     VM    :  708 375 0001  ( US an=\r\nd Canada 1- 888 400 8260) Extension - 100009\n     Fax   :  708 375 0099\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0157_01C9B312.DEE0D6B0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;A mail on vedic-wisdom yahoogroup quoting=\r\n Aurobindo \nis relevant to this thread.

What ails her, \nshe who is after all so vast and might =\r\nbe so strong? There is surely some \nenormous defect, something vital is wan=\r\nting in us, nor is it difficult to lay \nour finger on the spot. We have all=\r\n things else, but we are empty of strength, \nvoid of energy. We have abando=\r\nned Shakti and are therefore abandoned by Shakti. \nThe Mother is not in our=\r\n hearts, in our brains, in our arms.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is \nit love, enthusia=\r\nsm, Bhakti that is wanting? These are ingrained in the Indian \nnature, but =\r\nin the absence of Shakti we cannot concentrate, we cannot direct, we \ncanno=\r\nt even preserve it. Bhakti is the leaping flame, Shakti is the fuel. If the=\r\n \nfuel is scanty how long can the fire endure?...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The deep=\r\ner we \nlook, the more we shall be convinced that the one thing wanting, whi=\r\nch we must \nstrive to acquire before all others, is strength?strength physi=\r\ncal, strength \nmental, strength moral, but above all strength spiritual whi=\r\nch is the one \ninexhaustible and imperishable source of all the others. If =\r\nwe have strength \neverything else will be added to us easily and naturally.=\r\n In the absence of \nstrength we are like men in a dream who have hands but =\r\ncannot seize or strike, \nwho have feet but cannot run....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nWhat is our mother-country? It \nis not a piece of earth, nor a figure of sp=\r\neech, nor a fiction of the mind. It \nis a mighty Shakti, composed of the Sh=\r\naktis of all the millions of units that \nmake up the nation, just as Bhawan=\r\ni Mahisha Mardini sprang into being from the \nShakti of all the millions of=\r\n gods assembled in one mass of force and welded \ninto unity. The Shakti we =\r\ncall India, Bhawani Bharati, is the living unity of \nthe Shaktis of three h=\r\nundred million people,[3] but she is inactive, imprisoned \nin the magic cir=\r\ncle of Tamas, the self-indulgent inertia and ignorance of her \nsons....&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; We have to create strength where it did not exist \nbefore; we=\r\n have to change our natures, and become new men with new hearts, to be \nbor=\r\nn again.... We need a nucleus of men in whom the Shakti is developed to its=\r\n \nuttermost extent, in whom it fills every corner of the personality and ov=\r\nerflows \nto fertilise the earth. These, having the fire of Bhawani in their=\r\n hearts and \nbrains, will go forth and carry the flame to every nook and cr=\r\nanny of our \nland.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Beautiful.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;

Their slow, patient, dexterous&nbsp;and systematic \n  propaganda=\r\n is bearing fruit even today. To undo their work, one needs to be \n  equall=\r\ny dexterous and patient. This is not the work for hot-blooded, angry and \n =\r\n frustrated people. One needs to be cool-headed, smart and \npatient.&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Another thing is that sanatana dharma is broken \n  to=\r\nday. In pursuit of modern education, the cream of Indian intelligentsia \n  =\r\nstopped engaging in our traditional knowledge. This brought a discontinuity=\r\n in \n  knowledge. We have some faithful Hindus engaging in superstitious an=\r\nd/or \n  purposeless practices. We have many priests who are corrupted by mo=\r\nney and \n  fame, don&#39;t do any sadhana and don&#39;t have any spiritual strength=\r\n. Many \n  intelligent people either dissociate themselves from religion or =\r\nfollow \n  religion passively without much faith and with some shame or misg=\r\nivings. At \n  the root of this is the broken knowledge and purposeless \n  p=\r\nractices.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Also, we have many bad practices that=\r\n afflict \n  Hinduism due to Kali, which need to be gotten rid of. For examp=\r\nle, caste \n  system of today is so different from old days. The concept of =\r\ncaste mobility \n  is gone now&nbsp;- one would start with father&#39;s caste, b=\r\nut get a caste later \n  on based on one&#39;s aptitude and attitude in old days=\r\n. For example, Valmiki was \n  a shudra by birth who lived by killing birds =\r\nand he became a brahmana and a \n  brahmarshi later. Vishwamitra was a kshat=\r\nriya by birth but became a brahmana \n  and a brahmarshi later and even beca=\r\nme one of saptarshis. If lower caste and \n  untouchable Hindus&nbsp;feel av=\r\nersion to Hinduism which is exploted by \n  Christian missionaries who offer=\r\n money and respect to convert, &lt;EM&gt;some&lt;/EM&gt; \n  fault lies with Hinduism to=\r\no. We need to reform casteism.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;There are many =\r\nthings that need to be done. At \n  one level, some propaganda needs to be d=\r\none on the greatness of Hinduism. This \n  needs to be done with a cool, sch=\r\nolarly&nbsp;and patient attitude (as opposed \n  to yelling in shrill voice =\r\nfrom rooftops like some Hindutva activists \n  foolishly do). At another lev=\r\nel, broken links within Hinduism need to be \n  rediscovered so that the kno=\r\nwledgebase of our philosophy is correctly \n  represented to sway the intell=\r\nigentsia. While other religions are based on \n  &quot;faith&quot; in the words of a m=\r\nessiah, Hinduism has a wide-ranging and \n  sophisticated philosophy and met=\r\nhods that can enable &lt;EM&gt;anyone &lt;/EM&gt;to \n  &lt;EM&gt;become&lt;/EM&gt; a messiah. Howev=\r\ner, the knowledge has become corrupted and \n  incomplete and some intellige=\r\nnt people are justified in not having&nbsp;faith. \n  At yet another level, =\r\nwe need to reform some social and cultural aspects of \n  Hindusm and undo s=\r\nome changes brought in by Kali.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;There are many =\r\nthings to do and this will take \n  many decades of focused and concerted ef=\r\nfort.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; \n  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Personally, I have no doubt that the time of \n  weakening (or even fal=\r\nl)&nbsp;of certain faiths has come.
