I did not mean to say otherwise.\n=A0\nBut j=\r\nust having an ishta devata is not enough to be &quot;protected&quot; from deep and tr=\r\noublesome instabilities when one&#39;s body-mind complex goes through a big tra=\r\nnsformation. Not every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ra=\r\nvanas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for &quot;psycholog=\r\nical disorder&quot;, the second lady &quot;did much sadhana of Srirama&quot;. Even those w=\r\nho think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, men=\r\ntal and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one&#39;s conditioning and desir=\r\nes!) interpretation of internal/external experiences and even madness.\n=A0\n=\r\nTrue surrender/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but cu=\r\nltivating it is as difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In f=\r\nact, true surrender and detachment are almost the same.\n=A0\nThis is why I s=\r\naid that *lightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One with =\r\ndense conditioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god a=\r\nre ready to help.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nN=\r\now, the question is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortunately, ther=\r\ne is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, ho=\r\nmam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by regular introspection an=\r\nd self-improvement.\n=A0\nTaking mind away from its current pre-occupations (=\r\ne.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing good sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not g=\r\net what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am better than X&quot;, &quot;I must have Y at any cost&quot; =\r\netc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for these thoughts k=\r\neep *reinforcing* the conditioning!\n=A0\nTo reduce the regular pre-occupatio=\r\nns of mind, different imagery/visualization may work better for some people=\r\n.\n=A0\nOne approach is to contemplate god whenever possible, in the middle o=\r\nf any activity. You can imagine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/ab=\r\nle person or as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that =\r\nis so perfect and fascinating for the mind to contemplate that it does not =\r\ncare about other objects around that are making shadripus and ashtapashas w=\r\nork on the mind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its regular debilitati=\r\nng pre-occupations, one can try to contemplate god instead.\n=A0\nMind is a w=\r\nild animal. As Pi says in the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger on the boa=\r\nt, wild animals can&#39;t be transformed or domesticated, but they can be train=\r\ned into some habits!\n=A0\nWhenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if on=\r\ne thinks &quot;the omnipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument&quot; and st=\r\narts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of thinking too much a=\r\nbout limited sense objects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done =\r\nby shadripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for what they did, if one th=\r\ninks &quot;the omnipresent God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that in=\r\nstrument&quot; and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of bei=\r\nng angry at someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shad=\r\nripus. And so on.\n=A0\nIn the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes l=\r\naced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up becoming about ones=\r\nelf rather than about god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am doing t=\r\nhis nice homam&quot;, &quot;I think *I* am making progress through this&quot;). With effor=\r\nt and perseverance, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it cente=\r\nred on the supreme power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long time t=\r\no train a wild animal, it takes a long time to train mind!\n=A0\nTry to devel=\r\nop devotion and surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of=\r\n a concept/principle of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/c=\r\nontemplate that concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditati=\r\nng. When mind veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don&#39;t spen=\r\nd too much time dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gen=\r\ntly into contemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about your=\r\nself.\n=A0\nThe main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make=\r\n it about themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable=\r\n, try to break free from it.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *\n=A0\nFinally, one can try to overcome the limited sense of self and en=\r\ngage in selfless actions that benefit a larger set of people than oneself. =\r\nWhat stops us from truly loving god is our deep and sub-conscious love for =\r\n*ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* notion of self that drives the current body=\r\n-mind complex). One way to overcome that is to selflessly love others. Afte=\r\nr all, other people around us are as much replicas of god as we are. If we =\r\ncannot empathize with them, love them and give them unconditionally, how ca=\r\nn we ever hope to transcend the limited sense of Self and truly love omnipr=\r\nesent God?\n=A0\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality R=\r\nesources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n=A0\n\n&gt;___________________=\r\n_____________\n&gt; From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Thursday, Febru=\r\nary 28, 2013 10:35 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt;=A0Dear Friends ,\n&gt;=A0All psychosomatic or schizophrenic cases a=\r\nre not defined as=A0=A0=A0 wrongly=A0=A0=A0 experimented=A0=A0kundalini=A0=\r\n=A0 experiences .

It is just A SM=\r\nALL STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Let me give =\r\nan analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this bo=\r\ndy-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the p=\r\nalace over time and\n move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one =\r\noccasionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy=\r\n for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? =\r\nIn fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses no=\r\nthing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization =\r\nwithout any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi =\r\nVasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get somethin=\r\ng without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have=\r\n deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough=\r\n effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared =\r\n(and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\nAs you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Nature has a=\r\n delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints on what\n =\r\nNature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous actions). So =\r\nNature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it o=\r\nr want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s who=\r\nle life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not e=\r\nnjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, on=\r\ne may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another case=\r\n, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn as a tig=\r\ner or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that experience.=\r\n Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;see=\r\nking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalin=\r\ni, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundal=\r\nini and one&#39;s\n previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, o=\r\nne may be born in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify =\r\n(if there is enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary o=\r\nr painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it=\r\n panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a=\r\n certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;We are =\r\nlike that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex a=\r\nnd scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;If our ideas =\r\nabout who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if =\r\nwe are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization o=\r\nf that at some\n stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, witho=\r\nut being scared?\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is fa=\r\nr better than Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioni=\r\nng is still left in one&#39;s system.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;When one transcends one problemat=\r\nic notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buri=\r\ned deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If on=\r\ne overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;=\r\ns body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor,=\r\n a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example=\r\n, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the=\r\n world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the =\r\nworld now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any=\r\n such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progres=\r\ns and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;An awakened Kund=\r\nalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weakne=\r\nsses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual =\r\nproblems.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;T=\r\nhe best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its =\r\nrise. Just do sadhana, overcome your weaknesses and improve your detachment=\r\n over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or di=\r\nstaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin=\r\n of attachment. It is a negative attachment. =A0\n&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about whethe=\r\nr your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6=\r\n internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or not. If your=\r\n ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF you=\r\nr Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you complet=\r\nely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) will automatically ascen=\r\nd to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt;&gt;=A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deit=\r\ny. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simpl=\r\ny do business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is =\r\nthe plain and bare fact.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please g=\r\nive it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and pleas=\r\ne protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something you wa=\r\nnt and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires=\r\n, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascin=\r\nation for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord =\r\nthrows one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s pr=\r\nasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with f=\r\nascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;If=\r\n one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experie=\r\nnces a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a pers=\r\nonal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. =\r\nIt is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk g=\r\nlued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was s=\r\ncared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s protec=\r\ntion! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger tha=\r\nt\n one should run away from!\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develo=\r\np dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be =\r\ntaken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but b=\r\ne prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light men=\r\ntal conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;=\r\ns Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in o=\r\nne&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her fro=\r\nm meeting True Self.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning is=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality Resourc=\r\nes: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: Leela Sa=\r\nstry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Su=\r\nbject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=A0YES=A0 SIR=\r\n=A0 , perfectly correct=A0=A0 ,=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=A0 ma=\r\nkes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles=\r\n .=A0=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and mant=\r\nhra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc=\r\n with the=A0 psyche .=A0 Once we are under the protection of=A0 a mahadevat=\r\nha ,all the other=A0 disturbances will definitely=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various eleme=\r\nnts that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this trans=\r\nlates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control=\r\n of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakeni=\r\nng happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force=\r\n. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care o=\r\nf the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and =\r\nwhen it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various othe=\r\nr things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some o=\r\nf them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual =\r\nfor its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nat=\r\nure and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even mo=\r\nre\n vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience=\r\n of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycholog=\r\ny are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is =\r\npuerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible s=\r\nometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various sub=\r\ntle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;rupt=\r\nured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, tr=\r\nauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind an=\r\nd they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very comp=\r\nlex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down eve=\r\nry option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few c=\r\nan have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they c=\r\nan do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.\n Som=\r\netimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, t=\r\nhe starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks us=\r\ned to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwya=\r\nyamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@yahoo.=\r\nco.uk&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 Februa=\r\nry 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=A0=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on m=\r\ny recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at pr=\r\nesent, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she=\r\n has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This h=\r\nas involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She i=\r\ns not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms =\r\nstarted and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find =\r\nanything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that =\r\nthis is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describ=\r\ne themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalin=\r\ni awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in ma=\r\ninstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood b=\r\ny western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged\n kundalini, w=\r\ne struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My=\r\n experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not b=\r\ne forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the s=\r\nuffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her,=\r\n and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there=\r\n could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother,=\r\n who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and=\r\n either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that=\r\n the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom =\r\nwe may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be care=\r\nful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps=\r\n this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;l=\r\net me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n rising bit to God&#39;s will=\r\n. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \r\n---770455430-1684199591-1362167614=:82112\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Bh=\r\nakti yoga or the path of surrender and devotion is indeed more suitable in =\r\nthis age. I did not mean to say otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;But just having an =\r\nishta devata is not enough to be &quot;protected&quot; from deep and troublesome inst=\r\nabilities when one&#39;s body-mind complex goes through a big transformation. N=\r\not every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After a=\r\nll, out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;=\r\n, the second lady &quot;did much sadhana of Srirama&quot;. Even those who think of a =\r\ndeity and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, mental and spirit=\r\nual disorders, wrong (colored by one&#39;s conditioning and desires!) interpret=\r\nation of internal/external experiences and even madness.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;True =\r\nsurrender/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but\n cultiv=\r\nating it is as difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact,=\r\n true surrender and detachment are almost the same.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This is wh=\r\ny I said that *lightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One =\r\nwith dense conditioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or =\r\ngod are ready to help.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now, the qu=\r\nestion is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no si=\r\nngle magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc ca=\r\nn help, but they need to be augmented by regular introspection and self-imp=\r\nrovement.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Taking mind away from its current pre-occupations (e=\r\n.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing good sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not ge=\r\nt what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am better than X&quot;, &quot;I must have Y at any cost&quot; e=\r\ntc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for\n these thoughts k=\r\neep *reinforcing* the conditioning!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;To reduce the regular pre-=\r\noccupations of mind, different imagery/visualization may work better for so=\r\nme people.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One approach is to contemplate god whenever possibl=\r\ne, in the middle of any activity. You can imagine a being in your mind, eit=\r\nher as an ideal/able person or as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in =\r\nmany beings, that is so perfect and fascinating for the mind to contemplate=\r\n that it does not care about other objects around that are making shadripus=\r\n and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its =\r\nregular debilitating pre-occupations, one can try to contemplate god instea=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says in the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot;=\r\n about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can&#39;t be transformed or domestic=\r\nated, but they can be trained into some habits!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Whenever one i=\r\ns enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks &quot;the\n omnipresent God is enjoy=\r\ning this thru this instrument&quot; and starts contemplating the qualities of th=\r\nat god instead of thinking too much about limited sense objects, one is bet=\r\nter placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whenever one is angry at=\r\n someone for what they did, if one thinks &quot;the omnipresent God is giving me=\r\n the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument&quot; and starts contemplating the=\r\n qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone, one is better pla=\r\nced to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In the =\r\nbeginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. Every now and =\r\nthen, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than about god (&quot;*=\r\nI* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am doing this nice homam&quot;, &quot;I think *I*=\r\n am making progress through this&quot;). With effort and perseverance, one can a=\r\nvoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the supreme power that=\r\n runs the show. Just as it takes a long\n time to train a wild animal, it ta=\r\nkes a long time to train mind!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Try to develop devotion and sur=\r\nrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/principl=\r\ne of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that con=\r\ncept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When mind veers=\r\n off into other things, gently steer it back. Don&#39;t spend too much time dis=\r\nsecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into contemplat=\r\ning god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThe main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it about =\r\nthemselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try to b=\r\nreak free from it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Finally, one ca=\r\nn try to overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions =\r\nthat benefit a larger set of\n people than oneself. What stops us from truly=\r\n loving god is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *l=\r\nimited* notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way =\r\nto overcome that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people arou=\r\nnd us are as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with th=\r\nem, love them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to transc=\r\nend the limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetic=\r\na, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;Best =\r\nregards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources=\r\n: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.=\r\norg/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0,=\r\n 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean,\n sans-serif;backgro=\r\nund-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blo=\r\nckquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px;=\r\n margin-top: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, h=\r\nelvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times n=\r\new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;fon=\r\nt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, February 28, 2013 10:35 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re:=\r\n Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D=\r\n&quot;yiv1296290291ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000;back=\r\nground-color:#fff;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-=\r\nsize:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;Dear Friends ,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;A=\r\nll psychosomatic or schizophrenic cases are not defined as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; wrongly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experimented&nbsp;&nbsp;kundalini&nbsp;&nbsp; e=\r\nxperiences .

It is just A SMALL S=\r\nTEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let me give =\r\nan analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this bo=\r\ndy-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the p=\r\nalace over time and\n move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one =\r\noccasionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy=\r\n for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? =\r\nIn fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses no=\r\nthing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization =\r\nwithout any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi =\r\nVasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, one does not get som=\r\nething without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may=\r\n have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put e=\r\nnough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprep=\r\nared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Na=\r\nture has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints=\r\n on what\n Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous act=\r\nions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer=\r\n want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth=\r\n one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One=\r\n may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life afte=\r\nr that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. &lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;In another case,=\r\n one may deeply desire to act in a famous film.

I went to free it and it panicked so badly and sta=\r\nrted to shake violently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it=\r\n was scared that I would kill it!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We are like that chipmunk, g=\r\nlued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scared of being re=\r\nscued from a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If our ideas about who we are=\r\n (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;inf=\r\ninite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that at some\n =\r\nstage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, without being scared?=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesir=\r\nable conditioning is overcome, is far better than Kundalini rise forced whe=\r\nn some really undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion about who one is and wha=\r\nt one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spr=\r\ning to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the b=\r\nody&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awa=\r\nreness clings on to (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_136206784=\r\n6619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291userContent&quot;&gt;e.g. a great doctor, a g=\r\nreat leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc&lt;/span&gt;). As an extreme exam=\r\nple, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who\n rescues=\r\n\n the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue=\r\n the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings t=\r\no any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of pr=\r\nogress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An awa=\r\nkened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate on=\r\ne&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and =\r\nspiritual problems.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv12962=\r\n90291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_158&quot;&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NO=\r\nT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your =\r\nweaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasiz=\r\ne that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around =\r\nyou. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment.&lt;/span&gt; It is a\n negat=\r\nive attachment. &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FO=\r\nNT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);F=\r\nONT-SIZE:13px;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_155&quot;&gt;D&lt;span i=\r\nd=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;on&#39;t worry about whether =\r\nyour Kundalini rises or not.

Though true =\r\nsurrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do business w=\r\nith god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the plain and b=\r\nare fact.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I want X, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2=\r\n_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_=\r\n141&quot;&gt;I will pray to you and &lt;/span&gt;please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of K=\r\nundalini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just=\r\n a business deal. There is something you want and you ask\n god for it. True=\r\n surrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True=\r\n surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord=\r\n. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is=\r\n pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefull=\r\ny. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even i=\r\nn the face of (and during) Death.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one without true surrende=\r\nr and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one=\r\n may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that g=\r\nod does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting=\r\n or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; exampl=\r\ne above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s co=\r\nnditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s protection may=\r\n seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that\n one should run away fro=\r\nm!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_=\r\n141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, deve=\r\nlop dispassion and detachment.

Only detachment and a very light m=\r\nental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as on=\r\ne&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in=\r\n one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her f=\r\nrom meeting True Self.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The real key is how light your conditio=\r\nning is.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology &am=\r\np; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:ari=\r\nal, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:13px;&quot; id=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_60&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_1=\r\n9_1362067846619_59&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19=\r\n_1362067846619_165&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619=\r\n_62&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT:rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv=\r\n1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_65&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:arial, =\r\nhelvetica, sans-serif;FONT-SIZE:10pt;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362=\r\n067846619_168&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_69&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;=\r\n&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_167&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291=\r\nyui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_70&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px sol=\r\nid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER-TOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-RIGHT:#ccc 1px=\r\n solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291hr&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold=\r\n;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\n&lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold=\r\n;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syn=\r\ndrome&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:#fff;F=\r\nONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;COLOR:#000;FONT-SIZE:10p=\r\nt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_79&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;=\r\nYES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly correct&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense bhak=\r\nthi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka an=\r\nd remove most of the hurdles .&nbsp;&nbsp;All the so called dhyanamargas wi=\r\nth out any personal deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter in =\r\nto the inner planes who play havoc with the&nbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we ar=\r\ne under the protection of&nbsp; a mahadevatha ,all the other&nbsp; disturba=\r\nnces will definitely&nbsp; be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose th=\r\ne human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more det=\r\nachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, gr=\r\need etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has=\r\n to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far=\r\n more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - =\r\nA good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does=\r\n - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entiti=\r\nes, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless,=\r\n and given half a chance can make\n use of the individual for its own ends. =\r\nThey take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utili=\r\nzes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more vital. 4 - Whil=\r\ne someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakt=\r\ni awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of th=\r\nis. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insuffi=\r\ncient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the a=\r\nura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and =\r\nhelps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to variou=\r\ns reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can =\r\nallow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances=\r\n of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various pos=\r\nsiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover=\r\n, even if such a diagnosis\n is correctly done, very few can have the right =\r\nknowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are ofte=\r\nn doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work. Sometimes it will have=\r\n results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point i=\r\ns a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - &lt;span c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;yiv1296290291st&quot;&gt;Mens sana in corpore sano.&lt;/span&gt; -Regards &nbsp;R=\r\najarshi \n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291MsoNormal&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:rgb(153,153,153);&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291Apple-styl=\r\ne-span&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, n=\r\new york, times, serif;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950 y=\r\niv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_92&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE =\r\nmAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;COLOR:navy;FONT=\r\n-SIZE:10pt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv129629029=\r\n1yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_17_1362045432997_73 yiv=\r\n1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_93&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Ti=\r\nmes New Roman&quot;&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:2=\r\n4]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;FON=\r\nT-SIZE:12pt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_95&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;=\r\n class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_96&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM:#ccc 1px solid;BO=\r\nRDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px solid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER-TOP:#ccc 1px solid=\r\n;BORDER-RIGHT:#ccc 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1296290291hr&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@yah=\r\noo.co.uk&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:b=\r\nold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1296290291&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv129629=\r\n0291ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini synd=\r\nrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psych=\r\niatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who see=\r\nms to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since ch=\r\nildhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in =\r\nthe body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini unti=\r\nl her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not bee=\r\nn able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it=\r\n might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call menta=\r\nlly ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spont=\r\naneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into t=\r\nhis topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not we=\r\nll-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for derange=\r\nd\n kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken th=\r\ne kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundali=\r\nni should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at time=\r\ns because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it wi=\r\nll consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what=\r\n solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the=\r\n Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of =\r\nthis woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May=\r\n I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others =\r\nlike her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And=\r\n let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation our=\r\nselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps s=\r\nafest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n rising bi=\r\nt to God&#39;s will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n  =\r\n  &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;height:0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n        \n  \n  \n    &lt;table sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;4px&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;tbod=\r\ny&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n          &lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#FFF;background-color:#F2F2F2;borde=\r\nr:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:aria=\r\nl;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#FFF;background-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid =\r\n#EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7p=\r\nx 5px 5px;color:#FFF;background-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;co=\r\nlor:#FFF;background-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#2D50FD;=\r\nbackground-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;=\r\n/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---770455430-1684199591-1362167614=:82112--\r\n\n"}}
