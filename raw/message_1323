Ujjain is also famou=\r\ns for Raja Bharathat Hari cave.\nRaja Barathari is considered as one of the =\r\n9 Naths from the Nath \nSampradaya. He meditated for a long time and then he=\r\n went south to\nDevas, a small town near Indore. The legend is, a drop of bl=\r\nood from \nSati when Lord Shiva was carrying the corpse feel in Devas too. A=\r\nnd \nin the same place on a hill there is a Chamunda Devi Temple. A lot of \n=\r\ngreat Mahatmas since 1400 Have been staying and meditating there, \nstarting=\r\n with Raja Barathari, then came the Poet Chand Bardai and then\nSheelnath Ma=\r\nharaj and Swami Shri VishnuTirth Maharaj in the 20th \ncentury. Over and abo=\r\nve the temple now there is Sheelnath maharaj \nDhuni Sanstan and also Swami =\r\nVishnuTirth Maharaj&#39;s Ashram located in \nthe valley of the hill where Mothe=\r\nr Chamunda temple is situated.\n\nMother in this temple manifested many times=\r\n and gave guidance and \ndarshan to all of the above saints. I am sure there=\r\n are others who \nbenefited too.\n\nThey all stayed at the Temple in devas. It=\r\n is said even today many \nMahatmas in Sooksma sareer come to pray Chamunda =\r\nDevi on a regular \nbasis.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n"}}
