I am thinking now it is too bi=\r\ng if I want to start daily homams. The small copper ones I have seen at the=\r\n shop do not have stands and they are like 2x2 inch interior or max of 3x3i=\r\nnches. What is the ideal size for a daily homam kumd? If I cannot use brick=\r\ns, can I just place the copper kund on a wooden plank or newspaper piece ! =\r\n\nAlso, do we need to wash and clean the homa kund, the wooden ladle and the=\r\n whole prayer area daily ? \n\nregards\nrAma\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sh Narasimha, et al. - I=\r\n have done my first homam (SriKrsna homam) today, hopefully it was fine, as=\r\n I made some minor mistakes. \n&gt; First of all, the fire got put off twice, a=\r\ns the twigs did not catch fire easily. I learnt that the twigs need to be c=\r\nut vertically for them to burn better.\n&gt; Secondly, the full dry coconut did=\r\n not burn completely in the poornahuti and if I put a half one or a piece i=\r\nt would have burnt completely.\n&gt; Also, the dharbhas I have were a bit bent =\r\nand I could not put them pointed to north or south or the other directions =\r\ncorrectly. Hope that was ok too !\n&gt; \n&gt; Now some questions (I am sure these =\r\nhave been answered, I apologize, but would appreciate if you respond again)=\r\n; btw, if these could be put in FAQ, will be much obliged.\n&gt; 1. what do I d=\r\no with the partially burnt poornahuti ? Can I use it tomorrow ? Also, what =\r\ndoes one do with all the ash and the burnt part? What is the holy way to di=\r\nspose it off ? No lakes or river by in Bangalore ! Do I put them under a tr=\r\nee and pour water ? Not many trees, only plants, in the apts I live here.\n&gt;=\r\n 2. If there are any unburnt part of the twigs, can I use them again? Or do=\r\n they need to be disposed off ?\n&gt; 3. Is it advisable to dip (not pour) the =\r\ntwigs in the ghee so that they burn well ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me know of other points=\r\n I might have known for a beginner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, a million thanks and appr=\r\neciations for all who are responsible (Sh MMP, Sh PVR, etc.) for the KT.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; regards\n&gt; rAma\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
