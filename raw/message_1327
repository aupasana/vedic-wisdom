There need not be a big=\r\n or famous temple nearby. Buy a few acres of land (for possible expansion i=\r\nn future) and construct a homa kundam built in open space with four pillars=\r\n on the four sides and a high roof on the top to protect from rain. The are=\r\na is open on all the four sides and covered only on the top. Close to it, a=\r\n small one or two room structure is built to store materials.\n \nA priest or=\r\n a sadhaka is employed. His main qualification is that he should be a since=\r\nre devotee of the Mother and interested in a simple lifestyle dedicated to =\r\nHer. His job is to do one Chandi homam in the morning, one more in forenoon=\r\n, have lunch, relax in the afternoon and do one more Chandi homam in the ev=\r\nening. Keep doing it day in and day out. There are no idols to worship and =\r\nno other rituals to do.\n \nThis will pretty much take up all his time and he=\r\nnce enough money should be arranged to take care of the priest and his fami=\r\nly. If the priest is not well-versed in homam or Chandi homam, that is no p=\r\nroblem. He can be trained. But, the most important thing is that he should =\r\nbe committed to this and devoted to the Mother. If one has the basic simpli=\r\ncity, innocence, devotion and purity, other things will fall in place by th=\r\nemselves.\n \nBuying of the land and construction of room and homa kundam (wi=\r\nth roof and pillars) is a one-time expense. Salary of the priest and materi=\r\nals like ghee, wood etc for homam are an ongoing expense. This project requ=\r\nires a good amount of money and energy.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAfter a cen=\r\nter is established and sadhana progresses in each center, slowly the presen=\r\nce of Mother will be established there. Once that happens, the sadhaka will=\r\n start making faster progress. As he becomes purer and purere, the sadhana =\r\nwill generate more and more energy.\n \nAfter establishing 4 other centers, a=\r\n center in Ujjain is to be started. The sadhana being done at the Chandi ho=\r\nmam centers will have a catalytic influence on the homam movement and many =\r\nmany people will start doing different kinds of homas around the world. Thi=\r\ns will have a major impact on dharma in the world. That is what he was told=\r\n.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI did not want to force or impose on anybody. So =\r\nthis has waited. When the time comes, people who will make this happen will=\r\n come and take charge.\n \nTime has probably not yet come for Ujjain. But if =\r\nthere is a village in Gujarat or Maharashtra where you can do this, please =\r\nconsider. But please realize that this requires money commitment and also a=\r\n committed sadhaka.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (=\r\nSJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From:=\r\n Ashwin Rawal \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, Februa=\r\nry 26, 2009 12:50 PM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shree Maa (Re: Quest=\r\nion on Kunjika Stotra)\n\n\n        Dear Sir,\n        Should I try at Ujjain ?=\r\n I may visit and check some locations.

Someone se=\r\nnt me a few snippets from an \n                              interview poste=\r\nd on her website. Please see below.\n\n                              It is in=\r\nteresting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It \n     =\r\n                         is interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had t=\r\no &quot;do fire ceremonies and \n                              show what is truth=\r\n&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will be peace&quot;. This \n                 =\r\n             is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she =\r\nappeared to \n                              him during Shata Chandi homam at=\r\n Chennai.\n\n                              She told him that many people are =\r\nand will be born who will perform a short \n                              fi=\r\nre ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the \n =\r\n                             world and also make quick spiritual progress i=\r\nndividually in that process. \n                              Shree Maa&#39;s sta=\r\ntement about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar \n                  =\r\n            lines.\n\n                              My guru was also told by =\r\nMother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam \n                        =\r\n      should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 =\r\ntimes a \n                              day. These places do not need to be =\r\nnear any temples or famous places and \n                              can be=\r\n anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no \n    =\r\n                          need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple r=\r\nitual with bare minimum \n                              offerings is enough,=\r\n but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a \n                   =\r\n           few such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a c=\r\nhain of \n                              events that will help re-establish s=\r\nanatana dharma.\n\n                              Though not 3 times a day, th=\r\nese people have done a Chandi homam everyday for \n                         =\r\n     3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantas=\r\ntic! \n                              It is the sadhana and purity of sadhaka=\r\ns that creates energy and brings \n                              deities to =\r\na place. While several ancient temples are without any divine \n            =\r\n                  presence these days, new places of divine presence may be=\r\n created by pure \n                              souls engaged in selfless s=\r\nadhana for establishing dharma in the world.\n\n                             =\r\n As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during whic=\r\nh \n                              Mother appeared and gave instructions to m=\r\ny guru on spreading homam was \n                              taken on Ramak=\r\nrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within \n          =\r\n                    a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of th=\r\ne birth anniversary. \n                              All of this was a coinc=\r\nidence and we were unaware of this significance when \n                     =\r\n         we decided the muhurta.

Buy a few acres of land (for \npossible expansion in =\r\nfuture) and construct a homa kundam built in open space \nwith four pillars =\r\non the four sides and a high roof on the top to protect from \nrain.

His job is to do one Chandi \nhomam in the mo=\r\nrning, one more in forenoon, have lunch, relax in the afternoon \nand do one=\r\n more Chandi homam in the evening.

Someone sent me a few snippets \n     =\r\n                         from an &lt;BR&gt;interview posted on her website. \n    =\r\n                          Please see below.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is interesting that \n=\r\n                              she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her =\r\nguru. \n                              It &lt;BR&gt;is interesting that Ramakrishna=\r\n told her \n                              she had to &quot;do fire ceremonies and=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;show what \n                              is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time t=\r\nhe whole world will \n                              be peace&quot;. This &lt;BR&gt;is s=\r\nimilar to what my guru was \n                              told by Divine Mo=\r\nther when she appeared to &lt;BR&gt;him \n                              during Sha=\r\nta Chandi homam at Chennai.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She \n                              told =\r\nhim that many people are and will be born who \n                            =\r\n  will perform a short &lt;BR&gt;fire ritual on a regular \n                      =\r\n        basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the \n                =\r\n              &lt;BR&gt;world and also make quick spiritual progress \n           =\r\n                   individually in that process. &lt;BR&gt;Shree Maa&#39;s \n         =\r\n                     statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along \n  =\r\n                            similar &lt;BR&gt;lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My guru was also told=\r\n by \n                              Mother that a few centres of regular Cha=\r\nndi homam \n                              &lt;BR&gt;should be established around t=\r\nhe world, where \n                              Chandi homam is done 3 times=\r\n a &lt;BR&gt;day. These \n                              places do not need to be n=\r\near any temples or \n                              famous places and &lt;BR&gt;can=\r\n be anywhere. The ritual \n                              need not be elabora=\r\nte. For example, there is no \n                              &lt;BR&gt;need to off=\r\ner silk sarees etc in fire. A \n                              simple ritual =\r\nwith bare minimum &lt;BR&gt;offerings is \n                              enough, b=\r\nut it needs to be performed 3 times \n                              everyday=\r\n. When a &lt;BR&gt;few such centres are \n                              establishe=\r\nd, it will apparently lead to a chain of \n                              &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;events that will help re-establish sanatana \n                             =\r\n dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though not 3 times a day, these \n                          =\r\n    people have done a Chandi homam everyday for &lt;BR&gt;3 \n                   =\r\n           years in the same place and finished 1000 such \n                =\r\n              homas. That is fantastic! &lt;BR&gt;It is the sadhana \n            =\r\n                  and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and \n         =\r\n                     brings &lt;BR&gt;deities to a place. While several \n        =\r\n                      ancient temples are without any divine \n             =\r\n                 &lt;BR&gt;presence these days, new places of divine \n           =\r\n                   presence may be created by pure &lt;BR&gt;souls engaged \n     =\r\n                         in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the=\r\n \n                              world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the s=\r\nankalpa \n                              of the Shata Chandi homam during whi=\r\nch &lt;BR&gt;Mother \n                              appeared and gave instructions=\r\n to my guru on \n                              spreading homam was &lt;BR&gt;taken=\r\n on Ramakrishna&#39; s \n                              birth anniversary and the=\r\n time of sankalpa was \n                              within &lt;BR&gt;a few minut=\r\nes from the actual Tithi \n                              Pravesha time of th=\r\ne birth anniversary. &lt;BR&gt;All of \n                              this was a c=\r\noincidence and we were unaware of this \n                              signi=\r\nficance when &lt;BR&gt;we decided the muhurta. It \n                              =\r\nis interesting to know that Ramakrishna did \n                              =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;mention fire ceremonies specifically to \n                              =\r\nsomebody and that his words are &lt;BR&gt;similar to the \n                       =\r\n       words of Mother.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n                              regards,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- \n                              ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a \n                            =\r\n  Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n                              href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot;
