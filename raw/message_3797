The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa once =\r\none *fully* understands and appreciates it.\n=C2=A0\nChandipath consists of s=\r\nymbolic stories of wars that the divine Mother fought, which explain how on=\r\ne can fight and overcome various weaknesses that typically bind one in Maay=\r\naa. Reciting these stories on a regular basis will promote the fighting spi=\r\nrit within one that fights these weaknesses.\n=C2=A0\nThere is nothing wrong =\r\nin understanding Maayaa and trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. O=\r\nne aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you =\r\nexperience good and bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you =\r\nunderstand Maayaa to overcome it. One aspect of the Mother makes you fight =\r\nand overcome it. When one realizes Self at the end, irrespective of the pat=\r\nh taken, one finally sees that all these are aspects of a Single Mother who=\r\n is also essentially true Self.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Also, I ha=\r\nve started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert\n&gt; Svobodha. For no=\r\nw I have very mixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; Perhaps I need to read more!=\r\n \n=C2=A0\nAghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not everyon=\r\ne&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n=C2=A0\nGhora means ter=\r\nrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghor=\r\na. A true=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as terrible or bad or =\r\nimpure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god and tries to focus=\r\n the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) always, instead of imp=\r\nermanent manifestations of god.\n=C2=A0\nWhen someone dies, north Indians cha=\r\nnt &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It m=\r\neans &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is true and everything else is an illusion=\r\n&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself that life and death are just a temporary i=\r\nllusion and only the Lord is real. But the question is: why should we remin=\r\nd ourselves of this ultimate truth only when someone dies? When someone pra=\r\nises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and we are about to feel =\r\nproud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing =\r\nwe did and the praises are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let =\r\nthe mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to somet=\r\nhing beautiful and want to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam saty=\r\na hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other things that seem not so be=\r\nautiful are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dw=\r\nell on temporary illusions&quot;?\n When someone attacks and abuses us and we are=\r\n about to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai.=\r\n These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind =\r\nnot dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n=C2=A0\nA true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raa=\r\nma naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations=\r\n* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and im=\r\npure, good and bad etc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion ) a=\r\nnd tries to find and focus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extreme=\r\ns.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nVedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we=\r\n perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and f=\r\nruit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within t=\r\nhem is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may=\r\n try a ritual where feces is eaten.=C2=A0But, please remember that eating f=\r\neces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and =\r\nnot perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is =\r\nthe main point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, f=\r\nor such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Sel=\r\nf (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but t=\r\nhe mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with cer=\r\ntain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking =\r\nthat he is Self and he is eating Self.\n=C2=A0\nOf course, a vedantin also ha=\r\ns the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which e=\r\nssentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such cha=\r\nnting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. A=\r\ns he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a=\r\n tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc=\r\n) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).\n=C2=A0\nThus, a vedantin=\r\n and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth and trying to absorb t=\r\nhat truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in =\r\nan extreme situation where failure results in a very bad dual experience. T=\r\nhat can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! I=\r\nn the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I =\r\nam consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout =\r\nfrom failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the=\r\n mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other fo=\r\nod, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in=\r\n Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the=\r\n fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience may act as an ince=\r\nntive in succeeding quickly.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, difficult tasks cannot necessa=\r\nrily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyo=\r\nne trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nTake anot=\r\nher simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam a=\r\nnd homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling=\r\n on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is cau=\r\nsing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nA regular person will try to =\r\nenforce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is n=\r\nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may sti=\r\nll come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is=\r\n no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one =\r\nafter that. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for se=\r\nx?\n=C2=A0\nAn aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root=\r\n cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and=\r\n sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may co=\r\nmbine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an=\r\n aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does =\r\nhis japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may t=\r\nhink that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do =\r\njapam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogram=\r\nmed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no lon=\r\nger feel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex=\r\n may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no lo=\r\nnger evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small tho=\r\nughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser =\r\nand\n denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they m=\r\nay now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in med=\r\nitation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may =\r\nfeel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fa=\r\nscination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n=C2=A0\nMind has a lot o=\r\nf conditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed t=\r\no. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures by engagin=\r\ng in certain practices that undermine those structures.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, is =\r\nthis a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that the person k=\r\neeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime=\r\n he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he see=\r\ns naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and =\r\nweaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a nor=\r\nmal person may push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with=\r\n low stakes.

Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb =\r\nVedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. How=\r\never, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More=\r\n dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong under=\r\nstanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C2=A0Aghora stands fo=\r\nr neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people pursu=\r\ning thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upani=\r\nshads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the tru=\r\nth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n=C2=A0\nBTW, the f=\r\nollowing mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths and explains=\r\n the basic reality.

My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-insp=\r\niring.

THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hour=\r\ns now. THAT is awe-inspiring.\n\nIntegrating various sadhanas is a personal p=\r\nroblem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pic=\r\nk one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of split=\r\nting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is be=\r\ntter to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places,=\r\n if one wants to find water.\n\nOne possibility is to do a homam and then med=\r\nitate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached to.=\r\n\n\nI am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from the little I h=\r\nave been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation of the layers =\r\nof duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the layer of d=\r\nuality and realize Self.\n\nLalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fier=\r\nce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly.=\r\n If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provide=\r\nd you can face the strictness).

He conducted some of the best homams and poojas I have witnessed. =\r\nHe has been on mouna vratam (vow of silence) for more than a year and commu=\r\nnicates by writing (saying mantras in pooja/homam is an exception).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I can give an ana=\r\nlogy for the last point regarding an aghora&#39;s way to overcome any&nbsp;weak=\r\nness for sex that may be left in the mind (which may make sexual&nbsp;thoug=\r\nhts arise in the mind now and then).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Suppose you ar=\r\ne trying to read a book and a friend is distracting you and irritating you =\r\nby talking about something else.

The=\r\n variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If =\r\nfeces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reali=\r\nty within them is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces=\r\n. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal size=3D2&gt;But, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. P=\r\nerceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent=\r\n manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, =\r\neating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dw=\r\nelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. =\r\nA successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling =\r\non the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and will not =\r\nfeel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eat=\r\ning\n Self.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Of course, a vedantin also has the same =\r\nnotions really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially =\r\nmean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may m=\r\nerely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, =\r\nhis mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty ladd=\r\nu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver=\r\n from the focus on the permanent (Self).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Thus, a ve=\r\ndantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth and trying to ab=\r\nsorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himse=\r\nlf in an extreme situation where failure results in a very bad dual experie=\r\nnce. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend dual=\r\nity! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self =\r\nand I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fa=\r\nllout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. =\r\nIf the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or ot=\r\nher food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to abs=\r\norb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thu=\r\ns, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience may act as a=\r\nn incentive in succeeding quickly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, difficu=\r\nlt tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely because of a=\r\nn incentive.

Suppose someone is doing a l=\r\not of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Sup=\r\npose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle=\r\n of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep =\r\nthe mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcomin=\r\ng such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. =\r\nEven if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fas=\r\ncination in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to ov=\r\nercome the fascination some minds may have for sex?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cau=\r\nse and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex=\r\n as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combin=\r\ne them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an agh=\r\nora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his =\r\njapam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think=\r\n that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japa=\r\nm like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed.=\r\n He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer =\r\nfeel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may=\r\n be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer=\r\n evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thought=\r\ns related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to\n denser and=\r\n denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may n=\r\now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in meditat=\r\nion while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may feel=\r\n for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascin=\r\nation and weakness for sex may be gone largely.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the thought=\r\ns we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these str=\r\nuctures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those structures.&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;However, is this a fool-proof method? Not reall=\r\ny. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice me=\r\nrely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of=\r\n thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not se=\r\nrious/sincere/ ready to start with.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Bottom=\r\nline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a =\r\nhigh stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push the problems =\r\nunder the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strateg=\r\ny is not applicable to all.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta a=\r\nnd what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and abso=\r\nrb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. =\r\nHowever, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. M=\r\nore dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong un=\r\nderstanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.&nbsp;Aghora stands=\r\n for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people pu=\r\nrsuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Up=\r\nanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the =\r\ntruth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spi=\r\nritual paths and explains the basic reality.

For&nbsp;instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great co=\r\nmposer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja a=\r\nnd Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba N=\r\navavarna Krithis&nbsp;mention&nbsp;great details about all the&nbsp;nine av=\r\naranas and different forms of the divine mother as one goes through each av=\r\narana.&nbsp;In the Dhyana Krithi&nbsp;of those, in the very&nbsp;first line=\r\n he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.&nbsp;That line tells =\r\nme that&nbsp;even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form=\r\n.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So my questi=\r\non was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you=\r\n mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought=\r\n in those terms. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I =\r\nhave started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it f=\r\nluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navar=\r\natri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashat=\r\ni! Have to see how mother will help me achieve my target. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Also, I have started to read the Agh=\r\nora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings=\r\n on the subject. Perhaps I need to read more! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Nagraj&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAr=\r\nial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 2/12/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;I&gt;&lt;&lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://in.mc955.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dpvr@...&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;pvr@charter. net&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAr=\r\nial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://in.mc955.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dpvr@...&quot; t=\r\narget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;pvr@charter. net&lt;/A&gt;&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV class=3Dh5&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc955.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Date: Friday, February 12, 2010, 11:31 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sanskrit is almost like a mother t=\r\nongue to me. My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-ins=\r\npiring. On the other hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit a=\r\nt all and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their fi=\r\nrst attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hou=\r\nrs now. THAT is awe-inspiring.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Integrating various sadhanas is a per=\r\nsonal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea=\r\n to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead o=\r\nf splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, i=\r\nt is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten =\r\nplaces, if one wants to find water.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One possibility is to do a homam=\r\n and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is=\r\n attached to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, =\r\nfrom the\n little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic represent=\r\nation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to un=\r\nravel the layer of duality and realize Self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lalita means gentle one=\r\n and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gent=\r\nly, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, yo=\r\nu will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both are valid pa=\r\nths.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Less=\r\nons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam a=\r\nnd Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make=\r\n a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On Fri, 2/5=\r\n/10, &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnagraj%40sbc=\r\nglobal.net&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;nagraj@sbcglobal. net&lt;/A&gt; &lt;&lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnagraj_um%40yahoo.c=\r\nom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;From: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnagraj%4=\r\n0sbcglobal.net&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;nagraj@sbcglobal. net&lt;/A&gt; &l=\r\nt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnagraj_um%40yah=\r\noo.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom]\n Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us=\r\n.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Date: Frida=\r\ny, February 5, 2010, 11:51 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I a=\r\nm very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam everyday. You al=\r\nso wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homa=\r\nm. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? A=\r\nlso, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapat=\r\nhi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachak=\r\nshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minute=\r\ns daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, t=\r\nhat takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with ho=\r\nmam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please expla=\r\nin what is sri Vidya\n and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to le=\r\narn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in =\r\nSri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krit=\r\nhis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nagraj Kota&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLO=\r\nCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
