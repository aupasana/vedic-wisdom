A lamp with a single wick is lit when one dies and placed near one&#39;s body. I want to shed a little light on this tradition.\n \nThough it is common to see lamps lit with 2 wicks in poojas, the mantras actually say &quot;saajyaM trivarti saMyuktaM..&quot;. The word &quot;trivarti saMyuktaM&quot; means &quot;having three wicks&quot;. So the mantras normally refer to 3 wicks, but people normally light 2 wicks.\n \nThe Sanskrit word for wick is &quot;varti&quot; (from the root &quot;vR^t&quot;)and it means &quot;one that conducts&quot; or a &quot;a channel&quot;. A wick that conducts the flow of oil and supports a light is akin to a nadi or a channel of energy flow in our body. Just as oil flows in a wick, awareness flows a nadis. Just as there is a light supported by that oil, there is a sense of self supported by that awareness.\n \nLighting a lamp with 3 wicks is like energy flowing through Ida (lunar channel), Pingala (solar channel) and Sushumna (middle channel of divine perception). Because Sushumna is not open in most people, the habit of lighting a lamp with only 2 wicks came up.\n \nRise of energy through Ida nadi gives a perception of the universe colored by the lunar approach. It gives compassion, devotion, kindness, humility, emotions etc. Rise of energy through Pingala nadi gives a perception of the universe colored by the solar approach. It gives sacrifice, knowledge, confidence, logical thinking etc. Rise of energy through Sushumna nadi gives a perception of the universe colored by neither lunar (emotional) or solar (logical) approach. It gives understanding through a direct experience that is colored by neither emotion nor logic. When a yogi leaves body at the end, one aspires for the awareness to rise through Sushumna and leave through Brahma randhra at the top of the head.\n \nTo a true spiritual seeker, there is no difference between life and death. In fact, a yogi may practice death and effectively die many times during sadhana. A yogi embraces neither death nor life and is certainly not afraid of death. Moreover, for a true yogi, there is nothing great about either emotional understanding or logical understanding of the universe. Neither Ida nor Pingala is that important to a true yogi. Understanding caused by a flow in Sushumna alone is good understanding.\n \nThus, a single wick lamp is not so bad after all. In any case, just because one lights a lamp with a certain number of wicks, one&#39;s internal awareness does not automatically start flowing in a certain number of internal channels. External symbols work internally through resonance only after repeated practice and visualization.\n \nBottomline: Use the number of wicks you are comfortable with (1 or 2 or 3). I suggest not being dogmatic about it and following what one is told by elders or gurus. But, try to understand the meaning behind the practice.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
