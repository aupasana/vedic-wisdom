The question i=\r\ns what Braahmana should do in the absence of such patronage.\n \n*        *  =\r\n      *\n \nLord Krishna&#39;s words in SrimadBhagavatam 11.17 to Sri Uddhava giv=\r\ne clear guidance in this matter (see http://vedabase.net/sb/11/17/ for orig=\r\ninal Sanskrita verses).\n \nSB 11.17.41: A brahmana who considers that accept=\r\ning charity from others will destroy his austerity and spiritual purity sho=\r\nuld maintain himself by the other two brahminical occupations, namely teach=\r\ning Vedic knowledge and performing sacrifice. If the brahmana considers tha=\r\nt those two occupations also compromise his spiritual position, then he sho=\r\nuld collect rejected grains in agricultural fields and live without any dep=\r\nendence on others.\n \nSB 11.17.42: The body of a brahmana is not intended to=\r\n enjoy insignificant material sense gratification; rather, by accepting dif=\r\nficult austerities in his life, a brahmana will enjoy unlimited happiness a=\r\nfter death.\n \nSB 11.17.43: A brahmana householder should remain satisfied i=\r\nn mind by gleaning rejected grains from agricultural fields and marketplace=\r\ns. Keeping himself free of personal desire, he should practice magnanimous =\r\nreligious principles, with consciousness absorbed in Me. In this way a brah=\r\nmana may stay at home as a householder without very much attachment and thu=\r\ns achieve liberation.\n \nSB 11.17.47: If a brahmana cannot support himself t=\r\nhrough his regular duties and is thus suffering, he may adopt the occupatio=\r\nn of a merchant and overcome his destitute condition by buying and selling =\r\n*MATERIAL* things. If he continues to suffer extreme poverty even as a merc=\r\nhant, then he may adopt the occupation of a kshatriya, taking sword in hand=\r\n. But he cannot in any circumstances become a shudra.\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \nIf one carefully reads SrimadBhagavatam 11.17, there is no confusion on =\r\nwhat a Braahmana can and cannot do with Vedic knowledge. Accepting royal gr=\r\nants and other charity given voluntarily by others to support a braahmana (=\r\nwhen one is satisfied with the spiritual purity of the giver) is fine. Teac=\r\nhing Jyotish and other Vedic knowledge and performing rituals and taking vo=\r\nluntary donation (when one is satisfied with the spiritual purity of the gi=\r\nver) is fine.\n \nOtherwise, when not enough money is generated through Vedic=\r\n teaching and rituals and one is suffering, buying and selling material thi=\r\nngs (e.g. mathematics knowledge, software, TVs, accounting services etc) to=\r\n support oneself is fine.\n \nBut, setting price on Jyotish knowledge or othe=\r\nr Vedic knowledge or rituals performed for gods is NOT fine for a *braahman=\r\na*. There cannot be two opinions on this, as the Lord Himself spoke clearly=\r\n to Uddhava in this manner!\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding the clause ab=\r\nove &quot;when one is satisfied with the spiritual purity of the giver&quot;, an exam=\r\nple:\n \nSwami Brahmananda was the spiritual son of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa a=\r\nnd a friend of Lord Krishna in a previous incarnation as per Ramakrishna. W=\r\nhen he was the head of the Ramakrishna mission, a rich man came to them. He=\r\n wanted to renounce and donate his entire wealth to Ramakrishna mission. Sw=\r\nami Brahmananda determined that taking that money would taint them and he r=\r\nefused!\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf some people are charging fixed fees for =\r\nperforming rituals like poojas and homas and abhishekas to relieve people o=\r\nf their problems or charging fixed fees for teaching Jyotish or giving Jyot=\r\nish readings, it is their prerogative and we cannot (and should not) force =\r\nthem to change. One performs one&#39;s own karmas and reaps the fruits - tasty =\r\nand bitter - of one&#39;s own karmas. Others cannot change it.\n \nHowever, we ca=\r\nn say that they are NOT being braahmanas, as per the guidelines of Lord Kri=\r\nshna.\n \nThough SB 11.17.40 says that Vedic knowledge can be taught and ritu=\r\nals can be performed *only* by Braahmanas (here braahmana means one followi=\r\nng the code of conduct of a braahmana and not just one born in a so-called =\r\nbrahmana family), we seem to have a huge number of NON-braahmanas (by condu=\r\nct and not necessarily by birth) who are *selling* Jyotish knowledge and ri=\r\ntual performance. It is not surprising, this being deepening Kali yuga!\n \nT=\r\nhe best way to deal with them is not to attack them or call them names. If =\r\nyou want to buy what they are selling, buy it. If not, ignore them, leave t=\r\nhem to their own fate and move on. YOU can follow the words of Lord, if you=\r\n have faith in Lord. But there is no need to impose them on others. Leave t=\r\nhat to Lord!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesso=\r\nns, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and P=\r\nitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films t=\r\nhat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n \n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sanjay Rath=\r\n&quot; &lt;sanjayrath@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; om gurave namah\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Vinay Jha\n&gt; \n&gt; How =\r\ndo you know that =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Jyotishis in ancient courts were not =\r\npaid servants.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C2=9D?

There are many doctors in India who do some social service. Almo=\r\nst all astrologers in this list also do some social service.

Free readings without any Dakshina is not only fruitless for th=\r\ne client, it will actually harm him/her. In astrological fora, free reading=\r\ns are offered, but the clients should pay as much Dakshina as possible in t=\r\nhe name of astrologer to any sanyasi, student, temple, etc IF the astrologe=\r\nr is unwilling to take money, otherwise free readings will be wastage of ti=\r\nme of the astrologer and harmful for the client.\n&gt; \n&gt; Generally I refuse to=\r\n accept Dakshina because I am a loner and God has provided me alternatives,=\r\n hence if I accept Dakshina I will have to donate it to others, which I som=\r\netimes do.

In fact, the position of &quot;Raj=\r\na Jyotishi&quot; had been evident in a number of historical books. All the great=\r\n sages got patronage from various kings of their times. Now the time has ac=\r\ntually changed!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lord Rama had to accompany sage Vishwamitra to des=\r\ntroy the demonic forces and he was given all kinds of astra-shastras and ma=\r\nntric vidya by the divine sage. In fact, Maharishi Vashishtha was the &quot;Raja=\r\n Guru&quot; of the &quot;Raghu Vansha&quot;. These sages were knowledgeable about this vid=\r\nya whose example is found in Ramayana as Lord Rama&#39;s horoscope is mentioned=\r\n in detail. In fact each of the brother&#39;s details are mentioned in Ramayana=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Similar is the case in Mahabharata; wherein we found the details=\r\n of Lord Krishna&#39;s birth and other Pandavas details in one way or the other=\r\n. While Maharishi Veda-Vyasa has been revered as the &quot;Raja Guru&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nEven in other fields i.e. music; who doesnt know the power of &quot;Deepak Raga&quot;=\r\n of Taansen which created so much heat that everything started burning when=\r\n he sung in &quot;Deepak Raga&quot;. In a competition, &quot;Baiju Bawara&quot; used &quot;Meha Malh=\r\naar&quot; in such a way that he washed the heat created by Tansen&#39;s Deepak Raga =\r\nthrough rain.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, astrological classics also give details abo=\r\nut how astrology is actually practised: &quot;The Prashna Tantra&quot; gives details =\r\nof the same. In fact, it mentions the time when the horoscopes should be se=\r\nen and how many in totality. But now, it is more of a business for a number=\r\n of people than real practice. Somehow the good side is losing its sheen.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; People want everything for free and hesitate in paying; it is the c=\r\nommon practice now. There is no mention anywhere that the astrologer&#39;s shou=\r\nld not be paid. But seeking payment from financially deprived person is wro=\r\nng. Therefore, some part of it is for the good of financially deprived peop=\r\nle and some for payment from financially sound people.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In any case=\r\n, it is up to the conscience of both astrologer and seeker.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; Prakash Kandpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com &lt;mai=\r\nlto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There has been a lot of discussion on vedic=\r\n-astrology list on astrological readings and fees.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Every actio=\r\nn has an equal and opposite reaction. This is the first law of Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Giving a potentially life-altering astrological reading is an actio=\r\nn that will have a reaction. Doing so for financial rewards, pre-determined=\r\n (fee) or completely left to the client (dakshina), will further complicate=\r\n the equation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, giving astrological readings, freely or fo=\r\nr a fee (including &quot;recommended&quot; dakshina) or for a dakshina (i.e. totally =\r\nvoluntary), is not the only action we engage in. We engage in so many actio=\r\nns, some better and some worse.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One with bad vaasanaas (mental=\r\n conditioning) engages in wrong actions or in correct actions with wrong at=\r\ntitude, and pays for it later.

It may be relevant when =\r\nwe are discussing astrology and fees. I am not an emotional person, but thi=\r\ns made my eyes wet. If I was there, I would&#39;ve washed the feet of this begg=\r\nar and sprinkled the water on my head. This kind of pure thinking is so dif=\r\nficult to find now-a-days...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Once when I was in Alandi, I hea=\r\nrd two blind beggars talk inside the temple presmises. One of them said tha=\r\nt he has recently been initiated by someone into the Varkari path and he ca=\r\nn now sing Abhags (spiritual songs in Marathi) in the company of other init=\r\niates. He was very happy. The other beggar asked him, why don&#39;t you sing th=\r\ne abhangs when you beg. You will get more money, your singing is terrific. =\r\nThe first man replied that he cannot use songs of God for earning money, ev=\r\nen if the money is coming through begging. God is beyond everything else. B=\r\negging is for my dharma, but signing is for God. I will not mix the two.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;When I heard it (&lt;deleted&gt; was also there) I was stunned. This =\r\ncoming from a begger! This created a strong impact on my mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Such is the power of Gyaneshwar Maharaj who moulds the consciousness of a=\r\nll who go there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Krishna temple at Alandi, where Gyanesh=\r\nwar Maharaj is believed to be still meditating in the underground chamber (=\r\nI have no doubt about it), is one of the most spiritually charged places I =\r\nhave been to. Tiruvannamalai, Girnar, Mayapur and Dakshineshwar are some ot=\r\nher places that are alive with spiritual energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
