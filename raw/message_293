Rather, true wisdom is the consequent result\nof the uniting of knowledge=\r\n with immediate spiritual realization via\nthe practice of God-centered medi=\r\ntation. It is in devotional\nmeditative absorption upon the Absolute that bo=\r\nth factual knowledge\nand the faculty of discernment itself finally bare spi=\r\nritual fruit in\nthe form of direct non-mediated perception of Truth. When w=\r\ne achieve\nsuch an experience, transcendent Truth itself then becomes a livi=\r\nng\npresence within us, nurturing us in the light of God&#39;s grace. To have\nwi=\r\nsdom means to surrender to Truth itself, and to presence that Truth\nin our =\r\neveryday lives in everything we do, think, and say.&quot; (pg. 31)\n\n- Sri Dharma=\r\n Pravartaka Acharya\n\n\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com\n\nJoin the Revolution in=\r\n Higher Consciousness!\n\n\n\n"}}
