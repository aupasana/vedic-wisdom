If you are unable t=\r\no use sesame seeds and use akshatas as a substitute for sesame seeds, it is=\r\n ok to stick to the same mantra and imagine the akshatas to be sesame seeds=\r\n. That may be better than changing the text to &quot;akshatodakam&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nSesame seeds, atleast the white ones, are available in most places, includi=\r\nng the west.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; You can collect the water in a vessel or bowl and =\r\noffer it at the base of a plant or tree at the end of the ritual.

One can do pi=\r\ntri tarpana on everyday during this fortnight and forget all other criteria=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of people these days may benefit from pitri tarpana. Th=\r\ne super-short procedure can be finished in 5 minutes and makes a lot of dif=\r\nference over the time. These are some chakras (energy centers) in the palm.=\r\n When water flows over tham in a particular direction and thoughts of freed=\r\nom from certain subtle influences on one&#39;s mind are in one&#39;s mind at the sa=\r\nme time, it is conducive to internal changes which free one from those infl=\r\nuences. Like with all rituals, you are engaging in external actions that pr=\r\nomote certain kinds of internal transformation over time. Rituals work over=\r\n time, when coupled with conducive thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; In the old days, b=\r\nrahmanas (i.e. people interested in knowledge, spiritual progress and liber=\r\nation) used to do a short homam and pitri tarpana everyday. If that is not =\r\npossible, atleast doing tarpana during this fortnight is a great idea.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Someone asked about diet rules etc.=\r\n For any spiritual sadhaka, eating as saattwik food as one can is always a =\r\ngood idea. While doing sadhanas like pitri tarpana or homam, it is good if =\r\none can stop eating meat or atleast cut down on it.
