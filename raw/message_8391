Making an idol of Dur=\r\nga from the mud collected from the house of a widow and a prostitute! I int=\r\nerpret that ritual to demonstrate that Durga abides in the heart of a prost=\r\nitute as much as she does in the heart of a saint, and so the soil from bot=\r\nh their houses is equally sacred. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m glad to hear you say that=\r\n tantra has so many women of high spiritual calibre...that&#39;s very inspiring=\r\n. What a pity we don&#39;t hear much about them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I recently read a w=\r\nonderful book about the women saints of India, called &quot;Daughters of the God=\r\ndess&quot;, written by an American devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen). She a=\r\nsked the same question &quot;Where are the women saints of India?&quot;. A Pandit ji =\r\nreplied, &quot;just because they don&#39;t stand on public stages and give seminars,=\r\n doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist!&quot;. Linda then went on a pilgrimage to India =\r\nand met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anandi Ma and other living realised saints in =\r\nthe female form. I&#39;ve met Amma, but would love to meet some of the yoginis =\r\nand Bhairavis you mention.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m curious about tantra and would li=\r\nke to learn more about it. I like Japa as my main spiritual practice,  but =\r\nI&#39;m open to learning about other paths (tantra probably includes Japa for a=\r\nll I know). And learning more about Goddess worship would be great. I see D=\r\nurga as my spiritual guide, keeping me on the path, doing the Sadhana with =\r\nme (because I&#39;m too lazy to do it on my own), and Hari as the goal (actuall=\r\ny they&#39;re the same in my head and are both my goal as my divine parents). T=\r\nhe cowherd girls of yore, clever girls, knew that the Goddess alone could g=\r\nive them Hari...as we all know, they famously worshipped Katyayani asking f=\r\nor Krishna, and She gave Him to them! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please could you reccomme=\r\nnd some articles/books on tantra. I would love to have a read and educate m=\r\nyself on this, and may be even, add something to my practice. My only worhi=\r\np of Durga currently (aside from abusing and praising her alternately) is r=\r\nepeating her mantra Om Dum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) ran=\r\ndomly. (My main mantra that I got intiated into from a Swami of the Sivanan=\r\nda tradition is Om Namo Narayanaya.) And I have recently added homams to my=\r\n practice, albeit only once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Hari wit=\r\nh it (it&#39;s not a perfect homam technique wise, but I try and put a bit of h=\r\neart in it. And if I can&#39;t find any heart, I blame Durga for not giving me =\r\nany! She gets a lot of abuse from me I&#39;m afraid, but as she made me, it&#39;s h=\r\ner own fault). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for the message, and here&#39;s to tant=\r\nra, the path that treats women as equals! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Very authentic questions! Allow me to add =\r\nsome perspective to it, which may or may-not be helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;H=\r\now outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women were not \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; al=\r\nlowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; aren&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the point of \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; covering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), =\r\nand then yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\ncriptures).&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I assume from your words that you have been ex=\r\nposed to some standard view-points about Durga, (Avidya/Maya and all that s=\r\ntuff). In some branches of the Adwaitha philosophy it is said that Shakti (=\r\nDurga) is Maya and Avidya. Irony being that, adherents of these branches we=\r\nre hardly the folks, historically speaking, who chief deity was Ma Durga.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The path that *actually* worshiped Her, was/is Tantra, which =\r\nbelieves, there is no &quot;Avidya&quot; at all. Brahman/the-state-called-Atman is tr=\r\nue, and so is the world of duality which is but a manifestation/projection =\r\nof that core. In the path of Tantra, which was neither mainstream nor geogr=\r\naphically widespread, there was never any restriction to females with respe=\r\nct to sadhana. Not only were women initiated, but there were fantastic wome=\r\nn of exceptional spiritual caliber, and they used to be classified based on=\r\n the levels they had achieved as &quot;uttara-sadhikas&quot;, &quot;bhairavis&quot; and &quot;yogini=\r\ns&quot;. While mainstream Hinduism was busy burning widows alive in the name of =\r\nsome dubious rules, Tantras boldly declared Sati-daha as an abomination, re=\r\njected the caste-system totally, and allowed women the status of spiritual =\r\npreceptors when they could attain certain states. One of the Gurus of Sri R=\r\namakrishna was a Bhairavi who taught him Tantra. The first person to worshi=\r\np\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  UgraTara south of the Vindya Hills was the wife of a disciple of =\r\nSri Ramana Maharishi, who was initiated into this worship by a Bhairavi in =\r\nMithila. If a Bhairavi has the caliber to teach a Ramakrishna, would she no=\r\nt have the caliber to act as gurus for average folks? Sure. But then, histo=\r\nry does not even record her real name. Why? Because, the system of Tantra a=\r\ns well as those who followed the path - both men and women - were firmly re=\r\njected by mainstream brahminical Hinduism; thus they never gained any popul=\r\narity, except for the wrong reasons. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Every worship =\r\nof Durga that happens anywhere today is India is still a watered-down versi=\r\non from the Tantras. The concept of ChanDi Homa was first mentioned in the =\r\nDamara and Katyayani Tantras. In Bengal every rule of Durga Puja is from th=\r\ne various Tantric schools. [For example, when creating an idol of Durga, th=\r\ne mud has to be collected from 4/5 different places such as from home of a =\r\nprostitute, a river-bed, a widow&#39;s house, etc etc.] \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n So it is not that those who followed the path of Ma Durga never had women =\r\nsaints. Infact, they had more women in their folds who were accorded the hi=\r\nghest spiritual status than in mainstream Hinduism. But since Tantra itself=\r\n was never popular, neither were these saints popular. And things like fema=\r\nle foeticide were unheard of in places where the worship of the Goddess was=\r\n popular. Even the misguided thugees - infamous worshipers of Ma Kali - who=\r\n were guilty of rampant human-sacrifices, would never dare to offer a woman=\r\n as a sacrifice to Ma Kali, for they feared of Her wrath since Tantras stri=\r\nctly forbid harming the female of any specifies for a worshiper of the Godd=\r\ness. So if blame has to be laid for mistreatment of women, objectively it w=\r\nould not fall on those whose chief worship was of Durga or Kali or one of H=\r\ner forms.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hota hain =\r\nshab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ek khel hain aurang=\r\n-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  From: sunrise_10=\r\n80 &lt;sunrise_1080@&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sa=\r\nturday, 16 June 2012 12:13 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic lia=\r\nbility for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;=\r\nscsa_taker3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; First of all, to anyone reading this=\r\n , please chant mentally while\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reading, time is running out, who k=\r\nnows when you will reach the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cremation ground, chant and chant.

I=\r\n hasten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I&#39;m furious with Durga.=\r\n How outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women were not allowed =\r\nto be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess).
