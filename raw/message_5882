Usually, I cal=\r\nl several people and divide the total number by the number of people chanti=\r\nng and offer the quotient number of offerings in the fire. But this being a=\r\n working day I don&#39;t think I will be getting any help. So, I will do the 10=\r\n,000 swaha chantings myself and I need to be doing 10,000 offerings. What i=\r\ns the best material to be used. Ghee, Havan Samagri or any other seeds like=\r\n sunflower seeds etc.? Please advise. \n\n\n\n2. For Siva Ratri, in our communi=\r\nty at the local temple some people are organizing a Siva Homam wherein they=\r\n are distributing Siva Lingas for sponsors ordered from some place in Delhi=\r\n. I do not know the origin well. It could well be from internet. After that=\r\n homam is done and I get the Siva Lingam, can I use it in my daily pooja or=\r\n shall I put in the show-case! \n\n\n\nOn the same topic, several people are af=\r\nraid that something bad would happen if they do not do abhishekam for the l=\r\ningam daily, so they are refraining from sponsoring the pooja. In  the proc=\r\ness, the temple is suffering with not enough funds. What would be your advi=\r\nse for such situations?\n\n\n\n3.
