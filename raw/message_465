I will continue in\nthe same vein for a little more time.\n\nI had a dream a couple of years ago early in the morning. In the dream,\nthere was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit and I were sitting in\nfront of the fire. He was teaching me some pranayama techniques in the\ndream. Suddenly, he changed into somebody else that I could not recognize.\nIt was not anybody I had seen before.\n\nI mentioned this dream to my guru after a couple of weeks. First he said he\ndid not know who the other person was and said he would&#39;ve probably known if\nI had mentioned the dream soon after it had happened. I left it there.\nHowever, when we talked in the next weekend, he referred to my dream and\nsaid he had an idea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me to search on\nthe internet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in my dream.\nIt was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before him). Though\nhe is apparently well-known, I was not knowledegable about this lineage and\ndid not see his picture before. I searched on the internet and found a\nphoto. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the person I saw in my\ndream. The person that Manish transformed into in my dream looked like a\nslightly younger version of that photo.\n\nWhen I confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and said, &quot;Narasimha, there\nare so many links between various lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n\nOf course, I do not know much about kriya yoga or about the lineage of\nParamahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life starts from Dattatreya. We\nhave a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his lineage and got\na lot of our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps experience from them. We do\nnot have any direct link to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda. But,\nManish thought there were some other indirect links. Moreover, he guessed\nwho I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, and he guessed\ncorrectly. That should count for something!\n\nI will not be surprised if there are indeed subtle connections between\nseveral lineages that seem disjoint today.\n\nBy the way, Swami Vivekananda also appeared in the prison cell of Sri\nAurobindo (who wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad) and\nimparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n\n*        *        *\n\nAn interesting coincidence is that a swamiji from Puri contacted me within a\nfew days after I saw that photo. His guru and Paramahamsa Yogananda were\nco-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is the keeper of\nsome astrological knowledge that his guru received from Yukteshwar Maharaj.\nHe visited me after a month, discussed that knowledge and spent a day at my\nhouse. Thus, some small connection was made with a representative of that\nlineage soon after the dream. After all, some karmik debts may have been\nthere...\n\n*        *        *\n\nI want to make one thing clear.\n\nSome things I mention like this may give the impression that my guru has\nsome psychic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he always\ndownplays those things and attaches no importance whatsoever. He says,\n&quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and lower than dirt and capable of\nnothing. It is all Her power. She is the connection between every entity in\nthis universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrument sometimes\nand do something using me. I have no special abilities of any kind. Any\ncoincidences you find are just Her grace and not due to me.&quot;\n\nI realized in time that this simplicity, humility and lack of ego is not\nfake. I also realized that this lack of ego is what enabled him to do things\nthat sound impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that many great\nsaints in the past were like this. Several magical things happened through\nthem, but they did not find any pride in them and retained their humility\nand sense of surrender to their chosen form of god and believed that god\nwas the doer of all things and they were mere instruments.\n\nThe day you also start believing that, not for the sake of lecturing or\nposturing, but from the deep cores of your heart, your sadhana will bear\nfruit.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Lakshmi,\n&gt;\n&gt; The Yogananda I mentioned is different. Swami Yogananda is one of\nthe sixteen monastic disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, along with\nSwami Vivekananda. He was forced to marry, but never slept with his\nown wife. Swami Vivekananda once said &quot;if any of us (disciples of\nRamakrishna) conquered lust completely and in all respects, it is\nJoginder (Swami Yogananda)&quot;. There is no question of Swami Yogananda\nbeing accused of drinking and having women etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda is a sishya of Yukteshwar Maharaj and from the\nlineage of Mahavatar Babaji. They practice kriya yoga. I do not know\nmuch about him.\n\n\n\nFor what it is worth, you can read more about Paramahamsa Yogananda in\nhis free+online autobiography,\nhere http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi\n\nThere were interesting links between Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and\nParamahamsa Yogananda:-\nFor example, one of the top disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was\nMahendranath Gupta (not sure if he was one of the 16 monastic\ndisciples that Narasimhaji refers to) aka Master Mahasaya, who wrote\n&quot;The Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot;\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahendranath_Gupta), and was the\nsanskrit tutor to Paramahamsa Yogananda as well; the latter devoted an\nentire chapter to him in his\nbook : http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi/Chapter_9\n\nElsewhere in his autobiography Paramhamsa Yogananda also mentions an\nanecdote of a disciple to whom he gifted a silver cup, who as a young\nman was told by Swami Vivekandana that the Guru in his life would\npresent him with a silver cup in the future.\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi/Chapter_47\n\nMakes you wonder about the Divine connection between all these\nsupremely elevated souls!\n\nBest.\n\n\n"}}
