I am just doing a =\r\nthinking aloud here. Feel free to disagree :)\n=C2=A0\nFirstly, I feel, the c=\r\nonception of colloquially used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with u=\r\nnlimited potentials way beyond what any normal human being can achieve, cam=\r\ne into existence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krs=\r\nhna as the ultimate God=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=\r\n=C2=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata relig=\r\nion started from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All th=\r\ne major purely=C2=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Val=\r\nlavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhanesh=\r\nwari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - conside=\r\nred, (with differing nuances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, =\r\nmoksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This w=\r\nas aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, t=\r\nhat is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,\n=\r\n like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal v=\r\niew of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless P=\r\naramatma, as well as Narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama=\r\n was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the =\r\nearlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.\n=C2=A0\nWhatev=\r\ner the case maybe, each school had its own set of established saints and sc=\r\nholars to vouch for their views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which=\r\n is often, as you rightly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nWe=C2=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an Avat=\r\nar appears on the earth,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after t=\r\nhe Avatara, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatara=\r\n=C2=A0because invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those tim=\r\nes, the life of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way beyo=\r\nnd=C2=A0imagination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the=\r\n next Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and befor=\r\ne Krshna, of which we have very little written record, the world at large r=\r\nemained entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.\n=C2=A0\nIn this light Krshna is t=\r\nhe Poorna-Avatara. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible ac=\r\ncompanied by a set of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coteri=\r\ne of Rishis who explain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to t=\r\nhe general masses - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be l=\r\nooked at as the crest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nI believe in the evolutionary parable of these 9 Avatara becau=\r\nse I find no other reason why these set of Avatara, from the whole list of =\r\npossible=C2=A0Avataras, have captured the popular imagination. I mean Datta=\r\ntreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality is no less than that of=\r\n any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9/10 Avataras. \n=C2=A0\nTh=\r\ne=C2=A0original Nath Yogis used to consider=C2=A0Nine Chakras in the Human =\r\nBody. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also came from them, which was basically e=\r\nxploring=C2=A0cronologically all these nine chakras one after the other by =\r\nflooding them with Chit-Shakti.\n=C2=A0\nThere are 9 basic grahas in jyotish.=\r\n Each graha could very well=C2=A0represent the essential nature of each cha=\r\nkra. All these make me more sanguine that there must be Nine Evolutionary A=\r\nvataras, not ten. In which case Kalki must be the Ninth Avatara.\n=C2=A0\nBud=\r\ndha, as you rightly pointed out,=C2=A0has a tremendous logical appeal in Ka=\r\nli Yuga. But if logic is the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not=\r\n agree to=C2=A0his philosophy as it comes down to us from his followers, bu=\r\nt it cannot be denied that=C2=A0Adi Shankara was=C2=A0arguable one of the s=\r\nharpest and most logical of spiritual philosphers. His intellectual and log=\r\nical mind=C2=A0is beyond doubt.=C2=A0Just that Shankara=C2=A0never claimed =\r\nhimself to be an Avatara. Neither did=C2=A0Siddhartha. Only that the later =\r\ncame 3000 years ago, and the former came possibly in the last 1000 years.=\r\n=C2=A0Shankara&#39;s spiritual impact on the world is no less than that of the=\r\n=C2=A0Buddha. What mainstream=C2=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, =\r\nhad it not been for the invaluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Bud=\r\ndha was truly=C2=A0the awaited=C2=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would n=\r\not have been able to absorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus=\r\n make it lose its grip on India. Buddhism\n barely exists in land of its bir=\r\nth.\n=C2=A0\nAll this taken together, make me more and more convinced that th=\r\nere are 9 evolutionary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0 =\r\n*=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nA little bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire R=\r\nama, it is not a lip-service. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I f=\r\nind extremely inspiring, educative and uplifting. Like the incident where R=\r\nama was to cross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one m=\r\noment he could have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield wa=\r\ny to his army. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that the=\r\n ocean allow his army safe passage. When all else failed, when genuine good=\r\nwill was not recirpocated, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the oce=\r\nan,=C2=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama took up weapons to get the job done.=C2=A0A powerfu=\r\nl warrior,=C2=A0who knows=C2=A0very well how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself =\r\nis, not letting that sense of power pervert his mind even for a moment is a=\r\nn amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comte=\r\nmplation, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has =\r\nsome form of power or influence in\n this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had=\r\n no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He =\r\nwas the very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cu=\r\nnningness are impossible.\n=C2=A0\nRecently, a friend of mine told me that he=\r\n has learnt all his life that one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only =\r\nfollow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehemen=\r\ntly. If one reads entire Krshna&#39;s life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna =\r\nof Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Gur=\r\nu who speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in t=\r\nhe Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all th=\r\nrough his life at every instance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under a=\r\nll circumstances of life, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes=\r\n me wonder, was this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do something l=\r\nike this? It is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate from=\r\n everything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He =\r\nhad not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his w=\r\nife abducted for him to start a war against Ravana.\n But Krshna had zero=C2=\r\n=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents fro=\r\nm Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he=\r\n forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a gr=\r\neat war to cleanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed R=\r\nama all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0=\r\nBalarama in his next incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshn=\r\na. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they d=\r\noing with all these kings, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their v=\r\nillage in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will =\r\nunderstand everything. But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, =\r\nwith perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false prais=\r\nes, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I=\r\n am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I\n wo=\r\nrship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single =\r\nsadhaka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kin=\r\nd of perfected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from =\r\nthe world or actively performing a larger dharma.\n=C2=A0\nI started apprecia=\r\nting Swami Vivekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara. =\r\nThat was the last known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a=\r\n circus-stoplight of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and=\r\n on the other bitter enemies accusing him of=C2=A0being a heretic=C2=A0righ=\r\nt upto the=C2=A0very end of his brief life,=C2=A0and yet none of that affec=\r\nted him to any great degree. He faced terrific racism in the America, yet n=\r\not a single speech of his reflects the slightest trace of bitterness, anger=\r\n, or negativity. That is such a fantastic achievement, IMHO.\n=C2=A0\nI agree=\r\n with you, Narasimha, for most of us it is better to=C2=A0try to=C2=A0mould=\r\n ones life=C2=A0with the same kind of supreme selflessness that Rama showed=\r\n all along.=C2=A0Not just worship Rama=C2=A0but more importantly study=C2=\r\n=A0his life and imbibe,=C2=A0to whatever degree possible, the quality he re=\r\npresented.=C2=A0Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifested Reality - Shiva - =\r\nwill fix the mind so firmly on that Reality, that in some future life, in s=\r\nome later birth, one will be able to live life like Krshna showed, unattach=\r\ned and unaffected by any dirt that the world throws up. And then the=C2=A0U=\r\nniversal=C2=A0Chit-Shakti (Adya Shakti)=C2=A0will flood such an individual =\r\nwith oppulence unimaginable, of this world and also of=C2=A0what lies in ot=\r\nher worlds, like Krshna&#39;s six oppulences -=C2=A0Infinite wealth, infinite b=\r\neauty, infinite power/knowledge, infinite fame, and infinite detachment fro=\r\nm all the other five. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nEnjoyed this discussion. :)\n=C2=A0\nJai=\r\n Jai=C2=A0Rama Krshna Hari!\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\nawaktam w=\r\nyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanutta=\r\nmam ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Narasimha P.V.R.

He too said there are innumerable avataras. Avataras can co=\r\nme with a combination of paramatmamsas (supreme/absolute being portions) an=\r\nd jivatmamsas (living/relative being portions) taken from grahas in any com=\r\nbination. Though 9 main avataras of Vishnu came from paramatmamsas of 9 gra=\r\nhas, many many other avataras also descended on earth due to various other =\r\ncombinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas of the same 9 grahas! There a=\r\nre obviously many possibilities.\n=C2=A0\nIn fact, Parasara says that ALL bei=\r\nngs contain some paramatmamsa and some jivatmamsa, coming from grahas. But =\r\njivatmamsa is predominant in most of us.\n=C2=A0\nWhen one leaves earth, para=\r\nmatmamsas in one return to respective grahas and jivatmamsas take birth aga=\r\nin based on desires. In the &#39;end&#39;, even the jivatmamsas return to respectiv=\r\ne grahas. At the time of Mahapralaya, grahas also merge back in Supreme Lor=\r\nd.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAs for Kalki, Parasara did not clarify an=\r\nd we can only speculate. Though some people associate him with lagna, that =\r\nmakes no sense to me either. That is inconsistent with the overall framewor=\r\nk laid by Parasara (i.e. beings born with combinations of paramatmamsas and=\r\n jivatmamsas from *grahas*).\n=C2=A0\nKalki will probably come with paramatma=\r\nmsas of both Sun and Moon. After all, Kalki shows Shiva and Shakti (Sun and=\r\n Moon - soul and mind) coming together finally!! Just a speculation..\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nWhether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avataras, the th=\r\neory of evolutionary spiritual perfection does not add up because &quot;perfecti=\r\non&quot; occurred before the last avatara, unless you break away from main scrip=\r\ntures and throw away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not come yet).\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nRather than &quot;evolution&quot;, it is a matter of w=\r\nhat the world needs at that time. If people at the beginning of Satya yuga =\r\nare established in Self always and the only issue is that a small attachmen=\r\nt may develop now and then, disturbing that state of being established in S=\r\nelf (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness that is rele=\r\nvant is &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachme=\r\nnt and takes one back to being established in Self. So an avatara correspon=\r\nding to Ketu occurred.\n=C2=A0\nAs collective consciousness became denser, be=\r\ning established in Self became less natural and more effort was needed. So =\r\nthe &quot;spirit of patience, persistence and hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became relevan=\r\nt and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.\n=C2=A0\nIn the=\r\n dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept anything that didn&#39;=\r\nt &quot;make sense&quot;.

It is =\r\nonly in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and the term be=\r\ncomes popular. \n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;And ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avataras, in a fi=\r\nxed sequence=C2=A0of appearence, that we get the popular concept of Dasavat=\r\nara.

Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains th=\r\ne various vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every =\r\nlimitation of conception. Hence, the One says, among those who weild weapon=\r\ns, it is Rama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&lt;&lt;First,=\r\n he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he d=\r\noes not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept i=\r\ns possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theoriz=\r\ne.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As I said, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on t=\r\nhe idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then t=\r\nhese link to grahas are not of any use. For these nine grahas, individually=\r\n or in combination, will represent all Avataras, or for that matter everyth=\r\ning else in this Universe.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and cor=\r\nresponding grahas for each, then what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna =\r\nis not a graha.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Or, just surmising, can it be possible that until =\r\nan Avatara actually descends on the earth, his energy and his force cannot =\r\nbe attributed to any graha, but once he does appear, it reconfigures things=\r\n completely? We can only know after the last Avatara comes.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Anyway=\r\n, I am not looking at this main Avatars from the point of grahas/jyotish at=\r\n all. For that matter, some traditions consider Balarama to be an Avatara r=\r\nather than Buddha.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The concept of Avatara and Vibhutis com=\r\nes from the Gita.

In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned =\r\nthat Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used that exa=\r\nct expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (tho=\r\nugh paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Secondly, after describing=\r\n the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and that=\r\n all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is=\r\n under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are pa=\r\nrtial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduction that Kri=\r\nshna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to =\r\nsay that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above=\r\n, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it=\r\n mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;W=\r\nhile SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.=\r\n3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the=\r\n nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualitie=\r\ns of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds =\r\nin sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, s=\r\nimilarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the m=\r\neaning of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I a=\r\nm afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on their fancies a=\r\nnd conditioning..\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/abs=\r\nolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter portion is dom=\r\ninant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras desc=\r\nend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entire=\r\nly from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specifi=\r\nc examples given by Parasara.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;They are entirely divine, but they d=\r\no not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; cann=\r\not be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contain the entire sky.=\r\n They take part in the drama obeying and executing the divine will but NOT =\r\naltering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do n=\r\not\n&gt;&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt;&gt; realization=\r\n, the one he advocated, is a static realization,\n&gt;&gt; an end in a void.\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s li=\r\nst. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then you=\r\nr concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as =\r\nyou theorize.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Secondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mer=\r\ncury, who personifies logical mind and the spirit of investigation and comp=\r\nrehension. Logical mind and its spirit of comprehension are inherently fall=\r\nible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping t=\r\nhe Absolute Reality completely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wond=\r\ner it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is =\r\nwhat Buddha ended up doing. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the=\r\n Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great s=\r\npiritual force in this world in this age.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible co=\r\nrruption, are you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on =\r\nare perfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a different matter that you are only taking=\r\n some SB verses and ignoring some as I showed!.)\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The bottomline as=\r\n far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly co=\r\nherent esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Bud=\r\ndha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, V=\r\nenus - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES=\r\n have a highly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, eso=\r\nterically is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures and no=\r\ntions in them.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lo=\r\npsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and=\r\n other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supre=\r\nme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;On a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, =\r\nis superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declar=\r\ned them to be essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited diff=\r\nerentiating between them. As I see it, the difference between them is too s=\r\nubtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some significant=\r\n difference between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own cond=\r\nitioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfectly d=\r\netached and fully divine karma yogis.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If we think about it, perfec=\r\nted mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect =\r\nrepresented by Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishna a=\r\nnd Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their stories may b=\r\ne different.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;One last word though. If someone truly believes that =\r\nKrishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am ver=\r\ny happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing th=\r\ninking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the long ru=\r\nn, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone=\r\n of us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik=\r\n and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping some fistfuls =\r\nof Reality.

Let me write down as I=\r\n see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there=\r\n are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is=\r\n the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana=\r\n,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes on=\r\ntu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, V=\r\nyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supre=\r\nme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;2. Of these various pos=\r\nsible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded specia=\r\nl mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, speci=\r\nally those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When K=\r\nrshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed t=\r\nhe full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. Al=\r\nl Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-=\r\nYuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence =\r\nof appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama,=\r\n Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the fo=\r\nrm and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. =\r\nFrom the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-=\r\nhalf-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes pos=\r\nsession of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik ava=\r\ntara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara o=\r\nf Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spiritu=\r\nality is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressive reali=\r\nzation of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the=\r\n consciousness and its development through various life-forms. Larger spiri=\r\ntuality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand desi=\r\ngn for life on earth.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusin=\r\ng on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that i=\r\nf one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of libera=\r\ntion of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any =\r\nDevata can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the A=\r\nvatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider sup=\r\ner-massive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama=\r\n and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, bo=\r\nth inside as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in t=\r\nhis age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic m=\r\nind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencie=\r\ns within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater pu=\r\nrpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances=\r\n, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change=\r\n only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did=\r\n feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moment=\r\ns fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha w=\r\nhen the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the fin=\r\nal battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed =\r\nRavana not to rescue her, but it was\n the Dharma to do so, and to unhold hi=\r\ns family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family =\r\nhonor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of=\r\n Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a =\r\npoet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in=\r\n the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his kill=\r\ning Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no per=\r\nsonal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. Hi=\r\ns life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this im=\r\nmaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatura=\r\nl feats into account. It is his singular and constant detachment from situa=\r\ntions, from people, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life=\r\n. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his =\r\nfriends, his foster parents, his\n village-folks who so loved him, pleaded w=\r\nith him that it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and =\r\ncomfort of his happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny=\r\n and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that=\r\n they won&#39;t understand, he promised he will return back once his work in Ma=\r\nthura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to=\r\n him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment s=\r\nome of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed hi=\r\nmself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally an=\r\nd no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the=\r\n later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The=\r\n moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and =\r\nwas back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of be=\r\ning a revolutionist and\n charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhan=\r\na, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest =\r\nhim, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did =\r\nnot finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own p=\r\noised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his goi=\r\nng overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of =\r\nconfidence in his actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him.=\r\n And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipo=\r\nise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life =\r\nremains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition c=\r\nan never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results =\r\nbelong to the instrument. When running away from the battle-field and killi=\r\nng Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gest=\r\nuring Bheema to\n hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to fa=\r\nce Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the sit=\r\nuations must be lined up which would cause the destruction of these people.=\r\n This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens w=\r\nhen one is constantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We =\r\ndo not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least =\r\nin the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such =\r\nother auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Ad=\r\nbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ra=\r\nvana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed d=\r\nemon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabh=\r\narata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sa=\r\nttwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, c=\r\nhief of\n which is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused du=\r\ne to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroye=\r\nd, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also caus=\r\ne some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no a=\r\nttachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, ene=\r\nmy - and therefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His=\r\n Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was gr=\r\neat spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme o=\r\nf evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static =\r\nrealization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of th=\r\nis earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused.=\r\n None of them negated this world. If negation of this world and life is the=\r\n final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary=\r\n\n development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha b=\r\neing an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impac=\r\ntful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that th=\r\nese 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such m=\r\nany vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an=\r\n avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and=\r\n dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantra=\r\ns formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Sh=\r\nakti and therefore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original =\r\nliterature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers o=\r\nf psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non=\r\n-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9=\r\n Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full power and force\n of o=\r\nne of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify co=\r\nnsciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself is var=\r\nious possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not =\r\na graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution=\r\n are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I can=\r\nnot comment on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know =\r\nof what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree wit=\r\nh it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding o=\r\nr textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the A=\r\nvataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to =\r\nsay in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one=\r\n thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita aw=\r\nastha comes living in the full and complete purity and might\n and force and=\r\n strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara wi=\r\nll burn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolu=\r\ntion. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to ach=\r\nieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white hor=\r\nse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to =\r\nrectify the various errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this i=\r\ns how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with=\r\n my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to =\r\ntruth. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAma=\r\nbuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;___=\r\n_____________________________\n&gt;&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrot=\r\ne that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this st=\r\nage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progressio=\r\nn of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna=\r\n&quot;. =C2=A0 I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars =\r\nof a &quot;linear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 * =C2=A0 Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected fo=\r\nrm. =C2=A0 Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For example,=\r\n Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively. =C2=A0 W=\r\ne also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and=\r\n Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning=\r\n spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/d=\r\niscipline,\n spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respecti=\r\nvely). =C2=A0 Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect=\r\n of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspec=\r\nt operates. =C2=A0 Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul ope=\r\nrates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lo=\r\nrd Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination opera=\r\ntes. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/init=\r\niative operates. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Now, let us remember one basi=\r\nc thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdo=\r\nm in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these are differe=\r\nnt manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these d=\r\nifferent aspects, it has different qualities and plays different roles. The=\r\nre is no comparison between them. =C2=A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us f=\r\nirst,\n perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we need b=\r\nalance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects o=\r\nf Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance working together in t=\r\nhe Cosmos. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 One who is fascinated by the qualit=\r\nies of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who=\r\n is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrate=\r\ns how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom m=\r\nay like the story that demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But thi=\r\ns is just a matter of taste and subjective preference. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n* =C2=A0 Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen=\r\n as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. =\r\nIt is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes. =C2=A0 Once=\r\n mind fancies a separate existence with some\n agendas/desires, soul support=\r\ns the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as =\r\nits dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individua=\r\nlized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoym=\r\nent, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas=\r\n/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of =\r\none&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on=\r\n. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those ka=\r\nrmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individuali=\r\nzed consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and beget=\r\nting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its=\r\n dharma and does it impassionately. =C2=A0 Now, does this sound exciting? P=\r\nerhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supporting=\r\n the play, may not seem interesting enough\n to some. =C2=A0 On the other ha=\r\nnd, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those a=\r\ngendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps=\r\n the individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything e=\r\nlse in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma=\r\n impassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and brin=\r\ngs in agendas and passion and even decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. T=\r\nhat way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Kris=\r\nhna&#39;s life appeals more to one who may be excited by this description! =C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but le=\r\nt me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective. =C2=A0 Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how so=\r\nul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and be=\r\ncame realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra=\r\n. Soon after marriage, he was given\n kingdom. At the last moment, his fathe=\r\nr banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-brot=\r\nher was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-mot=\r\nher and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported a=\r\nnd consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he kne=\r\nw leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer=\r\n would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When sh=\r\ne was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He ne=\r\nver faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leav=\r\ning her later. He accepted every life situation with no complaints and did =\r\nthe best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without =\r\nhatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, =\r\nhe went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were going to di=\r\nsappear with Ravana! =C2=A0 Rama\n is a perfect example of a liberated man w=\r\nith no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arisin=\r\ng from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what sou=\r\nl does! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 As another example, let us look at Lor=\r\nd Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discriminatio=\r\nn operates. =C2=A0 He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cos=\r\nmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qualities. =C2=\r\n=A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is doin=\r\ng good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), =\r\none&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When wi=\r\nsdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are completel=\r\ny suppressed. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Please think about the other ava=\r\ntaras. The stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of how vario=\r\nus aspects of\n our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Para=\r\nsara. =C2=A0 Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them sep=\r\narately. Of course, if you are more attracted to one of them, please think =\r\nabout that avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of relie=\r\nving us from samsara. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 By the way, happy Hanum=\r\najjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools of t=\r\nhought). =C2=A0 Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality R=\r\nesources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org -------- \n\r\n--1004636618-1466986554-1367842074=:47740\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;VAR id=3Dyui-=\r\nie-cursor&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; =\r\nFONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, s=\r\nans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;=\r\nRIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparen=\r\nt; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace=\r\n, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\r\n=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Jai Ma!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: trans=\r\nparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, mono=\r\nspace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: tr=\r\nansparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, m=\r\nonospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPA=\r\nN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Some freeflowing thoughts that struck me while thin=\r\nking about some of points you have raised.

It is difficult to miss the phonetic&nbsp;similarity betwe=\r\nen terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the G=\r\nita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely&nbsp;Va=\r\nishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, =\r\nSri Chaitanya&nbsp;as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest =\r\nknown non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differing n=\r\nuances on the&nbsp;relation between jiva,\n paramatma, moksha&nbsp;etc), Krs=\r\nhna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a=\r\n measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana =\r\nand the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some, like the Gaudiya Vais=\r\nhnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and decl=\r\nared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as N=\r\narayana,&nbsp;as merely&nbsp;the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately =\r\nlinked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshn=\r\na, not as a separate Divity in himself.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROU=\r\nND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courie=\r\nr, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT=\r\n: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKG=\r\nROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, cou=\r\nrier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RI=\r\nGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Whatever the case maybe, each school=\r\n had its own set of established saints and scholars to vouch for their view=\r\ns.

Buddhism barely exists in land of its birth.=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FON=\r\nT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0=\r\n,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-=\r\nCOLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, =\r\nmonaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: a=\r\nuto&quot;&gt;All this taken together, make me more and more convinced that there ar=\r\ne 9 evolutionary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;B=\r\nACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New,=\r\n courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px=\r\n; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FO=\r\nNT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, san=\r\ns-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FON=\r\nT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0=\r\n,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-=\r\nCOLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, =\r\nmonaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: a=\r\nuto&quot;&gt;A little bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it is n=\r\not a lip-service. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremel=\r\ny inspiring, educative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to c=\r\nross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he cou=\r\nld have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his arm=\r\ny. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow=\r\n his army safe passage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not=\r\n recirpocated, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean,&nbsp;THE=\r\nN&nbsp;Rama took up weapons to get the job done.&nbsp;A powerful warrior,&n=\r\nbsp;who knows&nbsp;very well how&nbsp;powerful he&nbsp;himself is, not lett=\r\ning that sense of power pervert his mind even\n for a moment is an amazing p=\r\nhenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comtemplation, s=\r\npecially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has some form o=\r\nf power or influence in this world in any sphere.&nbsp;Rama had no malice f=\r\nor anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He was the very=\r\n personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningness ar=\r\ne impossible.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE=\r\n: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;=\r\n COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 16px; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Courier=\r\n New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE:=\r\n 16px; RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Recently, a friend of mine told me that he has learnt a=\r\nll his life that one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only follow what R=\r\nama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehemently. If one r=\r\neads entire Krshna&#39;s life&nbsp;with an objective mind, Krshna of Vrndavana,=\r\n Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks =\r\nthe Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Gita,&nbsp=\r\n;Krshna the&nbsp;Divine Worker&nbsp;himself followed it all through his lif=\r\ne at every instance. It is his&nbsp;perfect detachment under all circumstan=\r\nces of life, from childhood&nbsp;to his death,&nbsp;that makes me wonder, w=\r\nas this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do something like this? It =\r\nis as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate\n from everything,=\r\n and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He had not a si=\r\nngle personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wife abducted=\r\n for him to start a war against Ravana. But Krshna had zero&nbsp;personal s=\r\ntake in the Mahabharata.&nbsp;After liberating his parents from Kamsa, very=\r\n soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he forced himse=\r\nlf into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a great war to cl=\r\neanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed Rama all along=\r\n the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as&nbsp;Balarama in h=\r\nis next incarnation&nbsp;he could&nbsp;hardly understand Krshna. There are =\r\nso many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with all=\r\n these kings, and&nbsp;that they should&nbsp;return to their village in Vrn=\r\ndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will understand ev=\r\nerything. But that cannot stop him from following\n his dharma, with perfect=\r\n detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false praises, nor wron=\r\ng accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I am not even=\r\n counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I worship Krshna,=\r\n because I have not yet met or heard of read of&nbsp;a single sadhaka or sa=\r\nint or ordinary man or mahatma&nbsp;who has displayed this kind of perfecte=\r\nd detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the world or =\r\nactively performing \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
