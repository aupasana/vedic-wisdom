The plain meaning of the word Karma is action o=\r\nr deed. Karma  is  also   being used by some to indicate Destiny.   Karmaph=\r\nala means effect. . Karma comprises the entire cycle of cause and effect. W=\r\ne can say that Karma is a sum total of what a jiva has done, is currently d=\r\noing and will do and their resultant reactions. Present and future experien=\r\nces are the effect of all past deeds.  This makes one\n&gt; responsible for one=\r\n`s one life.  Karma extends through  not only one`s  present life but also =\r\nthrough past and future lifes, according to the religions which talk of\n&gt; r=\r\nebirth.  All religions which were\n&gt; either native in Bharath  viz., Hinduis=\r\nm or were  conceived  in India,viz.,  Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism contain=\r\n  law of Karma.\n&gt; \n&gt;The concept of Karma is an integral part of Hinduism. A=\r\nction and reaction govern  all life.  Karma  is not fate, as man acts with =\r\n free will  creating his own destiny.  Bhagawan Satya Sai Baba says, &quot;If yo=\r\nu sow Goodness, you will reap Goodness; if we sow evil, we will reap evil&quot;.=\r\n\n&gt;Conquest of Karma lies in intelligent  and detached action and  dispassio=\r\nnate reaction. Not all Karmas rebound immediately.While some karmas show th=\r\neir reaction in this very birth itself, others  accumulate and return unexp=\r\nectedly in this or other future births.\n&gt;The Law of Karma is considered to =\r\nbe a Spiritually oriented law that can not be abrogated by any person but c=\r\nan be mitigated by God, the Karmaphaladhata. Karma is not\n&gt; punishment or\n&gt;=\r\n retribution.  To my humble\n&gt; mind, it is an extended expression of natural=\r\n acts.  The Bhagawad Gita sings eloquently on action and reaction and  also=\r\n about Nishkamya  Karma or Selfless action ie., action without expecting an=\r\ny fruit in return.\n&gt;(to be continued) \n&gt;\n&gt;G.Balasubramanian\n_______________=\r\n_________________\nYahoo!
