Following a tradition\nthat=\r\n was still prevalent at the time, she was =E2=80=98married=E2=80=99 at the =\r\nage of five.\nSuch child brides usually lived with their parents till they r=\r\neached\npuberty, at which point they would move to their husband=E2=80=99s h=\r\nome. However,\nsince Akhilandamma=E2=80=99s husband died when she was only s=\r\neven years old, she\nspent all her childhood and youth at her parents=E2=80=\r\n=99 home. Under the social\nconditions that prevailed at the time, it was no=\r\nt possible for her to\nremarry, so when she grew up she decided to devote he=\r\nr life to serving\nsadhus. Though she was primarily attracted to Ramana Maha=\r\nrshi, she also\nserved Seshadri Swami and Vitthoba, an eccentric saint who l=\r\nived in Polur,\nabout thirty kilometres north of Tiruvannamalai.\n\nShe first =\r\nsaw Bhagavan in 1896 while he was residing in the Arunachaleswara\ntemple. O=\r\nn that occasion she saw the temple priest collecting the abhishekam\nmilk fr=\r\nom the Amman shrine and giving it to Bhagavan. This darshan did not\nmake a =\r\ngreat impression on her. It was not until 1903, when she visited Sri\nBhagav=\r\nan on the hill, that she first felt his power. From 1903 onwards she\nwas a =\r\nregular visitor. She invariably came for Bhagavan=E2=80=99s birthday\ncelebr=\r\nation, for the Deepam festival and for Jnanasambandhar Guru puja. She\nfrequ=\r\nently came at other times during the year. On each visit she would\nbring fo=\r\nod for Bhagavan and his devotees.\n\nWhen she stayed in her native village wi=\r\nth her mother, many of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s\ndevotees used to come and stay at=\r\n her house. With the object of serving such\ndevotees, Akhilandamma and Mast=\r\nhan Swami (whom she introduced to Bhagavan)\nestablished a math or centre th=\r\nere in 1914. Called Sri Ramanananda\nMathalayam, it was the first =E2=80=98R=\r\namana Centre=E2=80=99 to be established outside\nTiruvannamalai. Many of Bha=\r\ngavan=E2=80=99s early devotees such as Kunju Swami,\nRamaswami Pillai, Madha=\r\nva Swami and Ramanatha Brahmachari were taken there\nto recuperate from vari=\r\nous illnesses they had contracted in Tiruvannamalai.\n\nKunju Swami, one of h=\r\ner cured patients, made this comment in the\nintroduction to her biography: =\r\n=E2=80=98I know that for the last forty years this\nlady has been engaging h=\r\nerself in serving food to Bhagavan Sri Ramana\nMaharshi and Mahan Seshadri S=\r\nwami. Even from the days when Bhagavan was\nliving at Skandashram, whenever =\r\nany devotees there fell ill, it was her\ncustom to take them to the math in =\r\nher village and look after them. She\nwould only send them back after curing=\r\n their illness.=E2=80=99\n\nThere are two principal sources for information o=\r\nn Akhilandamma=E2=80=99s life: a\nTamil biography written by Sadhu Om in 196=\r\n0, and a Telugu account by\nNageswara Rao. Nageswara Rao, who interviewed Ak=\r\nhilandamma himself,\nincorporated many of Sadhu Om=E2=80=99s stories in his =\r\nown account, but also added\nincidents that Sadhu Om did not cover. The foll=\r\nowing story, from Nageswara\nRao=E2=80=99s account, was published in the Aru=\r\nnachala Ramana magazine in 1982. It\ndoes not appear either in Sadhu Om=E2=\r\n=80=99s account or in the =E2=80=98Power of the\nPresence=E2=80=99 chapter o=\r\nn Akhilandamma:\n\nWhenever Ganapati Muni saw me coming, he would exclaim wit=\r\nh delight, =E2=80=98Oh!\nAkhlkandamma has come!=E2=80=99\n\nEmboldened by this=\r\n, his favourable disposition towards me, one day I asked\nGanapati Muni in a=\r\n plaintive tone, =E2=80=98I am utterly unlettered while you, I am\ntold, are=\r\n a Master of all the Vedas and the Upanishads. What is the way for\nme?=E2=\r\n=80=99\n\nThe great scholar explained to me, with great respect and sweetness=\r\n,\n=E2=80=98Akhilandamma, you are really blessed. You are feeding Bhagavan R=\r\namana who\nis the very avatar of Kumara Swami. This is a sure sign of the Lo=\r\nrd=E2=80=99s\ngrace. Bear\nit in your mind and take heart. No austerities can=\r\n give fruit by themselves.\nRemember this always: it is Iswara who is the di=\r\nspenser of the fruit [of\nkarma]. Sent by that Iswara himself, Sri Ramana ha=\r\ns come down to earth. So\nwhat can please Iswara more than devoted service t=\r\no Sri Ramana? When you\nrecognise this secret, your fruit will increase all =\r\nthe more.=E2=80=99\n\nI have already acquainted you with the fact that my fam=\r\nily was very poor. We\nwere always beset with economic difficulties. In addi=\r\ntion to this, there\narose, at one time, differences in the family. Unable t=\r\no bear that\naffliction, I came before Bhagavan, cried, and broke down I tea=\r\nrs.\n\nBhagavan, after remaining silent for some time, opened his mouth and k=\r\nindly\nsaid, =E2=80=98Tesuramma [=E2=80=9CMother from Desur=E2=80=9D, her vi=\r\nllage], you are under the\nimpression that difficulties have come to you alo=\r\nne. This life is a blend of\npain and pleasure. One should have no elation w=\r\nhen there is pleasure, and no\ndejection when there is pain. Take my example=\r\n. I came here at the age of\nseventeen. I had no mother or father here. I ha=\r\nve spent my time in caves and\nunder trees in sun, in showers, and in the co=\r\nld. I begged alms to pacify my\nhunger. It is only nowadays that all of you =\r\nhave come here to minister to my\nneeds.=E2=80=99\n\nStill shedding tears, I s=\r\naid to Bhagavan in a begging tone of voice, =E2=80=98You,\nBhagavan, are an =\r\nincarnation, so you can bear all that. But what about a\nwoman like me? I ha=\r\nve no one but you to help me. You alone have to have\ncompassion on me.=E2=\r\n=80=99\n\nThese plaintive words moved Bhagavan, and his eyes became moist. Af=\r\nter\nremaining grave and serious for a while, slowly and steadily these supr=\r\neme\nwords emerged from his mouth: =E2=80=98Hereafter, remember me whenever =\r\nyou face\ncalamities.=E2=80=99\n\nWith these mighty words of grace ringing in =\r\nmy heart, I came out of the\ncave, followed by Ganapati Muni.\n\n=E2=80=98Akhi=\r\nlandamma!=E2=80=99 he cried with great elation. =E2=80=98Your virtue has ri=\r\npened.\nBhagavan has bestowed a rare boon on you. Never before have I seen B=\r\nhagavan\nbestowing a boon like this. And this boon is for future lives also.=\r\n This day\nis one of extreme rejoicing for me, for the mighty power of confe=\r\nrring\nboons, till now hidden in Bhagavan, has now broken out for your sake.=\r\n The\nhidden powers of a great and genuine Guru do not easily come out to wo=\r\nrk in\nthe external world; they do so only for the sake of worthy disciples.=\r\n The\ncredit of drawing them out, pure lady, goes to you now.=E2=80=99\n\nIt w=\r\nas really a boon to me as my subsequent experience proved. When\ndifficultie=\r\ns surrounded me like threatening clouds, when life itself became\na dungeon,=\r\n I would utter =E2=80=98Lord Ramana, my Lord Ramana=E2=80=99, and call on h=\r\nis\nprotection and help. Then, in a trice, the difficulties would disappear.=\r\n\nHowever severe the calamity, because of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s protection, my =\r\nmind would\nnot get agitated.\n\nDesuramma alias Akhilandamma, who was serving=\r\n food for Bhagavan Ramana, was\nin due course, desiring to take up &#39;sannyasa=\r\n&#39; by wearing ochre robes. She\nwanted to have inititation by Bhagavan Ramana=\r\n, by one of the three methods\nmentioned in Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai,th=\r\nat is either by &#39;look&#39;, &#39;touch&#39;\nor through His thought. She narrated her in=\r\ntention to Chinnaswami, who said\nthat it would be difficult to\npersuade Bha=\r\ngavan Ramana in the matter, since He did not initiate anyone and\nfurther, e=\r\nven if He took an exception, many others like Echammal and\nKamakshi Ammal w=\r\nould also desire to have initiations by Him.\n\nAkhilandamma kept quiet for a=\r\n few months but she was eager to embrace\nsannyasa with initiation by Bhagav=\r\nan Ramana. One day she had a dream where\nBhagavan Ramana gave her vibhuti. =\r\nShe took this dream as a good omen, and\nthen made the white sari into an oc=\r\nhre sari by dipping it in the red dye,\ndried up the sari and kept it in a v=\r\nessel, closed it with a leaf and went to\nthe Asramam next morning. She was =\r\nscared as to how to go about further. She\nmerely kept the vessel in the pre=\r\nsence of Bhagavan Ramana and was waiting\nwith bated breath. Bhagavan Ramana=\r\n knew everything even without words. He\ncame to the Hall, opened the vessel=\r\n and looked at the robes, as if there was\nsome food, and then looked at Akh=\r\nilandamma.No one knew the implication. The\neyes that burnt Tripura and also=\r\n the karmas of devotees, the eyes of\nSiva-Ramana gave her inititation. Akhi=\r\nlandamma rushed back to her home and\ncame back to the Hall in the new attir=\r\ne!\n\nElsewhere in in Nageswara Rao=E2=80=99s account Akhilandamma recounts s=\r\nome of the\nincidents from Bhagavan=E2=80=99s early days on the hill when he=\r\n was harassed by\njealous sadhus. These have been well documented in other b=\r\nooks, but\nAkhilandamma adds a few details that I have not seen elsewhere. B=\r\nefore I\ngive her version of events, I should mention that many of these sto=\r\nries\nappeared in the first edition of Self Realization that came out around=\r\n 1930.\nBhagavan had not been shown the book prior to publication. When he s=\r\naw all\nthe stories about the hostile sadhus, he asked that they be removed =\r\nfrom the\nnext edition. He was not questioning the validity of the stories, =\r\nhe was, in\ncharacteristic fashion, trying to avoid causing offence to the p=\r\neople who\nhad given him so much trouble. He apparently said that many of th=\r\nese sadhus\nwere still alive and might be upset if they found their stories =\r\nin print.\nTowards the end of his life Bhagavan said that the accounts could=\r\n be\nrepublished because the sadhus had all passed away, and were therefore\n=\r\nbeyond taking offence. However, they were not included again until a few\nye=\r\nars ago when Sri Ramanasramam made a reprint of the first edition of Self\nR=\r\nealization that included all the original incidents.\n\nHere are Akhilandamma=\r\n=E2=80=99s sadhu stories:\n\nI found that Arunachala is the abode of sadhus, =\r\nand that among these there\nare both good and evil ones. In truth, the evil =\r\nfar outnumber the good. Even\nBhagavan Ramana had been severely molested by =\r\nthese devils of sadhus. Sri\nRamana himself treated us time and again to tho=\r\nse incidents, which he\nnarrated to us as interesting anecdotes. Now I shall=\r\n recall one or two of\nthem which still linger in my memory.\n\nBhagavan would=\r\n be surrounded by devotees and these would offer fruits to him\n=E2=80=93 a =\r\nglorious sight. But this became an eyesore to a sadhu from Kerala, who\nout =\r\nof sheer envy, rolled down a big boulder against Bhagavan and\nPalaniswami, =\r\nwho were seated at a lower lever on the hill.\n\nPalaniswami began to cry.\n\n=\r\n=E2=80=98What=E2=80=99s the matter, Palani? What has happened?=E2=80=99 enq=\r\nuired Bhagavan.\n\nThen Bhagavan discovered that the attack had badly cut one=\r\n of his toes, and\nthat it was bleeding.\n\n=E2=80=98Oh,=E2=80=99 said Bhagava=\r\nn, =E2=80=98is it for this that you are crying?=E2=80=99\n\nBhagavan then too=\r\nk the flesh that was hanging from his toe, restored it to\nits original plac=\r\ne, and stroked it a couple of times. How strange! By the\nnext day it had be=\r\ncome whole, without even leaving a scar.\n\nAt one time there was another sad=\r\nhu living in the same cave as Bhagavan. He\nwould tell all the devotees who =\r\ncame to see Bhagavan that he himself was\nBhagavan=E2=80=99s Guru, and he wo=\r\nuld gather into his own bag all the fruits and\ncoins that had been offered =\r\nto Bhagavan. This was too much for Palaniswami,\nwho rebelled against the ch=\r\neating sadhu.\n\nThe sadhu himself brought pressure on Bhagavan to drive out =\r\nPalani, but\nBhagavan paid no attention to his demands. The devil-sadhu, hav=\r\ning been\nrebuffed by both Palaniswami and Bhagavan, became enraged and spat=\r\n squarely\non Bhagavan=E2=80=99s face. Even that did not affect Bhagavan=E2=\r\n=80=99s silence or\ndemeanour.\n\nLater on a third sadhu appeared on the scene=\r\n. He was foolish enough to offer\nto pass on his spiritual energy to Bhagava=\r\nn. Bhagavan declined the sadhu=E2=80=99s\noffer, but despite this the sadhu =\r\nput his hand on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s head to effect\nthe transmission. The res=\r\nult? The foolish sadhu passed out and became\nunconsciousness.\n\nLast in this=\r\n list of stories is that of a sadhu from North India.Approaching\nBhagavan, =\r\nhe said, =E2=80=98I have come at the command of God himself to initiate\nyou=\r\n with the mantra of Lord Dattatreya, so you must take it.=E2=80=99\n\nBhagava=\r\nn, ever-resourceful, responded by saying, =E2=80=98Good! Let the same Lord\n=\r\nGod appear to me and direct me to take the mantra. Then I shall surely do\ni=\r\nt.=E2=80=99\n\nSources:\n\n1)\nhttp://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2008/06/a=\r\nkhilandamma-ganapati-muni-and-jealous.html\n2) Arunachala&#39;s Ramana Volume I\n=\r\n3) Sri Ramananubhavam.

Sent by that Iswara himself, Sri Ramana has come down to earth. =\r\nSo what can please Iswara more than devoted service to Sri Ramana? When you=\r\n recognise this secret, your fruit will increase all the more.=E2=80=99=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I have already acquainted you with the fact that my family was=\r\n very poor. We were always beset with economic difficulties. In addition to=\r\n this, there arose, at one time, differences in the family. Unable to bear =\r\nthat affliction, I came before Bhagavan, cried, and broke down I tears.=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan, after remaining silent for some time, opened his mou=\r\nth and kindly said, =E2=80=98Tesuramma [=E2=80=9CMother from Desur=E2=80=9D=\r\n, her village], you are under the impression that difficulties have come to=\r\n you alone. This life is a blend of pain and pleasure. One should have no e=\r\nlation when there is pleasure, and no dejection when there is pain. Take my=\r\n example. I came here at the age of seventeen. I had no mother or father he=\r\nre. I have spent my time in caves and under trees in sun, in showers, and i=\r\nn the cold. I begged alms to pacify my hunger. It is only nowadays that all=\r\n of you have come here to minister to my needs.=E2=80=99=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Still shedding tears, I said to Bhagavan in a=\r\n begging tone of voice, =E2=80=98You, Bhagavan, are an incarnation, so you =\r\ncan bear all that. But what about a woman like me? I have no one but you to=\r\n help me. You alone have to have compassion on me.=E2=80=99=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThese plaintive words moved Bhagavan, and his eyes became moist. After rema=\r\nining grave and serious for a while, slowly and steadily these supreme word=\r\ns emerged from his mouth: =E2=80=98Hereafter, remember me whenever you face=\r\n calamities.=E2=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;With these mighty words of grace ring=\r\ning in my heart, I came out of the cave, followed by Ganapati Muni.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n=E2=80=98Akhilandamma!=E2=80=99 he cried with great elation. =E2=80=98Your =\r\nvirtue has ripened. Bhagavan has bestowed a rare boon on you. Never before =\r\nhave I seen Bhagavan bestowing a boon like this. And this boon is for futur=\r\ne lives also. This day is one of extreme rejoicing for me, for the mighty p=\r\nower of conferring boons, till now hidden in Bhagavan, has now broken out f=\r\nor your sake. The hidden powers of a great and genuine Guru do not easily c=\r\nome out to work in the external world; they do so only for the sake of wort=\r\nhy disciples. The credit of drawing them out, pure lady, goes to you now.=\r\n=E2=80=99=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;It was really a b=\r\noon to me as my subsequent experience proved. When difficulties surrounded =\r\nme like threatening clouds, when life itself became a dungeon, I would utte=\r\nr =E2=80=98Lord Ramana, my Lord Ramana=E2=80=99, and call on his protection=\r\n and help. Then, in a trice, the difficulties would disappear. However seve=\r\nre the calamity, because of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s protection, my mind would no=\r\nt get agitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Desuramma alias Akhilandamma, who was servi=\r\nng food for Bhagavan Ramana, was in due course, desiring to take up &#39;sa=\r\nnnyasa&#39; by wearing ochre robes. She wanted to have inititation by Bhaga=\r\nvan Ramana, by one of the three methods mentioned in Arunachala Akshara Man=\r\na Malai,that is either by &#39;look&#39;, &#39;touch&#39; or through His th=\r\nought. She narrated her intention to Chinnaswami, who said that it would be=\r\n difficult to&lt;br&gt;\n\npersuade Bhagavan Ramana in the matter, since He did not=\r\n initiate anyone and further, even if He took an exception, many others lik=\r\ne Echammal and Kamakshi Ammal would also desire to have initiations by Him.=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Akhilandamma kept quiet for a few months but she was eager to=\r\n embrace sannyasa with initiation by Bhagavan Ramana. One day she had a dre=\r\nam where Bhagavan Ramana gave her vibhuti. She took this dream as a good om=\r\nen, and then made the white sari into an ochre sari by dipping it in the re=\r\nd dye, dried up the sari and kept it in a vessel, closed it with a leaf and=\r\n went to the Asramam next morning. She was scared as to how to go about fur=\r\nther. She merely kept the vessel in the presence of Bhagavan Ramana and was=\r\n waiting with bated breath. Bhagavan Ramana knew everything even without wo=\r\nrds. He came to the Hall, opened the vessel and looked at the robes, as if =\r\nthere was some food, and then looked at Akhilandamma.No one knew the implic=\r\nation. The eyes that burnt Tripura and also the karmas of devotees, the eye=\r\ns of Siva-Ramana gave her inititation. Akhilandamma rushed back to her home=\r\n and came back to the Hall in the new attire!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Elsewhere in in Nage=\r\nswara Rao=E2=80=99s account Akhilandamma recounts some of the incidents fro=\r\nm Bhagavan=E2=80=99s early days on the hill when he was harassed by jealous=\r\n sadhus. These have been well documented in other books, but Akhilandamma a=\r\ndds a few details that I have not seen elsewhere. Before I give her version=\r\n of events, I should mention that many of these stories appeared in the fir=\r\nst edition of Self Realization that came out around 1930. Bhagavan had not =\r\nbeen shown the book prior to publication. When he saw all the stories about=\r\n the hostile sadhus, he asked that they be removed from the next edition. H=\r\ne was not questioning the validity of the stories, he was, in characteristi=\r\nc fashion, trying to avoid causing offence to the people who had given him =\r\nso much trouble. He apparently said that many of these sadhus were still al=\r\nive and might be upset if they found their stories in print. Towards the en=\r\nd of his life Bhagavan said that the accounts could be republished because =\r\nthe sadhus had all passed away, and were therefore beyond taking offence. H=\r\nowever, they were not included again until a few years ago when Sri Ramanas=\r\nramam made a reprint of the first edition of Self Realization that included=\r\n all the original incidents.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Here=\r\n are Akhilandamma=E2=80=99s sadhu stories:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found that Aruna=\r\nchala is the abode of sadhus, and that among these there are both good and =\r\nevil ones. In truth, the evil far outnumber the good. Even Bhagavan Ramana =\r\nhad been severely molested by these devils of sadhus. Sri Ramana himself tr=\r\neated us time and again to those incidents, which he narrated to us as inte=\r\nresting anecdotes. Now I shall recall one or two of them which still linger=\r\n in my memory.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan would be surrounded by devotees and =\r\nthese would offer fruits to him =E2=80=93 a glorious sight. But this became=\r\n an eyesore to a sadhu from Kerala, who out of sheer envy, rolled down a bi=\r\ng boulder against Bhagavan and Palaniswami, who were seated at a lower leve=\r\nr on the hill.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Palaniswami began to cry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98Wha=\r\nt=E2=80=99s the matter, Palani? What has happened?=E2=80=99 enquired Bhagav=\r\nan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Bhagavan discovered that the attack had badly cut one of hi=\r\ns toes, and that it was bleeding.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98Oh,=E2=80=99 said B=\r\nhagavan, =E2=80=98is it for this that you are crying?=E2=80=99=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Bhagavan then took the flesh that was hanging from his toe, restored it =\r\nto its original place, and stroked it a couple of times. How strange! By th=\r\ne next day it had become whole, without even leaving a scar.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nAt one time there was another sadhu living in the same cave as Bhagavan. He=\r\n would tell all the devotees who came to see Bhagavan that he himself was B=\r\nhagavan=E2=80=99s Guru, and he would gather into his own bag all the fruits=\r\n and coins that had been offered to Bhagavan. This was too much for Palanis=\r\nwami, who rebelled against the cheating sadhu.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The sadhu him=\r\nself brought pressure on Bhagavan to drive out Palani, but Bhagavan paid no=\r\n attention to his demands. The devil-sadhu, having been rebuffed by both Pa=\r\nlaniswami and Bhagavan, became enraged and spat squarely on Bhagavan=E2=80=\r\n=99s face. Even that did not affect Bhagavan=E2=80=99s silence or demeanour=\r\n.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Later on a third sadhu appeared on the scene. He was fooli=\r\nsh enough to offer to pass on his spiritual energy to Bhagavan. Bhagavan de=\r\nclined the sadhu=E2=80=99s offer, but despite this the sadhu put his hand o=\r\nn Bhagavan=E2=80=99s head to effect the transmission. The result? The fooli=\r\nsh sadhu passed out and became unconsciousness.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Last in this=\r\n list of stories is that of a sadhu from North India.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;Approaching Bhagavan, he said, =E2=80=98I have come at the comma=\r\nnd of God himself to initiate you with the mantra of Lord Dattatreya, so yo=\r\nu must take it.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan, ever-resourceful, responded by =\r\nsaying, =E2=80=98Good! Let the same Lord God appear to me and direct me to =\r\ntake the mantra. Then I shall surely do it.=E2=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sources:=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2008/06/akhilandamma-ganapati-muni-and-j=\r\nealous.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2008=\r\n/06/akhilandamma-ganapati-muni-and-jealous.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n2) Arunachala&#39;s=\r\n Ramana Volume I&lt;br&gt;\n3) Sri Ramananubhavam.
