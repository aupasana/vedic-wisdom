The nature of Universe or the e=\r\nxpression of consciousness (Divine Mother) is constant change / progress. S=\r\no the body has to die and soul housed in a new form as time progresses. All=\r\n Rishis / Naths do not live for ever in the same material body as ours. Eit=\r\nher their body is transformed or they will have to lose their body after so=\r\nme time. By power of yoga one can prolong existing body into several centur=\r\nies or even few thousand years, but that body will still be mortal. The nec=\r\nessary condition for that is the matter that forms the body regaining its c=\r\nonsciousness and becomes totally fluid  - a body of light can be immortal a=\r\ns it can modify itself as per the flow of the guiding consciousness. So the=\r\nre will not be a necessity to break that form and create another new form. =\r\nIt can simply transform. That is the essense (atleast in my understanding) =\r\nof what Sri Aurobindo refers to as physical immortality. He and the Mother =\r\nhave explained it more clearly in some other places but I am not able to fi=\r\nnd it now. \n\nAs per Sri Aurobindo, there has been few being who might have =\r\nattained Supramental descent and even partial transformation personally but=\r\n not the full supramental transformation. Besides, as per him, unless the t=\r\nransformation is collective, individual transformation is not perfect. \n\nSu=\r\npramental transformation is a state beyond Sahaja Samadhi. In Sahaja Samadh=\r\ni, one consciously functions from a state of Brahman, but body still is unc=\r\nonscious for most part, subject to laws of nature and they remain mostly de=\r\ntached from the body consciousness (Eg. Ramana Maharishi). A person in Saha=\r\nja Samadhi is like a deity that can walk and talk. His/her body will also b=\r\ne transformed to some extent to host the immense shakthi and vibration of t=\r\nhe enlightened person, but that is a far cry from what Sri Aurobindo calls =\r\nas Supramental transformation. \n\nHowever, in Supramental transformation, th=\r\ne matter of the body _also_ is transformed to express the Sat-Chit-Ananda c=\r\nonsciousness. There are lots of other things too other than body transforma=\r\ntion. \n\nIf you have time and are interested, I would suggest you read &quot;Sri =\r\nAurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness&quot; by Satprem. It is a not a larg=\r\ne book but may take a loong time to read and assimilate. It very lucidly an=\r\nd clearly delineates different stages of consciousness from a very practica=\r\nl standpoint, starting with body consciousness to vital, mental, intellectu=\r\nal and higher regions of consciousness. It is a unique biography which deal=\r\ns not with mundane life details of the subject, but his journey through con=\r\nsciousness and while doing that explains various finer stages and aspects o=\r\nf consciousness to the reader. If Spiritual biographies of other Masters ar=\r\ne written in that way, it would be amazing. \n\nWhat ever I said on this topi=\r\nc is _very crude_ and does not do justice to the topic at all. I really mea=\r\nn it. I have oversimplified for the sake of the post. This topic needs a ve=\r\nry subtle and sublime treatment  stemming at least in part from correspondi=\r\nng inner experiences & realizations which I am not capable of at present. T=\r\nhe best I can do is point to those that have done it. Once &quot;Sri Aurobindo o=\r\nr adventure of Consciousness&quot; is read, then all of Sri Aurobindo&#39;s works an=\r\nd what he says about Supramental descent and transformation can be comprehe=\r\nnded more easily.  Alternately one can start with the works of M.P. Pandit =\r\nas well. Shri. Pandit&#39;s writings are very lucid, profound and illuminating.=\r\n\n\nBTW, I read with interest your thread &quot;Rama Nam Satha Hai&quot;.

Immediately upon my\n&gt; &gt; arriva=\r\nl I was struck by the spiritual atmosphere of the place. On August\n&gt; &gt; 15th=\r\n of that year, I had my first darshan of Sri Aurobindo. This was one of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n three times in a year that he gave darshan. I found Sri Aurobindo and Moth=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; to be powerful spiritual personalities, as they seemed to have the a=\r\nbility\n&gt; &gt; to work on the development of their disciples in a silent and in=\r\nvisible\n&gt; &gt; manner. All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings cannot convey=\r\n his or the\n&gt; &gt; Mother&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While I w=\r\nas in Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed\n&gt; &gt; disciple of=\r\n both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then\n&gt; &gt; visiting Sri =\r\nRamanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharshi and his\n&gt; &gt; ashrama. His=\r\n intriguing descriptions, along with the reading of B. V.\n&gt; &gt; Narasimhaswam=\r\ni&#39; s biography of the Maharshi, is what prompted my first visit\n&gt; &gt; to Rama=\r\nnasramam in 1933.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Before this second visit to Ramanasramam I once =\r\nagain read Bhagavan&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; biography. In it I found a passage relating to th=\r\ne possibility of changing\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s guru. I had a doubt about this and addr=\r\nessed it to the Maharshi. He\n&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Yes. Certainly. One can change h=\r\nis guru. What of that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a =\r\nlarge extent, was regulated and\n&gt; &gt; controlled. For instance, even to take =\r\na simple trip into town we had to\n&gt; &gt; obtain permission. In contrast, here =\r\nin Ramanasramam it was totally\n&gt; &gt; different. I experienced a liberating fe=\r\neling of freedom, informality and\n&gt; &gt; spontaneity. Everything was so natura=\r\nl and at the same time elevating.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disc=\r\niples were generally permitted to visit all\n&gt; &gt; other saints and ashramas, =\r\nwith the exception of the Maharshi and Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ramanasramam. It was believe=\r\nd that the Maharshi had the power to undo years\n&gt; &gt; of spiritual preparatio=\r\nn that the Mother and Aurobindo were effecting on the\n&gt; &gt; psyche of their f=\r\nollowers. In other words, they considered the Maharshi too\n&gt; &gt; powerful an =\r\ninfluence. Bhagavan was aware of this and once when I was alone\n&gt; &gt; with hi=\r\nm he told me, &quot;Yes, I know of that place. They are afraid of me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nLeaving Aurobindo Ashram\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had been with the Mother and Aurobindo =\r\nfor five years. During those years\n&gt; &gt; they showered me with kindness and l=\r\nove, while guiding me on the spiritual\n&gt; &gt; path. My gratitude and regard fo=\r\nr them compelled me to obtain their\n&gt; &gt; permission and blessings before lea=\r\nving. This turned out to be much more\n&gt; &gt; difficult than I imagined.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; In Aurobindo Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples who had doubts=\r\n or\n&gt; &gt; questions to write them in the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. A=\r\nll the\n&gt; &gt; letters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, who would s=\r\nit with the\n&gt; &gt; Mother during the nights and promptly answer them in writin=\r\ng. Sometimes we\n&gt; &gt; would see the lights burning all night as they were eng=\r\naged in this work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Upon my return from Ramanasramam I wrote a lett=\r\ner stating my desire to\n&gt; &gt; receive their blessings and permission to live =\r\nat Ramanasramam. In the\n&gt; &gt; letter to Aurobindo I wrote that since your yog=\r\na begins with\n&gt; &gt; Self-realization, kindly permit me to go to Ramana Mahars=\r\nhi who emphasizes\n&gt; &gt; only Self-realization, a state I have not attained, o=\r\nr may not even be\n&gt; &gt; worthy of attaining. Aurobindo&#39;s reply was affectiona=\r\nte, but negative in\n&gt; &gt; regards to my leaving his ashram. He wrote, &quot;Both S=\r\nelf-realization and the\n&gt; &gt; supra-mental state can be simultaneously develo=\r\nped and achieved here. There\n&gt; &gt; is no need for you to go there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI was extremely disappointed at his response and consequently became\n&gt; &gt; fr=\r\nustrated, restless and discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; and felt distraught. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the =\r\nsame\n&gt; &gt; request. Again I was denied permission. It took a long five months=\r\n and a\n&gt; &gt; third letter before Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giv=\r\ning me their\n&gt; &gt; permission and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was dete=\r\nrmined to go and\n&gt; &gt; they saw no other recourse but to grant my request.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final letter to me he wrote, &quot;Since you are determine=\r\nd to\n&gt; &gt; follow a path in which you can achieve only partial realization, w=\r\ne give you\n&gt; &gt; our blessings, though we believe it would be better if you s=\r\ntayed on here\n&gt; &gt; and pursued your sadhana where both the Mother and I can =\r\nhelp you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was the rule in Aurobindo Ashram that any letter wri=\r\ntten to or received\n&gt; &gt; from Aurobindo should not leave the ashram premises=\r\n. So, to comply with this\n&gt; &gt; rule, I burnt all my letters, except the fina=\r\nl letter I received from\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo. This I kept with the view of showin=\r\ng it to Bhagavan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Settling at Sri Ramanasramam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During the=\r\n early years there were no houses anywhere near the ashram, as it\n&gt; &gt; was m=\r\nostly jungle or forest. I eventually found an upstairs room in a\n&gt; &gt; brahmi=\r\nn&#39;s house near the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would\n&gt; &gt; some=\r\ntimes cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n outside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daily=\r\n I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in the\n&gt; &gt; hal=\r\nl with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back again to the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on like this during =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; first year. If possible, I would always sit close to Bhagavan so I =\r\ncould\n&gt; &gt; hear all of his precious utterances.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S. S. Cohen, after =\r\nrepeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decided that the\n&gt; &gt; Yogi from Pond=\r\nicherry must have some greatness. Consequently, one day he\n&gt; &gt; travelled to=\r\n Pondicherry and while there wrote a note to Aurobindo\n&gt; &gt; describing who h=\r\ne was, what he wanted from life (Self-realization) and where\n&gt; &gt; he was the=\r\nn residing (Sri Ramanasramam) . Cohen later showed me the reply he\n&gt; &gt; got =\r\nfrom Aurobindo. It said, in brief, that all his aspirations could be\n&gt; &gt; fu=\r\nlfilled at Sri Ramanasramam, where he was then living.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I remember =\r\nduring my second visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day\n&gt; &gt; reading=\r\n a lengthy book review from a newspaper. The book being reviewed was\n&gt; &gt; Au=\r\nrobindo&#39;s Lights on Yoga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; this newspaper was Bhagavan&#39;s devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed to=\r\n take\n&gt; &gt; great interest in the review and would occasionally stop reading =\r\nand comment\n&gt; &gt; on what he had just read to those sitting around him. When =\r\nhe had concluded\n&gt; &gt; reading it, someone who was aware that I had that very=\r\n book with me, said to\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan, &quot;This man has come from the Aurobindo =\r\nAshram and he has that book\n&gt; &gt; with him.&quot; Bhagavan turned to me and said, =\r\n&quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have a\n&gt; &gt; look at it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I went back to my =\r\nroom, fetched the book and handed it over to Bhagavan.\n&gt; &gt; Immediately Bhag=\r\navan began reading it intently. He kept on reading it well\n&gt; &gt; into the nig=\r\nht, with the help of a small oil lamp, until he finished it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When =\r\nI came into the hall the next day he began discussing the book with me,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n telling me that a certain term used in the book might look like something\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; new, but it is actually the equivalent of this other term used in such =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; such ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussing and compar=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly underst=\r\nood\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy both intellectually and also from the standp=\r\noint of\n&gt; &gt; experience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One evening I said to Bhagavan that the ma=\r\njor attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; teachings is that it professes that immor=\r\ntality of the body can be achieved.\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan made no comment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe next day, as soon as I walked into the hall and sat down, Bhagavan\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlooked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakonam there was one yogi, C. V. V.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Rao, who was proclaiming to all, his doctrine of the immortality of th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; body. He was even so bold as to declare that Dr. Annie Besant (a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndistinguished public and spiritual personality in India) would have to come=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; to him to learn how to make her body immortal. But, before he had a ch=\r\nance\n&gt; &gt; to meet Dr. Annie Besant, he died.&quot; This brief story clearly illus=\r\ntrated his\n&gt; &gt; point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On another day, not too long after settling =\r\nnear Sri Ramanasramam, I\n&gt; &gt; approached Bhagavan when no one was in the hal=\r\nl and showed him that last\n&gt; &gt; letter I had received from Aurobindo. Bhagav=\r\nan asked me to give it to him to\n&gt; &gt; read. I told him he would be unable to=\r\n decipher Aurobindo&#39;s handwriting, as\n&gt; &gt; it was very illegible and only th=\r\nose who have studied it for sometime could\n&gt; &gt; read it. He said, &quot;Give it t=\r\no me. Let me try.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After looking into it and realizing he could on=\r\nly make out a few words, he\n&gt; &gt; returned it and asked me to read it out. I =\r\nbegan reading it and when I came\n&gt; &gt; to the sentence, &quot;Since you are determ=\r\nined to follow a path in which you can\n&gt; &gt; achieve only partial realization=\r\n . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me and said,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Partial realization? If it is p=\r\nartial, it is not realization, and if it is\n&gt; &gt; realization, it is not part=\r\nial.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This was the final blow that silenced all my doubts. I then =\r\ndestroyed this\n&gt; &gt; letter, like all the rest. And because of all the discus=\r\nsions I had had with\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan I soon felt perfectly established in his =\r\nteachings, having a clear\n&gt; &gt; understanding of where the Maharshi&#39;s path an=\r\nd Aurobindo&#39;s path diverged and\n&gt; &gt; went different ways. When all the cloud=\r\ns of doubts and distractions\n&gt; &gt; dispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagava=\r\nn then knew that I understood and\n&gt; &gt; the foundation work had been done. Th=\r\ne purpose of all our discussions were\n&gt; &gt; served and so they stopped automa=\r\ntically.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe the most unique characteristic of Bhagavan was =\r\nthe power of his\n&gt; &gt; presence. Much of what he taught had already been tran=\r\nsmitted to the masses\n&gt; &gt; down through the ages. In Bhagavan we found a bei=\r\nng that was surcharged with\n&gt; &gt; the Reality to such an extent that coming i=\r\nnto his presence would effect a\n&gt; &gt; dramatic change in us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sources=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a) http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Dmay-jun\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; b) http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Dmar-apr\n&gt; &gt; c) ht=\r\ntp://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Djul-aug\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=D1=80=E2=96`&quot;=D1=80=E2=96`=D0&#39; =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B8=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BE=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9B =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BD=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=A7=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=\r\n=A1=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=97 =D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=90 =D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96`=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B3=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=\r\n=BF\n&gt; &gt; =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BA=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96`=D0&#39;=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=AC=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96&quot;=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=\r\n=95=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0&#39;=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=\r\n=96`=D1=80=E2=96`=D0&#39;\n&gt; &gt; =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BA=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=97=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=97 =D1=80=\r\n=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=\r\n=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A1=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96&#39;=D0`\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Your Mail works best with t=\r\nhe New Yahoo Optimized IE8.
