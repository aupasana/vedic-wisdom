If one uses years, months and days *consistently*, all year=\r\ns should start with a particular month and end with particular month and al=\r\nl months should start with a particular day and end with a particular day.\n=\r\n\nBut that is broken if one mixes tithis (lunar days or rather soli-lunar da=\r\nys) with months of souramaana. One month may start on Sukla Ashtami and ano=\r\nther month on Sukla Chaturthi. How logical is that?\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\n\n\nEven=\r\n the chaandramana calculations we follow today may be imperfect.\n\nFor examp=\r\nle, ask a simple question: Why were the twelve months named that way?\n\nChai=\r\ntra month starts when Moon and Sun are together in Meena (Poorvabhadra 4th =\r\npada, Uttarabhadra, Revati). Why is it named Chaitra? Vaisakha month starts=\r\n when Moon and Sun are together in Mesha (Aswini, Bharani, Krittika 1st pad=\r\na). Why is it named Vaisakha? Jyeshtha month starts when Moon and Sun are t=\r\nogether in Vrishabha (Krittika 2nd, 3rd and 4th padas, Rohini, Mrigasira 1s=\r\nt and 2nd padas). Why is it named Jyeshtha?\n\nIf you look carefully, the nam=\r\nes of the months are based on stars (Chita-Chaitra, Visakha-Vaisakha, Jyesh=\r\ntha-Jyeshtha etc). Starting from Chitra, 12 out of 27 stars are picked for =\r\nthe names of months. At the time of Full Moon in Chaitra month, Moon moves =\r\nby 180 degrees compared to where he was at the beginning of the month (Meen=\r\na) and is around Chitra star. At the time of Full Moon in Vaisakha month, M=\r\noon moves by 180 degrees compared to where he was at the beginning of the m=\r\nonth (Mesha) and is around Visakha star. And so on.\n\nIt is logical to guess=\r\n that the zodiac was divided into 12 equal parts (not necessarily aligned t=\r\no the twelve rasis) and the name of a month is decided based on the star oc=\r\ncupied by Moon at the middle of the month, i.e. at the time of Full Moon. A=\r\n prominent star was chosen in the twelve equal parts and the month was name=\r\nd based on it.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nMooladhara chakra is in the middle of the=\r\n body and it is the basis of our existence. The chakras at the top of the h=\r\nead or the bottom of the feet are not taken as the base. In astrology, zodi=\r\nac is decided by the Chitra star, i.e. Chitra star is perfectly aligned to =\r\nthe *middle* of the zodiac. We do not fix the beginning of the zodiac by th=\r\ne exact location of Aswini star, but by taking 180 degrees from the exact l=\r\nocation of Chitra star. Similarly, it is possible that a month is named bas=\r\ned on the star occupied at the *middle* of the month rather than the beginn=\r\ning.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nWhen the current month started as per soli-lunar (cha=\r\nandramaana) calendar on January 15, Sun and Moon were in Capricorn. So it i=\r\ns called &quot;Maagha maasa&quot; based on current conventions.\n\nHowever, Pournima of=\r\n that month is running right now and Moon is in the 2nd pada of Pushya star=\r\n right now. He is far from Magha star. Is this really Maagha Pournima as pe=\r\nople think?\n\nMy personal view is that it is Pushya Pournima right now and F=\r\neb 11 is Pushya Krishna Chaturdasi and not MahaaShivaraatri.\n\nWhen a new mo=\r\nnth as per Chaandramaana starts on February 13, people consider it as Phalg=\r\nuna maasa because Moon and Sun are in Kumbha. But the next Pournima on Febr=\r\nuary 28 coincides with Magha nakshatra. I suggest that THAT is the real Maa=\r\ngha Pournima. So March 13 is the Maagha Krishna Chaturdasi, i.e. MahaaShiva=\r\nraatri.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nBottomline: I agree with the conclusion of sourama=\r\nana proponents this particular time, but for a different reason compared to=\r\n theirs. I respectfully suggest that we are all lacking in our understandin=\r\ng of the correct calendar used with tithi based festivals. We celebrate fes=\r\ntivals on the correct days most of the times, but make mistakes now and the=\r\nn. Some misunderstandings still need to be corrected.\n\nGood thing is that t=\r\nhe knowledge of rishis is self-revealing and self-correcting. If one is sin=\r\ncere and applies oneself, one can find the answers.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimh=\r\na\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n=C2=\r\n=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films =\r\nthat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish wri=\r\ntings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n\n--- On Thu, 1/28/10, msr_2_1=\r\n4_2001 &lt;abhayambika@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: msr_2_14_2001 &lt;abhayambika@gmai=\r\nl.com&gt;\nSubject: [sivacharya] Re: When do we observe the =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=\r\n=93Maha Sivarathri=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=EF=BF=BD, is it on February 12 or March 1=\r\n3th?\nTo: sivacharya@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Thursday, January 28, 2010, 6:40 =\r\nPM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n\n\n\nRespected Devotees,\n\n=\r\n\n\nnamashshivaaya \n\n\n\nMost smaarta-s observe this based on puraaNa-s.

If one uses years, mont=\r\nhs and days *consistently*, all years should start with a particular month =\r\nand end with particular month and all months should start with a particular=\r\n day and end with a particular day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that is broken if one mixes =\r\ntithis (lunar days or rather soli-lunar days) with months of souramaana. On=\r\ne month may start on Sukla Ashtami and another month on Sukla Chaturthi. Ho=\r\nw logical is that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEven the chaandramana cal=\r\nculations we follow today may be imperfect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, ask a simpl=\r\ne question: Why were the twelve months named that way?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chaitra month=\r\n starts when Moon and Sun are together in Meena (Poorvabhadra 4th pada, Utt=\r\narabhadra, Revati). Why is it named Chaitra? Vaisakha month starts when Moo=\r\nn and Sun are together in Mesha (Aswini, Bharani, Krittika 1st pada). Why i=\r\ns it named Vaisakha? Jyeshtha month starts when Moon and Sun are together i=\r\nn Vrishabha (Krittika 2nd, 3rd and 4th padas, Rohini, Mrigasira 1st and 2nd=\r\n padas). Why is it named Jyeshtha?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you look carefully, the names =\r\nof the months are based on stars (Chita-Chaitra, Visakha-Vaisakha, Jyeshtha=\r\n-Jyeshtha etc). Starting from Chitra, 12 out of 27 stars are picked for the=\r\n names of months. At the time of Full Moon in Chaitra month, Moon moves by =\r\n180 degrees compared to where he was at the beginning of the month (Meena) =\r\nand is around Chitra star. At the time of\n Full Moon in Vaisakha month, Moo=\r\nn moves by 180 degrees compared to where he was at the beginning of the mon=\r\nth (Mesha) and is around Visakha star. And so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is logical to g=\r\nuess that the zodiac was divided into 12 equal parts (not necessarily align=\r\ned to the twelve rasis) and the name of a month is decided based on the sta=\r\nr occupied by Moon at the middle of the month, i.e. at the time of Full Moo=\r\nn. A prominent star was chosen in the twelve equal parts and the month was =\r\nnamed based on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mooladhara chakra is in the=\r\n middle of the body and it is the basis of our existence. The chakras at th=\r\ne top of the head or the bottom of the feet are not taken as the base. In a=\r\nstrology, zodiac is decided by the Chitra star, i.e. Chitra star is perfect=\r\nly aligned to the *middle* of the zodiac. We do not fix the beginning of th=\r\ne zodiac by the exact location of\n Aswini star, but by taking 180 degrees f=\r\nrom the exact location of Chitra star. Similarly, it is possible that a mon=\r\nth is named based on the star occupied at the *middle* of the month rather =\r\nthan the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the current month sta=\r\nrted as per soli-lunar (chaandramaana) calendar on January 15, Sun and Moon=\r\n were in Capricorn. So it is called &quot;Maagha maasa&quot; based on current convent=\r\nions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Pournima of that month is running right now and Moon =\r\nis in the 2nd pada of Pushya star right now. He is far from Magha star. Is =\r\nthis really Maagha Pournima as people think?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My personal view is tha=\r\nt it is Pushya Pournima right now and Feb 11 is Pushya Krishna Chaturdasi a=\r\nnd not MahaaShivaraatri.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a new month as per Chaandramaana start=\r\ns on February 13, people consider it as Phalguna maasa because Moon and Sun=\r\n are in Kumbha. But the\n next Pournima on February 28 coincides with Magha =\r\nnakshatra. I suggest that THAT is the real Maagha Pournima. So March 13 is =\r\nthe Maagha Krishna Chaturdasi, i.e. MahaaShivaraatri.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottomline: I agree with the conclusion of souramaana proponents th=\r\nis particular time, but for a different reason compared to theirs. I respec=\r\ntfully suggest that we are all lacking in our understanding of the correct =\r\ncalendar used with tithi based festivals. We celebrate festivals on the cor=\r\nrect days most of the times, but make mistakes now and then. Some misunders=\r\ntandings still need to be corrected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good thing is that the knowledg=\r\ne of rishis is self-revealing and self-correcting. If one is sincere and ap=\r\nplies oneself, one can find the answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp; Free\n Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;br&gt;--=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--=\r\n- On &lt;b&gt;Thu, 1/28/10, msr_2_14_2001 &lt;i&gt;&lt;abhayambika@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b=\r\n&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); m=\r\nargin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: msr_2_14_2001 &lt;abhayambika@gm=\r\nail.com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [sivacharya] Re: When do we observe the =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=93Maha Sivarathri=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=EF=BF=BD, is it on February 12 o=\r\nr March 13th?&lt;br&gt;To:\n sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Thursday, January=\r\n 28, 2010, 6:40 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1990838120&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;di=\r\nsplay: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n   =\r\n   &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRespected Devotees,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nnamashshivaaya &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMost =\r\nsmaarta-s observe this based on puraaNa-s.
