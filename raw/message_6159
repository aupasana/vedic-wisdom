I have already impleme=\r\nnted some of the recommendations you made, most importantly the mantra &quot;Gan=\r\nanam Tva Ganapatim HAVAMAHE&quot; from your jyotish lectures back in 2004/2005! =\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In the recent times I was pondering about how north Indians spe=\r\nak Hindi, where they reduce most of the words to &quot;Halanthas&quot;, like &quot;Shiv&quot;, =\r\n&quot;Ram&quot;, &quot;Krishn&quot; and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit=\r\n that a consonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by the Vowel=\r\n. But for whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They ca=\r\nrry that habit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the N=\r\north Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bh=\r\naja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, =\r\nwhich sounded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages lik=\r\ne Braj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manas=\r\na&quot; is more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadh=\r\ni also without proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that,=\r\n that approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana Sar=\r\noja\n&gt;  raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Guruc=\r\nharan saroj raj&quot;. You may shed more light on this aspect as well. \n&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; --- On Thu, 4/7/11, aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; From: aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Co=\r\nmmon Sanskrit Pronunciation Errors (Part 1)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\n&gt; Date: Thursday, April 7, 2011, 11:34 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &quot;&quot;If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry and just ignore this idio=\r\nt!&quot;&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear narasimha guruji \n&gt; \n&gt; you are doing a great job to this uni=\r\nverse by sharing your knwledge\n&gt; and correcting,but you are tooooo humble!!=\r\n!.Truth ia truth and what ever you are saying is also truth .no need to con=\r\nsider yourself as an idiot\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Naras=\r\nimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa once said that even Vedas are corrupted these days. It is the=\r\n nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is my feeling that =\r\nmany people, including highly learned Vedic scholars, pronounce some sounds=\r\n in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantras) incorrectly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of cour=\r\nse, pronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the spirit of surr=\r\nender to god is even more important. However, pronunciation is a factor too=\r\n. Especially, correct pronunciation is very important in Veda mantras. Wron=\r\ng pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the most complete experi=\r\nence of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who can memorize and r=\r\nepeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I will write my views on correct pronuncia=\r\ntion and point out some common errors. If you do not think that correct pro=\r\nnunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment of the errors=\r\n or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please ignore my writi=\r\nngs on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to changing your pr=\r\nonunciation, please give a consideration to my views and adopt my suggestio=\r\nns if you find them appropriate.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound=\r\n at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat=\r\n&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. They cha=\r\nnge &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason=\r\n why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption nevertheles=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/aksh=\r\nara. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at t=\r\nhe end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, cha=\r\nnges the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still experience so=\r\nmething when meditating on the mantra, but you will never experience the ma=\r\nntra to the fullest with that pronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Akshara means &quot;unperi=\r\nshed&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you ha=\r\nve just a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is =\r\nkshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; a=\r\ns is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and th=\r\ne listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life forc=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Becau=\r\nse &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which=\r\n has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chh=\r\nandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat=\r\n&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you =\r\nsaid &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully, b=\r\nut otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt trans=\r\nient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This makes=\r\n people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other v=\r\nowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes=\r\n clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; s=\r\no that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that =\r\nhis students would not get confused when learning. Probably the students th=\r\nought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-p=\r\nronunciation. Probably, that became a standard practice after a couple of c=\r\nenturies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not cha=\r\nnge it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and =\r\nleave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the end. The =\r\nsame thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I =\r\nsaid about words ending in consonants applies to all consonants and not jus=\r\nt &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. There can be words that end=\r\n in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people normally add an artificial vowe=\r\nl sound at the end and end up changing the chhandas and altering the flow o=\r\nf energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One mor=\r\ne common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south =\r\nIndians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Ka=\r\nnnada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks very similar and just one d=\r\not in the middle is different. It is possible that some people started misp=\r\nronouncing this sound because of their inability to see the dot and others =\r\nstarted following. Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pro=\r\nnouncing correctly will be the odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not Eng=\r\nlish. We never have two different symbols for the same sound or two differe=\r\nnt sounds for the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different an=\r\nd their sounds are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;=\r\ntaamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =\r\n=3D story).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharma=\r\nartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for =\r\nattaining the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilli=\r\nng duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (=\r\ndeveloping detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama =\r\nmoksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and =\r\nmoksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; mean=\r\ns &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I=\r\n have seen it committed by many many trained priests!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you rea=\r\nd Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the difference betw=\r\neen &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. When you see &quot;=\r\ntha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure that you are not=\r\n confusing tha for dha.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are several other mis=\r\ntakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in the pronunciation of San=\r\nskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the next few months, w=\r\nhenever the Mother allows me to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please give me your consideration=\r\n and take my input into consideration in altering your pronunciation (if yo=\r\nu are open to that). If you don&#39;t find any sense in what I am saying or wan=\r\nt to continue as taught by your gurus, I can understand that. I am not here=\r\n to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, because She inspired me to share=\r\n my thoughts with the world, I am guessing that there are SOME who are dest=\r\nined to change their pronunciation based on my views. That is why I am writ=\r\ning these mails.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry an=\r\nd just ignore this idiot!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Y=\r\nourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedi=\r\ncastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaga=\r\nnnath.org\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
