It is, in other words, the upanisha=\r\ndic life. It is the life of renunciation. It is the last of the four ashram=\r\nas. In none of these stages should a person grasp at the duties of the othe=\r\nr three. He should stick to the dharma of his own particular ashrama.\n\n=E2=\r\n=80=9CAhimsa paramo dharmah=E2=80=9D cannot be strictly practiced by househ=\r\nolders. It can be practiced by sannyasins who tread the nivritti marga.Real=\r\n sannyasins do not defend themselves even when their lives are in danger, b=\r\necause, they know that existence is in reality changeless. A sannyasin is o=\r\nne who has no body, and who identifies himself with Brahman or the atman. \n=\r\n\n\n"}}
