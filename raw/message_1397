Not every person can renounce. Not every person can perform rituals. Not =\r\nevery person can read scriptures. Not every person can contemplate the teac=\r\nhings of scriptures. Not every person can visit temples.\n \nDifferent people=\r\n have different duties given by Nature as a result of previous samskaras of=\r\n the person. One needs to find out and fulfil the duties with as little att=\r\nachment and ego as possible.\n \nPre-existing karmik debts of some may make i=\r\nt their dharma to make a lot of money and use it for some good causes. That=\r\n may require bribing or lying.\n \nThat itself is not a great sin. We all do =\r\nmany sins.\n \nOne of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas, Surendra Nath Mitra,=\r\n worked at a British merchant firm and was a rich man in Calcutta. He was o=\r\nne of the providers of Ramakrishna and the land where Belur Math was starte=\r\nd was bought with the money he had donated. When he was confused, Ramakrish=\r\nna told him:\n \n&quot;The renunciation of &#39;lust and gold&#39; is for sannyasins. It i=\r\ns not for you. Now and then you should go into solitude and call on God wit=\r\nh a yearning heart. Your renunciation should be mental.\n&quot;For you, like Chai=\r\ntanya said, the disciplines to be practised are kindness to living beings, =\r\nservice to the devotees, and chanting the name of God.\n&quot;Why do I say all th=\r\nis to you? You work in a merchant&#39;s office. I say this to you because you h=\r\nave many duties to perform there.\n&quot;You tell lies at the office. Then why do=\r\n I eat the food you offer me? Because you give money in charity; you give a=\r\nway more than you earn. &#39;The seed of the melon is bigger than the fruit,&#39; a=\r\ns the saying goes.\n&quot;I cannot eat anything offered by miserly people. Their =\r\nwealth is squandered in these ways: first, litigation; second, thieves and =\r\nrobbers; third, physicians; fourth, their wicked children&#39;s extravagance. I=\r\nt is like that.&quot;\n \nRamakrishna told Surendra to remember the Mother in all =\r\nhis activities and offer all his activities to Her mentally. He also told h=\r\nim to always give in charity.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSimilarly, if your jo=\r\nb requires you to lie or give bribes, don&#39;t worry about it. If that job is =\r\nneeded for fulfilling your dharma towards self or family or world, do what =\r\nis needed. However, minimize selfishness. Do things for others. Do it for y=\r\nour family and for the society in general. Instead of using all the money f=\r\nor yourself or your family, be generous and donate some to the needy. Also =\r\ndonate some to devotees and saintly people and serve them. The lying and br=\r\nibes and earning good money (which your samskaras are pulling you to do) wi=\r\nll be worthwhile then.\n \n&gt; Some say to grow one has to do that. Some say to=\r\n survive one\n&gt; has to give. So I am wondering what the correct way should b=\r\ne.\n \nIf you do it to survive, survive and do good deeds. If you do it to gr=\r\now, grow and make sure that some unselfiish dharma around you also grows al=\r\nong with you.\n \nNothing is good or bad per se.  How you do it and what fram=\r\ne of mind you do it with is more important than what you do.\n \nAt the end o=\r\nf the day, there is some good and bad and they balance out. The trick is to=\r\n find the right balance.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs you engage in various a=\r\nctivities related to the job, mentally offer them to the Divine Mother. Thi=\r\ns will eventually fill the mind with devotive energy even in the middle of =\r\nmundane activities. If you are ashamed to do something, you better not do i=\r\nt. If there is justification for something and you are clear in your mind w=\r\nhy you are doing it, then you should not be ashamed of it and you should be=\r\n able to offer it to the Mother. So offer all your activities to the Mother=\r\n mentally as you do them. If you get into this practice, it will make your =\r\nmind more confident and calm and increase devotion.\n \n*        *        *\n =\r\n\nPeople depending on your for their food etc will also get a part of your k=\r\narma. So your wife and children will get some part of that karma.\n \nHowever=\r\n, if you engage in the activities with love, devotion and a calm mind and p=\r\nut a part of the money to good unselfish use, you need not worry about it.\n=\r\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nS=\r\npirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lesson=\r\ns (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows)=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  Dear Narsimhaji\n   \n  Tha=\r\nnk you for taking the time off your busy schedule.\n  My queiry is as under\n=\r\n   \n  It is my desire to grow spiritually as well as materialistically. In =\r\nfact I feel that in the rat race of today, to live in a city one must have =\r\ndecent amount of money where one can survive and afford the necessities lik=\r\ne car, villa, so on and so forth. I do believe that one must not hanker aft=\r\ner money (specially if one is also bent to grow spiritually) but at the sam=\r\ne time one must have enough money so that at least ones one or two generati=\r\non does not have to worry about the same.\n  Considering the above fact, I f=\r\neel either you must be a specialist or be in a very special field or if you=\r\n are in business you should have a niche product or be  in a niche market. =\r\nIf the above is not possible, then you have to be in business with some com=\r\npetitive edge. Now if you are starting a business, to capture the market ei=\r\nther you must have a very strong financial backing and/or have a special re=\r\nlationship with your customer. In fact even if there is a strong financial =\r\nbacking behind you, to beat the competition you should have a special relat=\r\nionship with the customer. I hope you agree with me and  I would love to kn=\r\now your views on this.\n  To elaborate the point, the special relationship c=\r\nonsists of either taking the person out to dinner/lunch or doing a favor fo=\r\nr him in some way or other or most of the time what it means is keeping a c=\r\nommission for him (this is because these days lunches and small gifts do no=\r\nt satisfy people). Here the customer does not mean the owner of the Company=\r\n but the purchaser or if you are selling say technical products, then it wo=\r\nuld be the site engineer or the engineer who specifies your products. Now I=\r\n know accepting bribe is considered sin, and I am fully aware of the conseq=\r\nuences, I am talking of giving bribes and your views on this and how does t=\r\nhat come in the way of our spiritual progress. \n  You may be surprised to k=\r\nnow why I ask this question,but this is very commonplace in India, Middle E=\r\nast and most of the developing nations of the world and I have talked to ma=\r\nny many people, either business owners or people in sales (from small fishe=\r\ns to big sharks) and most of them offer the same in some form or the other.=\r\n Some say to grow one has to do that. Some say to survive one has to give. =\r\nSo I am wondering what the correct way should be.\n  Please give some detail=\r\ned guidelines from the spiritual perspective and if I do the same, i.e. giv=\r\ne bribe, will it come in the way or affect the karma of my family members, =\r\nspecially my wife . As a sideline, could you also explain if my action can =\r\naffect the karmas of my wife or whatever my wife is today (spiritually, mat=\r\nerialistically etc) and will be, is exclusively due to her karmas.\n  If you=\r\n could kindly throw light on these doubts, that would be much appreciated.\n=\r\n   \n  Thanks and Regards\n  &lt;deleted&gt;\r\n------=_NextPart_000_013C_01C99B92.32617CB0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;DIV {\n\tMARGIN: 0px\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;M=\r\nSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;As your ques=\r\ntion may be of interest to others also, \nI am cc&#39;ing this to vedic-wisdom y=\r\nahoogroup dedicated to spirituality, after \ndeleting references to your nam=\r\ne.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;First of all, dharma varies from person to perso=\r\nn. \nNot every person can renounce.

In fact I feel that in the \n  rat race of today, to live in a city one m=\r\nust have decent amount of money \n  where one can survive and afford the nec=\r\nessities like car, villa, so on and so \n  forth. I do believe that one must=\r\n not hanker after money (specially if one is \n  also bent to grow spiritual=\r\nly) but at the same time one must have enough money \n  so that at least one=\r\ns one or two generation does not have to worry about the \n  same.&lt;BR&gt;Consid=\r\nering the above fact, I feel either you must be a specialist or \n  be in a =\r\nvery special field or if you are in business you should have a niche \n  pro=\r\nduct or be&nbsp; in a niche market. If the above is not possible, then you =\r\n\n  have to be in business with some competitive edge. Now if you are starti=\r\nng a \n  business, to capture the market either you must have a very strong =\r\nfinancial \n  backing and/or have a special relationship with your customer.=\r\n In fact even if \n  there is a strong financial backing behind you, to beat=\r\n the competition you \n  should have a special relationship with the custome=\r\nr. I hope you agree with me \n  and&nbsp; I would love to know your views on=\r\n this.&lt;BR&gt;To elaborate the point, \n  the special relationship consists of e=\r\nither taking the person out to \n  dinner/lunch or doing a favor for him in =\r\nsome way or other or most of the time \n  what it means is keeping a commiss=\r\nion for him (this is because these days \n  lunches and small gifts do not s=\r\natisfy people). Here the customer does not \n  mean the owner of the Company=\r\n but the purchaser or if you are selling say \n  technical products, then it=\r\n would be the site engineer or the engineer who \n  specifies your products.=\r\n Now I know accepting bribe is considered sin, and I \n  am fully aware of t=\r\nhe consequences, I am talking of giving bribes and your \n  views on this an=\r\nd how does that come in the way of our spiritual progress. \n  &lt;BR&gt;You may b=\r\ne surprised to know why I ask this question,but this is very \n  commonplace=\r\n in India, Middle East and most of the developing nations of the \n  world a=\r\nnd I have talked to many many people, either business owners or people \n  i=\r\nn sales (from small fishes to big sharks) and most of them offer the same i=\r\nn \n  some form or the other. Some say to grow one has to do that. Some say =\r\nto \n  survive one has to give. So I am wondering what the correct way shoul=\r\nd \n  be.&lt;BR&gt;Please give some detailed guidelines from the spiritual perspec=\r\ntive and \n  if I do the same, i.e. give bribe, will it come in the way or a=\r\nffect the karma \n  of my family members, specially my wife . As a sideline,=\r\n could you also \n  explain if my action can affect the karmas of my wife or=\r\n whatever my wife is \n  today (spiritually, materialistically etc) and will=\r\n be, is exclusively due to \n  her karmas.&lt;BR&gt;If you could kindly throw ligh=\r\nt on these doubts, that would be \n  much appreciated.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks a=\r\nnd \n  Regards&lt;BR&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_013C_01C99B92.32617CB0--\r\n\n"}}
