Sh=\r\niva and \n&gt;&gt;Vishnu had unconditional love and devotion for each other. They =\r\nare not like \n&gt;&gt;normal human beings and their relationships, such as love a=\r\nnd devotion, are not \n&gt;&gt;governed by petty notions of superiority and depend=\r\nence.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavite distinctions and the biases of Kali y=\r\nuga are \n&gt;&gt;unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am willing to tolerate biases and \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as long as one is making some =\r\n\n&gt;&gt;progress with one&#39;s own belief system.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; One climbing =\r\na mountain has to choose one of the available paths. Whether one \n&gt;&gt;acknowl=\r\nedges that several mountain paths lead to the mountain top or whether one \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;believes that only the path one has chosen leads to the top, is not that =\r\n\n&gt;&gt;important. As long as one is climbing the mountain in one&#39;s chosen path,=\r\n one is \n&gt;&gt;doing alright!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; After all, there may be many paths around =\r\nthe hill. One may be unable to see \n&gt;&gt;paths on the other side of the mounta=\r\nin or even distant paths on the same side. \n&gt;&gt;If one does not think much of=\r\n those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own \n&gt;&gt;path, that does no har=\r\nm.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the othe=\r\nr paths that \n&gt;&gt;seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one=\r\n is very close to the \n&gt;&gt;top, one will see that all paths are leading there=\r\n. When one is on the top, one \n&gt;&gt;sees all paths to converge there. After go=\r\nd-realization, one sees various paths \n&gt;&gt;to be valid paths to god. Of cours=\r\ne, different paths come with different \n&gt;&gt;obstacles. One path may have some=\r\n snow. One path may be too steep. One path may \n&gt;&gt;be slippery. One path may=\r\n have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees \n&gt;&gt;blocking it. And so =\r\non. But, one on the top knows that people can reach there \n&gt;&gt;using several =\r\npaths, if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and \n&gt;&gt;reaching th=\r\ne top.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Let people follow the paths chosen by them and wish them good=\r\n luck to reach the \n&gt;&gt;top in their own paths. Let them say whatever they wa=\r\nnt to say about your path. \n&gt;&gt;It does not matter. If YOU have conviction an=\r\nd faith, you just walk your path \n&gt;&gt;and reach the top!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nThe problem is that some people are doing no sadhana really, making no prog=\r\nress \n&gt;&gt;really and yet passing judgments on other paths and getting into fi=\r\nghts. They \n&gt;&gt;are like people at the base of the mountain, trying to block =\r\npeople from some \n&gt;&gt;paths and trying to enroll them in their path. They may=\r\n fight with people and \n&gt;&gt;kill them too. They stay at the base forever and =\r\nnever reach the top. They are a \n&gt;&gt;problem.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; But, people with narrow =\r\nviews who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. \n&gt;&gt;They are on some pat=\r\nh and will eventually reach god. For example, so many \n&gt;&gt;Krishna bhaktas wh=\r\no look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their \n&gt;&gt;mantra seve=\r\nral malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will \n&gt;&gt;eventually m=\r\nake progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even \n&gt;&gt;wors=\r\nhip Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone,=\r\n try to \n&gt;&gt;see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and kee=\r\np their \n&gt;&gt;austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and =\r\nwill eventually \n&gt;&gt;make progress.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Let us not worry about people who =\r\nare doing some sadhana and progressing. Any \n&gt;&gt;deficiencies in their unders=\r\ntanding will be addressed in due course.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The bottomline is: Keep doi=\r\nng enough sadhana to burn the conditioning and keep \n&gt;&gt;making progress.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpa=\r\nna:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: http=\r\n://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; I ha=\r\nrdly disagree with your views but for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no \n&gt;&gt;d=\r\noubt on Shri Prabhupada and his mission to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness =\r\nbut \n&gt;&gt;many times(After exit of Shri Prabhupada)on numerous occasions I fou=\r\nnd their \n&gt;&gt;views very biased towards Shri Shivji and for that reason I hav=\r\ne my reservations \n&gt;&gt;and those views of mine are not my own views as some s=\r\nenior ex-Iskconites too \n&gt;&gt;share same views like me.If I am allowed to spea=\r\nk I have seen very few shivites \n&gt;&gt;speaking hard stuff like them for opposi=\r\nte side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not \n&gt;&gt;even that well known astrologer =\r\nSanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures \n&gt;&gt;for Vaishnavas to do Maham=\r\nrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead \n&gt;&gt;of Shri Vasishtha =\r\nmantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

If you see \n&gt;&gt;an elephant carefully, your mind may be =\r\nable to capture all of its details well. \n&gt;&gt;If you read thousands of books =\r\non an elephant without having ever seen one, you \n&gt;&gt;may still not be able i=\r\nmagine an elephant. Moreover, you may find different \n&gt;&gt;books to be contrad=\r\nictory. You may like some and dislike some based on your own \n&gt;&gt;biases abou=\r\nt what an elephant looks like. If you see an elephant yourself \n&gt;&gt;oneday, y=\r\nou will realize then that books that seemed contradictory once are not \n&gt;&gt;t=\r\nhat contradictory after all.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a =\r\ngreat saint. To go abroad without even \n&gt;&gt;knowing anyone there at an advanc=\r\ned age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam New \n&gt;&gt;York streets without proper=\r\n shoes or clothing in winter, requires tremendous \n&gt;&gt;surrender. Based on pr=\r\nevious samskaras, some may not be attracted to his \n&gt;&gt;interpretations. But =\r\nthat does not take away anything from them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; My personal favorite=\r\n is Lord Jnaneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad Gita and I also \n&gt;&gt;like Aadi Shankar=\r\na&#39;s commentary overall. However, Srila Prabhupada&#39;s commentary \n&gt;&gt;is fine t=\r\noo and it is perfect for people with certain samskaras.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sophisti=\r\ncated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not palatable to \n&gt;&gt;everyone. T=\r\nhey need to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheistic \n&gt;&gt;belief s=\r\nystems and subscription based religions need simpler models of divinity. \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be palatable =\r\nto \n&gt;&gt;them.

In the former, one is cleaning u=\r\np a dirty place that one is \n&gt;&gt;forced to live in. In the latter, one is goi=\r\nng to someone else&#39;s dirty place and \n&gt;&gt;cleaning it up. If there is some ra=\r\ndioactive waste there and one is not \n&gt;&gt;protected, one may be affected.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like=\r\n fruits lying \n&gt;&gt;in a basket. One takes out one fruit after another and eat=\r\ns them. Some may be \n&gt;&gt;tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one doe=\r\ns rituals and other \n&gt;&gt;spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad f=\r\nruits into a trash can and \n&gt;&gt;make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwi=\r\nse. But there may be some spillage \n&gt;&gt;as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a=\r\n priest is conducting the ritual, he may be \n&gt;&gt;affected by the spillage.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated=\r\n enough purity \n&gt;&gt;to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do en=\r\nough penance. They are \n&gt;&gt;quite vulnerable as they start messing with other=\r\n people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of today who co=\r\nnduct poojas are not really \n&gt;&gt;brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father i=\r\ns neither necessary nor sufficient \n&gt;&gt;for one to become a brahmana oneself.=\r\n One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have \n&gt;&gt;to be brahmana-like. Many bra=\r\nhmanas today think of power and influence over \n&gt;&gt;others or of money or of =\r\ncomforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and \n&gt;&gt;liberation. They a=\r\nre not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few \n&gt;&gt;brahmanas on e=\r\narth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed \n&gt;&gt;for oth=\r\ners only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, \n&gt;&gt;infl=\r\nuence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doi=\r\nng rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance \n&gt;&gt;when you are not=\r\n doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana \n&gt;&gt;lifestyle =\r\ndescribed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly \n&gt;&gt;become =\r\na brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;and vaisyas.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2=\r\n below on astrologers:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment a=\r\nnd there is an element of truth in it. A \n&gt;&gt;lot of what I said above applie=\r\ns here too.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of =\r\n&quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces \n&gt;&gt;an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action=\r\n of giving advice to someone \n&gt;&gt;resulted in that person doing X instead of =\r\nY at kaarmik crossroads and \n&gt;&gt;experiencing Z instead of W in coming years,=\r\n there is clearly an action here. If \n&gt;&gt;the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I=\r\n am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to \n&gt;&gt;experience the fruits of it. Some =\r\nblessings can come and some sufferings can \n&gt;&gt;come too.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMessing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to fo=\r\nllow \n&gt;&gt;a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 a=\r\nnd aspire to \n&gt;&gt;truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandal=\r\nas, shudras, \n&gt;&gt;kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born =\r\nand brought up, one \n&gt;&gt;will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only bra=\r\nhmanas are qualified to play \n&gt;&gt;with the karmas of others by giving life-al=\r\ntering advice or by conducting \n&gt;&gt;rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not tal=\r\nking about brahmanas by birth, but \n&gt;&gt;about brahmanas by conduct.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you look at the criteria laid abo=\r\nut by \n&gt;&gt;Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyotish!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ri=\r\ntual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.o=\r\nrg\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and general condition of \n&gt;&gt;B=\r\nrahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakan=\r\nda.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I think this is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence \n&gt;&gt;=\r\nI am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nil 2:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl=\r\n_yhoo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s=\r\n) mp3 training \n&gt;&gt;sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard =\r\nthrough friends \n&gt;&gt;and close uncles that astrology can have a severe advers=\r\ne impact on yourself \n&gt;&gt;(astrologer) and yrou family.

They, in their current form are no better than fenetics of=\r\n Islam and other such religions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am sorry if i used very strong wo=\r\nrds but that is how it is. they are that bad when they start their &quot;Pravach=\r\nan&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yours,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mai=\r\nl.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n=\r\n target=3D_blank&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pv=\r\nr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; While appreciati=\r\nng your viewpoint, I want to add my 2 cents of a perspective.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vishnu&#39;s incarnations such as Rama and Krishna w=\r\norshipped Shiva. Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional love and devotion for e=\r\nach other. They are not like normal human beings and their relationships, s=\r\nuch as love and devotion, are not governed by petty notions of superiority =\r\nand dependence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavite distinctions and =\r\nthe biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am willing to tole=\r\nrate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as long as one i=\r\ns making some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the availabl=\r\ne paths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to\n the =\r\nmountain top or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen lead=\r\ns to the top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mountai=\r\nn in one&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; After all, t=\r\nhere may be many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on t=\r\nhe other side of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If on=\r\ne does not think much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own p=\r\nath, that does no harm.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As one reaches the top, it gets na=\r\nrrower and one may see the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to=\r\n be quite nearby now. As one is very close to the top, one will see that al=\r\nl paths are leading there. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to co=\r\nnverge there. After god-realization, one sees various paths to be valid pat=\r\nhs to god. Of course, different paths come with different obstacles. One pa=\r\nth may have some snow. One path may be too steep. One path may\n be slippery=\r\n. One path may have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking =\r\nit. And so on. But, one on the top knows that people can reach there using =\r\nseveral paths, if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reachi=\r\nng the top.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let people follow the paths chosen by them and=\r\n wish them good luck to reach the top in their own paths. Let them say what=\r\never they want to say about your path. It does not matter. If YOU have conv=\r\niction and faith, you just walk your path and reach the top!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The problem is that some people are doing no sadh=\r\nana really, making no progress really and yet passing judgments on other pa=\r\nths and getting into fights. They are like people at the base of the mounta=\r\nin, trying to block people from some paths and trying to enroll them in the=\r\nir path. They may fight with people and kill them too. They stay at the bas=\r\ne forever and never reach the top. They are a\n problem.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bu=\r\nt, people with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. T=\r\nhey are on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Kr=\r\nishna bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing thei=\r\nr mantra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will ev=\r\nentually make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not ev=\r\nen worship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena a=\r\nt the start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to any=\r\none, try to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and ke=\r\nep their austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and wi=\r\nll eventually make progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let us not worry about people=\r\n who are doing some sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their unde=\r\nrstanding will be addressed in due course.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The bottomline =\r\nis: Keep doing enough sadhana to burn\n the conditioning and keep making pro=\r\ngress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -----------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual=\r\n manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.v=\r\nedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswa=\r\ntifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jy=\r\notishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I hardly disagree\n with your views but f=\r\nor Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his missio=\r\nn to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit of Shri Prab=\r\nhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased towards Shri S=\r\nhivji and for that reason I have my reservations and those views of mine ar=\r\ne not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same views like m=\r\ne.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking hard stuf=\r\nf like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even that wel=\r\nl known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures for Vaishn=\r\navas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead of Sh=\r\nri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

If you see an elephant carefully, your mind may b=\r\ne able to capture all of its details well. If you read thousands of books o=\r\nn an elephant without having ever seen one,\n you may still not be able imag=\r\nine an elephant. Moreover, you may find different books to be contradictory=\r\n. You may like some and dislike some based on your own biases about what an=\r\n elephant looks like. If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will real=\r\nize then that books that seemed contradictory once are not that contradicto=\r\nry after all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a=\r\n great saint. To go abroad without even knowing anyone there at an advanced=\r\n age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam New York streets without proper shoe=\r\ns or clothing in winter, requires tremendous surrender. Based on previous s=\r\namskaras, some may not be attracted to his interpretations. But that does n=\r\not take away anything from them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; My personal fav=\r\norite is Lord Jnaneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad Gita and I also like Aadi Shank=\r\nara&#39;s commentary overall.

They need to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheisti=\r\nc belief systems and subscription based religions need simpler models of di=\r\nvinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be pal=\r\natable to them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptures slight=\r\nly differently, because there are different groups of people with different=\r\n samkaras waiting to be guided by them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; My philo=\r\nsophy is simple. Read what appeals to you. Follow what you are able to. But=\r\n, in the end, reading tomes about elephant are only the starting point.

In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is for=\r\nced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place a=\r\nnd cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is not =\r\nprotected, one may be affected.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lyin=\r\ng in a basket. One takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some ma=\r\ny be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and othe=\r\nr spiritual sadhana, the\n deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash c=\r\nan and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be so=\r\nme spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the =\r\nritual, he may be affected by the spillage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated =\r\nenough purity to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough=\r\n penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people=\r\n&#39;s karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many pr=\r\niests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a=\r\n brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a br=\r\nahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-li=\r\nke. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of mon=\r\ney or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. =\r\nThey are not\n really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas =\r\non earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for ot=\r\nhers only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influe=\r\nnce, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rituals for oth=\r\ners. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for ot=\r\nhers. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhag=\r\navatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming th=\r\ne tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologers:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an elemen=\r\nt of\n truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sens=\r\ne of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s acti=\r\non of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y=\r\n at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, the=\r\nre is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doi=\r\nng this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings =\r\ncan come and some sufferings can come too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky busines=\r\ns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? Wel=\r\nl, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle descri=\r\nbed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahman=\r\na by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n =\r\nIrrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahma=\r\nna if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karma=\r\ns of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again,=\r\n to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmana=\r\ns by conduct.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will=\r\n become clear, if you look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahami=\r\nhira etc on who can be taught Jyotish!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish =\r\ntextbook,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for s=\r\nhort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\nvedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://Saras=\r\nwatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote=\r\n: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any cur=\r\nse(Shapam)?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the o=\r\nverall and general condition of Brahmanas specially\n those who do pujas for=\r\n Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if th=\r\nis is true is there any remedy for this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thin=\r\nk this is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I am posti=\r\nng this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- =\r\nIn &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namas=\r\nte Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaj=\r\ni&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous ins=\r\ntances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and\n close uncles that astro=\r\nlogy can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou fam=\r\nily.
