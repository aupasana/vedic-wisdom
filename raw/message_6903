How is one=\r\n to attain liberation? And how is\none to reach dispassion? Tell me this, si=\r\nr. 1.1\n\nAshtavakra said:\n\nIf you are seeking liberation, my son, avoid the =\r\nobjects of the senses like\npoison and cultivate tolerance, sincerity, compa=\r\nssion, contentment, and\ntruthfulness as the antidote. 1.2\n\nYou do not consi=\r\nst of any of the elements -- earth, water, fire, air, or\neven ether. To be =\r\nliberated, know yourself as consisting of consciousness,\nthe witness of the=\r\nse. 1.3\n\nIf only you will remain resting in consciousness, seeing yourself =\r\nas\ndistinct from the body, then even now you will become happy, peaceful an=\r\nd\nfree from bonds. 1.4\n\nYou do not belong to the brahmin or any other caste=\r\n, you are not at any\nstage, nor are you anything that the eye can see. You =\r\nare unattached and\nformless, the witness of everything -- so be happy. 1.5\n=\r\n\nRighteousness and unrighteousness, pleasure and pain are purely of the min=\r\nd\nand are no concern of yours. You are neither the doer nor the reaper of t=\r\nhe\nconsequences, so you are always free. 1.6\n\nYou are the one witness of ev=\r\nerything and are always completely free. The\ncause of your bondage is that =\r\nyou see the witness as something other than\nthis. 1.7\n\nSince you have been =\r\nbitten by the black snake, the opinion about yourself\nthat &quot;I am the doer,&quot;=\r\n drink the antidote of faith in the fact that &quot;I am not\nthe doer,&quot; and be h=\r\nappy. 1.8\n\nBurn down the forest of ignorance with the fire of the understan=\r\nding that &quot;I\nam the one pure awareness,&quot; and be happy and free from distres=\r\ns. 1.9\n\nThat in which all this appears is imagined like the snake in a rope=\r\n; that\njoy, supreme joy, and awareness is what you are, so be happy. 1.10\n\n=\r\nIf one thinks of oneself as free, one is free, and if one thinks of oneself=\r\n\nas bound, one is bound. Here this saying is true, &quot;Thinking makes it so.&quot;\n=\r\n1.11\n\nYour real nature is as the one perfect, free, and actionless consciou=\r\nsness,\nthe all-pervading witness -- unattached to anything, desireless and =\r\nat\npeace. It is from illusion that you seem to be involved in samsara. 1.12=\r\n\n\nMeditate on yourself as motionless awareness, free from any dualism, givi=\r\nng\nup the mistaken idea that you are just a derivative consciousness or\nany=\r\nthing external or internal. 1.13\n\nYou have long been trapped in the snare o=\r\nf identification with the body.\nSever it with the knife of knowledge that &quot;=\r\nI am awareness,&quot; and be happy, my\nson. 1.14\n\nYou are really unbound and act=\r\nionless, self-illuminating and spotless\nalready. The cause of your bondage =\r\nis that you are still resorting to\nstilling the mind. 1.15\n\nAll of this is =\r\nreally filled by you and strung out in you, for what you\nconsist of is pure=\r\n awareness -- so don&#39;t be small-minded. 1.16\n\nYou are unconditioned and cha=\r\nngeless, formless and immovable, unfathomable\nawareness, unperturbable: so =\r\nhold to nothing but consciousness. 1.17\n\nRecognise that the apparent is unr=\r\neal, while the unmanifest is abiding.\nThrough this initiation into truth yo=\r\nu will escape falling into unreality\nagain. 1.18\n\nJust as a mirror exists e=\r\nverywhere both within and apart from its reflected\nimages, so the Supreme L=\r\nord exists everywhere within and apart from this\nbody. 1.19\n\nJust as one an=\r\nd the same all-pervading space exists within and without a\njar, so the eter=\r\nnal, everlasting God exists in the totality of things. 1.20\n\n\nJanaka said:\n=\r\n\nTruly I am spotless and at peace, the awareness beyond natural causality.\n=\r\nAll this time I have been afflicted by delusion. 2.1\n\nAs I alone give light=\r\n to this body, so I do to the world. As a result the\nwhole world is mine, o=\r\nr alternatively nothing is. 2.2\n\nSo now that I have abandoned the body and =\r\neverything else, by good fortune\nmy true self becomes apparent. 2.3\n\nWaves,=\r\n foam, and bubbles do not differ from water. In the same way, all this\nwhic=\r\nh has emanated from oneself is no other than oneself. 2.4\n\nWhen you analyse=\r\n it, cloth is found to be just thread. In the same way, when\nall this is an=\r\nalysed it is found to be no other than oneself. 2.5\n\nThe sugar produced fro=\r\nm the juice of the sugarcane is permeated throughout\nwith the same taste. I=\r\nn the same way, all this, produced out of me, is\ncompletely permeated with =\r\nmyself. 2.6\n\nFrom ignorance of oneself, the world appears, and by knowledge=\r\n of oneself it\nappears no longer. From ignorance of the rope it appears to =\r\nbe a snake, and\nby knowledge of it it does so no longer. 2.7\n\nShining is my=\r\n essential nature, and I am nothing other than that. When the\nworld shines =\r\nforth, it is only me that is shining forth. 2.8\n\nAll this appears in me ima=\r\ngined due to ignorance, just as a snake appears in\nthe rope, the mirage of =\r\nwater in the sunlight, and silver in mother of\npearl. 2.9\n\nAll this, which =\r\nhas originated out of me, is resolved back into me too, like\na jug back int=\r\no clay, a wave into water, and a bracelet into gold. 2.10\n\nHow wonderful I =\r\nam! Glory to me, for whom there is no destruction, remaining\neven beyond th=\r\ne destruction of the world from Brahma down to the last clump\nof grass. 2.1=\r\n1\n\nHow wonderful I am! Glory to me, solitary even though with a body, neith=\r\ner\ngoing or coming anywhere, I who abide forever, filling all that is. 2.12=\r\n\n\nHow wonderful I am! Glory to me! There is no one so clever as me! I who h=\r\nave\nborne all that is forever, without even touching it with my body! 2.13\n=\r\n\nHow wonderful I am! Glory to me! I who possess nothing at all, or\nalternat=\r\nively possess everything that speech and mind can refer to. 2.14\n\nKnowledge=\r\n, what is to be known, and the knower -- these three do not exist\nin realit=\r\ny. I am the spotless reality in which they appear because of\nignorance. 2.1=\r\n5\n\nTruly dualism is the root of suffering. There is no other remedy for it =\r\nthan\nthe realisation that all this that we see is unreal, and that I am the=\r\n one\nstainless reality, consisting of consciousness. 2.16\n\nI am pure awaren=\r\ness though through ignorance I have imagined myself to have\nadditional attr=\r\nibutes. By continually reflecting like this, my dwelling\nplace is in the Un=\r\nimagined. 2.17\n\nFor me here is neither bondage nor liberation. The illusion=\r\n has lost its\nbasis and ceased. Truly all this exists in me, though ultimat=\r\nely it does not\neven exist in me. 2.18\n\nRecognising that all this and my bo=\r\ndy too are nothing, while my true self is\nnothing but pure consciousness, w=\r\nhat is there left for the imagination to\nwork on now? 2.19\n\nThe body, heave=\r\nn and hell, bondage and liberation, and fear too, all this is\npure imaginat=\r\nion. What is there left to do for me whose very nature is\nconsciousness? 2.=\r\n20\n\nI do not even see dualism in a crowd of people, so what do I gain if it=\r\n is\nreplaced by a desert? 2.21\n\nI am not the body, nor is the body mine. I =\r\nam not a living being. I am\nconsciousness. It was my thirst for living that=\r\n was my bondage. 2.22\n\nTruly it is in the infinite ocean of myself, that, s=\r\ntimulated by the\ncolourful waves of the world, everything suddenly arises i=\r\nn the wind of\nconsciousness. 2.23\n\nIn the infinite ocean of myself, the win=\r\nd of thought subsides, and the world\nboat of the living-being traders is wr=\r\necked by lack of goods. 2.24\n\nHow wonderful it is that in the infinite ocea=\r\nn of myself the waves of living\nbeings arise, collide, play, and disappear,=\r\n in accordance with their nature.\n2.25\n\nSource: http://bhagavan-ramana.org/=\r\nashtavakragita.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =\r\n=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016364ed85082c42e04a864e34a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Ashtavakra Gita&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;J=\r\nanaka said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How is one to acquire knowledge?

It was my thirst for living that was=\r\n my bondage. 2.22&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Truly it is in the infinite ocean of myself, that,=\r\n stimulated by the colourful waves of the world, everything suddenly arises=\r\n in the wind of consciousness. 2.23&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the infinite ocean of mysel=\r\nf, the wind of thought subsides, and the world boat of the living-being tra=\r\nders is wrecked by lack of goods. 2.24&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How wonderful it is that in t=\r\nhe infinite ocean of myself the waves of living beings arise, collide, play=\r\n, and disappear, in accordance with their nature. 2.25&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ashtavakragita.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;h=\r\nttp://bhagavan-ramana.org/ashtavakragita.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;m=\r\nargin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-he=\r\night:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%=\r\n;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-=\r\nheight:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016364ed85082c42e04a864e34a--\r\n\n"}}
