As I keep saying again and agai=\r\nn, specific advice given by saints may be adopted to their desa-kaala-paatr=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Things change from time to time and from place to place.

If someone has aversi=\r\non for  backdoor, that&#39;s fine and he can use the front door.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *   =\r\n     *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; BTW, Ramakrishna did engage in all the 64 practic=\r\nes of tantra, under the guidance of Bhairavi Braahmani who was sent by Tril=\r\ninga Swami.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Also, Ramakrishna did meet Trilinga Swami in person a=\r\nnd fed him rice pudding with his own hands. Aghori Vimalananda also met Tri=\r\nlinga Swami before his life transformed with the darshan of Smashana Tara a=\r\nnd said Trilinga Swami was his guru-bhai (i.e. same lineage). It is a small=\r\n world with many interesting connections.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; Now on to the thread quoted below..\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Comment on Rajarshi&#39;s =\r\noriginal point:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Rina is something you &quot;owe&quot; and hence &quot;give back&quot;=\r\n. Rina is all about giving and not taking. Most sense gratification people =\r\nengage in involves more taking than giving. When you &quot;give&quot; something (to o=\r\nthers or to universe), you are paying back your debt. When you &quot;take&quot; somet=\r\nhing (from others or from universe), you are creating a new debt that will =\r\nneed to be paid back later. A simple formula is &quot;give all you can and do no=\r\nt get worked up if you are not receiving enough in return&quot;. Of course, when=\r\n you have an opportunity to give different things to different people and h=\r\nave to pick some, you have to use your judgment to pick the right ones, to =\r\npay off a more important rina with the little you have!!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The prob=\r\nlem is that it is so difficult to give without getting something back (i.e.=\r\n pay back old debt and create a new debt)! This is true with anything and n=\r\not just the example of sex you mentioned. Of course, when it comes to sex, =\r\nit may be even more difficult. One may tend to think more about one&#39;s own p=\r\nleasure than partner&#39;s. Even when one thinks about partner&#39;s pleasure, it m=\r\nay be with an egoistic focus (&quot;am *I* able to give pleasure&quot;). Who forgets =\r\nown pleasure and thinks &quot;I will submit to the god in my partner and give as=\r\n much pleasure as I can to god in this form. My own pleasure does not matte=\r\nr at all and I will not think about it&quot;? If one indeed does that successful=\r\nly, then hardly new rina is created and old rina is paid back.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; No=\r\nw, forget sex. Even in other things, giving goes hand-in-hand with taking a=\r\nnd we often create new rinas. As long as our ego remains, we are always pur=\r\nsuing self-gratification in many ways.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Suppose I made a promise t=\r\no my guru in last life to spread homam and astrology and created a rina. Or=\r\n suppose I undermined them in my last life and ended up creating a rina. Or=\r\n suppose I benefited from those subjects and created a rina.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Some=\r\nhow or the other, suppose I created a rina that set the stage for the work =\r\nof this life. Suppose the rina requires me to do something for those subjec=\r\nts, e.g. teach homam, teach astrology, give a free astrology software etc. =\r\nAll this is what I am &quot;giving&quot;, i.e. I am paying back a rina I created befo=\r\nre somehow or the other.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Now, suppose people start praising me fo=\r\nr what I am doing and I feel proud and gratified. This gratification I deri=\r\nve is something I am &quot;taking&quot; from others and the universe. So this is a ri=\r\nna.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Of course, I cannot control what others do. When I give somet=\r\nhing to them - knowledge or manuals or software etc - they may praise me to=\r\n ANY level. That I cannot control. But I CAN control how proud and gratifie=\r\nd I feel. By conscious effort, constant contemplation, surrender to the Mot=\r\nher and viewing it as a lila in which I a small instrument, I can try to no=\r\nt focus my mind on what universe is giving me and focus it instead on what =\r\nmore I can give to the universe.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; If by exercising ones will power, an individual is able to avoid paying=\r\n a rna, what happens then? &lt; &lt; &lt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Everything you took does need to=\r\n be paid back. Actually, paying back is never a problem. If you can pay bac=\r\nk a rina without incurring a new rina in the process, it is safe anytime to=\r\n give back and there is no need to delay or avoid.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; But, if that i=\r\ns not the case, you can try to use your will power to delay payback to a ti=\r\nme later when you are hopefully able to give without taking something back.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Utpal, in your example, &quot;Curse, Co=\r\nnstantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress&quot; under (1) are useles=\r\ns activities. They involve no giving and no productive action.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nsaid earlier: &quot;Of course, when you have an opportunity to give different th=\r\nings to different people and have to pick some, you have to use your judgme=\r\nnt to pick the right ones, to pay off a more important rina with the little=\r\n you have!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; So part of option (1) is valid. If one believes ther=\r\ne is a chance to retrieve the money and put it to a good use to fulfil some=\r\n other important rina, one can try. But, if one determines that there is no=\r\n chance, one should be able to put it to rest (i.e. (2)). Similarly, one sh=\r\nould put in one&#39;s effort prepared for any outcome and not thinking about th=\r\ne money always.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; What action you engage in decides the outcome and=\r\n not whether you think about this action and its object all the time. By th=\r\ninking about it all the time and becoming anxious, you achieve nothing. In =\r\nfact, such anxiety may sometimes cloud your judment, stop you from doing th=\r\ne right thing and reduce your efficiency. Attachment limits efficiency. It =\r\nis action that gets result and not attachment. Detached action is the best =\r\nformula for efficient action. Both inaction and attached action are formula=\r\ns for disaster.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Softw=\r\nare, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual ma=\r\nnuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiF=\r\nilms.org\n&gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ---- dinesh_nambisan &lt;dinesh@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal-bhai:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tha=\r\nnks for your thoughts.

Now it happened so that Mr. VS could not repay it due to reasons =\r\nonly known to him. Mr. VS gives many excuses and many dates but fails and u=\r\nltimately does not pay back. Mr. FL is under great pressure due to that.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. FL can have many options to react in the situations:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1] Thinking constantly and repenting for the act He can-\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;    Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress, res=\r\nort to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal and extern=\r\nal activities concerning that issue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this case, He stro=\r\nngly identifies with the Money, act of Giving then expecting it back, Repen=\r\nting etc...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OR\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2] Mr. FL can really grab =\r\nthe golden chance to resort to the implementation of knowledge (KIP-Knowled=\r\nge in Practice) and thinks that it was a Rina which needed to be paid back =\r\nand practically starts training the mind with that knowledge. He follows up=\r\n for the money but with the attitude of detachment. Although he shows to hi=\r\ns family and friends that he is extremely concerned and it was foolish act =\r\netc... But in his mind he thinks that it was a rina from some past life whi=\r\nch was fulfilled. He thinks that they were Money of Mother and she will tak=\r\ne care. If they needed to come back, she will do it or if they were to be p=\r\naid to nullify some past rinas then they will not come back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and =\r\nwill be able to break free from this particular chain. He may have successf=\r\nully PAID BACK his debt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With the first Approach, Mr. FL h=\r\nas identified himself very strongly with Money and its ownership and hence =\r\nall the actions done due to that, so He may have created NEW RINAS which wi=\r\nll be needed to settled on a later date.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However I am not =\r\nsure for what I have written.

This comes from millions of jan=\r\nmas and samskaras. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My spiritual father &quot;Vimalananda=\r\n&quot; used to say  in a slightly different context that he believes in Samprada=\r\nha or incineration.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I applied it to this as well and it works qui=\r\nte well.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Two things  are going to be  useful, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Con=\r\ntinue your mantra during the act and it will act as a continuation of your =\r\nsadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not=\r\n be disheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the  thing in your =\r\nmind which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked fe=\r\nmale(or male as  may be the case)  body is like a landscape picture just li=\r\nke any other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wa=\r\nt, you need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly  feel that the pictur=\r\ne  is very beautiful  but you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Sa=\r\nmasta Sakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.... ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once this stage is reached=\r\n then the mind ceases to think of sex all the while.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes you may =\r\nstill encounter it, but that is another story.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manis=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Thu, Feb 25, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Narasimha P.V.R. =\r\nRao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Sathasivom who sent this mail is the priest I mention=\r\ned earlier.

It was during the Shata Chandi homam that Manish had a da=\r\nrshan of  the Mother, who commanded to  spread homam and said She will arra=\r\nnge all the resources needed. Swami Sathasivom had several books on homam g=\r\nifted to us by a friend  of his on the next day, without Manish telling any=\r\nthing about the Mother&#39;s command to anyone. He also gifted a homa kundam to=\r\n me enabling me to experiment with homam and prepare myself for creating th=\r\ne manuals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He is a priest in the Sivacharya traditio=\r\nn of Tamil Nadu and his father Sri Sambamurthi Sivacharya was  a very respe=\r\ncted Sivacharya who trained a lot of priests and consecrated many temples. =\r\nSwami Sathasivom is one of the rare priests we find today, who is not only =\r\na priest but also a yogi and a sadhaka. He has childlike innocence, simplic=\r\nty, rare humility  and love for all. He conducts himself with detachment by=\r\n seeking nothing and avoiding nothing. He conducted some of the best homams=\r\n and poojas I have witnessed. He has been on mouna vratam (vow of silence) =\r\nfor more than a year and communicates by writing (saying mantras in pooja/h=\r\nomam is an exception).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *               *            =\r\n   *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can give an analogy for the last point regard=\r\ning an aghora&#39;s way to overcome any  weakness for sex that may be left in t=\r\nhe mind (which may make sexual  thoughts arise in the mind now and then).\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose you are trying to read a book and a friend is=\r\n distracting you and irritating you by talking about something else.

It is =\r\nnormal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible.=\r\n Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A t=\r\nrue  Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and=\r\n sees all as impermanent manifestations of god and tries to focus the think=\r\ning of the mind on what is permanent (god) always, instead of impermanent m=\r\nanifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When someone dies, north India=\r\nns chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carrying the dead body to the funeral=\r\n. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is true and everything else is an il=\r\nlusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself that life and death are just a tempo=\r\nrary illusion and only the Lord is real. But the question is: why should we=\r\n remind ourselves of this ultimate truth only when someone dies? When someo=\r\nne praises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and we are about to=\r\n feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This =\r\nthing we did and the praises are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real=\r\n. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to=\r\n something beautiful and want to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naa=\r\nm satya hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other things that seem not=\r\n so beautiful are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind =\r\nnot dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  When someone attacks and abus=\r\nes us and we are about to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama=\r\n naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is rea=\r\nl. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nA true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind rejects=\r\n all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by=\r\n classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about t=\r\nhem with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is perma=\r\nnent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *               *=\r\n               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The vari=\r\nety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces=\r\n and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality wi=\r\nthin them is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So =\r\nhe may try a ritual where feces is eaten.  But, please remember that eating=\r\n feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed an=\r\nd not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), i=\r\ns the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose,=\r\n for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of S=\r\nelf (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but=\r\n the mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with c=\r\nertain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinkin=\r\ng that he is Self and he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, =\r\na vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when ea=\r\nting food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Neve=\r\nrtheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in=\r\n one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifest=\r\nations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly =\r\nsalty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the=\r\n same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse.=\r\n But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure result=\r\ns in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in f=\r\norcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic=\r\n verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus =\r\nand nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self w=\r\nhile eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-=\r\nnice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other ha=\r\nnd, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, i=\r\nt will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad =\r\ndual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by e=\r\nveryone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas=\r\n succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *               *             =\r\n  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is =\r\ndoing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for=\r\n sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in t=\r\nhe middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and ke=\r\nep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overco=\r\nming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract on=\r\ne. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the =\r\nfascination in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to=\r\n overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause =\r\nand remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as=\r\n two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine t=\r\nhem into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora=\r\n sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his jap=\r\nam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think th=\r\nat his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam l=\r\nike that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He=\r\n may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer fee=\r\nl titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may be=\r\n broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer ev=\r\noke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts r=\r\nelated to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;  denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but the=\r\ny may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in =\r\nmeditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind m=\r\nay feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s=\r\n fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the though=\r\nts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these st=\r\nructures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those structures.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It=\r\n is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely =\r\nfor sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thin=\r\nking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious=\r\n/sincere/ ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *         =\r\n      *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Bottomline is that an aghora takes prob=\r\nlems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, wher=\r\neas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly=\r\n and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *               *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\nLike Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? A=\r\nghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s t=\r\nhought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is certai=\r\nnly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, some=\r\n people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong understanding and the t=\r\nhrill such an understanding brings.  Aghora stands for neither thrills nor =\r\nperversion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or per=\r\nversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, bu=\r\nt Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking=\r\n by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, the followi=\r\nng mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths and explains the b=\r\nasic reality.

But what I am trying to understand  is that how to wo=\r\nrship both forms simultaneously. For  instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar=\r\n, was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along w=\r\nith Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka.=\r\n His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis  mention  great details about all the  nin=\r\ne avaranas and different forms of the divine mother as one goes through eac=\r\nh avarana.  In the Dhyana Krithi  of those, in the very  first line he says=\r\n, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.  That line tells me that  eve=\r\nn through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a=\r\n great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of d=\r\nuality! I never thought in those terms. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have star=\r\nted reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, =\r\nbefore I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2=\r\n010. I really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashati! Have t=\r\no see how mother will help me achieve my target. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Al=\r\nso, I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. =\r\nFor now I have very mixed feelings on the subject. Perhaps I need to read m=\r\nore! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 2/12/1=\r\n0, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Friday, February 1=\r\n2, 2010, 11:31 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNamaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me=\r\n. My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On =\r\nthe other hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all and t=\r\nook 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their first attempt=\r\n. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THA=\r\nT is awe-inspiring.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Integrating various sadhanas is a =\r\npersonal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good i=\r\ndea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instea=\r\nd of splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said=\r\n, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in t=\r\nen places, if one wants to find water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One possibility=\r\n is to do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with vario=\r\nus mantras one is attached to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not that knowledge=\r\nable about Sri Vidya. However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree=\r\n chakra is a symblic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Se=\r\nlf. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce on=\r\ne. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If y=\r\nou have a mother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you=\r\n can face the strictness).

Y=\r\nou also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi=\r\n homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short ti=\r\nme? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ga=\r\nnapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with p=\r\nachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 m=\r\ninutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a we=\r\nek, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along wi=\r\nth homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please =\r\nexplain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated t=\r\no learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest=\r\n in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna =\r\nkrithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagr=\r\naj Kota\n\n\n"}}
