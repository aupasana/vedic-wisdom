If priest was aware and still did that, then I can\n&gt; underst=\r\nand the consequence.\n\nIf one goes in the path of a tornado, aware or unawar=\r\ne that a tornado is coming, one will still be consumed by it.\n\nIf the quest=\r\nion is of fairness, well, is it fair that tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricane=\r\ns etc should kill thousands of people every year? Well, Natural order of th=\r\ne universe is neither fair nor unfair. It is just an &quot;order&quot;. Your actions =\r\ngets opposite reactions. You experience the fruits of your actions, as dete=\r\nrmined by the order of nature. A person may happen to be doing what he sees=\r\n as his dharma and earthquake may strike there and kill him. If so, there m=\r\nust be a previous karma as a result of which he is placed there at that tim=\r\ne.\n\nIn the case of the priest in the story, his mistake is that he slapped =\r\na person worshipping god. If he had no way of assessing the bhava (feeling)=\r\n in the mind of the person doing the worship, he should&#39;ve given the benefi=\r\nt of doubt and assumed it was a sincere devotee, rather than assuming it wa=\r\ns a fool.\n\nSee, when Ramakrishna went there and saw Trilinga Swami, he imme=\r\ndiately knew the stature and remarked that this is Viswanatha himself. Howe=\r\nver, others may not be so fortunate. You only saw a body with some body par=\r\nts and some clothes and nothing beyond it. If so, give the benefit of doubt=\r\n and treat kindly and respectfully. Just because of external parameters, do=\r\n not judge a person and act harsh.\n\nHitting a person who still has a limite=\r\nd self-identification is one thing and hitting a person who has no limited =\r\nself-identification and identifies with the entire universe or with a deity=\r\n is different.\n\n* * *\n\nIn any case, do not worry about that priest that muc=\r\nh. For all you know, he may be an associate of Shiva who came along with Tr=\r\nilinga Swami to enact a story and teach a moral and he may have gone back t=\r\no Shiva. Even if not, he was lucky to enact an important role in an interes=\r\nting divine drama.\n\n* * *\n\nJeevanmuktas may engage in actions that are diff=\r\nicult to comprehend. They have no personal ego, will and agenda. They becom=\r\ne instruments for Nature to fulfil the Natural order. The action of Triling=\r\na Swami may help several people question, challenge and overcome their bias=\r\nes and learn some important lessons, centuries after he left earth.\n\n* * *\n=\r\n\nRegarding many gods: As I keep emphasizing, yogis and saints sometimes giv=\r\ne advices based on desa-kaala-paatra or advices geared at a specific set of=\r\n people.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in having many deities in pooja room and w=\r\norshipping all. Such people may lead fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimal=\r\nananda may not be concerned about such people. His teachings may be address=\r\ned at some other people to come in the coming years who he has rina with an=\r\nd who are meant to achieve saayujya of some deities and do some work. There=\r\n is an intended audience for every work and no work can be perfect for all =\r\naudience.\n\nIf the goal is either liberation or a deity&#39;s darshan (vision) o=\r\nr saayujya (company), one has to agree that focusing on one deity is the be=\r\nst thing to do, rather than trying to focus mind on ten deities and keep sw=\r\nitching. A deity comes when mind and its thoughts are filled with that deit=\r\ny&#39;s name and mantra and other thoughts are driven away from the mind. Vimal=\r\nananda perhaps wanted to motivate several people to strive for vision/compa=\r\nny of deities. He probably thought some people he has a rina with would com=\r\ne to earth with such a potential.\n\n* * *\n\nThyagaraja did compose songs on m=\r\nany deities. But, he first had a darshan of Rama. He spent several years ch=\r\nanting Rama&#39;s name and had a darshan. Then he composed songs on many deitie=\r\ns. However, he saw all of them as different emanations from Rama. He saw Ra=\r\nma in all.\n\nSame with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy Deekshitar, Bammera Potha=\r\nna and others.\n\nWhen one achieves perfection in surrender to one deity, one=\r\n&#39;s life is made. After that, one will see the same deity in all deities eve=\r\nn if he worships 100 deities. If one is switching between ten deities befor=\r\ne that, it may not be helpful in filling the mind with thoughts of any of t=\r\nhose deities. Mind sees those deities as different objects and may not full=\r\ny surrender to any of them. Still, as I said, one may lead a fruitful dhaar=\r\nmik life. That&#39;s fine.\n\nBut, if you really want to taste the nectar of comp=\r\nlete surrender, it is better to pick one deity and fill the mind with his/h=\r\ner thoughts.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; Excellent answers on each thread and mother showed h=\r\ner divine\n&gt; grace through you that I am able to find answers to many\n&gt; ques=\r\ntions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n\nThough I had some spiritual =\r\nexperiences fortunately, I am not a realized person. I too am a normal pers=\r\non with an immature mind. But my guru blessed me that I will be able to giv=\r\ne excellent replies to spiritual questions if I think of him and then write=\r\n what comes to my mind. That is what I have been doing.

If priest was aware and still did that, t=\r\nhen I can understand the consequence.

But contrary to that we find great saints / composer=\r\ns / poets from India have indeed worshipped many forms of the God and were =\r\nsuccessful in that approach as well. For instance, there is not a single de=\r\nity form that was not worshipped by Adi Sankara and/or Muththuswamy Dikshit=\r\nar. It was famous that Muththuswamy Dikshitar was a self-realized Sri Vidyo=\r\npasaka and he left his mortal coil by singing to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in t=\r\nhe presence of many of his disciples. But he composed songs of deep devotio=\r\nn that have immense power and depth on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Ram=\r\na and so on. So was Thyagaraja. So were many great composers of Carnatic Mu=\r\nsic in that path. In fact they were all great advaitis and never saw any di=\r\nfference between any form of the God, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a great=\r\n poet of Andhra who\n&gt; translated Bhagavatam, in his opening invocatory poem=\r\ns, pays homage to Lord Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahmi, D=\r\nurga, Lakshmi in that order before declaring that he got the divine inspira=\r\ntion from Lord Rama to write the Stories of Krishna! Where is the differenc=\r\ne between any form of God here! I wonder. So, I was not able to comprehend =\r\nwhy Vimalananda accuses many Hindus of having a chaotic mind just because t=\r\nheir puja mandirams are filled with many photographs/ idols of different mu=\r\nrthis of Almighty.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhagaru, \n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent ans=\r\nwers on each thread and mother showed her divine grace through you that I a=\r\nm able to find answers to many questions that my immature mind keeps on ask=\r\ning! \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, coming back to the topic, some of the topics I found dis=\r\nturbing in the first book of Aghora are as follows: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. On the page 45=\r\n it says that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara =\r\nwith his own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason for this =\r\nbizarre behavior and why should the priest who slapped him die, because in =\r\nmy opinion, anyone else would have done the same in the least! Since you ha=\r\nve an excellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing things, I hope to =\r\nfind and answer here. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In quite a few places, Vimalananda equates c=\r\nhanging the loyalty from diety to diety as akin to prostitution, which I fi=\r\nnd as an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi Sankara compose so =\r\nmany hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed in the praise =\r\nof Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well. So are so many =\r\ngreat composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leelashuka where the=\r\ny wanted to see their favorite deity form only (rama in the case of former =\r\nand krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the other form is t=\r\nhe same supreme being, are only a very minority in the list of Bhaktas that=\r\n we have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equally in the love a=\r\nnd awe of every form of god, namely Shiva, rama, krishna, ganesha, amba, su=\r\nbramanya, anjaneya and so on! \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 3/2/10, Narasi=\r\nmha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@=\r\ncharter. net&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Surrender (Re: Aghora books..)\n&gt; To=\r\n: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, March 2, 2010, 6:31 PM\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How to achieve it effectivey?\n&gt; \n&gt; If it =\r\ncan be achieved easily, we will not have so many spiritual paths and so man=\r\ny sadhanas.

The rest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of us have to follow dharma, which includes=\r\n standing up for what is right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and righteous and not being defeatis=\r\nt or fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have written off the wrong=\r\ns of the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna urged hi=\r\nm to take up the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mercy. Th=\r\ne webs of karma are too intricate and complex and delicate to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; co=\r\nmprehended unless one has reached certain very very high levels of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nspiritual attainment, and even then, it will only be a partial vision. Only=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S/He who is unlimited (Iswara/i) knows and sees the entire web of =\r\nkarma and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knows best how to dispatch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Aditiji and others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun could do wha=\r\nt he did for a reason.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was a great sadhaka himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhat he did was sort of simple. He did so much sadhana of a deity that this\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day and night. This deity was a form of S=\r\nhiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the rarest of rare opportunity to be wi=\r\nth Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time of the battle, because Shiva is the greatest=\r\n Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one who knows how to worship Krishna properly.=\r\n Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself can you worship Krishna perfectly.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the battle, Arjun was beset with doub=\r\nt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa something crazy happened as if K=\r\nrishna was within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even before, b=\r\nut Arjun could not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s lila o=\r\nr play of course, because otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as=\r\n a friend ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him,=\r\n but the Lord loves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok,=\r\n now once Arjun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively Kr=\r\nishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the end of=\r\n the battle when all the Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person who had be=\r\nen decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kept alive=\r\n at the top of the tree,..... about who was responsible for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pan=\r\ndava&#39;s victory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said was that at the beginnin=\r\ng of the day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out from one end of =\r\nthe battlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that destruction, it would re=\r\nturn to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the blood which w=\r\nas being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun =\r\nwas lucky, He had God incarnate at His side, others may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; so fortunate. For example, Ramakrishna used to say that a doctor&#39;s money =\r\nwas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left my thriving surgical career when I read t=\r\nhis a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He said something similar about the m=\r\noney earned by a lawyer.(I think he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law i=\r\nn that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Easiest thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) prani=\r\ndhana. Surrender to God. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; freely admitted to the Lord when I had H=\r\nis darshana that I was a complete\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fool and knew nothing at all. She=\r\n taught me all I know because of this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever you ever do in life=\r\n, just try and be straight in every dealing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you have with anyb=\r\nody, give whatever you can, turn away nobody from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your door, who kn=\r\nows when God will come to test you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This does not mean tha=\r\nt one is fatalistic and does nothing, but it means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that terrific sa=\r\ndhana is useful, nay even necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhana and a real Gu=\r\nru (Gu kara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-removes darkness Ru kas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cha Teja Uch=\r\nayte- brings light into the being), are essential. Before I met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my =\r\nreal Guru, I saw plenty of guys who were basically sadhakas themselves, I\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; used to ask and swear at them, &quot;You are blind yourself, how will you=\r\n lead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the blind me to God, when you have not seen God yourself face=\r\n to face?!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once you take Time out of the equation (bec=\r\nause a deity has a different time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; space frame which runs in thousan=\r\nds of years which pass by in a blink of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eye) by waiting with pat=\r\nience, then where will God go? God has to come, He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t escape.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sa=\r\nt, Feb 27, 2010 at 9:05 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you see the old mail quoted by Heman=\r\nth below, it will answer your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just =\r\nbecause a group of people think something is their dharma and do it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; does not free them from karma.

Dharma (duty)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and moksha (=\r\nliberation) are two different purusharthas and not one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fulfillin=\r\ng dharma is helpful for liberation, but not sufficient.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n In addition to doing dharma, one needs to overcome ego (I-ness) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; doership. As ego and the sense of doership goes down, the speed at whic=\r\nh new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karmas are incurred goes down. Dharma becomes clearer. For =\r\nliberation, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs to lower ego and the sense of doership and =\r\ndo one&#39;s dharma (i.e. pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back debts) without attachment and doer=\r\nship.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mail quoted by Hemanth clarifies some key con=\r\ncepts and worth reading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and understanding carefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, =\r\nFree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual m=\r\nanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rol=\r\noger.org&lt;http://www.vedicast rologer.org/ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Se Am &lt;mahalaxmye=\r\ny@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i heard that Muslims used to behead meditating s=\r\nages head when they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so Muslims dharma=\r\n is to kill other religious people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so will Muslims attact bad k=\r\narma or sin?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Hemanth Srinivas &lt;hemanthks@. ..=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ye=\r\ns, even I think one has to follow Dharma.

Krishna clearly says in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your =\r\nown dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Following the path of dharma basically means engagin=\r\ng in the right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action/duty. Right action varies from person to =\r\nperson, from time to time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from place to place. It is depend=\r\nent on what nature expects from you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on =\r\nwho you have been in the past, what actions you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past=\r\n while identifying with the action, who you affected in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts=\r\n you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental tendencies you acc=\r\numulated until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s =\r\nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a pers=\r\non to spread the message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of all religio=\r\nns, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; men=\r\ntal tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wan=\r\nts a person to make a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money and construct a te=\r\nmple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma =\r\nto kill his gurus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such=\r\n that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature w=\r\nanted earth to be relieved of some weight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjun=\r\na being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilit=\r\nate that. Some people he deeply loved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the=\r\n other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whe=\r\nn the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was differe=\r\nnt in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounc=\r\ne material life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live th=\r\ne simple life of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a si=\r\nmple life of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he i=\r\ns born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said), h=\r\nis dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does on=\r\ne decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have int=\r\nerpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a =\r\nlong time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very muc=\r\nh there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He be=\r\ncame a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what one is exp=\r\nosed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s o=\r\nwn varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinter=\r\npretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharma=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very diffic=\r\nult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fa=\r\nct, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us w=\r\nhat our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from =\r\nother parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nconfused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combinin=\r\ng discrimination and intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our=\r\n dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More th=\r\nan following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should n=\r\not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We=\r\n should engage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best =\r\njudgment on what our dharma in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is=\r\n), with as little attachment and self-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nction as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will ha=\r\nppen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma=\r\n yoga (unfication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our eg=\r\no and purify our consciousness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become p=\r\nurer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to s=\r\nee our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karma=\r\ns. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people t=\r\nhink.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not followi=\r\nng one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; g=\r\nets refined with time if one engages in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little atta=\r\nchment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anot=\r\nher external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given t=\r\no one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spir=\r\nitual master, one can take the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to=\r\n determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishn=\r\na who clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekanand=\r\na) was confused about his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renoun=\r\nce the world and go to a secluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who on=\r\ne is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects fr=\r\nom one can err in the judgment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma i=\r\ns. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anyb=\r\nody) cannot outline a set of principles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the=\r\n dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one=\r\n&#39;s understanding of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing intern=\r\nal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like ho=\r\nmam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment=\r\n, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to p=\r\nersist so long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramah=\r\namsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerje=\r\ne &lt;banerjeea@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with Dinesh.

He follows up for the=\r\n money but with the attitude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of detachment. Although he shows to =\r\nhis family and friends that he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extremely concerned and it was =\r\nfoolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it was a rina f=\r\nrom some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were =\r\nMoney of Mother and she will take care. If they needed to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ba=\r\nck, she will do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then they will not come back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will n=\r\not Create New Rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and will be able to break free from this part=\r\nicular chain. He may have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successfully PAID BACK his debt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified hi=\r\nmself very strongly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with Money and its ownership and hence all th=\r\ne actions done due to that, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He may have created NEW RINAS whic=\r\nh will be needed to settled on a later\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; date.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; However I am not sure for what =\r\nI have written.

The i=\r\ndea is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understan=\r\nds and appreciates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of symbolic stories o=\r\nf wars that the divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother fought, which explain how one can f=\r\night and overcome various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses that typically bind one in M=\r\naayaa. Reciting these stories on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular basis will promote the=\r\n fighting spirit within one that fights these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; There =\r\nis nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight/over=\r\ncome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; One aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcom=\r\ne it. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aspect of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. W=\r\nhen one realizes Self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the end, irrespective of the path taken,=\r\n one finally sees that all these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are aspects of a Single Mother w=\r\nho is also essentially true Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83?=\r\n =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read=\r\n the Aghora series books by Dr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Svobod=\r\nha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need to read more!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but =\r\nAghora is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed f=\r\neelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. =\r\nAghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is Ag=\r\nhora. A true=C3=83? Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terr=\r\nible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (go=\r\nd)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When so=\r\nmeone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carr=\r\nying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind o=\r\nneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only=\r\n the Lord is real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is: why should we remind ours=\r\nelves of this ultimate truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies? When someone=\r\n praises us for a supposedly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we have done and we are =\r\nabout to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naa=\r\nm satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illu=\r\nsions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary=\r\n illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing tha=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are=\r\n temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwe=\r\nll on temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel =\r\nsad or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. Thes=\r\ne abuses are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the =\r\nmind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind th=\r\ninks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rejects all *imperma=\r\nnent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them by cl=\r\nassifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nabout them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what i=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta =\r\nsays &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An ag=\r\nhora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritua=\r\nl where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eaten.=C3=83? But, please remember that eating f=\r\neces is not the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point. Perceiving Self in the food being con=\r\nsumed and not perceiving an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation of Self (fe=\r\nces, fruit etc), is the main point. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, eating feces wit=\r\nh disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is dwelling=\r\n on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating =\r\nit. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that =\r\nhe is Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has=\r\n the same notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when eating food=\r\n, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consuming Self&quot;. Nev=\r\nertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be fully =\r\nabsorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinj=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus=\r\n on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are tel=\r\nling themselves the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb that truth in=\r\nto every thought and impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting himself in an=\r\n extreme situation where failure results in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very bad dual exper=\r\nience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one to tr=\r\nanscend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Se=\r\nlf while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (o=\r\nr even not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a laddu or other food, what is the b=\r\nig deal? On the other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind fails to absorb in Self a=\r\nnd dwells on the taste of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgusting. Thus, =\r\nthe fact that failure results in a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience may a=\r\nct as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot =\r\nnecessarily be accomplished by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely because of an ince=\r\nntive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a =\r\nlot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness f=\r\nor sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual t=\r\nhoughts in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana and that is causing guilt and bl=\r\nocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and ke=\r\nep the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula =\r\nfor overcoming such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still =\r\ncome and distract one. Even if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, t=\r\nhere is no guarantee that the fascination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the mind does not re=\r\nturn to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination=\r\n some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He wil=\r\nl try to fix the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cause and remove fascination from the mind.=\r\n Instead of keeping sadhana and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two different activities (=\r\none pure and the other impure), he may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine them into one with=\r\nout such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an aghora sits n=\r\naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his =\r\njapam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists =\r\nto do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind =\r\nmay be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing somet=\r\nhing impure. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may no longer feel titillation.
