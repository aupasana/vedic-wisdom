My comments on that is:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara=\r\n,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 C=\r\nausal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everyth=\r\ning else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ord=\r\ninate with each other, and not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. A new-born =\r\nchild or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousnes=\r\ns coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, t=\r\nhat coordinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty =\r\nto interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you=\r\n have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of=\r\n I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR=\r\n Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 at=\r\ntributes of individualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am th=\r\nis&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or eg=\r\no principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physica=\r\nl body? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible pers=\r\non&quot;, one may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great =\r\nperson&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with =\r\nthe criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical =\r\nbody and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from di=\r\nstance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s cons=\r\nciousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the =\r\ncaller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to mo=\r\nre than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One m=\r\nay have forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may thi=\r\nnk of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different =\r\nbody or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so=\r\n and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away fr=\r\nom the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a =\r\ndream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea =\r\nthat ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamk=\r\nara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your ide=\r\na that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not =\r\nhave physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and =\r\nthinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, h=\r\ne would not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 idea=\r\ns of individualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we u=\r\nse the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, b=\r\nuddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, =\r\ninteracts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then man=\r\nas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various=\r\n things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to t=\r\nype this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists =\r\nas a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness=\r\n, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, =\r\nkarmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized consciousness an=\r\nd they play different roles while interacting with each other in different =\r\nways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in =\r\ndetails.

Even after a Soul is freed o=\r\nf the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Re=\r\nsurrection implies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkar=\r\na including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bod=\r\nied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part=\r\n cannot be the whole&quot;.

Each idea is independent of another, without requiring another id=\r\nea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the f=\r\nunctioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic ca=\r\nusal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each i=\r\ns independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamka=\r\nra. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as we=\r\nll as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of=\r\n Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharp=\r\nest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon th=\r\nat particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness i=\r\ns the very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through th=\r\ne Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Ast=\r\nral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see=\r\n the human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individ=\r\nualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not th=\r\ne same as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being=\r\n thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the entire indiv=\r\nidualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/per=\r\nceptive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consc=\r\niousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not derived fr=\r\nom any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral=\r\n consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a=\r\nn example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all t=\r\nhe beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides =\r\nin the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting contr=\r\nolled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this particular body =\r\nis &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies=\r\n themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they wo=\r\nuld attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound w=\r\norshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physica=\r\nl body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out o=\r\nf the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind=\r\n) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera=\r\n (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resu=\r\nrrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astr=\r\nal body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 funct=\r\nions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical=\r\n body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Phy=\r\nsical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements compr=\r\nising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a=\r\n whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different con=\r\nstituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the stag=\r\ning idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when=\r\n the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical v=\r\nibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta=\r\n with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being an=\r\nother variable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the other 3=\r\n4. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom =\r\nfrom Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditio=\r\nned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all the past incarn=\r\nations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inher=\r\nent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container co=\r\nntaining an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana =\r\nis required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including tho=\r\nse of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Gu=\r\nna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; repr=\r\nesents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving S=\r\natvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, on=\r\nly Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects=\r\n on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing=\r\n its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga =\r\nSutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is t=\r\nhe identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has =\r\nused Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use=\r\n any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Au=\r\ntobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roots in the as=\r\ntral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied b=\r\neings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism =\r\nhas to be rooted out while the consciousness is associated with the Physica=\r\nl Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The id=\r\nea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in=\r\n Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) w=\r\nhere Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted=\r\n to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay =\r\npermanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-conscio=\r\nusness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga S=\r\nutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanush=\r\nravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n That effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after obje=\r\ncts, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-a=\r\nttachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freed=\r\nom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the conscio=\r\nusness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an a=\r\nstral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yoga=\r\nshchittavrittin irodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements o=\r\nf Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by =\r\ntransferring the consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Ka=\r\nrma or otherwise as a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this cla=\r\nrifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up t=\r\nerminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limite=\r\nd to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal body as well.=\r\n In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bodies. Out of t=\r\nhe four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaar=\r\na (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain=\r\n till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi=\r\n also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (i=\r\nntellectual or thinking mind) analyzes current and past observations of min=\r\nd or chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) stores various observations o=\r\nr retrieves previously stored observations, they are all guided by the sens=\r\ne of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers of one&#39;s ind=\r\nividualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scri=\r\nptures have broken down the individualized consciousness into various group=\r\ns by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five praanas, five jn=\r\naanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. B=\r\nut ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire individualized con=\r\nsciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana means different thi=\r\nngs to different people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the path of contempl=\r\nation and discrimination. When a jnaana yogi reaches the final target, all =\r\nbodies and koshas are merged in cosmos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ &gt; wr=\r\note: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIn my opinion, there are three distinct phases that lead the sould to rise =\r\nabove Ego, Mind and Chitta - corresponding to the three bodies physical (St=\r\nhoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) resp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Rising above Ego is Jnana - Merging Physical body in Physical cosmos\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral cosmo=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga - Merging Causal body in Causal c=\r\nosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahma=\r\nn is YogaArudha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogr=\r\noups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

For example=\r\n, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One in=\r\ntrospects like this and, though the process of elimination, finally finds t=\r\nhe true Self.

Thats what makes your statements sound so in=\r\ncorrigible funny to say the least.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Wherein did I den=\r\ny that Ahamkara is not present in Astral/Causal bodies ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Y=\r\nou did deny it quite vehemently. Kindly check yourolder mails. You make a s=\r\ntatement A then in the course of discussion you conveniently change it to B=\r\n and then jump around assuming ridiculous airs. At least, try and remember =\r\nwhat you yourself speak. Go back and re check you own mails here.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Why is Ahamkara not dominant in Astral/Causal bodies ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The =\r\nreason I have already given in the first mail in sufficient detail.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thats again your assumption.&nbsp;Ahamkara is inde=\r\ned a dominant force in all\n planes untill one reaches a state beyond ego.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; BRING IT BACK AT REBIRTH TO THE EARTH. AND THEN, HE WILL RE=\r\nCLAIM HIS LOST TERRITORY AND WEALTH - THE CONFLICTS THAT WILL ARISE WILL BE=\r\n BEYOND ANYBODY&#39;S CONTROL. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This show=\r\ns that you have not understood even 1 percent of what has been told to you =\r\ntill now by other in this forum, maybe because you have already decided to =\r\nclose your mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ahamkara is NOT confied to acquirin=\r\ng or not acquiring of weath. THE specifics will depend on the law of karma.=\r\n The essential sense of I-ness will very much remain in ALL planes, the spe=\r\nciifcs gets filled in by karmic repurcussions and desires.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; THUS, THE BEAUTIFUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED=\r\n BY THE I-NESS OF MANAS, while CAUSAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF CH=\r\nITTA.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Any I-ness is Ahamkara. Period.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; i Sri\n Paramahansa Yogananda&quot;, he has mentioned about all these=\r\n things (what happens to a soul at death and so on) in such a simplistic ma=\r\nnner in his Gita commentaries, that even a layman can understand it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Is that the only book you have based all your fancy ideas =\r\non? Maybe its time for you go back to some more genuine reading with a open=\r\n mind. It will do you a world of good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regards,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajar=\r\nshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Proof by Contradiction&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; A pers=\r\non who lives as a farmer, should, after death, remain a farmer in the astra=\r\nl cosmos, and after subsequent astral death, should be reborn as the same f=\r\narmer with the same name and same identity as in his previous earthly incar=\r\nnation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Wrong example.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; A person after his death, depending on his tendencies in thi=\r\ns life and level of spiritual evolution will retain some aspects of his per=\r\nsonality, which means a person who loves music intensely&nbsp;will also in =\r\nhis next birth have an affinity for music.

My comments on that is:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived fro=\r\nm Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other idea o=\r\nf the 35 Causal-ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Reason:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Soul is the only T=\r\nruth and controller, everything else has an unreal and derived existence. T=\r\nhus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each oth=\r\ner. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic=\r\n-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coherently due to the astra=\r\nl-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact with man=\r\nas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus=\r\n, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its\n own sense of I-ness, not due to=\r\n Buddhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which one =\r\ngives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I=\r\n-ness or egosense or ego principle!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Is=\r\n one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If so=\r\nmeone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended o=\r\nr if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated=\r\n. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, eve=\r\nn though nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is bein=\r\ng used. When somebody calls one by\n name from distance (as opposed to patti=\r\nng on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;=\r\nI am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these example=\r\ns, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may =\r\nhave forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may think =\r\nof something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different bod=\r\ny or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so an=\r\nd so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from =\r\nthe physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dre=\r\nam. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutel=\r\ny unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do n=\r\not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incor=\r\nrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is=\r\n what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everything he =\r\ndoes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of =\r\nindividualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use th=\r\ne word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi=\r\n (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, inter=\r\nacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas in=\r\nteracts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various thin=\r\ngs. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type t=\r\nhis and I ended up typing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Your point =\r\nabout &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. =\r\nThe sense of\n I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the =\r\nsensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individuali=\r\nzed consciousness and they play different roles while interacting with each=\r\n other in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be co=\r\nntrols.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the term=\r\ninologies, though my mail didn&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details. Your=\r\n understanding is flawed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.=\r\n Where did you read this up ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One does=\r\n not &quot;read up&quot; these things in a single place.

Your understanding is flawed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to =\r\nthe ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the ph=\r\nysical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a=\r\n physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to\n fight with the idea of Ahamkara like =\r\nwe do.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego co=\r\nntrols manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; ...they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individuali=\r\nzed consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where =\r\ndid you read this up ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There=\r\n is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual So=\r\nul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after=\r\n a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is=\r\n not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up t=\r\nhe idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the=\r\n idea of Ahamkara because\n &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thu=\r\ns, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, does=\r\nn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is ind=\r\nependent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherw=\r\nise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Aham=\r\nkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basi=\r\nc causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, ea=\r\nch is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ah=\r\namkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning a=\r\ns well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the ide=\r\na of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or S=\r\nharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upo=\r\nn that particular\n idea.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of th=\r\ne entire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied be=\r\nings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the=\r\n same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierc=\r\ne the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very ba=\r\nsis&quot; of the entire individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unen=\r\nlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousn=\r\ness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousn=\r\ness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt;\n &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from =\r\nany idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral co=\r\nnsciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are=\r\n able to work through all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultane=\r\nously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so=\r\n on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say=\r\n that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they i=\r\nncarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal=\r\n- bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Posse=\r\nssion) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attem=\r\npt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out o=\r\nf\n the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the end=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected =\r\nSoul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19=\r\n ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions=\r\n of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ide=\r\nas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elements).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a=\r\n whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a t=\r\nime, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the correspon=\r\nding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas\n slippin=\r\ng out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other=\r\n modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is fi=\r\nnally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Ph=\r\nysical vibrations, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrati=\r\nons and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrat=\r\nions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another v=\r\nariable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even=\r\n illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ah=\r\namkara and so on...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chi=\r\ntta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions=\r\n of all the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it=\r\n doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those\n impressions, =\r\njust like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automaticall=\r\ny burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Sa=\r\nmskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Vipary=\r\naya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva=\r\n Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer =\r\nmy previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned=\r\n by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chit=\r\nta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains=\r\n, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinc=\r\nt from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Br=\r\nahman.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore=\r\n katmataivasmita -6&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is\n the identification of=\r\n the seer with the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead =\r\nof Ahamkara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any =\r\nof the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobio=\r\ngraphy of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-=\r\nbody and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings=\r\n can use thought to sense everything.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is as=\r\nsociated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the =\r\ncontroller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in Astral body, throug=\r\nh Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar i=\r\nllustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the p=\r\nleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted\n to stay permanently in the =\r\nCausal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is ass=\r\nociated with Manas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patan=\r\njali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashik=\r\nara samjnavairagyam -15-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tha=\r\nt effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects,=\r\n either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attac=\r\nhment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished b=\r\ny transferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral =\r\nKarma or otherwise as an astral-bodied being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogashch=\r\nittavrittin irodhah -2-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the=\r\n movements of Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to=\r\n Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a causal-bodi=\r\ned being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarif=\r\nies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up t=\r\nerminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limite=\r\nd to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal body as well.=\r\n In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bodies. Out of t=\r\nhe four antahkaranas, chitta\n (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaa=\r\nra (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remai=\r\nn till the end.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ah=\r\namkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also.
