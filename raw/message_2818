A sweet mango may have a bitter peel covering it. To enjoy the almond or mango, you have to remove the shell or peel and throw it away.\n \nSimilarly, the external signs may be unpleasant, but they may just be hiding some pleasant energy. *Some* holy places where you can see rampant commercialism (e.g. priests harrassing people for money and not focusing attention on the pooja) or ignorant adherence to the letter of the customs while breaking the spirit (e.g. forceful feeding of cows like you mentioned) may still be filled with excellent spiritual energy that you can tap into if you do some spiritual sadhana there!\n \n&gt; So, I kept wondering, that if these famous and energised idols have\n&gt; the power to raise the spiritual energies, then why did &quot;locals&quot; who\n&gt; have always been here, are getting corrupted.\n \nIn some temples, the energy has indeed been dissipated already and there isn&#39;t much left. The daily rituals and periodic re-energization rituals are not working well because people doing them are not upto it. There are many temples like that.\n \nHowever, there are also temples where there is powerful energy left still. It does not of course mean that everyone near that temple must be saattwik or spiritually elevated. To a blind-folded person, there is no difference between day and night. Even when Sun is shining brightly, he cannot see anything. Similarly, a person whose vision is blind-folded by the dark cloth of tamas cannot see the divine light near him.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs you correctly pointed out, good people sometimes ignorantly adhere to the letter of a custom while breaking its spirit blatantly.\n \nAn old astrologer once mentioned to me a griha pravesha (housewarming) ceremony he went to. It is believed that getting a cow inside a new house is an auspicious sign. So they rented a cow and got it inside the house. However, there were a few stairs to climb in order to get in and the cow was afraid to go up. They kept beating it agressively to force it to go up the stairs. That made this old astrologer very upset. Without any concern for propriety or diplomacy, he yelled at them for this unwise act, which was adharma in his view, and simply went out. Of course, they still persisted with their strategy and succeeded in finally getting the cow inside the house, thus following the recommendations of scriptures!\n \nUnfortunately, well-meaning people engage in wrong actions thinking them to be the right actions, as they do not understand the spirit of customs and blindly follow the letter of customs.\n \nSome religious activities of some people are based on fear, insecurity, greed etc, which are taamasik qualities, rather than love, compassion and surrender. That is the root of the problem.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBTW, Hari is correct. The temple I was thinking of is Vekkaali Amman temple near Tiruchirapally.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Narsimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for sharing your thoughts. They have helped me a lot on the query. Actually, I recently visited few (not to name any but also including 1 or 2 from your list) places with my parents. But, my experience was really bad. I could see lot of commercialism and greed invloved amongst everyone there including those in position over there. And spiritualism was difficult to find. I could feel spiritual vibes more outside (slightly away from the main building and crows) the temples than inside. And to my believe, these places would not have been like this always. So, I kept wondering, that if these famous and energised idols have the power to raise the spiritual energies, then why did &quot;locals&quot; who have always been here, are getting corrupted. But, then probably the tamas energies of people coming day in and out have overpowered or as you say visitors have made the incense disappear over the period of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have one experience to share, which is somewhat on similar lines. I was in Hardiwar with my parents on a certain &quot;Amavasya&quot;. After taking bath, they started looking for a cow to feed as per the custom. Fortunately or unfortunately, we could found a few (around 10) sitting at a certain place. But, they were surrounded by some 1000 odd people trying to feed them. And per my estimate a 10000 people would have already fed them per their &quot;Custom&quot;. Now, does it really make sense to forcibly feed a cow who already had her quota of 3-4 days, probably leading her to have digestion or food poisoning problems. I tried to convince my parents not to try to feed the, but could not succeed. And the whole day felt bad about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; In general, whatever holy place I have visited, I have hardly found it spiritual enough and have mostly felt disappointed. Rather, I always happen to see plentiful cases of useless greed which make me feel that to keep whatever goodness is left in one, he or she should never visit these places. As they are highly filled with Tamas now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Sriram\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

However, eventually the smell will be gone! How long it takes \n&gt; to disappear depends on how strong the smell was when the stick was \n&gt; burnt.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, when a great saint meditates in a place, \n&gt; the air there will be filled with that saint&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the \n&gt; saint leaves that place or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger \n&gt; there. Slowly it becomes weak and disappears.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In many famous temples these days, priests have \n&gt; become commercial and do not have the devotion needed. The rituals performed \n&gt; every few years to re-energize the idols \n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is my humble opinion that some famous temples do \n&gt; not have much divine presence today, though I do not want to name any names. At \n&gt; the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine \n&gt; presence.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I was very impressed with the Krishna temple \n&gt; in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and \n&gt; Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a \n&gt; tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples \n&gt; where the idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did \n&gt; not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in \n&gt; Calcutta.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was \n&gt; taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu \n&gt; before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that \n&gt; temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form of \n&gt; the divine Mother present there was a Tamil language name and I did not \n&gt; understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes \n&gt; and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a \n&gt; vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt \n&gt; that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the \n&gt; name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the \n&gt; goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof \n&gt; came down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the goddess \n&gt; likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I \n&gt; was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the \n&gt; name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a \n&gt; powerful divine presence across India.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one \n&gt; of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at \n&gt; Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the \n&gt; underground chamber there.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India is better \n&gt; for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with \n&gt; rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of \n&gt; sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my \n&gt; view is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are \n&gt; really good.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one has a chance to spend a few months doing \n&gt; spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east \n&gt; India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and \n&gt; Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, \n&gt; Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan \n&gt; and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam and Ujjain in \n&gt; central India.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are many other good places, but the above \n&gt; come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying there for \n&gt; several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual \n&gt; sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: \n&gt;   Astro \n&gt;   Seeker \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt;   \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 \n&gt;   AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n&gt;     \n&gt;       Respected Narsimhaji,\n&gt;         \n&gt;         I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples \n&gt;         etc) in today&#39;s time.
