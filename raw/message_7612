Do i have to read nyaas/dhyan with e=\r\nvery recitation of LNH? both LH n NH have different nyaas/dhyan?\n2. Daily i=\r\n read VS n L108 names as regular practice, can i read them after each LNH r=\r\necitation or just once at the end?\n3. Also daily i read namah to the satyan=\r\narayan parivar devata, mentioned by PVR long back in this forum. Do i read =\r\nthis also after every recitation?\n4. VS has its own viniyog, nyaas and dhya=\r\nn. do i read this as main strotra i am reading is LNH?\n5. Is there any laxm=\r\ni narayan mantra? i heard &quot;om shreem kleem lakshmi narayanaye namah&quot;\n\nappre=\r\nciate all the guidance.\n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
