Is it okay to do homam=\r\n while standing up? \n\nI once did a very simple homam while cooking. While t=\r\nhe food cooked for 20-30 minutes, I muttered the mantras and tended to a sm=\r\nall homam kunda (basically a brass bowl, with some wooden sticks and ghee a=\r\nnd basil leaf offerings) that I placed on the table next to the cooking foo=\r\nd. \n\nIt was a very pleasant experience. Far from feeling distracted, the si=\r\nmplicity of the whole process made it easier for me to focus on the mantra.=\r\n \n\nThe key thing is I could do this sort of a homam every day, as I cook mo=\r\nst days. And my family would not complain that I am spending too much time =\r\naway from them doing spiritual things. (It might even give the food a bette=\r\nr flavour as people say that food cooked while repeating mantras with feeli=\r\nng absorbs the mantra...who knows!)\n\nI am thinking of doing an ultra simple=\r\n homam while standing in the kitchen. Please tell me if you think this is a=\r\ngainst the scriptures, as I wouldn&#39;t want to do it if so.\n\nI know people sa=\r\ny feeling is more important that ritual. This homam procedure gives me a pr=\r\netty good feeling. I&#39;m planning to give it a try again and see how it feels=\r\n. I was wondering if there is anything in the scriptures that forbids doing=\r\n homam standing up? If I can generate concentration and feeling while stand=\r\ning and doing the homam, surely it will be equally effective (I hope so any=\r\nway). \n\nThanks very much in advance. Sorry if it sounds silly! \n\nAparna\n\nP.=\r\nS. I am doing a weekly homam the &#39;proper&#39; way i.e. sitting down and focussi=\r\nng. Just wanted to do a daily one and this would be the best way for me rig=\r\nht now. I have read the Agnihotra homam can be done &quot;anywhere&quot; so wondering=\r\n about other homams. \n\n\n"}}
