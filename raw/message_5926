You mentioned &quot;Om Shrim Hrim Aim&quot; Since it cont=\r\nains 3 beej of 3 aspects of devi is there any need to add any one name of d=\r\nevi after this mantra.\n\n\n\n2. I thought mantra had to have a seer before it =\r\nqualifies as being a mantra.\n\nis there any other good source on net for und=\r\nerstanding and knowing mantras by some realized yogi/guru\n\nOne source i kno=\r\nw is\n&quot;Meditations from the Tantras&quot; by Paramahamsa Swami Satyananda Saraswa=\r\nti listed at http://www.astrojyoti.com/mantras3.htm\n\n\n\n3. I know that vedic=\r\n mantras / gayatri have to have correct pronunciation. \n\na. Is the realisat=\r\nion of mantra hidden in the way its chanted or was this condition set to ma=\r\nke sure the words of vedas dont change over hundreds of years and possibly =\r\nlead to different literal meaning?\n\nb. What are your experiences with liste=\r\nning ghanam of vedic mantras?\n\n\n\n4. With my limited meditation background i=\r\n reach a state where i can see/feel my mind/thoughts. which of 3 options i =\r\nbest to stick to.\n\na. If i remain still and let thought waves pass, it simp=\r\nly remains clear for some time. mental clarity/peace is result\n\nb. If i cha=\r\nnt &quot;Om&quot; a particular kind of bliss/energy/feeling is result.\n\nc. If i chant=\r\n any diety mantra, mind like monkey starts to cling on image on god concept=\r\ns/grace related to god.\n\nThankyou for your guidance Narasimha.\n\nAkshay\n\n\n\n\n"}}
