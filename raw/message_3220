Most members of the society for=\r\n\nprevention of cruelty to animals (SPCA and similar organizations) in\nNorth=\r\n America and Europe are non-vegetarians.  They believe that animals\nthat lo=\r\nok cute and are friendly to humans should be treated properly and\nall other=\r\n animals which fit in the food chain should be killed\n*humanely*and eaten. =\r\n  In the US, a famous athelete called Michael Vick\nlost all of his fortune =\r\nas he was convicted of cruel behaviour to\nanimals when he was taken to task=\r\n by this same group of people.\n\nI would request any member to define *human=\r\ne* killing.  It is almost an\noxymoron since to be humane is *to be*\n\nI woul=\r\nd encourage people to watch the movie *Fast Food Nation*.  It\nshows the ins=\r\nide story of beef factories and what happens and how\nhumanely the cows are =\r\nkilled before they end up in burgers and stakes\nand what not.  Not suitable=\r\n for those faint of heart.
