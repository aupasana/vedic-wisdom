The concept of Shakti is a prin=\r\nciple that is over\n5000 years old. &quot;The Shakti Principle&quot; reintroduces to t=\r\noday&#39;s world the\nfeminine aspect of God, and a more rational way of viewing=\r\n ourselves and our\nreality. It offers humanity a profound philosophy of spi=\r\nritual environmentalism,\nwomen&#39;s liberation, and personal spiritual fulfill=\r\nment. This is a must read for\nanyone - both men and women - interested in p=\r\nersonal spiritual growth,\nunderstanding the teachings of Sanatana Dharma be=\r\ntter, or creating positive\nsocial change.
