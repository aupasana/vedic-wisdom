I do not want to comment on specific course=\r\ns or techniques, but will make a comment on Raja yoga practices in general.=\r\n\n \nBreathing is a very important activity and is connected to the balance b=\r\netween sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It maintains the li=\r\nfe force and emotional balance. Several breathing exercises are taught by v=\r\narious scriptures and traditions, such as praanaayaama taught by Baba Ramde=\r\nv of Patanjali Yoga Foundation, Kriya yoga taught by Mahavatar Babaji and P=\r\naramahamsa Yogananda, Sudarsana kriya taught by Art Of Living foundation.\n =\r\n\nAll these fall under Raja yoga, in the four-fold division of Jnaana, Bhakt=\r\ni, Karma and Raja yogas. If these exercises are used as a means to regulate=\r\n breathing and thoughts upto some level and keep the body fit, it is fine. =\r\nThey are quite useful.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI was watching a nice TV pro=\r\ngram of a Baba who popularized praanaayaamas like kapaalabhaati and anuloma=\r\n-viloma among Indian masses. He talked about breathing in and out slowly an=\r\nd gradually reaching nirbeeja samadhi through it. I was amused. Most people=\r\n have too many (and quite firm) impurities in their subtle bodies in the fo=\r\nrm of prior mental conditioning to be cleared just through breathing exerci=\r\nses and to reach samadhi - nirbeeja or sabeeja - just by doing praanaayaama=\r\n. However, I like the praanaayaamas he teaches. In fact, things like anulom=\r\na-viloma praanaayaama and kapaalabhaati are badly needed in today&#39;s stresse=\r\nd out world. However, I see this as something that relieves physical and em=\r\notional stress and enables better spiritual sadhana, rather than something =\r\nthat enables spiritual realization.\n \nOf course, there are yogic techniques=\r\n meant for raising Kundalini forcefully (e.g. bandhas such as Jalandhara ba=\r\nndha). But, with such techniques, one is playing with fire. Ramakrishna Par=\r\namahamsa discouraged his disciples (e.g. Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yogana=\r\nnda) from Hatha yoga and other Raja yoga practices, telling them to stay aw=\r\nay from practices that emphasize the body and to absorb the mind in god&#39;a n=\r\name instead. He said that realizng god through practices that emphasize the=\r\n body and its perfection, is nearly impossible in this age due to impuritie=\r\ns present everywhere, in food, water, air and thinking.\n \nIf one practices =\r\nyama, niyama etc and attains perfect composure, then it may be possible to =\r\ngo into samadhi through the control of breathing. But it is unrealistic for=\r\n most people. Suppose one has an ocean (samsaara) to cross and a boat (body=\r\n) is given to one. If one is close to the bank (liberation), one can just j=\r\nump out of the boat and land on the bank. If one in the middle of an ocean =\r\njumps out of the boat, one will only sink in the ocean! In jnaana yoga, bha=\r\nkti yoga or karma yoga, one uses knowledge or faith or ability to work with=\r\nout expectations as a rudder to steer the boat towards the bank. In raaja y=\r\noga, one takes control like a raja (king) and just jumps out of the boat. T=\r\nhat will work if one is close to the bank, i.e. already quite elevated. Oth=\r\nerwise, just jumping out of the boat is very risky. Raja yoga requires a lo=\r\nt of preparation. One in Raja yoga practices needs a good guru to gauge one=\r\n&#39;s progress and prescribe the next steps at every stage. If some things are=\r\n done too early, it may result in irreversible damage.\n \nBottomline: Use va=\r\nrious praanaayaamas, kriyas and other exercises for physical and emotional =\r\nhealth and to create an environment conducive to spiritual sadhana. But do =\r\nnot be under an impression that you can realize god through such activities=\r\n alone. That may have been possible in the past, but it nearly impossible f=\r\nor most people today.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding charging a lot of m=\r\noney for such things, one should realize that Ramakrishna and Ramana mahars=\r\nhi stayed away from money for a reason. When Srila Prabhupada initiated so =\r\nmany people into mahamantra, he did not charge any fee. He had faith in Kri=\r\nshna and ended up building a really big organization, though he did not dem=\r\nand any fee for his lectures or initiations and did not keep his teachings =\r\nsecretive.\n \nIf Ramakrishna Mutt is doing great service even today, it is b=\r\necause the organization was built by Swami Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, =\r\nSwami Shivananda and Swami Premananda with a lot of sattwa guna and they ke=\r\npt rajas and tamas at bay. They suffered in the beginning and it took a lon=\r\ng time to build, but it will last a long time. Things built with tamas or r=\r\najas do not last too long and do not take people to god. One intending to b=\r\nuild an organization to fulfil one&#39;s dharma should try to ensure that sattw=\r\na drives the activities and not rajas or tamas. Usually, money brings rajas=\r\n or even tamas into picture and that is why great masters have been wary.\n =\r\n\nThere may be exceptions of course. All activities of a fully realized and =\r\nliberated soul without any self-identification are guided by sattwa. If suc=\r\nh a person builds an organization based on selling divine knowledge, it mea=\r\nns that Nature wanted him/her to sell divine knowledge for some reason. Suc=\r\nh things are possible but rare. In general, you see great souls like Ramakr=\r\nishna, Ramana Maharshi and Srila Prabhupada operating within their means an=\r\nd not charging for spiritual knowledge.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam =\r\nYourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.com=\r\ncast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJy=\r\notish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
