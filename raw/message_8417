The message can actually inspire almost everybody who are some or the oth=\r\ner way in to spiritual Sadhana including the people who are truly confused.=\r\n\n\nIt is inspiring for the people who are getting pulled in too many directi=\r\non of life due to various sense weaknesses as well as various responsibilit=\r\nies,but who still rue the fact that they waste away their time and instead =\r\nshould invest that for God. It is also inspiring & eye opener for the peopl=\r\ne who talk big philosopohies and love of God and what may have you but shy =\r\naway from even a little bit of sadhana. It is a spiritual Tamacha which is =\r\nrequired occassionaly to all of us or most of us in varying degree includin=\r\ng the writer of the message.It is also for the people who are really deep i=\r\nn to Sadhana and still want to be better at that. I am of the opinion that =\r\nthis message, in future, will truly inspire some fortunate few and change t=\r\nhe course of their lives. As is everybody&#39;s experience in life that sometim=\r\ne Slap works much faster and better. Bitter medicines cures faster, Harsh t=\r\nruth needs to be spoken sometimes for good and there are so many examples w=\r\nhere it is recorded that many a times, Spiritual Gurus have push very bitte=\r\nr pills for their disciples.     \nI sincerely hope that readers do not get =\r\ndepress or angry/furious or even confuse due to the bluntness of the messag=\r\ne. I hope also that Ahmkaara does not get hurt. As the basic and important =\r\nWisdom goes - not get lost in words but to understand the soul of message -=\r\n and that will happen is my wish. It must bang the door of one&#39;s heart so t=\r\nhat little by little people start cutting down on many unnecessary entertai=\r\nnment and use more time for God or whatever term one like to use. This lect=\r\nure includes Me in the first palce. Shuruat merese Ho!\n\nThis is not at all =\r\na &quot;Vyakti Puja&quot; or something like that....but it is &quot;Message Puja&quot; surely!\n=\r\nThat message was like &quot;cleansing spirit&quot; on the wound and your response was=\r\n like a &quot;soothing Malam&quot; and i wrote for shhhhfuuu..shhhhfuuu\n\nFinsihing th=\r\nis, I wish you and everybody, a very happy Gupt Navaratri!\n\nYours Lovingly,=\r\n\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nice and blunt message that can truly inspire some sadhakas wh=\r\no are \n&gt; confused!\n&gt; \n&gt; But I can see that there will be many people for wh=\r\nom this message is \n&gt; not appropriate. I have a different message for them.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; It is ok if you do not really want God badly=\r\n. It is ok if you do not \n&gt; spend many hours in sadhana or sit still for lo=\r\nng durations of time. Not \n&gt; everyone can do that. Not everyone is meant to=\r\n realize god in this life \n&gt; and that is perfectly ok.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just spend time=\r\n doing whatever you are doing now and enjoy whatever \n&gt; aspects of life you=\r\n are enjoying now. But, try to make one small change. \n&gt; Try to be less sel=\r\nfish and more giving. All actions and dealings in this \n&gt; world involve giv=\r\ne and take. If an action&#39;s sole purpose is taking \n&gt; rather than giving, gi=\r\nve it less priority. If an action involves more \n&gt; giving than taking or at=\r\nleast balances give and take to a large extent, \n&gt; give it higher priority.=\r\n Like this, pick better actions, be mindful of \n&gt; others and try to be givi=\r\nng and unselfish.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If you spend 20 minutes doi=\r\nng a small homam everyday and try to do the \n&gt; above, THAT is enough for mo=\r\nst people. Yes, you may not realize god in \n&gt; this life (or, who knows, you=\r\n may), but, so what? You may make progress \n&gt; and may get a better chance i=\r\nn future.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, not everyone who plays t=\r\nennis needs to win a grand slam. One \n&gt; can play it, get some exercise and =\r\njust stay healthy! It is not \n&gt; necessary to either go for winning a grand =\r\nslam or give up tennis. There \n&gt; is a &quot;middle ground&quot; that is far more appr=\r\nopriate for far more people!\n&gt; \n&gt; So, my friends, those who want a grand sl=\r\nam, spend a lot more time in \n&gt; practice (sadhana) and those who don&#39;t care=\r\n, play it and stay fit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrolo=\r\ngy & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; On Thu, Jun 21, 2012 at 2:43 PM, scsa_taker3 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     (Itna sann=\r\nata kyun hai bhai???)\n&gt; ( Please chant as much while reading this, chant ra=\r\nm, krishna,allah, \n&gt; wahe - guru,  or whatever name you so please, chant yo=\r\nur mantra, because \n&gt; who knows when that heart attack comes )\n&gt; \n&gt; How bad=\r\n do you want God????\n&gt; \n&gt; A modified version of a really popular audio. The=\r\n modified version \n&gt; applies a lot to us, fools lost in oblivion trying to =\r\nlearn more and \n&gt; more and more theories instead of doing sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quo=\r\nted with modifications pertaining to Mr God.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;There was a young man,=\r\n you know, who wanted to reach god/be super \n&gt; siddha or something and so h=\r\ne went to this guru. The guru was very very \n&gt; advanced, a legend in his ow=\r\nn right. And he told the guru you know I \n&gt; wanna be on the same level you =\r\nare and the guru said if you wanna be on \n&gt; the same level I&#39;m on, I&#39;ll met=\r\n you tomorrow at the beach.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the young man got there 4 A.M. he was  =\r\nall ready to rock n&#39; roll. He \n&gt; was dressed properly, but he should have w=\r\norn shorts. The old man grabs \n&gt; his hand and said: How bad do you wanna be=\r\n successful ( basically \n&gt; achieve god, have siddhi and the like, all refer=\r\nences to success from \n&gt; hereon now mean uniting with god ) ? He said: &quot;Rea=\r\nl bad&quot;. He said: Walk \n&gt; on out in the water. So he walks out into the wate=\r\nr. When he walks out \n&gt; to the water he goes waist deep and goes like this =\r\nold man is crazy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The young man was thinking , &quot;Hey I wanna meet god, =\r\nachieve siddhi in my \n&gt; sadhana, get out of this birth death cycle etc. etc=\r\n. and this foolish \n&gt; old man got me out here swimming. I didn&#39;t ask to be =\r\na lifeguard. I \n&gt; wanna meet god he got me in water =C2=96 so the old man s=\r\naid go on a little \n&gt; further =C2=96 the young man walked out a little furt=\r\nher =C2=96 then the young man \n&gt; was neck deep in water - the young man was=\r\n thinking  this old man is \n&gt; crazy =C2=96 everybody calls him a paramhansa=\r\n, a mahapurusha, god incarnate \n&gt; but he is definitely crazy. So the old ma=\r\nn again said go on out a little \n&gt; further =C2=96 the young man went out a =\r\nlittle further, the water was now \n&gt; right at his mouth =C2=96the young man=\r\n was now thinking of going back, this \n&gt; old hack is out of his fucking min=\r\nd. And then the old man said: &quot;I \n&gt; thought you said you wanted to be succe=\r\nssful?&quot; He said: &quot;I do.&quot; He said: \n&gt; &quot;Then walk a little further.&quot; Then the=\r\n old man followed this guy into \n&gt; the water, he grabbed the young man&#39;s he=\r\nad, and held him down \n&gt; underwater. The old guy held the young man, till  =\r\nthe young man was \n&gt; about to pass out, the young guys arms were now splash=\r\ning the water in \n&gt; desperation, then suddenly the guru raised him up. He s=\r\naid: &quot;I got a \n&gt; question for you.&quot; He told the young guy, he said: &quot;When y=\r\nou want to \n&gt; succeed as bad as you wanna breathe than you will be successf=\r\nul.&quot;\n&gt; (Succeed =3D uniting with god, or seeing god, or achieving supernatu=\r\nral \n&gt; powers, or siddhi, or whatever, thats subjective, upto you.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I =\r\ndon&#39;t know how many of you all got asthma here in Vedic wisdom? If you \n&gt; e=\r\nver had a asthma attack before, you are short of breath S.O.B,due to \n&gt; sho=\r\nrtness of breath, you start wheezing, &quot;hai, hai, hai&quot; like you have \n&gt; run =\r\n10,000kms in one go, the only thing you are trying to do at that \n&gt; moment =\r\nduring the attack, is get some air. You don&#39;t care about no \n&gt; basketball g=\r\name, you don&#39;t care about what&#39;s on T.V., you don&#39;t care \n&gt; about nobody ca=\r\nlling you, you don&#39;t care about a party. The only thing \n&gt; you care about w=\r\nhen you trying to breathe is to get some fresh air. \n&gt; That&#39;s it! And when =\r\nyou get to the point where all you wanna do is be is \n&gt; successful as bad a=\r\ns you wanna breathe then you will be successful. And \n&gt; I&#39;m here to tell yo=\r\nu that number one, most of you say you wanna be \n&gt; successful but you don&#39;t=\r\n want it bad, you just kind of want it. You \n&gt; don&#39;t want it bad than you w=\r\nanna party. You don&#39;t want it as much as you \n&gt; want to be cool. Most of yo=\r\nu don&#39;t want success as much as you want \n&gt; sleep. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; (Again Success =\r\n=3D uniting with god, or seeing god, or achieving \n&gt; supernatural powers, o=\r\nr siddhi, or whatever, thats subjective, upto \n&gt; you.)\n&gt; End Quote\n&gt; \n&gt; Ign=\r\nore the following video , focus on the audio in it. with the above \n&gt; modif=\r\nications.\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dnw41UQU_J0A\n&gt; \n&gt; Do all of you=\r\n remember that Visa call from your perspective \n&gt; embassies????\n&gt; Remember =\r\nthose???\n&gt; The interviews???\n&gt; Even if you had slept at 4 in the morning, t=\r\nhe night before, you would \n&gt; still wake up and be at the embassy office at=\r\n 7, or whenever your \n&gt; appointment was.\n&gt; Hell even if you had high fever =\r\n102 or something, you would still reach.\n&gt; Do you remember that flight to t=\r\nhe states???\n&gt; Ohhhh Ammmerrriiiiicaaaaaaa!!!!

Wah, wah!!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Surely sire/ madame, god will be yours=\r\n, yes, yes surely.

Then post ap=\r\nologies, my goodness, the \n&gt; noise. Waste of a human birth, if you were to =\r\nsee the line waiting for a \n&gt; human womb, and then realize &quot;I&quot; have to stan=\r\nd at the end of this line, \n&gt; you would piss yourself. Some girl after seei=\r\nng it did, and has always \n&gt; been a little urgent with her sadhana ever sin=\r\nce then.\n&gt; \n&gt; I see this question getting asked a lot, that &quot;how do you fin=\r\nd a \n&gt; guru????&quot;\n&gt; And you know everyone, wants a high powered one, not any=\r\n other will do.\n&gt; See a high powered guru, also requires a good disciple.\n&gt;=\r\n Are you good enough, honestly answer this??? Many will say no, many will \n=\r\n&gt; say good or not, its the guru&#39;s job to deal with it etc etc, but are you =\r\n\n&gt; willing to work on yourself to spare the guru some work???? Why would a =\r\n\n&gt; high powered one come and teach you??? only after your penance is good \n=\r\n&gt; enough na? otherwise, he/she will be busy in his/her union with god.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Now how bad do you want god?\n&gt; How bad do you want a guru?\n&gt;   How bad do =\r\nyou want those spiritual states?\n&gt; How bad do you want the darsahn for your=\r\n beloved?\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t kind of want it, want it bad, time is running out, and=\r\n very soon, \n&gt; another rebirth, again the young age, again the teenage, aga=\r\nin the \n&gt; affairs, again the hormone spikes, again the degrees, again the s=\r\nucky \n&gt; jobs, again confused with life, again the financial nightmares, aga=\r\nin \n&gt; the heart attacks , again the death, and again, again. Hai ram!!!!\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll end this post with an example, a businessman in Delhi in the \n&gt; 194=\r\n0&#39;s, had done a bit of penance and you know was highly interested in \n&gt; god=\r\n , shod and all this stuff. So one day , he had gone to kerala, and \n&gt; met =\r\na guy who was proclaimed in the village to be equivalent to lord \n&gt; voldmeo=\r\nrt or something but on the god side.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the guy went to meet the guy w=\r\nhose name can&#39;t be taken and asked him \n&gt; , i am looking for a guru, the ol=\r\nd fella said , for what exactly are you \n&gt; looking for a guru??? The busine=\r\nss man said, , you know to learn stuff. \n&gt; The old fellow said what are you=\r\n willing to do for your guru??? The \n&gt; businessman said anything. The old f=\r\nella said, okay take all your \n&gt; clothes off, the businessman was shocked. =\r\nthe suit guy took them off \n&gt; reluctantly. then the old fella, told him , w=\r\near a patta around your \n&gt; neck and roam around the town naked. The busines=\r\nsman was aghast, but the \n&gt; old fella, told him &quot;anything right???&quot;, the bu=\r\nsinessman very BADLY \n&gt; wanted a guru, so he went and got shoes thrown at h=\r\nim, came back after \n&gt; half an hour to find the old fella gone and his clot=\r\nhes gone too. He sat \n&gt; there sobbing, and sobbing and cursing god, that i =\r\nwas the biggest fool \n&gt; to come here and trust this man. But then as he hai=\r\nd read somewhere, why \n&gt; waste time, he started meditating and chanted. 3 h=\r\nours went by no sign \n&gt; of the old man, 4 then 5 but by the 6th, the old fe=\r\nlla reappeared, and \n&gt; said &quot; here are your clothes, go back to your town.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The businessman just didn&#39;t want to say anything tried to get up, but=\r\n \n&gt; couldn&#39;t move. The old fella was weeping with joy, stating that finally=\r\n \n&gt; he has found someone worthy enough to teach.
