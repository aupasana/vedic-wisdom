Some people cannot see beyond a man&#39;s name and religion and hence canno=\r\nt recognize when a great celestial being is born in a different religion.\n =\r\n\nSwami Vimalananda, the Aghori yogi mentioned in the &quot;Aghora&quot; series books,=\r\n is somebody who achieved the highest states of consciousness. He received =\r\na lot of knowledge directly from Mother Tara. Accordinging to him, Akbar an=\r\nd Jodha were the re-incarnation of Samyukta and Rajput King Prithviraj Chou=\r\nhan. As Prithviraj, he repelled so many Muslim invaders at the border of In=\r\ndia. When Muslims finally conquered India, he was reborn as one of them and=\r\n put breaks on their aggression and changed their ways.\n \nIn that age, Musl=\r\nim invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed temples, libraries and other re=\r\nlics of native religion and culture. They beheaded Hindus who refused to co=\r\nnvert, they raped Hindu women and they beheaded defeated kings. They just t=\r\nried to wipe out the native religion and culture and replace with theirs. A=\r\nkbar slowed down the barbarism and aggression and promoted tolerance and in=\r\ntegration. He stopped the forced conversions, rapes and beheadings of Hindu=\r\ns. He stopped the destruction of temples and libraries. He talked about res=\r\npecting other religions while following one&#39;s own religion. He even took on=\r\n the mighty Muslim clerics when he abolished a special tax on Hindus based =\r\non religion. He was a man of great character, conviction and principles and=\r\n was utterly fearless. He had affinity for Rajputs and was even born in a R=\r\najput family and spent early years there. He displayed the samskaras and in=\r\nstincts of a refined and cultured Rajput more than those a of Mughal king -=\r\n he was so unlike his grandfather Babar, father Humayun and step-brother Ad=\r\nham.\n \nHe used to offer arghyas to Sun in the morning and then participate =\r\nin a Zoroastrian fire ritual of Farsis (similar to our homam) and then do a=\r\n namaz with Muslim clerics. Such tolerance was unheard of from any other Mu=\r\nslim ruler in those days (or perhaps even today!). Towards the end of his l=\r\nife, he even started his own religion, which was based on his realization a=\r\nnd is quite noble. He was a spiritually elevated soul. Irrespective of the =\r\nreligion one follows, one deserves our respect and admiration if one embodi=\r\nes the spirit of sanatana dharma in one&#39;s thoughts and actions.\n \nAkbar was=\r\n a true hero - a being who came down from a higher loka to fulfil a certain=\r\n mission with the blessings of rishis. His contribution to the safekeeping =\r\nof sanatana dharma is not to be judged from what harm his fellow Muslims in=\r\nflicted on sanatana dharma. His contribution is to be judged from what *mor=\r\ne* harm to sanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If he had not come, I have no=\r\n doubt that sanatana dharma would have suffered much much more than it did.=\r\n That was not the wish of rishis and that is why they sent somebody to alte=\r\nr the course and minimize the harm. It is unfortunate that those who see th=\r\ne goodness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji cannot see the goodness of Ak=\r\nbar simply because he was a Muslim.\n \nIt is unfortunate that some Hindus ar=\r\ne equating Akbar with the other cruel and barbaric Muslim kings. Who should=\r\n be (was) a friend of Hindus is being portrayed as an enemy and being shot =\r\ndown. Instead, we should promote his story and inspire more people to be li=\r\nke him. He was a great inspirational figure then and should be now too.\n \nT=\r\nhe epic movie &quot;Jodha Albar&quot; is a very good movie about one of the greatest =\r\nand most dharmik emperors of India. The director and actor did justice to a=\r\n man of great character that Akbar was. I am sad about the mud-slinging tha=\r\nt some of my fellow Hindus are engaging in. Please do not assassinate the c=\r\nharacter of Akbar.\n \nIf you want, please make movies of the same caliber an=\r\nd cinematic excellence on great Hindu heroes such as Chatrapati Shivaji, Pr=\r\nithviraj Chouhan, Sri Krishnadeva Raya, Vikramarka, Salivahana, Ashoka, Jna=\r\naneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Vi=\r\nvekananda, Ramana Maharshi etc. But there is no need to denigrate a fine mo=\r\nvie made on Akbar.\n \nThese are my 2 cents on the fire over Jodha Akbar.\n \nB=\r\nest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/=\r\nhomam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish=\r\n lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n\n  Namaskar\n\n  This i=\r\ns an awareness drive to awake people to boycott movie &#39;Jodhaa Akbar&#39;.\n\n  Th=\r\ne movie Jodhaa Akbar is a vile, vicious, and covert attempt by a mischievou=\r\ns producer/director from Bollywood (Mumbai) to make quick bucks by denigrat=\r\ning and vilifying the Hindu (Rajput) people.
