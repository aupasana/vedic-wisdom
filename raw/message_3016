Is it to avoid the I -factor again?  \n \nIn the manual its not =\r\nmentioned how to invoke Varuna? If I invoke varuna is it necessary to do th=\r\ne shodashodasopachaara pooja or a simple Panchopachara prayer can be done? =\r\nWhere can I find the Pavamana Sooktam? I couldn&#39;t find it in the manual.\n\nI=\r\ns darbha grass same as dhruva grass? Are they easily available in pooja sto=\r\nres in India? If I want to use the twigs how do I place it as twigs both en=\r\nds look the same as in the manual it mentions \n\n&quot;Take a darbha. Place it in=\r\nside the homa kundam (on the base), with the tip of the darbha facing east =\r\nand the other end facing west. Take another darbha. Place it inside, with t=\r\nhe tip of the darbha\nfacing north and the other end facing south.&quot;\n\nFor the=\r\n lakshmi homam I wish to pray the ashta mahalakshmi how do I do it?\n\nOne qu=\r\nestion about pranpratishta: \n\nWe pray gods in different forms so when we in=\r\nvoke the gods how does the prana come inside the idol in that form. For eg:=\r\n Goddess Lakshmi is associated with wealth so how does that shakti come on =\r\nit. Is it due to the mantras and thoughts we recite changes the power? Than=\r\nks so much for all the guidance you have been giving so far,\n\nBest regards,=\r\n\nSudha\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am glad you tried it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. As I said before, =\r\nanybody who wishes to formally have a guru figure in the mind for this proc=\r\nedure may think of me as the guru for this procedure, without asking specif=\r\nically.\n&gt;  \n&gt; My permission is always there, but I am nobody to give blessi=\r\nngs.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. Yes, that would be alright. South-west is considered a good p=\r\nlace for Ganapathi specifically.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. Krishna needs to do nothing, but =\r\nhe does everything.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Krishna is the supreme cosmic being. He is the su=\r\nm total of all beings. All the worlds and beings of this universe rest insi=\r\nde him. He sees, hears, eats, wishes, knows and acts through all beings of =\r\nthis universe.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The notion &quot;I am doing it&quot; causes pride and increases =\r\nattachment to the result. The notion &quot;god is doing through me&quot; increases de=\r\nvotion and detachment to the result. In all rituals, they say krishnaarpana=\r\nmastu at the end, as it is conducive to thoughts like &quot;god is doing through=\r\n me and I am a mere instrument&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 4. Agni and other deities will be mo=\r\nre offended by a proud person with good pronunciation who thinks &quot;what a ni=\r\nce and competent ritual I am doing right now and how good my pronunciation =\r\nis!&quot; A person having humility and devotion but pronouncing weakly is in a m=\r\nuch better position. \n&gt;  \n&gt; One more thing.. Pronunciation can be improved =\r\neasily. But humility and devotion cannot be improved that easily. It takes =\r\na much longer time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; So keep up your humility and devotion and slowly =\r\ntry to improve the pronunciation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; All the best with homam!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best=\r\n regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana=\r\n\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish =\r\nlessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:=\r\n//www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- &quot;Om.NamoNarayanaya&quot; &lt;om.namonarayanaya@...&gt; wro=\r\nte: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Guruji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your MahaGanapati=\r\n homam procedure document.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would really appreciate if you could =\r\nkindly help answer these  \n&gt; &gt; queries:-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.\tI realised while perfo=\r\nrming the homam for the first time today,  \n&gt; &gt; that I have yet to obtain y=\r\nour permission and blessings to name you as  \n&gt; &gt; my guru. I would really\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \tappreciate if you could kindly grant me your permission and blessings.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2.\tYou mentioned that the Ganapati idol has to be placed on the Ea=\r\nst  \n&gt; &gt; side of the homam kundam. I also noticed the same in your video.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \tMy homam kundam is slightly bigger at 15 inches square. Thus if I  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n place the idol on the East side, I find it difficult to offer the  \n&gt; &gt; it=\r\nems during the pooja.\n&gt; &gt; \tIs it aright to place the idol nearer, i.e. on t=\r\nhe South-West or  \n&gt; &gt; North-West corner so that it is easily accessible?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3.\tWhat is the significance of offering the doership of the homam t=\r\no  \n&gt; &gt; Lord Krishna at the end?\n&gt; &gt; \tThe homam was offered with the intent=\r\nion of spiritual cleansing and  \n&gt; &gt; upliftment. I am sure Lord Krishna doe=\r\ns not require spiritual  \n&gt; &gt; cleansing and upliftment.\n&gt; &gt; \tSo what then i=\r\ns the significance of offering the doership to Lord  \n&gt; &gt; Krishna?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n 4.\tMy knowledge of Sanskrit is very basic and thus my pronunciation  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nrequires my improvement. I am really worried that my pronunciation of  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n the mantras may be wrong\n&gt; &gt; \tin many places. While I try my best to liste=\r\nn to your video and  \n&gt; &gt; learn, I realise that this is a long process.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \tI do realise  that you had provided a very short procedure requiring=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; very little mantras. However I find that my knowledge  is somewhere =\r\nin  \n&gt; &gt; between your 2 procedures.\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \tWould I be committing any gr=\r\nave mistakes and thus offending the  \n&gt; &gt; deities and Agni?\n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; Thank=\r\n you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Om Shanti Shanti Shanti\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warmest Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Naraya=\r\nnan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
