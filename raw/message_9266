More importantly, if your understanding is correct, w=\r\nhy isn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring well b=\r\nefore?\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nFirst, regar=\r\nding Krishna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say tha=\r\nt Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned=\r\n that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot;\n (used that e=\r\nxact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (t=\r\nhough paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).\n=A0\nSecondly, after describing th=\r\ne avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and that al=\r\nl rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is un=\r\nder THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are parti=\r\nal, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishn=\r\na *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to say=\r\n that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above, P=\r\nararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n=A0\n=\r\nThird, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if=\r\n an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWhile SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it a=\r\nlso says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in\n reality formless (ar=\r\nUpa) and of the nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured =\r\nby the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms of =\r\nLord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is=\r\n beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again=\r\n, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lor=\r\nd Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on =\r\ntheir fancies and conditioning..\n=A0\nAll beings are made up of paramatma (s=\r\nupreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter port=\r\nion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great ava=\r\ntaras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras desc=\r\nend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna a=\r\nre specific examples given by Parasara.\n=A0\nThey are entirely divine, but t=\r\nhey do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After all,\n &quot;entire divinity=\r\n&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contain the entir=\r\ne sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing the divine will bu=\r\nt NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n&gt; Buddha was great spiritual forc=\r\ne in this world. But I do not\n&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary A=\r\nvatars. His\n&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization,\n&gt;=\r\n an end in a void.\n=A0\nFirst, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as wel=\r\nl as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary =\r\nAvatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not =\r\n&quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n=A0\nSecondly, as per Parasara,\n Buddha corr=\r\nesponds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the spirit of investig=\r\nation and comprehension. Logical mind and its spirit of comprehension are i=\r\nnherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehension is not capable=\r\n of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is beyond comprehensio=\r\nn. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt to compre=\r\nhend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical mind has a great=\r\n appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/wil=\r\nl be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nIf you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of=\r\n planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure that=\r\n the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a diff=\r\nerent matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring some as I=\r\n showed!.)\n=A0\nThe bottomline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s =\r\nlist actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each a=\r\nspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spi=\r\nrit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the sto=\r\nry of\n corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esot=\r\nerically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really need to unders=\r\ntand any higher scriptures and notions in them.\n=A0\nIf we take scriptures l=\r\niterally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Sh=\r\niva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would concl=\r\nude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and s=\r\no on.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nOn a differen=\r\nt note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and =\r\nlike Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to be essentiall=\r\ny the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating between them=\r\n. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for even rishis to=\r\n clearly comprehend. People seeing\n some significant difference between the=\r\nm are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. Same in the c=\r\nase of Krishna and Rama. Both were=A0 perfectly detached and fully divine k=\r\narma yogis.\n=A0\nIf we think about it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect repr=\r\nesented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represented by Sun) are not rea=\r\nlly that different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are not that different,=\r\n though the specifics of their stories may be different.\n=A0\nOne last word =\r\nthough. If someone truly believes that Krishna is superior to Rama and wors=\r\nhips Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for such a person. My argume=\r\nnts are more for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the bou=\r\nndaries of understanding in the long run, than changing the minds of anyone=\r\n in the short run. In the end, everyone of us will have to go through one&#39;s=\r\n own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution be=\r\nfore one starts grasping some fistfuls of Reality. These concepts are too s=\r\nubtle for anyone to convince others or be absolutely confident oneself!\n=A0=\r\n\nKrishnarpanamastu,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=A0\n\n\n&gt;___________________________=\r\n_____\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, May 4, 2013=\r\n 7:34 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Comparing Dasavataras!\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt;=\r\nNamaste,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Jai Ma!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have a different view point. Let me write do=\r\nwn as I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, t=\r\nhere are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatar=\r\na is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-nara=\r\nyana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goe=\r\ns ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Cant=\r\no, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the S=\r\nupreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;2. Of these various po=\r\nssible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded speci=\r\nal mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, spec=\r\nially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When =\r\nKrshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed =\r\nthe full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. A=\r\nll Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali=\r\n-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of=\r\n appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, K=\r\nrshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form=\r\n and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. Fr=\r\nom the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-ha=\r\nlf-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes posse=\r\nssion of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avata=\r\nra of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of =\r\nRama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spiritual=\r\nity is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressive realiza=\r\ntion of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the c=\r\nonsciousness and its development through various life-forms. Larger spiritu=\r\nality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design=\r\n for life on earth.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on =\r\nthe parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one=\r\n worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation =\r\nof the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devat=\r\na can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatar=\r\ns of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-ma=\r\nssive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna =\r\nare most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both inside as=\r\n well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age. Ram=\r\na represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in co=\r\nntrol of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within and=\r\n without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. Howev=\r\ner, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even thoug=\r\nh few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when c=\r\nircumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel deject=\r\ned while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear befor=\r\ne the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the late=\r\nr revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, R=\r\nama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not t=\r\no rescue her, but it was\n the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family hon=\r\nour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The w=\r\nay I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valm=\r\niki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an =\r\nobserver, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 year=\r\ns of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, =\r\nhe changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal consid=\r\neration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a =\r\nlesson of what a true leader must be!\n&gt;\n&gt;Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate =\r\ndetachment right from birth. I am not taking his=A0 supernatural feats into=\r\n account. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from =\r\npeople, from environment,\n from circumstances that mark his life. At the ag=\r\ne of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, hi=\r\ns foster parents, his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that=\r\n it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of h=\r\nis happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destina=\r\ntion. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t =\r\nunderstand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is ove=\r\nr. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking =\r\nhim to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them =\r\nstarted getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietl=\r\ny from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has=\r\n any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merel=\r\ny kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the =\r\n100th abuse was\n over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back in=\r\nto his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revol=\r\nutionist and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used =\r\nto think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna =\r\nshowed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish t=\r\nhe enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. =\r\nNever in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard=\r\n, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence i=\r\nn his actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then ri=\r\nght in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliv=\r\ner the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the =\r\nbest ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be =\r\ndejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to th=\r\ne\n instrument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Y=\r\navana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheem=\r\na to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, K=\r\nrshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must=\r\n be lined up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind o=\r\nf knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is c=\r\nonstantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find =\r\nthese kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmi=\r\nki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxill=\r\niary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramaya=\r\nna we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and th=\r\nen Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Ram=\r\na worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,\n the =\r\npicture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind.=\r\n Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of whi=\r\nch is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separat=\r\nion from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved =\r\nvery dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief=\r\n when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to=\r\n anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and the=\r\nrefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda neve=\r\nr left him even in the most trying situations.\n&gt;\n&gt;6. Buddha was great spiri=\r\ntual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evoluti=\r\nonary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realizati=\r\non, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth.=\r\n I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna\n espoused. None of=\r\n them negated this world. If negation of this world and life is the final a=\r\nim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary develop=\r\nment? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an A=\r\nvatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in t=\r\nhat sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Ava=\r\ntaras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaish=\r\nnava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara.=\r\n Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic,=\r\n outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed =\r\ntheir own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and =\r\ntherefore an object of reverence and realization.\n&gt;\n&gt;7. The original litera=\r\nture of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psyc=\r\nhological functions. 6 inside the human body\n and 3 too subtle, or non-deve=\r\nloped in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avat=\r\naras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full power and force of one of =\r\nthese 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciou=\r\nsness or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself is various p=\r\nossiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a grah=\r\na. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are n=\r\nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come.\n&gt;\n&gt;8. I cannot=\r\n comment on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of =\r\nwhat the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with i=\r\nt -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or t=\r\nextual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avat=\r\naras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say=\r\n in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka\n - the stainless one. There is only one t=\r\nhing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awas=\r\ntha comes living in the full and complete purity and might and force and st=\r\nrength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will =\r\nburn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolutio=\r\nn. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achiev=\r\ne his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse =\r\nand that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rec=\r\ntify the various errors and corruptions that beset our age. \n&gt;\n&gt;Well, this =\r\nis how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree wit=\r\nh my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to=\r\n truth.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt;=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAm=\r\nabuddhayah |\n&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;____=\r\n____________________________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krsh=\r\nna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Bu=\r\nddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of spiritu=\r\nality that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I w=\r\nant to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;linear =\r\nprogression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme =\r\nin a perfected form.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with plane=\r\nts. For example, Rama, Krishna and\n Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respe=\r\nctively.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;We also\n know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus,=\r\n Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiativ=\r\ne/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being =\r\nhappy, patience/discipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and deta=\r\nchment (respectively).\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression=\r\n of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of=\r\n how that aspect operates.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example o=\r\nf how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how min=\r\nd operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discri=\r\nmination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how ene=\r\nrgy/drive/initiative operates.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in=\r\n us, energy in us,\n learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, d=\r\niscipline/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the sa=\r\nme Self. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has di=\r\nfferent qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between=\r\n them.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect it and then pe=\r\nrfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in=\r\n the end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incompara=\r\nble and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;One who is fascinated by the qu=\r\nalities of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one=\r\n who is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that demonst=\r\nrates how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisd=\r\nom may like the story that\n demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. Bu=\r\nt this is just a matter of taste and subjective preference.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Let us focus on Rama and Kri=\r\nshna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, be=\r\ncause of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and has no agen=\r\ndas, no likes or dislikes.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Once mind fancies a separate existence wit=\r\nh some agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousness stem=\r\nming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength and suppo=\r\nrt to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy,=\r\n intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them =\r\nfully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassio=\r\nnately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws o=\r\nf Nature give proper fruits later\n on. It does all that despite full awaren=\r\ness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind=\r\n and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the notion=\r\n that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fu=\r\nlly in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionately.\n&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality =\r\nof an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interesting en=\r\nough to some.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas=\r\n. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achieving thi=\r\nngs. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! Though s=\r\noul is the support for everything else in the individualized consciousness,=\r\n soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keeps t=\r\nhe individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and even decid=\r\nes/affects\n every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of t=\r\nhe individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one who may =\r\nbe excited by this description!\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put R=\r\nama&#39;s life in perspective.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates=\r\n. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realiz=\r\ned. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon afte=\r\nr marriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished h=\r\nim to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was give=\r\nn the throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step=\r\n-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled =\r\nall three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Si=\r\nta in the forest\n with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would caus=\r\ne problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidna=\r\npped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted=\r\n Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her lat=\r\ner. He accepted every life situation with no complaints and did the best po=\r\nssible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or a=\r\nnger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to =\r\nhim and respectfully learned some subjects that were going to disappear wit=\r\nh Ravana!\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desire=\r\ns or agendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the mo=\r\nmentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!\n&gt;=A0\n=\r\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;As another example, =\r\nlet us look at Lord\n Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how w=\r\nisdom/discrimination operates.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;He was born as a learned pygmy. He fil=\r\nled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many gre=\r\nat qualities.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. =\r\nWhen one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride =\r\nor attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pride is sup=\r\npressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic qualiti=\r\nes are completely suppressed.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be un=\r\nderstood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of our consciousn=\r\ness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Let us not compar=\r\ne Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are=\r\n more\n attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and d=\r\nevelop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;By the way, happy Hanu=\r\nmajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools of =\r\nthought).\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;--------\n&gt;Astrology & Spiritualit=\r\ny Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n&gt;--------  \r\n---1593584224-348398366-1367715039=:12118\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica,=\r\n sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_136702521=\r\n5463_55&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;Namaste R=\r\najarshi,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Very nice to hear from you!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The &quot;unmista=\r\nkeable&quot; link to the *physical* evolution of life on earth does not imply an=\r\n increasing sequence of *spiritual* perfection, as you cannot directly map =\r\nthe physical to the spiritual. More importantly, if your understanding is c=\r\norrect, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurri=\r\nng well before?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;First, regarding K=\r\nrishna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama=\r\n is\n not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that=\r\n Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot;\n (used that exact =\r\nexpression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (though=\r\n paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, after describin=\r\ng the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and tha=\r\nt all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It i=\r\ns under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are p=\r\nartial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduction that Kr=\r\nishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to=\r\n say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said abov=\r\ne, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly do=\r\nes it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord\n Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it als=\r\no says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in\n reality formless (arUp=\r\na) and of the nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by=\r\n the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lo=\r\nrd to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is b=\r\neyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, =\r\nwhat is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord =\r\nHimself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on th=\r\neir fancies and conditioning..&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;All beings are made up of param=\r\natma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latt=\r\ner portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Gr=\r\neat avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avatar=\r\nas descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Kr=\r\nishna are specific examples given by Parasara.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;They are entire=\r\nly divine, but they do not encapsulate the\n entire divinity!!!! After all,\n=\r\n &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can =\r\ncontain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing t=\r\nhe divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Buddha was great spiritual =\r\nforce in this world. But I do not&lt;br&gt;&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evol=\r\nutionary Avatars. His&lt;br&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a stati=\r\nc realization,&lt;br&gt;&gt; an end in a void.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;First, he IS mentione=\r\nd in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; i=\r\nn your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wron=\r\ng and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Secondly, as per Parasara,\n Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies=\r\n logical mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mi=\r\nnd and its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;spirit of comprehe=\r\nnsion are &lt;/span&gt;inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehens=\r\nion is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is b=\r\neyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an=\r\n attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logica=\r\nl mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder=\r\n Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking o=\r\nf planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure tha=\r\nt the verses of SB you\n are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a di=\r\nfferent matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring some as=\r\n I showed!.)&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The bottomline as far as I am concerned is that P=\r\nararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The natur=\r\ne of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, S=\r\naturn - spirit of patience &amp; persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness e=\r\ntc) and the story of\n corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful c=\r\nonnection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really=\r\n need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, som=\r\ne would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inf=\r\nerior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deiti=\r\nes are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On a=\r\n different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to =\r\nTara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to be e=\r\nssentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating bet=\r\nween them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for even =\r\nrishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing\n some significant difference be=\r\ntween them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. Same=\r\n in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were&nbsp; perfectly detached and fu=\r\nlly divine karma yogis.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If we think about it, perfected mind (=\r\nparamatma &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;aspect represented =\r\nby &lt;/span&gt;Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353=\r\nyui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_13670=\r\n25215463_151&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;repr=\r\nesented by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid=\r\n Krishna and Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their sto=\r\nries may be different.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One last word though. If someone truly =\r\nbelieves that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice ver=\r\nsa!), I am very happy for such a person. My\n arguments are more for the sak=\r\ne of sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding=\r\n in the long run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In th=\r\ne end, everyone of us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various t=\r\namasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping=\r\n some fistfuls of Reality. These concepts are too subtle for anyone to conv=\r\nince others or be absolutely confident oneself!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div =\r\nclass=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_58&quot;

In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras=\r\n of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Mats=\r\nya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in=\r\n this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatar=\r\ns of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatar=\r\ns, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;=\r\nswayam Bhagawan.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div\n class=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_13670252154=\r\n63_87&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:Courier New, =\r\ncourier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-st=\r\nyle:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_1=\r\n98&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_88&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb=\r\n(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospac=\r\ne, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;2. Of these =\r\nvarious possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been acco=\r\nrded special mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual litera=\r\nture, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Pura=\r\nnas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had =\r\ncurtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in fu=\r\nll flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures o=\r\nf the Kali-Yuga, as are\n Tantras]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2=\r\n_64_1367025215463_89&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-famil=\r\ny:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;background-color:tran=\r\nsparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_=\r\n1367025215463_218&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_90&quot; sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:Courier New, courier, m=\r\nonaco, monospace, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal=\r\n;&quot;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurm=\r\na, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki=\r\n. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence of these ma=\r\nin avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the am=\r\nphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man =\r\n(first human life form who immediately takes possession of this earth repre=\r\nsented by Vamana&#39;s 3\n steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving=\r\n around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Ava=\r\ntara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to be\n separa=\r\nted into another world, but is a progressive realization of the various man=\r\nifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness and its de=\r\nvelopment through various life-forms. Larger\n spirituality of earth and evo=\r\nlution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on earth.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_219&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv4763=\r\n702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_91&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:=\r\n16px;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;backgr=\r\nound-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv47637=\r\n02353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_92&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:1=\r\n6px;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;backgro=\r\nund-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am =\r\nonly focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my conte=\r\nntion that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a sta=\r\nte of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hi=\r\nnduism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each =\r\none of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized\n in their own way and can be=\r\n consider\n super-massive spiritual dynamos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv47637023=\r\n53yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_271&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_136702=\r\n5215463_93&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:Courier =\r\nNew, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;fo=\r\nnt-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_270&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv4763702353yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_222&quot;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;5. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they re=\r\npresent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society=\r\n can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage=\r\n of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how t=\r\no transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a con=\r\nstructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sat=\r\ntwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is =\r\nstatic in\n nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As p=\r\ner the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in=\r\n the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana,=\r\n\n which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the =\r\nSun to Rama.\n At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most di=\r\nspassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was the=\r\n Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma =\r\nof that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic,=\r\n and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the thin=\r\ngs as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his =\r\nown preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama fa=\r\nced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most disp=\r\nassionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passio=\r\nns can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader =\r\nmust be!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from bir=\r\nth. I am not taking his&nbsp; supernatural feats into account. It is his si=\r\nngular and constant detachment from situations, from people, from environme=\r\nnt,\n from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides=\r\n to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his =\r\nvillage-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sens=\r\ne for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled vill=\r\nage life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to =\r\nreason with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promise=\r\nd he will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. =\r\nLater, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in =\r\ntheir dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealou=\r\ns and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, sayi=\r\nng that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right ove=\r\nr him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flower=\r\ns on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was\n over,=\r\n he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when=\r\n Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and charlatan=\r\n, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as =\r\nanother black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala ro=\r\nopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The ve=\r\nry next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mah=\r\nabharata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade=\r\n of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespe=\r\nctive of what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of t=\r\nhe greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime sp=\r\niritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yo=\r\nga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is imposs=\r\nible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the\n instrument. When ru=\r\nnning away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advisin=\r\ng Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to hit Duryodhana be=\r\nlow the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some D=\r\nivine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which wou=\r\nld cause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot com=\r\ne by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciou=\r\nsly connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex =\r\nsituations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course=\r\n, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelli=\r\nng, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 head=\r\ned demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Ady=\r\na Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if=\r\n we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,\n the picture that emerges i=\r\ns very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays=\r\n all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of which is self-control, as=\r\n well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita=\r\n whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa gun=\r\na creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is=\r\n shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this worl=\r\nd - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never af=\r\nfected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the=\r\n most trying situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this=\r\n world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His=\r\n realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a vo=\r\nid. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not i=\r\nn tune with what either Rama or Krshna\n espoused. None of them negated this=\r\n world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then why send =\r\nso many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If the spiri=\r\ntual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why n=\r\not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do =\r\nthey fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana =\r\nindicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in=\r\n parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to b=\r\ne complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life a=\r\ns well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of =\r\nspiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an objec=\r\nt of reverence and realization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. The original literature of the Na=\r\nth Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological func=\r\ntions. 6 inside the human body\n and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most =\r\npeople, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excludi=\r\nng Buddha - correspond to the full power and force of one of these 9 Chakra=\r\ns. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow=\r\n the consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities, a=\r\nre 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore t=\r\nhe chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in number.=\r\n And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. I cannot comment o=\r\nn which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the B=\r\nPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one =\r\ncannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual mis=\r\nrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has n=\r\not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Ag=\r\nhora books, Nishkalanka\n - the stainless one. There is only one thing which=\r\n is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes =\r\nliving in the full and complete purity and might and force and strength of =\r\nthe Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away =\r\nopposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Kr=\r\nshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends=\r\n. Kalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that s=\r\nword is a metaphor.

A learn=\r\ned friend wrote that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build=\r\n-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the lin=\r\near progression of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the oth=\r\ner upto Krshna&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I want to emphatically disagree with this not=\r\nion that Dasavatars of a &quot;linear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Each avatara represents an aspect=\r\n of Supreme in a perfected form.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Maharshi Parasara equated das=\r\navataras with planets. For\n example, Rama, Krishna and\n Narasimha are Sun, =\r\nMoon and Mars, respectively.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We also\n know that Sun, Moon, Mar=\r\ns, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of s=\r\noul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination,=\r\n spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline, spirit of innovation=\r\n/breaking barriers and detachment (respectively).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Correspondin=\r\ngly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected=\r\n form. Each story is an example of how that aspect operates.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;L=\r\nord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;=\r\ns story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is=\r\n a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;=\r\ns story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now, let us remember one basic thing.=\r\n Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us,\n learning spirit in us, wisdom in us=\r\n, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these are different mani=\r\nfestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these differen=\r\nt aspects, it has different qualities and plays different roles. There is n=\r\no comparison between them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We MAY focus on one aspect of us fi=\r\nrst, perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we need bal=\r\nance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects of =\r\nSupreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance working together in the=\r\n Cosmos.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One who is fascinated by =\r\nthe qualities of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul operate=\r\ns; one who is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that d=\r\nemonstrates how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities o=\r\nf wisdom may like the story that\n demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so =\r\non. But this is just a matter of taste and subjective preference.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul=\r\n and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some b=\r\nasic attributes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes o=\r\nr dislikes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Once mind fancies a separate existence with some a=\r\ngendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousness stemming fro=\r\nm that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EV=\r\nERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intelle=\r\nct, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully an=\r\nd yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately w=\r\nitnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature=\r\n give proper fruits later\n on. It does all that despite full awareness that=\r\n it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and oth=\r\ner aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the notion that th=\r\ney are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in t=\r\nhis play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionately.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of=\r\n an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interesting enou=\r\ngh to some.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and ag=\r\nendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achievin=\r\ng things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! Tho=\r\nugh soul is the support for everything else in the individualized conscious=\r\nness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that ke=\r\neps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and even =\r\ndecides/affects\n every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot;=\r\n of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one who=\r\n may be excited by this description!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in p=\r\nerspective.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At a y=\r\noung age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet,=\r\n he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marria=\r\nge, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to fo=\r\nrest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the th=\r\nrone. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother=\r\n felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all thre=\r\ne and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in th=\r\ne forest\n with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause proble=\r\nms, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by =\r\nRavana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita fo=\r\nr forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He a=\r\nccepted every life situation with no complaints and did the best possible a=\r\nction then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, bu=\r\nt as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and =\r\nrespectfully learned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana=\r\n!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires=\r\n or agendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the mom=\r\nentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As another example, let us look at Lord\n=\r\n Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination=\r\n operates.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entir=\r\ne cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qualities.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When o=\r\nne is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or att=\r\nachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppresse=\r\nd. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic qual\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
