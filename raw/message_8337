Even so called Vedic S=\r\nadhanas are often done for material gains. Recall how most of the Sanskrit =\r\nstotras of various deities contain a phalastuti (the expected results), is =\r\nthat not material gain? Doing a Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health benefits,=\r\n isn&#39;t that a material gain? It is not the path, but the attitude of the sa=\r\ndhaka which determines for what he/she is performing a certain sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tools also=\r\n acquire siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come as a byproduct of t=\r\nhe path. The problem is not with siddhis per se, it is with misusing them o=\r\nr commercializing them or hanging on to them. Any sadhaka who can gain a si=\r\nddhi, can also let go of that siddhi whenever he/she wants. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of Karma, everything has a karma of it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it =\r\nstands today, is roughly divided into two major geographic and philosophica=\r\nl demarcations. The style practiced in South India - mostly Dakshina Margi =\r\n- and that practiced in Bengal and adjacent areas - mostly Vama Margi. In m=\r\ny personal opinion, the adherents of the path in both cases, generally spea=\r\nking, have been trapped in two delusions born out of collateral byproducts =\r\nof their respective paths. The first step of Shakti sadhana is generating s=\r\nhakti. Second step is holding the shakti. Third step is channeling the shak=\r\nti. In view of this, one school of Tantra that is prevalent today has tied =\r\nitself up in too much of technicalities, such that on an average they forge=\r\nt to capture shakti (here shakti means energy, not Shakti the supreme Godde=\r\nss). WHile the other school is able to generate and hold shakti much better=\r\n, only to commercialize the same and/or misuse it (generally speaking,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;  expcetions are there too). End result, both eventually do not end up pro=\r\nducing enough genuine Tantrik saints.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i am wondering =\r\n&quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabilities one might be getting into=\r\n ?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A fair exchange is never a robbery, as Vimalananda says. =\r\nTheoretically, when the *right person* performs many of the things mentione=\r\nd in that blog, (and some of the stuff there is not exactly accurately port=\r\nrayed), he/she will know how to balance the karmic impact well. In the hand=\r\ns of an immature individual, it can lead to disaster. Further, the so calle=\r\nd division between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; and &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sharp and=\r\n clear as it is made out there. Each influences the other and is very much =\r\nintermingled.=C2=A0 Every sadhana in Vama Margi Tantra has a firm spiritual=\r\n basis. Performed correctly, with the right attitude, and by the right indi=\r\nvidual, it leads to very high spiritual states.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bazeecha-e-atfal ha=\r\nin duniya mere aage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ek baat hain ij=\r\naz-e-masiah mere aage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ________________________________=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  From: priyank_priyank &lt;aks_day@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, 12 June 2012 10:14 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been following some tantra group=\r\ns and in tantra there seems to be 3 attitudes. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.
