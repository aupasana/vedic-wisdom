And do you=\r\n do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for your regular japa?&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nMyself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No=\r\n I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPrashNa conductor: Yes. St=\r\nrictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation=\r\n of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at lea=\r\nst it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in medi=\r\ntation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMyself: Doesnt that only=\r\n apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody =\r\nin this group is already familiar with that book series)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPrashNa c=\r\nonductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Does=\r\nnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it=\r\n strictly.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe conversation went onto several other things. Subseq=\r\nuently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciti=\r\nng that mantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per =\r\nthe above mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual p=\r\nrogress since. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhether all the homa-practioners in this group agr=\r\nee with me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting everyb=\r\nody to perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get t=\r\nhe &quot;qualification&quot; for the ahuti.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRegards,&lt;br&gt;\nAshutosh&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-pref=\r\netch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--2124734478-120955543-1350936897=:85687--\r\n\n"}}
