Inquire from h=\r\nim submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can imp=\r\nart knowledge unto you because he has seen the Truth.&quot;\n\n(Bhagavad Gita, 4:3=\r\n4)\n\n\n\nThe concept of practicing spiritual life under the guidance of an aut=\r\nhentic and qualified guru, or spiritual teacher, has been central to the en=\r\ntire Dharmic world-view from the beginning of time, down to our present day=\r\n. So important has the role of the guru always been in Vedic culture, that =\r\nthere is no Hindu tradition or sampradaya (school of thought) in all of San=\r\natana Dharma that does not offer the greatest of respect to the importance =\r\nof the guru. The great Vedantic text known at the Vedanta-sara paints the f=\r\nollowing dramatic picture in order to convey the importance of having a gur=\r\nu in one&#39;s spiritual pursuit:\n\njanana-maranadi-samsaranala-santapto dipta-s=\r\nira jala-rasim iva\nupahara-panbm sotriyam brahma-nistham gurum upasrtya tam=\r\n anusarati\n\n&quot;Just as a person whose head is on fire runs to water, one who =\r\nburns from the flames of birth, death, old age, and disease in the holocaus=\r\nt of material existence must run to a genuine guru for relief. Such a guru =\r\nmust be fixed in the Absolute Truth and well-versed in the scriptures. One =\r\nshould approach him with all that is needed for sacrifice and submit to him=\r\n as a disciple, ready to\ncarry out his every instruction.&quot;\n\n(Vedanta-Sara, =\r\n11)\n\n\nIn our present era, the term &quot;guru&quot; has become very well known even t=\r\nhroughout the non-Hindu world, in addition to being known within Sanatana D=\r\nharma. Indeed, the very word &quot;guru&quot; has today become a part of the standard=\r\n English lexicon with such terms as &quot;computer guru&quot;, &quot;health guru&quot;, &quot;econom=\r\nics guru&quot;, etc. being employed in daily usage. While the use of the word ha=\r\ns become widespread, however, the sacrosanct importance of the station of g=\r\nuru is not as deeply\nunderstood in contemporary society as it once was. In =\r\nthe following work, I will be briefly explaining the traditional Dharmic un=\r\nderstanding of the importance of the guru in the life of the spiritual prac=\r\ntitioner, as well as dispelling some of the more common myths often wrongly=\r\n associated with the principle of guru.\n\nInterestingly, the very word &quot;guru=\r\n&quot; itself is actually a somewhat generalized term that simply means a compet=\r\nent teacher of any kind. Any skilled expert who is authorized to teach a sp=\r\necific subject can be considered a guru in the most general of senses. Thus=\r\n, there can be a sitar guru, a martial arts guru, a medicinal sciences guru=\r\n, or a fine arts guru. When the word is used in the overtly spiritual sense=\r\n, however, then we are talking about a guru of a categorically different na=\r\nture. The spiritual guru is specifically designated as\na &quot;sadguru&quot; or a tea=\r\ncher of Truth. It is the sadguru, the conveyor of Truth, who serves as the =\r\nunderlying model of any and all other types of gurus.\n\nIt has always been u=\r\nniversally recognized that one can only learn a specialized field of import=\r\nant knowledge from a qualified and well-trained teacher, an expert on that =\r\nparticular subject who has both theoretical knowledge, as well as the acqui=\r\nred experience necessary to bring that knowledge to life. If one were to st=\r\nudy to become a medical doctor, for example, it is understood that the only=\r\n\nway to truly understand medicine is to go to a recognized school, and lear=\r\nn under the instruction of very experienced professors who themselves are r=\r\necognized doctors trained and authorized to teach. If we attempt to learn t=\r\no become a doctor by merely reading books on our own without the benefit of=\r\n such expert guidance, we will be doing both ourselves and our later patien=\r\nts the greatest of disservices. Rather than curing our patients, in fact, w=\r\ne will most likely harm them due to our not having learned medicine from a =\r\nliving authority.\n\nSimilarly, it has been universally recognized in our Hin=\r\ndu tradition since the most ancient of times that if one wishes to understa=\r\nnd and make progress in the realm of spirituality, one must also seek guida=\r\nnce under the most able spiritual professionals available. Such a spiritual=\r\n professional is the guru.\n\nAccording to the Bhagavata Purana:\n\ntasmad guru=\r\nm prapadyeta\njijnasum sreyam uttamam\nsabde pare ca nisnatam\nbrahmany upasam=\r\nasrayam\n\n&quot;One who is searching for the Ultimate Truth must surrender unto a=\r\n spiritual master, a guru. A guru knows the inner meaning of the Vedas, is =\r\nfixed in the Absolute Truth and is expert in the shastra, the revealed scri=\r\nptures.&quot;\n\n(Bhagavata Purana, 11.3.21)\n\n\nOf all types of gurus, the scriptur=\r\nes (Shastras) of Sanatana Dharma have recognized the Acharya as the most im=\r\nportant form that the principle of guru can take. Acharyavan puruso veda, &quot;=\r\nOnly one who has an Acharya can know the Truth.&quot; (Chandogya Upanisad, 6.18.=\r\n2) It is only under the guidance of an Acharya who knows the Truth that a s=\r\neeker can in turn know Truth.\n\nThe sadguru is a spiritual teacher. The Acha=\r\nrya, moreover, is considered to be a sadguru who has attained a much higher=\r\n stage of personal spiritual development, and who thus has more responsibil=\r\nity in the realm of Dharmic leadership. An Acharya is a spiritual preceptor=\r\n who represents a living lineage (sampradaya) of Sanatana Dharma, and who e=\r\nmbodies the teachings of Dharma in his own life, thus\nteaching the world by=\r\n his own personal living example. While every Acharya fulfills the function=\r\n of a guru, not every guru can be considered an Acharya.\n\nMore than merely =\r\nbeing a teacher in the formal academic sense, however, the Acharya guru is =\r\nrecognized as also being someone who possesses divine qualities due to his =\r\nown years of practice and inner realization, and who thus perfectly personi=\r\nfies the fruit of spiritual teachings in his own life.\n\nacinoti yam sastrar=\r\ntham\nacare sthapayaty api\nsvayam acarate yasma\nacharyas tena kirtitam\n\n&quot;An =\r\nAcharya is one who fully understands the conclusions of the revealed script=\r\nures. His own behavior reflects his deep realization, and thus he is a livi=\r\nng example of divine precept. He is therefore known as an Acharya, or one w=\r\nho teaches the meaning of the scriptures both by word and deed.&quot;\n\n(Vayu Pur=\r\nana)\n\n\nThe qualified and authentic guru is not merely someone who teaches t=\r\nhe Truth verbally, but who also lives that Truth perfectly, and who then re=\r\nflects that Truth to his students in a living and dynamic way.\n\nIn the pres=\r\nent Age of Conflict (Kali Yuga), unfortunately, we often encounter unqualif=\r\nied and self-anointed individuals who claim to be gurus while often falling=\r\n very far short of the true meaning of this term. Often such unqualified pe=\r\nrsons do not possess the prerequisite qualities, training, and characterist=\r\nics necessary to call themselves a guru in the authentic and scripturally-b=\r\nased sense of this term. The scriptures of Sanatana Dharma have given us ve=\r\nry clear and unambiguous guidelines of many of the most important qualities=\r\n necessary in order to recognize whether or not a person is in fact an auth=\r\nentic and qualified guru. Some of these guidelines are outlined in the Bhag=\r\navad Gita:\n\n\nduhkhesv anudvigna-manah\nsukhesu vigata-sprhah\nvita-raga-bhaya=\r\n-krodhah\nsthita-dhir munir ucyate\n\n&quot;One who is not disturbed in spite of th=\r\ne threefold miseries, who is not elated when experiencing pleasantness, and=\r\n who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mi=\r\nnd.&quot;\n\n(Bhagavad Gita, 2:56)\n\n\nThus, the sadguru (true guru) is inwardly det=\r\nached and transcends the sufferings of this world, accepting material pleas=\r\nure and pain, suffering and pleasantness with equal demeanor. It is as a re=\r\nsult of the true guru&#39;s transcendent status - and the consequent calm, peac=\r\ne, and gravitas that the guru exudes at all times - that the true guru has =\r\nthe ability to help his student to similarly transcend the darkness of igno=\r\nrance.\n\nMore, the true guru exhibits certain necessary inherent qualities t=\r\nhat are a reflection of the fact that he is presencing the Divine in his ow=\r\nn life. Again, the Bhagavad Gita gives us several lists of these important =\r\ntranscendental qualities of the true guru, or the liberated sage, including=\r\n the following important characteristics:\n\n&quot;The Blessed Lord said: Fearless=\r\nness, purification of one&#39;s existence,\ncultivation of spiritual knowledge, =\r\ncharity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, auster=\r\nity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renuncia=\r\ntion, tranquility, aversion to faultfinding, compassion and freedom from co=\r\nvetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; vigor, forgivenes=\r\ns, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor--the=\r\nse transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed =\r\nwith divine nature.&quot;\n\n(Bhagavad Gita, 16:1-3)\n\n\nIn this way, the guru perso=\r\nnifies the fruit of a sattvic (spiritually positive) lifestyle and of years=\r\n of meditative practice.\n\nA true guru is known, not merely by how much char=\r\nisma they may possess, or by what cheap supposed miracles they seemingly pe=\r\nrform, or by how popular they have become with the gullible masses due to w=\r\nell-formulated PR and marketing campaigns. Rather, true gurus are known by =\r\nwhether or not they personify the qualities of a guru that are clearly outl=\r\nined in the scriptures of Sanatana Dharma. Any person who claims to be a tr=\r\nue guru, but who does not exhibit all the qualities of a true guru that are=\r\n revealed in the scriptures of Sanatana Dharma, is a false guru and must be=\r\n immediately rejected as a charlatan if the student is going to make any pr=\r\nogress toward the goal of transcendental realization.\n\nIt is precisely beca=\r\nuse the true guru both personifies the very highest philosophical teachings=\r\n (siddhanta), as well as the moral and yogic behavior described in our scri=\r\nptures that the guru has the ability to deliver us from ignorance to wisdom=\r\n, from darkness to the light, and from bondage to freedom.\n\nAccording to ou=\r\nr scriptures, when we find ourselves in the presence of such an authentic g=\r\nuru, it is almost as if we are in the very presence of God Himself; because=\r\n like God, the sadguru has the ability to show us Truth, and to thus set us=\r\n free. In the Bhagavata Purana, Sri Krishna confirms this in His instructio=\r\nns to His great devotee Uddhava:\n\nacharyam mam vijaniyam\nnavamanyeta karhic=\r\nit\nna martya buddhyasuyeta\nsarva-deva mayo gurum\n\n[Krishna told Uddhava] &quot;K=\r\nnow the Acharya as My very Self. I am the Acharya. Never envy the Acharya; =\r\nnever blaspheme him or consider him to be an ordinary man. Because the Acha=\r\nrya channels the infinite, He is greater than the sum total of all the fini=\r\nte. Thus, he is more important than all the gods.&quot;\n\n(Srimad-Bhagavatam 11.1=\r\n7.27)\n\nFurther, Sri Krishna explains in the same sacred text that to even v=\r\niew the liberated Acharya as an ordinary man, and to not offer one&#39;s due re=\r\nspects to such an exhalted guru, is considered by Him to be a great offense=\r\n (guru-maha-aparadha):\n\nyasya saksad bhagavati\njnana-dipa prade gurau\nmarty=\r\nasad-dhim srutam tasya\nsarvam ku-jara-saucavat\n\n&quot;The guru must be considere=\r\nd to be like the Supreme Lord Himself, because he bestows the light of tran=\r\nscendental knowledge upon his disciples. Consequently, for one who maintain=\r\ns the material conception that the guru is an ordinary human being, everyth=\r\ning is frustrated. His attempts to make progress in spiritual life - his Ve=\r\ndic studies and scriptural knowledge, his penances and austerities, and his=\r\n worship of the deity - are all as useless as the bathing of an elephant wh=\r\no rolls in the mud after his bath.&quot;\n\n(Srimad-Bhagavatam 11.20.17)\n\n\nConfirm=\r\nation of these Vedic instructions on the nature of sadguru is found through=\r\nout the length and breadth of the Hindu scriptures. For example, in the Pad=\r\nma Purana it is explained that: gurus nara-matir yasya va naraki sam, &quot;One =\r\nwho thinks that the guru is an ordinary man is said to live in ignorance.&quot; =\r\nIn this way, we see that the totality of the scriptures speak in one, unifi=\r\ned and authoritative voice on the importance of the guru and the unique rol=\r\ne of the guru is the life of one who claims the desire to know Truth.\n\nLate=\r\nr in this same conversation, Uddhava replies to Sri Krishna&#39;s instruction i=\r\nn the same vein:\n\nnaivopayanty apacitim kavayas tavesa\nbrahmayusapi krtam r=\r\nddha mudam smarantam\nyo&#39;ntar bahis tanu-bhrtam asubham vidhunvann\nacarya-ca=\r\nittya vapusa sva-gatim vyanakti\n\n[Uddhava said to Sri Krishna] &quot;O my Lord! =\r\nTranscendental poets and experts in spiritual science could not fully expre=\r\nss their indebtedness to You, even if they were endowed with the lifetime o=\r\nf Brahma, for You appear in two features - externally as the Acharya and in=\r\nternally as the Paramatman, the Supreme Self - to deliver the embodied livi=\r\nng beings by revealing to them your devotional service and teaching them ho=\r\nw to approach you on the path of divine love.&quot;\n\n(Srimad-Bhagavatam 11.29.6)=\r\n\n\n\nIn addition to explaining both the nature and the qualities of the sadgu=\r\nru, the scriptures also explain that it is likewise very important to under=\r\nstand the important qualities that must be present in a sincere and qualifi=\r\ned student. In the Katha Upanishad, for example, we read the following:\n\nsr=\r\navanayapi bahubhir yo na labhyam\nsrnvanto &#39;pi bahavo na vidyum\nacharyo &#39;sya=\r\n vakta kusalo &#39;sya labhda\nacharyo jnata kushala nushishtam\n\n&quot;Many cannot ev=\r\nen hear about the soul, and even after hearing about the soul, many cannot =\r\nunderstand it; this is because it is hard to find an Acharya who is a genui=\r\nne seer of the truth. Such a qualified Acharya is a great soul and is very =\r\nrare. At the same time, realization of the truth can be had only by those d=\r\nisciples who carefully follow the qualified Acharya&#39;s teachings and become =\r\nexpert in the science of God. Such disciples are also very rare. Thus it is=\r\n that only a few ever come to know the soul in truth.&quot;\n\n(Katha Upanisad, 1.=\r\n2.7.)\n\n\nTo find a sincere and worthy student is thus explained as being jus=\r\nt as difficult as finding a qualified and worthy sadguru. The highest attai=\r\nnment of transcendent Truth, and the personal spiritual liberation (moksha)=\r\n that results from such a realization, is the most difficult goal to realiz=\r\ne. Thus, Krishna states in the Bhagavad Gita:\n\nManushyam sahasreshu\nKashchi=\r\nd yatati siddhaye\nYatatam api siddhanam\nKashchin mam vetti tattvatah\n\n&quot;Of m=\r\nany thousands of men, one will attempt to reach perfection; and of the few =\r\nwho reach this goal, only a rare soul will perhaps know Me as I am.&quot;\n\n(Bhag=\r\navad Gita, 7:3)\n\n\nWhen a sincere student and a qualified sadguru finally do=\r\n find each other, and unite in the eternal process of spiritual exchange =\r\n=96 the guru sharing his insight, instruction, and empowering presence with=\r\n the student; and the student learning and growing spiritually with humilit=\r\ny, sincerity, openness and eagerness =96 we then witness the perfect condit=\r\nions necessary for the celebration and living of Truth. If you are seeking =\r\nTruth, then seek the guidance of one who has seen the Truth. Seek the sadgu=\r\nru.\n\n\n\nThe Author:\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.=\r\n) is an American who has been practicing Sanatana Dharma for over 35 years.=\r\n He has a Ph.D. in Religious Studies and is recognized by the global Hindu =\r\ncommunity as one of the leading Hindu Acharyas (Spiritual Preceptors) in th=\r\ne nation.
