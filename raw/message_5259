I am a=\r\nmongst the general populace of the world - to me, only the greatness part o=\r\nf the two characters have any meaning, not their faults and fallacies, but =\r\nI don&#39;t eulogize either of them neither demean them.\n\n    I am not a philos=\r\nopher. What I have tried to state so far, w.r.t &quot;Success with Mantra&quot; topic=\r\n, is that No matter how hard one tries, Ravanas&#39; or Ramas&#39; achievements in =\r\nthe field of &quot;duality&quot; cannot be erased by any amount of &quot;Highest shakti&quot; w=\r\nith or without Ego.\n\n   Reason lies in what Aurobindo states as Sat-chid-an=\r\nanda as the basis of all planes of existence including Physical plane of ex=\r\nistence. Argument of Impermanence by Advaitins has not so far been able to =\r\nerase the world of duality from existence. As per Aurobindo, Ananda is the =\r\nbasis of sense-mind, Chit is the basis of Physical consciousness, and Sat i=\r\ns the basis of existence of Physical plane, so lets not argue that there is=\r\n another reality which is better and happier than this one, and that this w=\r\norld is a myth. If physical sense-experience is fleeting, it is because one=\r\n has not progressed enough to realize why the truth of being is expressed i=\r\nn such a way at this plane of existence ? \nBottomline is Sense-experience i=\r\ns not different from Ananda, and Physical body not different from Chit.\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in the field of duality,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-control and egolessness. The\n\n&gt; &gt; What=\r\n does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ? \n    This quest=\r\nion was asked because you were trying to compare apples with oranges, by sa=\r\nying that (egolessness) soul consciousness competes with ego consciousness,=\r\n presuming that they act upon each other.\n\n    Truth of the matter is that =\r\nSoul is not in competition with ego consciousness ever, because God is neve=\r\nr in competition with his creation !! If a liberated soul wants to take par=\r\nt in an ego competition (Yada Yada hee Dharmasya), it has to have an ego, h=\r\nowever high, like that of an avatar. Krishna took the wheel of the chariot =\r\nand tried to kill Bhishma, not without an ego. Other people may differ with=\r\n me on this.\n\n&gt; I see inconsistencies in your views and a biased and \n   OT=\r\nOH, I see a lot of consistency in this mail exchange than the last time. It=\r\n is understandable that my view wouldn&#39;t be consistent in every mind-set, b=\r\necause at times, it is not possible to write every little detail for the sa=\r\nke of consistency.\n\n&gt; But the happiness one gets when one achieves somethin=\r\ng in the field &gt; of duality is not permanent.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The highest shakti give=\r\ns the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda, \n&gt; which is permanent.\n\n    Auro=\r\nbindo Ghosh has clearly stated:\n\n&quot;...If the immortal and infinite spirit ha=\r\ns veiled itself in Matter and is emerging, the development of a liberated S=\r\nupramental being who shall impose in Mind, Life and Matter a higher law tha=\r\nn that of limitation and Division, is the inevitable conclusion from the na=\r\nture of the cosmic existence. There is no reason why such a being should no=\r\nt liberate and make Divine the physical existence as well as the Mind and L=\r\nife....&quot;\n\n   So, lets attempt to divinze Physical form, in accordance with =\r\nhighest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji has done, because it=\r\ns basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to learn about all the achievement=\r\ns made by all those we can know of, irrespective of their being recognized =\r\nas good or bad by a limited set of people, for a limited duration of time.\n=\r\n   \n    These are just a few of my views based on what I have read so far, =\r\nbecause I don&#39;t see any reason, why an afterlife would bring me greater tru=\r\nth than where I am now.\n\nRegards,\nAryama\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt;  \n&gt; You say that =\r\n&quot;Killing Ravana was not a great deed&quot; and yet look at &quot;binding the physical=\r\n body of both Ram and Lakshman&quot; as a &quot;great deed&quot;. I see inconsistencies in=\r\n your views and a biased and sympathetic attitutde towards Ravana and his k=\r\nin. Anyway, I will just make a couple of specific points on shakti, which i=\r\ns a subtle topic and not easy to understand.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Sh=\r\nakti is Memory.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If memory is extended the longest, the most fundament=\r\nal and first memory should say that one is Brahman. If one&#39;s memory extends=\r\n that far, that creates the highest Shakti! In other words, self-realizatio=\r\nn brings the highest shakti.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Co=\r\nmpete with lower shakti ?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Great question!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Any lower shakti is a=\r\nn ability to perform actions with objects in the field of duality. Why does=\r\n one perform actions and manipulate the objects in the field of duality? Be=\r\ncause one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the other. But the happines=\r\ns one gets when one achieves something in the field of duality is not perma=\r\nnent.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The highest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-anand=\r\na, which is permanent.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one is pursuing an individual will, one m=\r\nay be swimming with or against the divine will. One will have some successe=\r\ns and some failures, some pleasures and some pains. When one&#39;s individual w=\r\nill has dropped off and one is flowing with the rhythm of the divine will, =\r\none is in bliss no matter what one does. One *can* do anything, but one doe=\r\ns only what divine rhythm wills done by one!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Only the fully detached =\r\nShiva can beget Shakti in totality and demons like Ravana or Mahisha or Shu=\r\nmbha can only get some trappings of Shakti but can never beget Shakti in to=\r\ntality.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A demon like Hiranyakashipu or Ravana may kill or imprison a =\r\nself-realized rishi. It may seem like the demon has more shakti. But the ri=\r\nshi is in bliss whether he is alive or being killed, whether he is at his h=\r\nermitage or in prison. The happiness demons got from their successes were s=\r\nhort-lived and ended later. But the rishi was in constant bliss. So the ris=\r\nhi&#39;s shakti was superior.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Why then fight like mortals, taking help =\r\nfrom mortal allies ?\n&gt; &gt; Instead, just order Rudra to finish the life of al=\r\nl ones&#39; enemies ?\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is the thing with shakti. Shakti is the abilit=\r\ny to do things in the field of duality. Just as you do not give important w=\r\nork to irresponsible people, any level of shakti never goes to people who d=\r\no not know how to handle that level of shakti.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, if a rishi wanted=\r\n, he could&#39;ve summoned Rudra to finish off Ravana or Hiranyakashipu. But, a=\r\n rishi is in bliss no matter what and does not break divine rhythm. If Sita=\r\n, Rama and Hanuman have to come to earth and establish certain lessons for =\r\nfuture and take care of Ravana, a rishi will let that happen and not do any=\r\nthing hasty.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyo=\r\ntish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short=\r\n Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;sil=\r\nentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Rama defeated and ki=\r\nlled Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; Killing Ravana was not a great deed.\n&gt; &gt; Ravana had done t=\r\nhat 10 times himself, beheading his own head, but the shakti of his sadhana=\r\n was such that he got a new head every time to continue the sadhana. On a d=\r\neeper level, it is Rudra that finally effects the death of Physical conscio=\r\nusness, so even that part is not in the hands of a mortal Physical form.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you still put Ravana above Rama in shakti, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question your=\r\n understanding of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti is Memor=\r\ny. Hanumaan realized his shakti only after he was reminded of it. Karna, in=\r\n the final battle, forgot his Shastra vidya because of the curse of his Gur=\r\nu. Generalizing, Shakti is the ability to remember the series of actions to=\r\n be done to effect a cause lawfully, irrespective of the doer. Thus, Hanuma=\r\nan had perfect memory by birth, and not by the association with Rama. Ravan=\r\na didn&#39;t have perfect memory, else he would have attempted to kill Vibhisha=\r\nna sooner than later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The use of shakti against avatar, binding the=\r\n physical body of both Ram and Lakshman, by a mortal (Meghnaad) was a great=\r\n deed, because even the motherly love of Yashoda couldn&#39;t bind Krishna avat=\r\nar by a rope. Meghnaad was son of Ravana. If it were not for Hanumaan, and =\r\nGaruda using divine powers, the result would have been different.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; D=\r\nespite all, without Vibhishana revealing the secrets, it was impossible to =\r\nkill Ravana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even a high level of understanding of the field of d=\r\nuality and even &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in th=\r\ne field of duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-control and egol=\r\nessness.

Instead, just=\r\n order Rudra to finish the life of all ones&#39; enemies ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Egolessness =\r\nis not a shakti, but a quality of Soul consciousness, in the same manner as=\r\n Ego is a quality of Physical creation. It reveals a manner of operating ha=\r\nrmoniously with Nature, without creating conflicts, something that Ravana d=\r\nidn&#39;t know.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Aryama\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How much purity is enough and for what purpose ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Di=\r\nfferent levels of purity can generate different results (and traps!),\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n based on one&#39;s background. But there is no point in trying to understand\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; it. The goal of sadhana is to erase ego completely. It is not to erase=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some conditioning, get some siddhi or get some results. If some sidd=\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and results come, one can accept them.

Thus, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person still afflicted by undesirable conditioning ma=\r\ny acquire enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purity to get some results.

The instinct of self-preservation is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; another aspect of ego. A person with ego and pride may suppress prid=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and self-importance out of no choice, for self-preservation. If o=\r\nne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later gets a chance to exert one&#39;s pride without sacrificing\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; self-preservation, one may still do so. This is conditional surrender.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of god also, surrendering to god when one&#39;s life is a =\r\nmess\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and one is helpless may still be conditional surrender. But, w=\r\nhen the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender is unconditional and one sees god as the controll=\r\ner of all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without any conditions attached, irrespective of whether =\r\nlife is good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or bad, one becomes purer and purer and one&#39;s self-con=\r\ntrol become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better and better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A powerless person may also =\r\nbecome angry. But, as you said, his anger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is powerless to do much h=\r\narm. As one&#39;s self-control increases, one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendency to become angr=\r\ny comes down.

Bhakti and meditation alwa=\r\nys\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would work!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If Mr. PVR or other gurujis ar=\r\ne reading this, I would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appreciate it if they take the leade=\r\nrship to develop such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mantras and circulate for the benefit =\r\nof the members.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you very much!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With dee=\r\np regards Murthy Divakaruni\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;javascript:parent.gMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;vedic-ast=\r\nrology@yahoogroups.com&#39;)&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; , &quot;jkumarkb&quot; &lt;jkumarkb@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chant the below man=\r\ntra at least 108 times everyday with deep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; belief and dedica=\r\ntion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rajagopala Mantram\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Krishna Krishna Ma=\r\nh=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6&#39;?=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C2=A2??=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6&#39;?=C3=83=\r\n=C6&#39;=C3=82=E2=80=9A=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=81yogin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bhakt=\r\n=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6&#39;?=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C2=A2??=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6&#39;?=C3=83=C6=\r\n&#39;=C3=82=E2=80=9A=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=81n=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6&#39;?=C3=83=C6&#39;=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A2??=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6&#39;?=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=E2=80=9A=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=81m Abhayam Kara Govinda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Param=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6=\r\n&#39;?=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C2=A2??=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6&#39;?=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=81nanda Sarvam Me Vasha M=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6&#39;?=C3=83=\r\n=C6&#39;=C3=82=C2=A2??=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=C6&#39;?=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=82=E2=80=9A=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=81na Ya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; !!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Translation:- Kr=\r\nishna, oh great Yogi, you give shelter to your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; devotees.
