It is also inspiring & eye opener for the people =\r\nwho talk big philosopohies and love of God and what may have you but shy aw=\r\nay from even a little bit of sadhana. It is a spiritual Tamacha which is re=\r\nquired occassionaly to all of us or most of us in varying degree including =\r\nthe writer of the message.It is also for the people who are really deep in =\r\nto Sadhana and still want to be better at that. I am of the opinion that th=\r\nis message, in future, will truly inspire some fortunate few and change the=\r\n course of their lives. As is everybody&#39;s experience in life that sometime =\r\nSlap works much faster and better. Bitter medicines cures faster, Harsh tru=\r\nth needs to be spoken sometimes for good and there are so many\n examples wh=\r\nere it is recorded that many a times, Spiritual Gurus have push very bitter=\r\n pills for their disciples. \nI sincerely hope that readers do not get depre=\r\nss or angry/furious or even confuse due to the bluntness of the message. I =\r\nhope also that Ahmkaara does not get hurt. As the basic and important Wisdo=\r\nm goes - not get lost in words but to understand the soul of message - and =\r\nthat will happen is my wish. It must bang the door of one&#39;s heart so that l=\r\nittle by little people start cutting down on many unnecessary entertainment=\r\n and use more time for God or whatever term one like to use. This lecture i=\r\nncludes Me in the first palce. Shuruat merese Ho!\n\nThis is not at all a &quot;Vy=\r\nakti Puja&quot; or something like that....but it is &quot;Message Puja&quot; surely!\nThat =\r\nmessage was like &quot;cleansing spirit&quot; on the wound and your response was like=\r\n a &quot;soothing Malam&quot; and i wrote for shhhhfuuu..shhhhfuuu\n\nFinsihing this, I=\r\n wish you and everybody, a very happy Gupt Navaratri!\n\nYours Lovingly,\n\nUtp=\r\nal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nice and blunt message that can truly inspire some sadhakas who are=\r\n \n&gt; confused!\n&gt; \n&gt; But I can see that there will be many people for whom th=\r\nis message is \n&gt; not appropriate. I have a different message for them.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; It is ok if you do not really want God badly. It =\r\nis ok if you do not \n&gt; spend many hours in sadhana or sit still for long du=\r\nrations of time. Not \n&gt; everyone can do that. Not everyone is meant to real=\r\nize god in this life \n&gt; and that is perfectly ok.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just spend time doin=\r\ng whatever you are doing now and enjoy whatever \n&gt; aspects of life you are =\r\nenjoying now. But, try to make one small change. \n&gt; Try to be less selfish =\r\nand more giving. All actions and dealings in this \n&gt; world involve give and=\r\n take. If an action&#39;s sole purpose is taking \n&gt; rather than giving, give it=\r\n less priority. If an action involves more \n&gt; giving than taking or atleast=\r\n balances give and take to a large extent, \n&gt; give it higher priority. Like=\r\n this, pick better actions, be mindful of \n&gt; others and try to be giving an=\r\nd unselfish.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If you spend 20 minutes doing a =\r\nsmall homam everyday and try to do the \n&gt; above, THAT is enough for most pe=\r\nople. Yes, you may not realize god in \n&gt; this life (or, who knows, you may)=\r\n, but, so what? You may make progress \n&gt; and may get a better chance in fut=\r\nure.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, not everyone who plays tennis=\r\n needs to win a grand slam. One \n&gt; can play it, get some exercise and just =\r\nstay healthy! It is not \n&gt; necessary to either go for winning a grand slam =\r\nor give up tennis. There \n&gt; is a &quot;middle ground&quot; that is far more appropria=\r\nte for far more people!\n&gt; \n&gt; So, my friends, those who want a grand slam, s=\r\npend a lot more time in \n&gt; practice (sadhana) and those who don&#39;t care, pla=\r\ny it and stay fit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & =\r\nSpirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nn Thu, Jun 21, 2012 at 2:43 PM, scsa_taker3 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     (Itna sannata k=\r\nyun hai bhai???)\n&gt; ( Please chant as much while reading this, chant ram, kr=\r\nishna,allah, \n&gt; wahe - guru,  or whatever name you so please, chant your ma=\r\nntra, because \n&gt; who knows when that heart attack comes )\n&gt; \n&gt; How bad do y=\r\nou want God????\n&gt; \n&gt; A modified version of a really popular audio. The modi=\r\nfied version \n&gt; applies a lot to us, fools lost in oblivion trying to learn=\r\n more and \n&gt; more and more theories instead of doing sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quoted w=\r\nith modifications pertaining to Mr God.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;There was a young man, you =\r\nknow, who wanted to reach god/be super \n&gt; siddha or something and so he wen=\r\nt to this guru. The guru was very very \n&gt; advanced, a legend in his own rig=\r\nht. And he told the guru you know I \n&gt; wanna be on the same level you are a=\r\nnd the guru said if you wanna be on \n&gt; the same level I&#39;m on, I&#39;ll met you =\r\ntomorrow at the beach.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the young man got there 4 A.M. he was  all r=\r\neady to rock n&#39; roll. He \n&gt; was dressed properly, but he should have worn s=\r\nhorts. The old man grabs \n&gt; his hand and said: How bad do you wanna be succ=\r\nessful ( basically \n&gt; achieve god, have siddhi and the like, all references=\r\n to success from \n&gt; hereon now mean uniting with god ) ? He said: &quot;Real bad=\r\n&quot;. He said: Walk \n&gt; on out in the water. So he walks out into the water. Wh=\r\nen he walks out \n&gt; to the water he goes waist deep and goes like this old m=\r\nan is crazy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The young man was thinking , &quot;Hey I wanna meet god, achie=\r\nve siddhi in my \n&gt; sadhana, get out of this birth death cycle etc. etc. and=\r\n this foolish \n&gt; old man got me out here swimming. I didn&#39;t ask to be a lif=\r\neguard. I \n&gt; wanna meet god he got me in water =C3=82=E2=80=93 so the old m=\r\nan said go on a little \n&gt; further =C3=82=E2=80=93 the young man walked out =\r\na little further =C3=82=E2=80=93 then the young man \n&gt; was neck deep in wat=\r\ner - the young man was thinking  this old man is \n&gt; crazy =C3=82=E2=80=93 e=\r\nverybody calls him a paramhansa, a mahapurusha, god incarnate \n&gt; but he is =\r\ndefinitely crazy. So the old man again said go on out a little \n&gt; further =\r\n=C3=82=E2=80=93 the young man went out a little further, the water was now =\r\n\n&gt; right at his mouth =C3=82=E2=80=93the young man was now thinking of goin=\r\ng back, this \n&gt; old hack is out of his fucking mind. And then the old man s=\r\naid: &quot;I \n&gt; thought you said you wanted to be successful?&quot; He said: &quot;I do.&quot; =\r\nHe said: \n&gt; &quot;Then walk a little further.&quot; Then the old man followed this gu=\r\ny into \n&gt; the water, he grabbed the young man&#39;s head, and held him down \n&gt; =\r\nunderwater. The old guy held the young man, till  the young man was \n&gt; abou=\r\nt to pass out, the young guys arms were now splashing the water in \n&gt; despe=\r\nration, then suddenly the guru raised him up. He said: &quot;I got a \n&gt; question=\r\n for you.&quot; He told the young guy, he said: &quot;When you want to \n&gt; succeed as =\r\nbad as you wanna breathe than you will be successful.&quot;\n&gt; (Succeed =3D uniti=\r\nng with god, or seeing god, or achieving supernatural \n&gt; powers, or siddhi,=\r\n or whatever, thats subjective, upto you.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know how many of yo=\r\nu all got asthma here in Vedic wisdom? If you \n&gt; ever had a asthma attack b=\r\nefore, you are short of breath S.O.B,due to \n&gt; shortness of breath, you sta=\r\nrt wheezing, &quot;hai, hai, hai&quot; like you have \n&gt; run 10,000kms in one go, the =\r\nonly thing you are trying to do at that \n&gt; moment during the attack, is get=\r\n some air. You don&#39;t care about no \n&gt; basketball game, you don&#39;t care about=\r\n what&#39;s on T.V., you don&#39;t care \n&gt; about nobody calling you, you don&#39;t care=\r\n about a party. The only thing \n&gt; you care about when you trying to breathe=\r\n is to get some fresh air. \n&gt; That&#39;s it! And when you get to the point wher=\r\ne all you wanna do is be is \n&gt; successful as bad as you wanna breathe then =\r\nyou will be successful. And \n&gt; I&#39;m here to tell you that number one, most o=\r\nf you say you wanna be \n&gt; successful but you don&#39;t want it bad, you just ki=\r\nnd of want it. You \n&gt; don&#39;t want it bad than you wanna party. You don&#39;t wan=\r\nt it as much as you \n&gt; want to be cool. Most of you don&#39;t want success as m=\r\nuch as you want \n&gt; sleep. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; (Again Success =3D uniting with god, or =\r\nseeing god, or achieving \n&gt; supernatural powers, or siddhi, or whatever, th=\r\nats subjective, upto \n&gt; you.)\n&gt; End Quote\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignore the following video ,=\r\n focus on the audio in it. with the above \n&gt; modifications.\n&gt; http://www.yo=\r\nutube.com/watch?v=3Dnw41UQU_J0A\n&gt; \n&gt; Do all of you remember that Visa call =\r\nfrom your perspective \n&gt; embassies????\n&gt; Remember those???\n&gt; The interviews=\r\n???\n&gt; Even if you had slept at 4 in the morning, the night before, you woul=\r\nd \n&gt; still wake up and be at the embassy office at 7, or whenever your \n&gt; a=\r\nppointment was.\n&gt; Hell even if you had high fever 102 or something, you wou=\r\nld still reach.\n&gt; Do you remember that flight to the states???\n&gt; Ohhhh Ammm=\r\nerrriiiiicaaaaaaa!!!!

Why would a \n&gt; high powered one come and teach you??? only after your=\r\n penance is good \n&gt; enough na? otherwise, he/she will be busy in his/her un=\r\nion with god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now how bad do you want god?\n&gt; How bad do you want a gur=\r\nu?\n&gt;   How bad do you want those spiritual states?\n&gt; How bad do you want th=\r\ne darsahn for your beloved?\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t kind of want it, want it bad, time i=\r\ns running out, and very soon, \n&gt; another rebirth, again the young age, agai=\r\nn the teenage, again the \n&gt; affairs, again the hormone spikes, again the de=\r\ngrees, again the sucky \n&gt; jobs, again confused with life, again the financi=\r\nal nightmares, again \n&gt; the heart attacks , again the death, and again, aga=\r\nin. Hai ram!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll end this post with an example, a businessman in D=\r\nelhi in the \n&gt; 1940&#39;s, had done a bit of penance and you know was highly in=\r\nterested in \n&gt; god , shod and all this stuff. So one day , he had gone to k=\r\nerala, and \n&gt; met a guy who was proclaimed in the village to be equivalent =\r\nto lord \n&gt; voldmeort or something but on the god side.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the guy went=\r\n to meet the guy whose name can&#39;t be taken and asked him \n&gt; , i am looking =\r\nfor a guru, the old fella said , for what exactly are you \n&gt; looking for a =\r\nguru??? The business man said, , you know to learn stuff. \n&gt; The old fellow=\r\n said what are you willing to do for your guru??? The \n&gt; businessman said a=\r\nnything. The old fella said, okay take all your \n&gt; clothes off, the busines=\r\nsman was shocked. the suit guy took them off \n&gt; reluctantly. then the old f=\r\nella, told him , wear a patta around your \n&gt; neck and roam around the town =\r\nnaked. The businessman was aghast, but the \n&gt; old fella, told him &quot;anything=\r\n right???&quot;, the businessman very BADLY \n&gt; wanted a guru, so he went and got=\r\n shoes thrown at him, came back after \n&gt; half an hour to find the old fella=\r\n gone and his clothes gone too. He sat \n&gt; there sobbing, and sobbing and cu=\r\nrsing god, that i was the biggest fool \n&gt; to come here and trust this man. =\r\nBut then as he haid read somewhere, why \n&gt; waste time, he started meditatin=\r\ng and chanted. 3 hours went by no sign \n&gt; of the old man, 4 then 5 but by t=\r\nhe 6th, the old fella reappeared, and \n&gt; said &quot; here are your clothes, go b=\r\nack to your town.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The businessman just didn&#39;t want to say anything tr=\r\nied to get up, but \n&gt; couldn&#39;t move. The old fella was weeping with joy, st=\r\nating that finally \n&gt; he has found someone worthy enough to teach. Somebody=\r\n who actually wants \n&gt; it &quot; bad &quot;.Old fella took the hotshot as his discipl=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; Punjabi fans -----&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Makkah gayan=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A8\n&gt; Gal mukdi nahin\n&gt; =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8Paven =\r\nsau sau jummen padhaiye\n&gt; Ganga gayan\n&gt; =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A8Gal mukdi nahin=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8\n&gt; Paven sau sa=\r\nu gothey khaiye\n&gt; Gaya gayan\n&gt; =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8Gal m=\r\nukdi nahin=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8\n&gt; Paven sau sau panD padh=\r\naiye\n&gt; Bulleh Shah!=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8\n&gt; Gal taiyon muk=\r\ndi=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8\n&gt; Jadon menu dilon gavaiye.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nParh parh ilm hazaar kitaabaN\n&gt; kadi apne aap nu parhya nahin\n&gt; Jaa jaa war=\r\ndey mandar maseetan\n&gt; kadi mann apne wich wareya nahin\n&gt; Anven larda shaita=\r\nan de naal bandeya\n&gt; kadi nafs apne naal larya nahin\n&gt; Aakhe peer Bulleh Sh=\r\nah aasmani pharna aeN\n&gt; jehra man wich wasda unhoN pharya nahin\n&gt; \n&gt; (jisko=\r\n samajh mien aye who baakiyon ke liye transalte kare )\n&gt; \n&gt; Satya Shri Akaa=\r\nl\n&gt; Jai mere kaal\n&gt; Nobody\n&gt; P.S.

The message can actually inspire almost everybody who are some or th=\r\ne other way in to spiritual Sadhana including the people who are truly conf=\r\nused.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt is inspiring for the people who are getting pulled in too=\r\n many direction of life due to various sense weaknesses as well as various =\r\nresponsibilities,but who still rue the fact that they waste away their time=\r\n and instead should invest that for God. It is also inspiring &amp; eye ope=\r\nner for the people who talk big philosopohies and love of God and what may =\r\nhave you but shy away from even a little bit of sadhana. It is a spiritual =\r\nTamacha which is required occassionaly to all of us or most of us in varyin=\r\ng degree including the writer of the message.It is also for the people who =\r\nare really deep in to Sadhana and still want to be better at that. I am of =\r\nthe opinion that this message, in future, will truly inspire some fortunate=\r\n few and change the course of their lives. As is everybody&#39;s experience in =\r\nlife that sometime Slap works much faster and better. Bitter medicines cure=\r\ns faster, Harsh truth needs to be spoken sometimes for good and there are s=\r\no many\n examples where it is recorded that many a times, Spiritual Gurus ha=\r\nve push very bitter pills for their disciples.     &lt;br&gt;\nI sincerely hope th=\r\nat readers do not get depress or angry/furious or even confuse due to the b=\r\nluntness of the message. I hope also that Ahmkaara does not get hurt. As th=\r\ne basic and important Wisdom goes - not get lost in words but to understand=\r\n the soul of message - and that will happen is my wish. It must bang the do=\r\nor of one&#39;s heart so that little by little people start cutting down on man=\r\ny unnecessary entertainment and use more time for God or whatever term one =\r\nlike to use. This lecture includes Me in the first palce.

It is ok i=\r\nf you do not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; spend many hours in sadhana or sit still for long du=\r\nrations of time. Not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; everyone can do that. Not everyone is meant =\r\nto realize god in this life &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and that is perfectly ok.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Just spend time doing whatever you are doing now and enjoy whatever=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; aspects of life you are enjoying now. But, try to make one small=\r\n change. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Try to be less selfish and more giving. All actions and =\r\ndealings in this &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; world involve give and take. If an action&#39;s sole=\r\n purpose is taking &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rather than giving, give it less priority. If =\r\nan action involves more &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; giving than taking or atleast balances gi=\r\nve and take to a large extent, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; give it higher priority. Like this=\r\n, pick better actions, be mindful of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; others and try to be giving =\r\nand unselfish.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If=\r\n you spend 20 minutes doing a small homam everyday and try to do the &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; above, THAT is enough for most people. Yes, you may not realize god in =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; this life (or, who knows, you may), but, so what? You may make pr=\r\nogress &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and may get a better chance in future.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; After all, not everyone who plays te=\r\nnnis needs to win a grand slam. One &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; can play it, get some exercis=\r\ne and just stay healthy! It is not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; necessary to either go for win=\r\nning a grand slam or give up tennis. There &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is a &quot;middle ground&quot; t=\r\nhat is far more appropriate for far more people!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So, my =\r\nfriends, those who want a grand slam, spend a lot more time in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; pr=\r\nactice (sadhana) and those who don&#39;t care, play it and stay fit.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Astrol=\r\nogy &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; --------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Jun 21, 2012 at 2:43 P=\r\nM, scsa_taker3 wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     (Itna sannata kyun hai bhai???=\r\n)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ( Please chant as much while reading this, chant ram, krishna,al=\r\nlah, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wahe - guru,  or whatever name you so please, chant your man=\r\ntra, because &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who knows when that heart attack comes )&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; How bad do you want God????&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A modified version o=\r\nf a really popular audio.

The guru was very very &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; advanced, a legend=\r\n in his own right. And he told the guru you know I &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wanna be on th=\r\ne same level you are and the guru said if you wanna be on &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the sam=\r\ne level I&#39;m on, I&#39;ll met you tomorrow at the beach.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So t=\r\nhe young man got there 4 A.M. he was  all ready to rock n&#39; roll. He &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; was dressed properly, but he should have worn shorts. The old man grabs =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; his hand and said: How bad do you wanna be successful ( basically=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; achieve god, have siddhi and the like, all references to success=\r\n from &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hereon now mean uniting with god ) ? He said: &quot;Real bad&quot;. H=\r\ne said: Walk &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; on out in the water. So he walks out into the water.=\r\n When he walks out &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to the water he goes waist deep and goes like =\r\nthis old man is crazy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The young man was thinking , &quot;Hey=\r\n I wanna meet god, achieve siddhi in my &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sadhana, get out of this =\r\nbirth death cycle etc. etc. and this foolish &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; old man got me out h=\r\nere swimming. I didn&#39;t ask to be a lifeguard. I &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wanna meet god he=\r\n got me in water =C3=82=E2=80=93 so the old man said go on a little &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; further =C3=82=E2=80=93 the young man walked out a little further =C3=82=\r\n=E2=80=93 then the young man &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was neck deep in water - the young m=\r\nan was thinking  this old man is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; crazy =C3=82=E2=80=93 everybody =\r\ncalls him a paramhansa, a mahapurusha, god incarnate &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; but he is de=\r\nfinitely crazy. So the old man again said go on out a little &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; furt=\r\nher =C3=82=E2=80=93 the young man went out a little further, the water was =\r\nnow &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; right at his mouth =C3=82=E2=80=93the young man was now think=\r\ning of going back, this &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; old hack is out of his fucking mind. And =\r\nthen the old man said: &quot;I &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; thought you said you wanted to be succe=\r\nssful?&quot; He said: &quot;I do.&quot; He said: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Then walk a little further.&quot; T=\r\nhen the old man followed this guy into &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the water, he grabbed the =\r\nyoung man&#39;s head, and held him down &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; underwater. The old guy held =\r\nthe young man, till  the young man was &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; about to pass out, the you=\r\nng guys arms were now splashing the water in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; desperation, then su=\r\nddenly the guru raised him up. He said: &quot;I got a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; question for you=\r\n.&quot; He told the young guy, he said: &quot;When you want to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; succeed as b=\r\nad as you wanna breathe than you will be successful.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (Succeed =3D=\r\n uniting with god, or seeing god, or achieving supernatural &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; power=\r\ns, or siddhi, or whatever, thats subjective, upto you.)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI don&#39;t know how many of you all got asthma here in Vedic wisdom? If you &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; ever had a asthma attack before, you are short of breath S.O.B,due =\r\nto &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; shortness of breath, you start wheezing, &quot;hai, hai, hai&quot; like =\r\nyou have &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; run 10,000kms in one go, the only thing you are trying t=\r\no do at that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; moment during the attack, is get some air. You don&#39;t=\r\n care about no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; basketball game, you don&#39;t care about what&#39;s on T.=\r\nV., you don&#39;t care &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; about nobody calling you, you don&#39;t care about=\r\n a party. The only thing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you care about when you trying to breath=\r\ne is to get some fresh air. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s it! And when you get to the po=\r\nint where all you wanna do is be is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; successful as bad as you wann=\r\na breathe then you will be successful. And &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m here to tell you t=\r\nhat number one, most of you say you wanna be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; successful but you d=\r\non&#39;t want it bad, you just kind of want it. You &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; don&#39;t want it bad=\r\n than you wanna party. You don&#39;t want it as much as you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; want to b=\r\ne cool.

But you seem to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have time for=\r\n everything else in life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Then what was the use for all =\r\nthe discussions because once your computer &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is switched off, nothi=\r\nng changes in your life, your mind has made a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fuddu out of you by=\r\n foxing you into thinking, &quot;sir I have done something &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; about my pi=\r\ntiable state.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Then you read Mr Nandy&#39;s post about the s=\r\ntory of &quot;p&quot;, and say what an &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; eye opener, what excitement, what a =\r\nstory!!!!!! But errrrrr=C3=82=E2=80=A6=C3=82=E2=80=A6=C3=82=E2=80=A6=C3=82=\r\n=E2=80=A6 what did &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you do post that???&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t=\r\n see people shortening their mall trips, their shopping sprees, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; t=\r\nheir time on the internet but when it comes to a homam, first question &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; or thought is &quot;oh my gawd, it will take that long, let me ask Mr Rao =\r\nof &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; making it shorter.&quot; And god is so magnanimous, he allows you t=\r\no do so.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hell you spend more time on buying your kacche,=\r\n panty, banyan and bras &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rather than on god!!!!!! Wah, wah, surely=\r\n god will be yours.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Then you pick up books, all sort of =\r\nbooks read all about other guys &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; reaching god, start reading into =\r\ntheir experiences, start discussing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; about their high spiritual st=\r\nates and everything, and get lost  in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; arguing over those discussi=\r\nons. Then post apologies, my goodness, the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; noise. Waste of a huma=\r\nn birth, if you were to see the line waiting for a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; human womb, an=\r\nd then realize &quot;I&quot; have to stand at the end of this line, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you wou=\r\nld piss yourself. Some girl after seeing it did, and has always &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; b=\r\neen a little urgent with her sadhana ever since then.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I =\r\nsee this question getting asked a lot, that &quot;how do you find a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gu=\r\nru????&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And you know everyone, wants a high powered one, not any o=\r\nther will do.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; See a high powered guru, also requires a good discip=\r\nle.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Are you good enough, honestly answer this??? Many will say no,=\r\n many will &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; say good or not, its the guru&#39;s job to deal with it et=\r\nc etc, but are you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; willing to work on yourself to spare the guru =\r\nsome work???? Why would a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; high powered one come and teach you??? =\r\nonly after your penance is good &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; enough na? otherwise, he/she will=\r\n be busy in his/her union with god.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Now how bad do you w=\r\nant god?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; How bad do you want a guru?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   How bad do you wan=\r\nt those spiritual states?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; How bad do you want the darsahn for your=\r\n beloved?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t kind of want it, want it bad, time is ru=\r\nnning out, and very soon, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; another rebirth, again the young age, a=\r\ngain the teenage, again the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; affairs, again the hormone spikes, ag=\r\nain the degrees, again the sucky &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; jobs, again confused with life, =\r\nagain the financial nightmares, again &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the heart attacks , again t=\r\nhe death, and again, again. Hai ram!!!!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll end this po=\r\nst with an example, a businessman in Delhi in the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1940&#39;s, had don=\r\ne a bit of penance and you know was highly interested in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; god , sh=\r\nod and all this stuff. So one day , he had gone to kerala, and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; me=\r\nt a guy who was proclaimed in the village to be equivalent to lord &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; voldmeort or something but on the god side.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So the guy=\r\n went to meet the guy whose name can&#39;t be taken and asked him &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; , i=\r\n am looking for a guru, the old fella said , for what exactly are you &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; looking for a guru??? The business man said, , you know to learn stuff=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The old fellow said what are you willing to do for your guru???=\r\n The &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; businessman said anything. The old fella said, okay take all=\r\n your &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clothes off, the businessman was shocked. the suit guy took=\r\n them off &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; reluctantly. then the old fella, told him , wear a patt=\r\na around your &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; neck and roam around the town naked. The businessma=\r\nn was aghast, but the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; old fella, told him &quot;anything right???&quot;, th=\r\ne businessman very BADLY &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wanted a guru, so he went and got shoes =\r\nthrown at him, came back after &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; half an hour to find the old fella=\r\n gone and his clothes gone too. He sat &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; there sobbing, and sobbing=\r\n and cursing god, that i was the biggest fool &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to come here and tr=\r\nust this man. But then as he haid read somewhere, why &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; waste time,=\r\n he started meditating and chanted. 3 hours went by no sign &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of th=\r\ne old man, 4 then 5 but by the 6th, the old fella reappeared, and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n said &quot; here are your clothes, go back to your town.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Th=\r\ne businessman just didn&#39;t want to say anything tried to get up, but &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; couldn&#39;t move. The old fella was weeping with joy, stating that finally =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; he has found someone worthy enough to teach. Somebody who actuall=\r\ny wants &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it &quot; bad &quot;.Old fella took the hotshot as his disciple.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Punjabi fans -----&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Makkah gayan=C3=83=\r\n=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Gal mukdi nahin&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=83=\r\n=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8Paven sau sau jummen padhaiye&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Gan=\r\nga gayan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8Gal mukdi nahin=C3=\r\n=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Paven sau sau gothey khaiye&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Gaya gayan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8Gal mukd=\r\ni nahin=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Paven sau sau panD =\r\npadhaiye&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Bulleh Shah!=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Gal taiyon mukdi=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=E2=82=AC=C3=82=C2=A8&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jadon =\r\nmenu dilon gavaiye.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Parh parh ilm hazaar kitaabaN&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; kadi apne aap nu parhya nahin&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jaa jaa wardey mandar maseetan&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; kadi mann apne wich wareya nahin&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Anven larda shaitaan de na=\r\nal bandeya&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; kadi nafs apne naal larya nahin&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Aakhe peer Bul=\r\nleh Shah aasmani pharna aeN&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; jehra man wich wasda unhoN pharya nahi=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (jisko samajh mien aye who baakiyon ke liye transalte =\r\nkare )&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Satya Shri Akaal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jai mere kaal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nNobody&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; P.S.
