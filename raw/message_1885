Free will is res=\r\ntricted to the\n&gt; amount of freedom the rope allows one.\n \nRamakrishna is a =\r\nmaster of explaining the toughest of philosophical points using the simples=\r\nt of analogies. His analogies are usually quite apt and brilliant.\n \nYes, k=\r\narma or destiny (i.e. the result of past actions) is like a rope tied to th=\r\ne neck of a goat. The rope restricts the movement of the goat, but does not=\r\n determine where the goat goes and what it does! That is upto the goat&#39;s fr=\r\nee will.\n \nA thirsty goat may look at a river nearby and despair as it cann=\r\not reach the river due to the rope. It may try and struggle continually, wi=\r\nthout reaching the river. Another thirsty goat may realize that it cannot r=\r\neach the river, accept that, look around, find a small bucket of water behi=\r\nnd it within reach if it negotiates with the rope and the obstacles. It may=\r\n turn back, go, drink that water in the bucket and be happy.\n \nWhile the de=\r\nstiny as frozen at the time of birth (and as reflected in the horoscope) is=\r\n like the rope tying the goat and the surroundings of the goat, the actions=\r\n of free will after birth are like the actions of the goat - how it accepts=\r\n and negotiates the rope and its surroundings to get what it wants.\n \n*    =\r\n    *        *\n \nToday&#39;s actions (karma) are tomorrow&#39;s destiny (karma). So=\r\nme of today&#39;s actions may impact destiny in a future life. Some of today&#39;s =\r\nactions may modify destiny for tomorrow (in this life itself!). Let me exte=\r\nnd Ramakrishna&#39;s analogy to explain it.\n \nA goat tied to a tree with a rope=\r\n may go around the tree a few times in one direction and the rope may get s=\r\nhorter. It may now be unable to reach places it was able to reach earlier. =\r\nSimilarly, some bad acts of free will in this life may tighten the destiny,=\r\n make things worse and reduce one&#39;s options.\n \nIt may go around the tree a =\r\nfew times in another direction and the rope may get longer. It may now be a=\r\nble to reach places it was unable to reach earlier. Similarly, some good ac=\r\nts of free will in this life may improve the destiny and make more things p=\r\nossible.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOne&#39;s mind is conditioned based on one&#39;s d=\r\nestiny. One&#39;s surroundings and life situations faced by one are influenced =\r\nby one&#39;s destinty. One will be pulled in certain directions. One may feel a=\r\nttraction for another person. Another person may hate one an, abuse one and=\r\n throw obstacles. One may not have enough money to live happily. One may be=\r\n adored by millions of people. And so on. One faces different life situatio=\r\nns at different times and in different matters.\n \nHowever, destiny only sho=\r\nws how one (and one&#39;s mind) is pulled in various directions and what life s=\r\nituations one finds oneself in. Irrespective of the mental conditioning and=\r\n one&#39;s circumstances, one can still choose between different actions. The a=\r\nctions taken by one are not fixed based on the horoscope. For example, one =\r\nperson may abuse one badly and one may feel great anger towards that person=\r\n, all on account of a previous karmik debt. But, when badly provoked, one c=\r\nan either succumb to the temptation and fight back or just ignore and move =\r\non.\n \nDestiny places you in different situations. What you do in those situ=\r\nations is based on how you use your free will. In some cases, free will has=\r\n a lot of wiggle room and many options and, in some cases, it has fewer opt=\r\nions. But, usually, you do have several options that may or may not be obvi=\r\nous and the action you finally choose shapes your destiny in a future birth=\r\n.\n \n*        *        *\n \nPlease note that the Sanskrit word for destiny is=\r\n karma and the Sanskrit word for action is also karma. Basically, actions o=\r\nf today become destiny of tomorrow. You will get reaction in future to your=\r\n current actions and destiny is the sum total of those actions that will co=\r\nme back to you.\n \nEach action of yours that impacts other beings and object=\r\ns of this universe will go towards forming your destiny for future. (Here p=\r\nlease note that both physical and mental actions count. Any emotions you fe=\r\nel towards someone else and do not necessary express outwardly will also im=\r\npact that person in a subtle manner and hence counts as an action.)\n \nHoros=\r\ncope captures the good and bad actions, committed physically or mentally to=\r\n other beings, until the current birth, which are to give their reactions i=\r\nn this life. This is also known as destiny.\n \nIt does not fix what you do i=\r\nn various situations in your current life. You have the ability to make dif=\r\nferent choices at important crossroads. The choices you make are your karma=\r\n (actions) and they shape your destiny for future. They may either impact y=\r\nour current life itself, or become part of the destiny (as reflected in the=\r\n horoscope) in the next life.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAnybody who tells you=\r\n that so and so houses show acts of free will does not understand what free=\r\n will is. Horoscope is the frozen list of past karmas that form one&#39;s desti=\r\nny for this life. It is like the rope tying the goat. Acts of free will are=\r\n like how the goat negotiates the rope and moves around within the possible=\r\n area to do its stuff. That is in the hands of the goat.\n \nThe scope and op=\r\ntions available to free will can be estimated from the horoscope, but the e=\r\nxact acts of free will are unpredictable based on horoscope. To complicate =\r\nthings further, how exactly free will has been used until now in this life =\r\n(which cannot be seen from the horoscope) has an impact on the scope and op=\r\ntions available to free will at this time. The exertion of free will until =\r\nnow may have modified the destiny.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI am not downpla=\r\nying astrology. Going back to the original Chiranjeevi prediction, the pred=\r\niction that he would come into politics in 2007-2009 and enjoy some kind of=\r\n power was made using astrology. When someone is already a candidate, even =\r\na random prediction of success or failure has a 1/2 or 1/3 probability. But=\r\n, when there are no signs on the ground, a prediction on one&#39;s political en=\r\ntry in a specific timeframe has a very low probability. Such a low probabil=\r\nity prediction made 7 years ahead using astrology came true. Moreover, we h=\r\nave all seen many cases where astrology worked spectacularly. I am not sayi=\r\nng astrology is nonsense. But I am saying that we do not attempt to underst=\r\nand its shortcomings.\n \nWhen someone&#39;s free will works in a predictable way=\r\n, i.e. when one&#39;s free will has very few options and/or one reacts to life =\r\nsituations thrown up by the destiny in predictable ways, job of an astrolog=\r\ner is easier. But, when free will has a wide range of options and/or one us=\r\ned the free will powerfully, the gap between the destiny as reflected by ho=\r\nroscope and the actual destiny as a result of those actions may make an ast=\r\nrologer fail.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree =\r\nJyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------- \n \n&gt; --- On Wed, 5/27/09, Shyam V.

At=\r\n the time of that prediction, there were no such indications on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n ground. But he did come into politics in the same timeframe. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\nnitial talk was in 2007, he finally formed a party in 2008 and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elec=\r\ntions were in 2009. Though his party did badly, he was elected as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n legislator (MLA) in May 2009.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the original predi=\r\nction was quite successful. However, I upped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ante last year by =\r\nsuggesting that Chiranjeevi&#39; s party would do well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 2009 election=\r\ns. Though I was not specific regarding his level of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success and did=\r\n not predict that he would become the Chief Minister, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was honestl=\r\ny expecting his party to do better than they managed. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fol=\r\nlowup of my original prediction is a failure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal observation that the success rate in hig=\r\nh profile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political predictions is less than in regular predictions=\r\n like marriage,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, childbirth etc in &quot;regular&quot; charts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In some cases, the reason is that the birthdata is not accurate a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet we are eager to make predictions. But sometimes we make bad\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions with good data too. Of course, it can be a human error =\r\nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judging various factors. However, that human error seems to be a=\r\n little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more common in high profile political predictions than in r=\r\negular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions. What could be the reason?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n wonder if the factor of free will that is left out of astrology\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pl=\r\nays a bigger role in political charts. I will try to think loud and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n elaborate what I mean.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s=\r\n birth chart contains the list of actions committed in previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liv=\r\nes using one&#39;s free will that are to give their reactions in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nife. However, as life goes on, one accumulates newer actions committed\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; in THIS life using one&#39;s free will. What happens at any point of time i=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s life is a function of ALL actions committed by one until th=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point of time, INCLUDING the actions committed in THIS life unti=\r\nl now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some key actions committed using one&#39;s free will in THIS lif=\r\ne,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially at important crossroads in life, should impact the li=\r\nfe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events from then onwards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people are we=\r\nighed down by too many karmas and always playing a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; catchup. In othe=\r\nr words, destiny (sum of the actions of previous lives\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which are to=\r\n give a reaction now) is too weighty and free will in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life has=\r\n little scope. When the options available for the free will in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this=\r\n life are limited, there may not be significant actions using free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwill and hence the modifications to destiny based on actions of this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; life may not be big enough. Thus, horoscope may be sufficient to predict\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, highly popular, successful and=\r\n high profile public\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personalities may have less restrictions and m=\r\nore options available for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their free will. With their free will bei=\r\nng more free and powerful, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions committed by their free will=\r\n may have a higher weightage. As we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are able to see only their dest=\r\niny in the horoscope (free will exercise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; upto birth) and unable to =\r\nfactor in how free will was exercised in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life until now, we ar=\r\ne perhaps handicapped in our predictions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether a pol=\r\nitical leader is in limelight and becomes MP or the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leader of oppos=\r\nition in parliament or the Prime Minister, he is enjoying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some poli=\r\ntical power. Previous karmas placed him in a position to enjoy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that=\r\n power. To predict the specific degree of power and make an accurate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; prediction, is the horoscope sufficient always? Could the exercise of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; free will in this life until now make a difference in some high profil=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charts?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am just t=\r\nhinking loud here.

At the time of that prediction, there were no s=\r\nuch \nindications on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ground. But he did come into=\r\n politics \nin the same timeframe. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initial talk w=\r\nas in 2007, he \nfinally formed a party in 2008 and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e=\r\nlections were in \n2009. Though his party did badly, he was elected as a&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \nlegislator (MLA) in May 2009.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; Thus, the original prediction was quite su=\r\nccessful. However, I \nupped&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ante last year by su=\r\nggesting that Chiranjeevi&#39; \ns party would do well&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in=\r\n 2009 elections. Though I was not \nspecific regarding his level of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; success and did not \npredict that he would become the Chief =\r\nMinister, I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was \nhonestly expecting his party to do =\r\nbetter than they managed. Thus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; the followup of my =\r\noriginal prediction is a failure.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; It is my personal observation that the success rate in high \nprofile&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political predictions is less than in regular \npredict=\r\nions like marriage,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, childbirth etc in \n&quot;regular=\r\n&quot; charts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In \nsome =\r\ncases, the reason is that the birthdata is not accurate and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&=\r\ngt; &gt; yet we are eager to make predictions. But sometimes we make \nbad&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions with good data too. Of course, it can be =\r\n\na human error in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judging various factors. However, =\r\nthat \nhuman error seems to be a little&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more common i=\r\nn high \nprofile political predictions than in regular&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; \npredictions. What could be the reason?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if the factor of free will that is left ou=\r\nt of \nastrology&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plays a bigger role in political cha=\r\nrts. I will \ntry to think loud and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elaborate what I =\r\nmean.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s birth chart contai=\r\nns the list of actions \ncommitted in previous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives =\r\nusing one&#39;s free will that \nare to give their reactions in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; life. However, as \nlife goes on, one accumulates newer actions =\r\ncommitted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in \nTHIS life using one&#39;s free will. What =\r\nhappens at any point of time in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s life is a fun=\r\nction of ALL actions committed by one until \nthat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; po=\r\nint of time, INCLUDING the actions committed in \nTHIS life until now.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some key actions committed using \none&#39;s free will in THIS=\r\n life,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially at important \ncrossroads in life, =\r\nshould impact the life&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events from \nthen onwards.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many \npeople are weig=\r\nhed down by too many karmas and always playing a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ca=\r\ntchup. In other words, destiny (sum of the actions of previous \nlives&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which are to give a reaction now) is too weighty \nand fre=\r\ne will in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life has little scope. When the \nopti=\r\nons available for the free will in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this life are \nli=\r\nmited, there may not be significant actions using free&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; \nwill and hence the modifications to destiny based on actions of this&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; life may not be big enough. Thus, horoscope may be su=\r\nfficient to \npredict&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, highly popular, successful and h=\r\nigh profile \npublic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personalities may have less rest=\r\nrictions and more \noptions available for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their free =\r\nwill. With their free \nwill being more free and powerful, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; actions committed \nby their free will may have a higher weightage=\r\n. As we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are \nable to see only their destiny in the h=\r\noroscope (free will exercise&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; upto birth) and unable=\r\n to factor in how free will was exercised in \nthis&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nife until now, we are perhaps handicapped in our \npredictions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether a \npolitical leader is =\r\nin limelight and becomes MP or the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \nleader of opposi=\r\ntion in parliament or the Prime Minister, he is enjoying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; some political power. Previous karmas placed him in a position to \nen=\r\njoy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that power. To predict the specific degree of po=\r\nwer \nand make an accurate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prediction, is the horosco=\r\npe \nsufficient always? Could the exercise of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; free wi=\r\nll in \nthis life until now make a difference in some high profile&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; \n&gt; charts?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; * * \n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am jus=\r\nt thinking \nloud here.
