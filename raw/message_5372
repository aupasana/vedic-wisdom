My apologies. However, =\r\nwhen someone/anyone tries to \nsell any idea on the basis of=C2=A0science, i=\r\nt needs to stand scrutiny. The first \nemail which prompted me to reply, was=\r\n based on so called &#39;science&#39;.\n\nScience provides data points and people con=\r\nstruct a big picture based on those \ndata points based on their agenda. Thi=\r\ns applies to all.\nIn fact, in several areas of study, unfortunately science=\r\n itself is today \ngoverned by various political and capitalistic agendas.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nWhile this is correct in some cases, it is not correct in all cases.=\r\n The=C2=A0key \nto=C2=A0objectivity=C2=A0is not blanketing everyone in one b=\r\nrush, but judging every \ninstance on it&#39;s specific merits and evidences. In=\r\n this case though the evidence \nis quite compelling. =C2=A0Your reply=C2=A0=\r\nclearly shows that you have not gone through \nthe evidences in details. I s=\r\ntand by my observation - which I gained the hard \nway - that the &#39;science&#39; =\r\ntouted in vegan sites are a mixture of fallacious \narguments through cherry=\r\n picking=C2=A0and=C2=A0balderdash. \n\n=C2=A0\nThe problem is not with science=\r\n or researchers per se. A reseracher merely looks \nat the evidence, and pla=\r\nces them in order. The problem is when people want to \nprove something for =\r\nwhatever reason,=C2=A0and thus look at the evidences with \ncoloured glasses=\r\n, accepting and rejecting based on convenience. For example all \nthis brouh=\r\naha about homosexuality being natural is a political agenda. There is \nenou=\r\ngh scientifc evidence that homosexuality is not a &quot;natural&quot; phenomenon in \n=\r\nanimal world, though occassionally such behaviour is displayed due to diffe=\r\nrent \nfactors,=C2=A0and in humans it can be reversed.=C2=A0Science is=C2=A0=\r\nfar from conclusive \nabout=C2=A0this issue.=C2=A0But the disease of being=\r\n=C2=A0politically correct has put a lid on \nthese evidences and given an en=\r\ntirely different spin to it. \n\n=C2=A0\nResearch by definition is honest, it =\r\nis those with an agenda who mess things up. \n\n=C2=A0\nBut it is not a good i=\r\ndea to let it control your thinking. Modern science is not \nworthy enough.\n=\r\n\nThank you for your advise. I shall keep this in mind, though I am not a bl=\r\nind \nsupporter of science at all. However, I do not reject science as being=\r\n all \nincorrect. What is correct or incorrect can only be judged, IMHO, by =\r\nunbiased, \nopen minded self study. \n\n=C2=A0\nYour other email on depression =\r\nis true. Psychology/psychiatry/neurology are \nvery, very=C2=A0grey areas wh=\r\nere modern=C2=A0science is=C2=A0just=C2=A0a toddler. \n\n=C2=A0\nI respect fun=\r\ndamental sciences. But, I have limited respect for other \nspeculative and e=\r\nxtrapolatory sciences. They seem to take a few points and \nextrapolate them=\r\n to create a picture. That is why they are always evolving and \nchanging.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nWell this maybe true, but there is more to it. Nothing can be accept=\r\ned or \ndismissed without scrutiny. For example, the same evolutionary ideas=\r\n, specially \nevolutionary anthropology, quite clearly establishes that huma=\r\nn population had \nbeen existing in the Indian subcontinent, atleast,=C2=A0s=\r\nince the last ice age. The \nwhole of AIT and AMT gets shattered. \n\n=C2=A0\nL=\r\nong back, there had been erruptions of some supervolcanoes near India, as i=\r\nn \nother parts of the world too, which covered the whole subcontinent and t=\r\nhe areas \naround it with thick volcanic ashes for a good 5/6 years, killing=\r\n and reducing \nthe population to a mere 10,000. The most dangerous part of =\r\nthis ash is what \nstayed in the air and cut off oxygen. One day I was discu=\r\nssing this with Manish, \nwhen he suggested an interesting idea. When such a=\r\nn erruption occures, the \nreason=C2=A0how and why some people in some areas=\r\n survived, maybe be due to=C2=A0fire \nworship. Homas/yagyas done effectivel=\r\ny can force rainfall and clear the air for \nbreathing.\n=C2=A0\nSome day a gr=\r\neat educationalist should change the whole system of studies in \nIndia. His=\r\ntory needs to be taken out of the clutches of &quot;arts&quot; and coupled with \narch=\r\naelogy and evolutionary studies.=C2=A0Had it been so,=C2=A0many of our hist=\r\norians \nwould not have remained so ignorant about ancient history.\n=C2=A0\nN=\r\natural forces facilitate both suric and asuric (divine and demonic) forces =\r\nthat \nare constantly pulling the universe in different directions. Nature f=\r\navors \ndemonic forces at times and divine forces at times, but divine force=\r\ns in the \nlong run. Great demons ruled earth for thousands of years in the =\r\npast. When \ndemonic thoughts were prevalent, no rishi or god who came to ea=\r\nrth said, &quot;this \nis the work of natural forces and so it must be good&quot;. Ins=\r\ntead, they fought it \nand changed things. The predominant thinking of this =\r\nage that vegetarianism is \n&quot;unnatural&quot; and inefficient, to me, indicates a =\r\ntemporary domination of asuric \nthought. It needs to be defeated by hook or=\r\n crook.\n=C2=A0\nBest of luck to you. \n=C2=A0\nHowever,=C2=A0I cannot agree wi=\r\nth you since there are too many difficult=C2=A0questions \nfor which there a=\r\nre no answers or=C2=A0unconvincing=C2=A0answers, IMO,=C2=A0as yet, =C2=A0fr=\r\nom those \nwho say vegeterianism is more natural for humans.

Scientific point=\r\ns \nmay be mentioned on the sidelines, but cannot be beaten to death.\n\n* * *=\r\n\n\nIn any case, please remember that science addresses well-defined problems=\r\n that \nhave a very narrow focus. Unfortunately, complex problems of life ca=\r\nn often not \nbe defined in such a narrow manner. As a result, what happens =\r\nis that scientists \nhonestly and accurately state their narrow conclusions =\r\nand those who apply that \nknowledge end up extrapolating a bit. That is why=\r\n one scientific research may \nconclude that so and so medicine helps depres=\r\nsion and another research may later \nconclude that the same medicine may ma=\r\nke depressed people commit suicide and the \nmedicine may be recalled!\n\nAbso=\r\nrption of proteins, as indicated by BV that was discussed here, for example=\r\n, \nis just one factor. Absorption of various nutrients, their interplay, th=\r\neir \ndistribution in the system, their impact on metabolism, anabolism and =\r\ncatabolism \netc, are not fully understood by modern science. Modern science=\r\n could only \ncapture a data point here and a data point there, but not the =\r\nfull holistic \npicture. \n\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human =\r\nnutrition is concerned, because human\n&gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) =\r\nis such that it finds certain animal \n&gt;products\n&gt; far easier to digest than=\r\n most planet based products.\n\nThe issue is not the ease of digestion. I did=\r\n not say &quot;foods that are tougher to \ndigest&quot;, but instead used the expressi=\r\non &quot;foods that light up a higher digestive \nagni&quot;.\n\nFor example, cooked car=\r\nrots with black pepper powder and green chillies light up \nhigher agni than=\r\n cooked carrots with just some coriander powder (and no other \nheavier spic=\r\ne) and are easier to digest. The latter is consider more saattwik, \nbecause=\r\n it lights up less agni for its digestion.\n\nSome other food like softly coo=\r\nked onions, for example, may be very easy to \ndigest and light up very litt=\r\nle agni in stomach, but when nutrients in it are \nditributed in the body, t=\r\nhey light up a strong agni elsewhere in the body. Agni \n(fire) is transform=\r\native energy and so many transformations of matter are \noccurring everywher=\r\ne in the body. For example, production of various enzymes and \nhormones in =\r\nthe body involves different kinds of agni. Ayurveda enumerates tens \nof dif=\r\nferent kinds of agni at the physical level alone. There are all kinds of \nc=\r\nonnections between these agnis and the food we eat.\n\nWhen it comes to food =\r\nthat is just sufficient for survival, conserves internal \nagni and facilita=\r\ntes faster spiritual development, ayurveda and Indian yogic \ntradition offe=\r\nr far more holistic theories than modern science can. As I said, \nmodern sc=\r\nience captures a data point here and a data point there and not a \nholistic=\r\n picture. Of course, people like you may want to study modern science \ncrit=\r\nically in order to prepare themselves for possible debates of future. But i=\r\nt \nis not a good idea to let it control your thinking. Modern science is no=\r\nt worthy \nenough.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; .. vegan websites etc .. they merely cherrry pi=\r\nck from researches\n&gt; That is politics and not science!\n\nScience provides da=\r\nta points and people construct a big picture based on those \ndata points ba=\r\nsed on their agenda. This applies to all.\n\nIn fact, in several areas of stu=\r\ndy, unfortunately science itself is today \ngoverned by various political an=\r\nd capitalistic agendas.\n\n* * *\n\nRegarding the NPR interview I mentioned, I =\r\nonly heard the interview with the \nresearcher on radio. I did not read abou=\r\nt it and hence do not know about their \npublications. The research took gor=\r\nillas (or perhaps chimpanzees) that were \ncomparable in various ways and di=\r\nd a controlled experiment over a period of \ntime. The explanation in terms =\r\nof brain development was only a speculation. The \nonly real scientific conc=\r\nlusion of theirs was that eating vegetarian diet over a \nperiod of time mad=\r\ne them smarter.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body stru=\r\nctures have concluded that \n&gt;meat\n&gt; eating along with cropping and fruits h=\r\nas been prevelant since at least 4\n&gt; million years.\n\nI respect fundamental =\r\nsciences. But, I have limited respect for other \nspeculative and extrapolat=\r\nory sciences. They seem to take a few points and \nextrapolate them to creat=\r\ne a picture. That is why they are always evolving and \nchanging.\n\nModern sc=\r\nientific understanding of how human life evolved may or may not be \nperfect=\r\n. I am not convinced by any of their conclusions.\n\nIf I say that there were=\r\n great civilizations 7 million years ago, great kings \nwho ruled earth and =\r\npeople lived orderly lives of happiness and bliss, modern \nscience will dis=\r\nagree. Mainly because they do not have evidence. But I see no \nevidence to =\r\nthe contrary either.\n\n&gt; This cannot be done consciously, but only by the wo=\r\nrk of natural forces.\n&gt; What is your take on this?\n\nNatural forces facilita=\r\nte both suric and asuric (divine and demonic) forces that \nare constantly p=\r\nulling the universe in different directions. Nature favors \ndemonic forces =\r\nat times and divine forces at times, but divine forces in the \nlong run. Gr=\r\neat demons ruled earth for thousands of years in the past.

(I am only dealing \n&gt;with\n&gt; the science part of these discussions, as I=\r\n had already maintained right at \nthe\n&gt; beginning).\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) I heard an int=\r\nerview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) \n&gt;several\n&gt; months b=\r\nack. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was\n&gt; fe=\r\nd with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several\n&gt; m=\r\nonths, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The one=\r\ns\n&gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have any references for this, in =\r\nterms of whether they published any\n&gt; paper on the same, I am interested to=\r\n know and analyse that in details. I am\n&gt; open to learning and reviewing my=\r\n position, provided there is genuine \nevidence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Their theory was that =\r\ndigestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed \nwith\n&gt; nuts and fruit=\r\ns may have diverted more energy towards the development of \nbrain.\n&gt; Though=\r\n they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a\n&gt; b=\r\nalanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition is concerned, becau=\r\nse human\n&gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain=\r\n animal \n&gt;products\n&gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products. =\r\nIn my other mail, I have\n&gt; qoted from a couple of research papers and books=\r\n on clinical nutrition and\n&gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more;=\r\n which may take a few days since \n&gt;I\n&gt; have to get them from people who dea=\r\nl with these topics professionally, but \n&gt;time\n&gt; is not a problem. All the =\r\npapers are from the most accepted and reputed\n&gt; scientific journals. There =\r\nis no confusion. Which is why I said, it is myth\n&gt; that vegeterian foods ar=\r\ne easier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria.\n&gt;\n&gt; Further, in my ex=\r\nperience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any \nmore\n&gt; dull or s=\r\nmarter than traditional omnivores.\n&gt; \n&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Ani=\r\nmals have their own vaasanas and their \n&gt;needs.\n&gt; If an animal can survive =\r\non vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor\n&gt; fellow whatever he/she=\r\n needs.\n&gt; \n&gt; An animal has a specific physical structure and needs to maint=\r\nain the same. \nBut\n&gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I h=\r\nave seen people feeding\n&gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speaking,=\r\n an animal whose whole body\n&gt; structure is designed to be a carnivore, may =\r\nadjust to any food for the sake \nof\n&gt; survival, but will become internally =\r\nweak and susceptable to disease and\n&gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for t=\r\nhe disease and weakness that may result\n&gt; from an unnatural diet to an anim=\r\nal?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, bu=\r\nt the \n&gt;chances\n&gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer,=\r\n but smoking makes \none\n&gt; susceptible to cancer. It increases the probabili=\r\nty. Therefore my personal\n&gt; opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it s=\r\nhould taken care of in the best\n&gt; way possible, providing it with whatever =\r\nmaybe needed, including the right \n&gt;diet.\n&gt; \n&gt; _______________\n&gt; \n&gt; A quest=\r\nion for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body structures h=\r\nave concluded that \n&gt;meat\n&gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been =\r\nprevelant since at least 4\n&gt; million years. That, without a diet which was =\r\nomnivorous, the structure of the\n&gt; human stomach (lack of a developed caecu=\r\nm), and the threefold increase in \nbrain\n&gt; size (from archeological evidenc=\r\nes) could never have been what it is today.\n&gt; Which means, an omnivorous di=\r\net has been a natural process, so ingrained that \n&gt;it\n&gt; has changed the ver=\r\ny structure of the human body. This cannot be done\n&gt; consciously, but only =\r\nby the work of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I \n&gt;will\n&gt; provide rele=\r\nvent research papers to prove my claim).\n&gt; \n&gt; What is your take on this?\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Narasim=\r\nha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thu=\r\n, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Food we eat\n&gt; \n&gt; N=\r\namaste friends,\n&gt;\n&gt; There has been a lot of discussion on food. A few quick=\r\n comments.\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our=\r\n body and their\n&gt; interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what w=\r\ne eat has a profound\n&gt; impact on us.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) Much has been written on the m=\r\naterial benefits from vegetarianism. But \nthat\n&gt; is not all. There are spir=\r\nitual and subtle reasons as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an =\r\nanimal that strongly identifies with the\n&gt; physical body entails a karma. S=\r\nelf-identification of plants with their \n&gt;physical\n&gt; body is much subtler a=\r\nnd the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is \nmuch\n&gt; smaller.\n&gt;\n&gt; E=\r\nspecially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by\n&gt; =\r\ncorporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for th=\r\neir\n&gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n&gt;\n&gt; (3) I hear=\r\nd an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) \n&gt;several\n&gt; =\r\nmonths back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas =\r\nwas\n&gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After sev=\r\neral\n&gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets.=\r\n The ones\n&gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt;\n&gt; Their theory was that digestion =\r\nof meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed \nwith\n&gt; nuts and fruits may have=\r\n diverted more energy towards the development of \nbrain.\n&gt; Though they were=\r\n not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a\n&gt; balanced ve=\r\ngetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n&gt;\n&gt; (4) =\r\nAfter we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus \nwel=\r\nl\n&gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestiv=\r\ne \n&gt;process\n&gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and =\r\nthere isn&#39;t much\n&gt; agni available for other activities such as digestion of=\r\n intellectual ideas \n&gt;that\n&gt; happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of s=\r\npiritual ideas/experiences also\n&gt; requires agni and that cannot happen well=\r\n. That is why meditation or homam \n&gt;after\n&gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and =\r\nwe are normally advised to do sadhana before\n&gt; eating.\n&gt;\n&gt; (5) If foods tha=\r\nt light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried \nfood\n&gt; with mor=\r\ne oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed \nmore\n&gt; =\r\nfrequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less=\r\n \n&gt;agni\n&gt; available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and e=\r\nxperiences. \nIf\n&gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simpl=\r\ne grains, simple\n&gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mi=\r\nld spices, and \nfruits),\n&gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more=\r\n agni is available for\n&gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and =\r\nexperiences.\n&gt;\n&gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge s=\r\ntacks of dry grass \n&gt;may\n&gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bi=\r\nt of internal fire may be \n&gt;enough\n&gt; to assimilate spiritual ideas and expe=\r\nriences in a person with excellent\n&gt; vaasanas and few obstructions (dry gra=\r\nss). A lot of internal fire may be \nneeded\n&gt; in a person with poor vaasanas=\r\n and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all\n&gt; depends on vaasanas and =\r\nimpurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt;\n&gt; One person may eat meat and deep fried=\r\n foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting\n&gt; them and yet make excellent spir=\r\nitual progress. Another person may eat \nsaattwik\n&gt; food, maximize the agni =\r\navailable for spiritual transformation and yet \nstruggle\n&gt; to progress spir=\r\nitually. However, the best course of action for one is to \n&gt;ignore\n&gt; counte=\r\nr-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that\n&gt; maximi=\r\nzes the agni available for spiritual progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s qu=\r\nestion: Animals have their own vaasanas and their \n&gt;needs.\n&gt; If an animal c=\r\nan survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor\n&gt; fellow what=\r\never he/she needs.\n&gt;\n&gt; (8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yo=\r\ngi should consume enough\n&gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma in the material\n&gt; world using physical body and make spiritual =\r\nprogress. Eating too much food is\n&gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ins=\r\ntead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is\n&gt; b=\r\netter to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more important fo=\r\nr\n&gt; transformation and success, than occasional practices.\n&gt;\n&gt; (9) By merel=\r\ny thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food\n&gt; to be =\r\ngod&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how\n&gt; dee=\r\nply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one \ninternal=\r\nly\n&gt; feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e=\r\n.g.\n&gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-2067762744-1291321739=:41789\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;You are correct, this is not a forum on science, therefore this discussi=\r\nng need not have taken place at all. My apologies. However, when someone/an=\r\nyone tries to sell any idea on the basis of&nbsp;science, it needs to stand=\r\n scrutiny. The first email which prompted me to reply, was based on so call=\r\ned &#39;science&#39;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Science provides data points=\r\n and people construct a big picture based on those data points based on the=\r\nir agenda. This applies to all.&lt;BR&gt;In fact, in several areas of study, unfo=\r\nrtunately science itself is today governed by various political and capital=\r\nistic agendas.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;While this is correct i=\r\nn some cases, it is not correct in all cases. The&nbsp;key to&nbsp;objectiv=\r\nity&nbsp;is not blanketing everyone in one brush, but judging every instanc=\r\ne on it&#39;s specific merits and evidences. In this case though the evidence i=\r\ns quite compelling. &nbsp;Your reply&nbsp;clearly shows that you have not g=\r\none through the evidences in details. I stand by my observation - which I g=\r\nained the hard way - that the &#39;science&#39; touted in vegan sites are a mixture=\r\n of fallacious arguments through cherry picking&nbsp;and&nbsp;balderdash. &lt;=\r\n/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;The problem is not with science or researchers per se.=\r\n A reseracher merely looks at the evidence, and places them in order. The p=\r\nroblem is when people want to prove something for whatever reason,&nbsp;and=\r\n thus look at the evidences with coloured glasses, accepting and rejecting =\r\nbased on convenience. For example all this brouhaha about homosexuality bei=\r\nng natural is a political agenda. There is enough scientifc evidence that h=\r\nomosexuality is not a &quot;natural&quot; phenomenon in animal world, though occassio=\r\nnally such behaviour is displayed due to different factors,&nbsp;and in hum=\r\nans it can be reversed.&nbsp;Science is&nbsp;far from conclusive about&nbsp=\r\n;this issue.&nbsp;But the disease of being&nbsp;politically correct has put=\r\n a lid on these evidences and given an entirely different spin to it. &lt;/P&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Research by definition is honest, it is those with an agen=\r\nda who mess things up. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;But it is not a good idea =\r\nto let it control your thinking. Modern science is not worthy enough.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Thank you for your advise. I shall keep this in mind, though I a=\r\nm not a blind supporter of science at all. However, I do not reject science=\r\n as being all incorrect. What is correct or incorrect can only be judged, I=\r\nMHO, by unbiased, open minded self study. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Your other =\r\nemail on depression is true. Psychology/psychiatry/neurology are very, very=\r\n&nbsp;grey areas where modern&nbsp;science is&nbsp;just&nbsp;a toddler. &lt;/P=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;I respect fundamental sciences. But, I have limited =\r\nrespect for other speculative and extrapolatory sciences. They seem to take=\r\n a few points and extrapolate them to create a picture. That is why they ar=\r\ne always evolving and changing.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Well thi=\r\ns maybe true, but there is more to it. Nothing can be accepted or dismissed=\r\n without scrutiny. For example, the same evolutionary ideas, specially evol=\r\nutionary anthropology, quite clearly establishes that human population had =\r\nbeen existing in the Indian subcontinent, atleast,&nbsp;since the last ice =\r\nage. The whole of AIT and AMT gets shattered. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Long ba=\r\nck, there had been erruptions of some supervolcanoes near India, as in othe=\r\nr parts of the world too, which covered the whole subcontinent and the area=\r\ns around it with thick volcanic ashes for a good 5/6 years, killing and red=\r\nucing the population to a mere 10,000. The most dangerous part of this ash =\r\nis what stayed in the air and cut off oxygen. One day I was discussing this=\r\n with Manish, when he suggested an interesting idea. When such an erruption=\r\n occures, the reason&nbsp;how and why some people in some areas survived, m=\r\naybe be due to&nbsp;fire worship. Homas/yagyas done effectively can force r=\r\nainfall and clear the air for breathing.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Some day a gr=\r\neat educationalist should change the whole system of studies in India. Hist=\r\nory needs to be taken out of the clutches of &quot;arts&quot; and coupled with archae=\r\nlogy and evolutionary studies.&nbsp;Had it been so,&nbsp;many of our histor=\r\nians would not have remained so ignorant about ancient history.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Natural forces facilitate both suric and asuric (divine and d=\r\nemonic) forces that are constantly pulling the universe in different direct=\r\nions. Nature favors demonic forces at times and divine forces at times, but=\r\n divine forces in the long run. Great demons ruled earth for thousands of y=\r\nears in the past. When demonic thoughts were prevalent, no rishi or god who=\r\n came to earth said, &quot;this is the work of natural forces and so it must be =\r\ngood&quot;. Instead, they fought it and changed things. The predominant thinking=\r\n of this age that vegetarianism is &quot;unnatural&quot; and inefficient, to me, indi=\r\ncates a temporary domination of asuric thought. It needs to be defeated by =\r\nhook or crook&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Best of luck to you. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;However,&nbsp;I cannot agree with you since there are too many dif=\r\nficult&nbsp;questions for which there are no answers or&nbsp;unconvincing&n=\r\nbsp;answers, IMO,&nbsp;as yet, &nbsp;from those who say vegeterianism is mo=\r\nre natural for humans.

Unfortunately, complex problems=\r\n of life can often not be defined in such a narrow manner. As a result, wha=\r\nt happens is that scientists honestly and accurately state their narrow con=\r\nclusions and those who apply that knowledge end up extrapolating a bit. Tha=\r\nt is why one scientific research may conclude that so and so medicine helps=\r\n depression and another research may later conclude that the same medicine =\r\nmay make depressed people commit suicide and the medicine may be recalled!&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Absorption of proteins, as indicated by BV that was discussed here, =\r\nfor example, is just one factor. Absorption of various nutrients, their int=\r\nerplay, their distribution in the system, their\n impact on metabolism, anab=\r\nolism and catabolism etc, are not fully understood by modern science. Moder=\r\nn science could only capture a data point here and a data point there, but =\r\nnot the full holistic picture. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is a wrong th=\r\neory as far as human nutrition is concerned, because human&lt;BR&gt;&gt; stomach =\r\nstructure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal products&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The issu=\r\ne is not the ease of digestion. I did not say &quot;foods that are tougher to di=\r\ngest&quot;, but instead used the expression &quot;foods that light up a higher digest=\r\nive agni&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For example, cooked carrots with black pepper powder and =\r\ngreen chillies light up higher agni than cooked carrots with just some cori=\r\nander powder (and no other heavier spice) and are easier to digest. The lat=\r\nter is consider more saattwik, because it lights up less agni for its diges=\r\ntion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some other food like softly\n cooked onions, for example, may b=\r\ne very easy to digest and light up very little agni in stomach, but when nu=\r\ntrients in it are ditributed in the body, they light up a strong agni elsew=\r\nhere in the body. Agni (fire) is transformative energy and so many transfor=\r\nmations of matter are occurring everywhere in the body. For example, produc=\r\ntion of various enzymes and hormones in the body involves different kinds o=\r\nf agni. Ayurveda enumerates tens of different kinds of agni at the physical=\r\n level alone. There are all kinds of connections between these agnis and th=\r\ne food we eat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When it comes to food that is just sufficient for sur=\r\nvival, conserves internal agni and facilitates faster spiritual development=\r\n, ayurveda and Indian yogic tradition offer far more holistic theories than=\r\n modern science can. As I said, modern science captures a data point here a=\r\nnd a data point there and not a holistic picture. Of course, people like yo=\r\nu may want to study modern science\n critically in order to prepare themselv=\r\nes for possible debates of future. But it is not a good idea to let it cont=\r\nrol your thinking. Modern science is not worthy enough.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; .. vegan websites etc .. they merely cherrry pick from researches&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; That is politics and not science!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Science provides data points =\r\nand people construct a big picture based on those data points based on thei=\r\nr agenda. This applies to all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In fact, in several areas of study, u=\r\nnfortunately science itself is today governed by various political and capi=\r\ntalistic agendas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regarding the NPR interview I mention=\r\ned, I only heard the interview with the researcher on radio. I did not read=\r\n about it and hence do not know about their publications. The research took=\r\n gorillas (or perhaps chimpanzees) that were comparable in various ways and=\r\n did a controlled experiment over a period of time. The explanation in term=\r\ns of brain development was\n only a speculation. The only real scientific co=\r\nnclusion of theirs was that eating vegetarian diet over a period of time ma=\r\nde them smarter.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Scientists studying evolution and=\r\n human body structures have concluded that meat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; eating along with c=\r\nropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4&lt;BR&gt;&gt; million year=\r\ns.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I respect fundamental sciences. But, I have limited respect for o=\r\nther speculative and extrapolatory sciences. They seem to take a few points=\r\n and extrapolate them to create a picture. That is why they are always evol=\r\nving and changing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Modern scientific understanding of how human life=\r\n evolved may or may not be perfect. I am not convinced by any of their conc=\r\nlusions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I say that there were great civilizations 7 million year=\r\ns ago, great kings who ruled earth and people lived orderly lives of happin=\r\ness and bliss, modern science will disagree. Mainly because they do not hav=\r\ne evidence. But I\n see no evidence to the contrary either.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This=\r\n cannot be done consciously, but only by the work of natural forces.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; What is your take on this?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Natural forces facilitate both suric an=\r\nd asuric (divine and demonic) forces that are constantly pulling the univer=\r\nse in different directions. Nature favors demonic forces at times and divin=\r\ne forces at times, but divine forces in the long run. Great demons ruled ea=\r\nrth for thousands of years in the past.

Instead, they fought it and changed things. Th=\r\ne predominant thinking of this age that vegetarianism is &quot;unnatural&quot; and in=\r\nefficient, to me, indicates a temporary domination of asuric thought.

Let me clarify. (I am only dealing wi=\r\nth&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the science part of these discussions, as I had already maintain=\r\ned right at the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; beginning).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) I heard an intervi=\r\new with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several&lt;BR&gt;&gt; months b=\r\nack. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After sever=\r\nal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two s=\r\nets. The ones&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with meat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you hav=\r\ne any references for this, in terms of whether they published any&lt;BR&gt;&gt; p=\r\naper on the same, I am interested to know and analyse that in details. I am=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; open to learning and reviewing my position, provided there is genu=\r\nine evidence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat take=\r\ns up more energy. Gorillas fed with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; nuts and fruits may have divert=\r\ned more energy\n towards the development of brain.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though they were =\r\nnot sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; balanc=\r\ned vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition is concerned=\r\n, because human&lt;BR&gt;&gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it =\r\nfinds certain animal products&lt;BR&gt;&gt; far easier to digest than most planet=\r\n based products. In my other mail, I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; qoted from a couple of re=\r\nsearch papers and books on clinical nutrition and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dietetics, and if=\r\n you ask, I can provide more; which may take a few days since I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hav=\r\ne to get them from people who deal with these topics professionally, but ti=\r\nme&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not a problem. All the papers are from the most accepted and =\r\nreputed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; scientific journals. There is no confusion. Which is why I =\r\nsaid, it is myth&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that vegeterian foods are easier to digest, if\n di=\r\ngestibility is the criteria.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Further, in my experience, I n=\r\never found traditional vegeterians to be any more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dull or smarter t=\r\nhan traditional omnivores.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question:=\r\n Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If an animal can =\r\nsurvive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fellow w=\r\nhatever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; An animal has a specific physical st=\r\nructure and needs to maintain the same. But&lt;BR&gt;&gt; if trained they can &#39;ad=\r\njust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen people feeding&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vegeterian d=\r\niets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body&lt;BR&gt;&gt; st=\r\nructure is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake =\r\nof&lt;BR&gt;&gt; survival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to dis=\r\nease and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakne=\r\nss that may result&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from an unnatural diet to an\n animal?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but =\r\nthe chances&lt;BR&gt;&gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cance=\r\nr, but smoking makes one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; susceptible to cancer. It increases the pr=\r\nobability. Therefore my personal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; opinion is that an animal if kept =\r\nat home, it should taken care of in the best&lt;BR&gt;&gt; way possible, providin=\r\ng it with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n _______________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A question for you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Scie=\r\nntists studying evolution and human body structures have concluded that mea=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at=\r\n least 4&lt;BR&gt;&gt; million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, =\r\nthe structure of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; human stomach (lack of a developed caecum), an=\r\nd the threefold increase in brain&lt;BR&gt;&gt; size (from archeological evidence=\r\ns) could never have been what it is\n today.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Which means, an omnivor=\r\nous diet has been a natural process, so ingrained that it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; has chang=\r\ned the very structure of the human body. This cannot be done&lt;BR&gt;&gt; consci=\r\nously, but only by the work of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; provide relevent research papers to prove my claim).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; What is your take on this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ________________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Narasimha PVR =\r\nRao &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [vedic-wisdom] Food we eat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; There has been a lot of discussion on\n food. A few quick comments.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our b=\r\nody and their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, wh=\r\nat we eat has a profound&lt;BR&gt;&gt; impact on us.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) Much has=\r\n been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with=\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; physical body entails a karma. Self-identification of plants w=\r\nith their physical&lt;BR&gt;&gt; body is much subtler and the karma entailed in e=\r\nating plant-based foods is much&lt;BR&gt;&gt; smaller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Especially=\r\n these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; cor=\r\nporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; (3) I heard an interview with a\n scientist on NPR (National Public Rad=\r\nio) several&lt;BR&gt;&gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. =\r\nOne set of gorillas was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with n=\r\nuts, fruits etc. After several&lt;BR&gt;&gt; months, researchers found a gap in t=\r\nhe intelligence of the two sets. The ones&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with meat were duller=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up more ene=\r\nrgy. Gorillas fed with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energ=\r\ny towards the development of brain.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though they were not sure if th=\r\ne same thing applies to human beings or not, a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; balanced vegetarian =\r\ndiet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (=\r\n4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus w=\r\nell&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the =\r\ndigestive process&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni o=\r\nr fire) and there isn&#39;t\n much&lt;BR&gt;&gt; agni available for other activities s=\r\nuch as digestion of intellectual ideas that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; happens in the mind. Si=\r\nmilarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; requires agn=\r\ni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana befo=\r\nre&lt;BR&gt;&gt; eating.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher dige=\r\nstive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with more oil, spicy foods =\r\nthat stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; frequently, ag=\r\nni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\navailable for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences=\r\n. If&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple gra=\r\nins, simple&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with m=\r\nild spices, and fruits),&lt;BR&gt;&gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion an=\r\nd more agni is\n available for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritu=\r\nal ideas and experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn w=\r\net grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; be burnt by just on=\r\ne spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to as=\r\nsimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be n=\r\needed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet gra=\r\nss). Thus, it all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and c=\r\nhakras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend=\r\n a lot of agni on digesting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual p=\r\nrogress. Another person may eat saattwik&lt;BR&gt;&gt; food, maximize the agni av=\r\nailable for spiritual transformation and yet struggle&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to progress s=\r\npiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ignore&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their=\r\n needs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwis=\r\ne, feed the poor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (8) =\r\nOne should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the ma=\r\nterial&lt;BR&gt;&gt; world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eatin=\r\ng too much food is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nInstead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more imp=\r\nortant for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; transformation and success, than occasional practices.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all\n actions =\r\nor considering food&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma=\r\n involved. It depends on how&lt;BR&gt;&gt; deeply ingrained that thought is and h=\r\now deeply one feels so. If one internally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; feels 100% that god is ac=\r\nting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; eating) is just go=\r\nd&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nNarasimha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\nborder=\r\n:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:10px 0;padding:0 10px;}\n\n#ygrp-=\r\nmkp hr {\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {\ncolor:#628c2a;font-siz=\r\ne:85%;font-weight:700;line-height:122%;margin:10px 0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\nma=\r\nrgin-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\npadding:0 0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p {\nmargin=\r\n:0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a {\ncolor:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n#ygrp-sponsor =\r\n#ygrp-lc {\nfont-family:Arial;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd {\nmargin:10px 0p=\r\nx;font-weight:700;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc =\r\n.ad {\nmargin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n\na {\ncolor:#1e66ae;}\n\n#actions {\nfon=\r\nt-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;padding:10px 0;}\n\n#activity {\nbackground-co=\r\nlor:#e0ecee;float:left;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10px;padding:10px;}\n\n#=\r\nactivity span {\nfont-weight:700;}\n\n#activity span:first-child {\ntext-transf=\r\norm:uppercase;}\n\n#activity span a {\ncolor:#5085b6;text-decoration:none;}\n\n#=\r\nactivity span span {\ncolor:#ff7900;}\n\n#activity span .underline {\ntext-deco=\r\nration:underline;}\n\n.attach {\nclear:both;display:table;font-family:Arial;fo=\r\nnt-size:12px;padding:10px 0;width:400px;}\n\n.attach div a {\ntext-decoration:=\r\nnone;}\n\n.attach img {\nborder:none;padding-right:5px;}\n\n.attach label {\ndisp=\r\nlay:block;margin-bottom:5px;}\n\n.attach label a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\nbl=\r\nockquote {\nmargin:0 0 0 4px;}\n\n.bold {\nfont-family:Arial;font-size:13px;fon=\r\nt-weight:700;}\n\n.bold a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\ndd.last p a {\nfont-family=\r\n:Verdana;font-weight:700;}\n\ndd.last p span {\nmargin-right:10px;font-family:=\r\nVerdana;font-weight:700;}\n\ndd.last p span.yshortcuts {\nmargin-right:0;}\n\ndi=\r\nv.attach-table div div a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\ndiv.attach-table {\nwidth=\r\n:400px;}\n\ndiv.file-title a, div.file-title a:active, div.file-title a:hover=\r\n, div.file-title a:visited {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\ndiv.photo-title a, div=\r\n.photo-title a:active, div.photo-title a:hover, div.photo-title a:visited {=\r\n\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\ndiv#ygrp-mlmsg #ygrp-msg p a span.yshortcuts {\nfon=\r\nt-family:Verdana;font-size:10px;font-weight:normal;}\n\n.green {\ncolor:#628c2=\r\na;}\n\n.MsoNormal {\nmargin:0 0 0 0;}\n\no {\nfont-size:0;}\n\n#photos div {\nfloat:=\r\nleft;width:72px;}\n\n#photos div div {\nborder:1px solid #666666;height:62px;o=\r\nverflow:hidden;width:62px;}\n\n#photos div label {\ncolor:#666666;font-size:10=\r\npx;overflow:hidden;text-align:center;white-space:nowrap;width:64px;}\n\n#reco=\r\n-category {\nfont-size:77%;}\n\n#reco-desc {\nfont-size:77%;}\n\n.replbq {\nmargin=\r\n:4px;}\n\n#ygrp-actbar div a:first-child {\nmargin-right:2px;padding-right:5px=\r\n;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg {\nfont-size:13px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-=\r\nserif;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg table {\nfont-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg sel=\r\nect, input, textarea {\nfont:99% Arial, Helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n\n#ygr=\r\np-mlmsg pre, code {\nfont:115% monospace;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg * {\nline-height:1.22=\r\nem;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg #logo {\npadding-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg a {\ncolor:#1E6=\r\n6AE;}\n\n#ygrp-msg p a {\nfont-family:Verdana;}\n\n#ygrp-msg p#attach-count span=\r\n {\ncolor:#1E66AE;font-weight:700;}\n\n#ygrp-reco #reco-head {\ncolor:#ff7900;f=\r\nont-weight:700;}\n\n#ygrp-reco {\nmargin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;}\n\n#ygrp-spon=\r\nsor #ov li a {\nfont-size:130%;text-decoration:none;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li =\r\n{\nfont-size:77%;list-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov u=\r\nl {\nmargin:0;padding:0 0 0 8px;}\n\n#ygrp-text {\nfont-family:Georgia;}\n\n#ygrp=\r\n-text p {\nmargin:0 0 1em 0;}\n\n#ygrp-text tt {\nfont-size:120%;}\n\n#ygrp-vital=\r\n ul li:last-child {\nborder-right:none !important;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-2067762744-1291321739=:41789--\r\n\n"}}
