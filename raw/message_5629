The canonical (shaastriya) definition o=\r\nf Rishi is &quot;mantra-drashtaa&quot;), ie Rishi gets the Vision of Mantras. In Kali=\r\nyuga, it is very difficult to explain this term due to heavy load of Uncons=\r\ncious conditionaing. Let me try.\n&gt;\n&gt; Gita says &quot;Among all Vedas, Saamaveda =\r\nis Lord Himself&quot;. Why ? Brahmasutra says that a brahm-jnaani is transported=\r\n to Brahm-loka by the verses of Saamaveda. After a brahm-jnaani leaves his =\r\nbody, he/she also leaves the indriyas which are part of the kaarana or sook=\r\nshma shareera, and is therefore incapable of uttering anything because Vak =\r\nindriya is a karmendriya and part of the discarded kaarana shareera which i=\r\ns a pre-condition of Moksha. Then who utters the verses of Saamaveda which =\r\ncarry the brahm-jnaani to Brahm-loka?? Nobody, Brahmasutra says the verses =\r\nof are &quot;active&quot; agents which carry the passive soul to final destination of=\r\n no return.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, mantras have attributes which cannot be described in =\r\nterms of human sense organs and their tan-maatras. Those who get Visions of=\r\n these alive mantras are rishis. A mantra can have only one rishi, although=\r\n other rishis may also &quot;see&quot; that mantra when needed. Without invoking the =\r\noriginal rishi, a mantra cannot be used. Anyone who is not the original Per=\r\nceiver of a vedic mantra cannot be called a rishi, whatever be his/her grea=\r\ntness on any scale. Rishi is different from any incarnation of God or gods.=\r\n We have no right to change canonical definitions of canonical terms to sui=\r\nt our defective, distorted and &quot;conditioned&quot; thinking.\n&gt;\n&gt; -VJ\n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; --- In vedi=\r\nc-astrology@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namas=\r\nte,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Not only rajarshi, but I say that it is very difficult to be a ri=\r\nshi also in this age. People now-a-days have an extremely toned down unders=\r\ntanding of what it means to be a rishi!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At World Association of Vedic=\r\n Studies (WAVES) 2010 conference at Port of Spain, where I taught homam as =\r\na spiritual sadhana, there were atleast 3 people who were called by others =\r\nor by themselves as &quot;rishis&quot;. People think rishi just means a brilliant per=\r\nson or a nice person or a spiritual person. To be a rishi requires much muc=\r\nh much more.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rish means to flow smoothly and quickly. Rishi is one wh=\r\no swiftly flows with the divine will. Let me elaborate what that means spir=\r\nitually.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Most beings with an individualized consciousness (like human=\r\n beings, demons or even deities) are weighed down by the conditioning and w=\r\nill of individual egosense (I-ness) and cannot flow smoothly and quickly wi=\r\nth divine will due to the weight of the conditioning. Just as a very light =\r\nleaf flows in air more freely while a heavier rock falls due to its gravity=\r\n, similarly one with lighter conditioning flows more freely with divine wil=\r\nl, while one with denser conditioning is pulled by the gravity of that cond=\r\nitioning and cannot flow freely with the divine will.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The director of=\r\n a drama may give important roles to an actor without ego and strong views,=\r\n who is in sync with the director and who will simply read one&#39;s lines (eve=\r\nn very complex ones or ones that make no sense initially) without complaini=\r\nng, as opposed to someone who has a problem with one&#39;s lines and with what =\r\nothers say to/about him in the drama and keeps complaining and tries to cha=\r\nnge the script. Similarly, the Supreme Power that runs this universe gives =\r\nimportant roles to beings who overcame individual egosense, have no individ=\r\nual agendas and conditioning, completely in sync with the Supreme Power and=\r\n flow with divine will.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One pulled by the gravity of dense conditioni=\r\nng can get some things done. In comparison, one pulled by the gravity of *l=\r\night* conditioning can get *big* things done in this universe. One with *ex=\r\ntremely light* conditioning is almost free and can get *really huge* things=\r\n done in this universe. One with *zero* (or almost zero) conditioning can g=\r\net *anything* (or almost anything) done in this universe.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Various cat=\r\negories of rishis are in that last zone of zero or near-zero conditioning! =\r\nThey have overcome their conditioning completely and have no desires, no ag=\r\nendas, no likes and no dislikes. They may behave like they have desires, ag=\r\nendas, dislikes, anger etc, but that is just like a drama actor reading out=\r\n the lines as asked by the director. As one&#39;s conditioning drops off, indiv=\r\nidual I-ness and individual will wither away and one is in communion with t=\r\nhe divine always. One has no will and no desires and one flows with the div=\r\nine and can do ANY action willed by the divine. One becomes an instrument t=\r\no implement divine will in the world. Such a being is infinitely powerful a=\r\nnd can really do anything. Nature uses such beings for very very important =\r\nwork. Rishi means such a free-flowing and non-resistant entity.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even =\r\nyogis who have directly experienced oneness with the divine at times can be=\r\n deluded by the polarities of the field of duality from time to time (&quot;GYaa=\r\nninaamapi chetaaMsi devI bhagavatI hi saa balaadaakR^iShya mohaaya mahaamaa=\r\nyaa prayachchhati&quot; - Saptashati). As long as one remains in an individual b=\r\nody (physical or ethereal), *some* conditioning will normally remain. Remov=\r\ning the conditioning completely and being in oneness with the Supreme at al=\r\nl times, is a herculean task and perhaps not possible in today&#39;s times. Jus=\r\nt as only one who has climbed the first 7,000 miles of a mountain knows how=\r\n difficult it is to climb the next 100 miles, similarly a sadhaka who overc=\r\name a lot of one&#39;s conditioning alone will know how difficult it is to over=\r\ncome the last bit of conditioning.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rishi is a very serious and sacred=\r\n word describing really evolved beings. It is almost impossible for one to =\r\nbecome a rishi in this age. Even those saints in the last century or two wh=\r\nom their followers called rishis are most probably not rishis. Even if amsh=\r\na of a rishi comes down to earth in these times, such an amsha may do some =\r\ngreat deeds without reaching the level of a rishi again and then merge back=\r\n (like a thread spawned from a main process in a computer program).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I=\r\nt is good to take rishis as our role models and follow them, but let us und=\r\nerstand what a rishi means and why they are kept on such a high pedestal in=\r\n tradition. There is no need to lower that pedestal to allow more people to=\r\n get onto it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; -------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; =A0 Free Jyotish Software, Fr=\r\nee Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals fo=\r\nr short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; =A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings\n&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;prakashkandpal&quot; &lt;=\r\nprakashkandpal@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It is very well described by you.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; However, I dont agree with the statement that it is not possible to beco=\r\nme a &quot;Rajarshi&quot; during the current times.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhagawat Gita itself te=\r\nlls that whenever evil will be at its peak I will come to the rescue of peo=\r\nple. =A0So, the lord himself in different forms can be stated as Rajarshi w=\r\nho comes to this world in various forms at various times.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In fact=\r\n, I had been thinking about the current planetary positions for a while, es=\r\npecially Guru-Shani axis and Mars getting into Capricorn that signified som=\r\nething positive.
