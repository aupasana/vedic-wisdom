I hope y=\r\nou won&#39;t mind.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBackground for others:\n \nThis gentle=\r\nman had a telephone conversation with me a few days back. He is an advaitin=\r\n. He was doing some rituals earlier. He happened to read &quot;I Am That&quot; book b=\r\ny Nisargadatta Maharaj, an adwaiti and a liberated master. In the weeks aft=\r\ner reading that book, he had a series of mystical experiences that revealed=\r\n one idea after another to him. Based on his experiences, he told me that a=\r\nll that we perceive is an illusion and even knowledge and ignorance are ill=\r\nusions. Is there a need to perform rituals and why? This whole thing is lik=\r\ne a dream and why do we need to do specific things in what we know to be a =\r\ndream?\n \nI mostly listened to what he was saying without saying anything, b=\r\nut said a few things at the end. He said that he sees everything for what i=\r\nt is during an experience, but back to normal at the end of it, e.g. worrie=\r\nd about a sore throat and stuff like that.\n \nI told him that that state of =\r\nnot having fear or likes or dislikes has to be permanent and not a fleeting=\r\n experience. I told him it is good to say duality is an illusion, but one n=\r\needs to deal with it when one is immersed in that illusion most of the time=\r\n. A fleeting experience of reality and immersion in the illusion again is n=\r\not liberation. One needs to strive for a state when one is in that state al=\r\nl the time. To reach that state, it is necessary to pay back one&#39;s karmik d=\r\nebts in the field of duality.\n \nI told him that rituals like homam can be p=\r\nerformed without an individual sankalpa, but just for the pleasure of the d=\r\neity. Thus, one ends up giving something to the universe without considerin=\r\ng whether and what one gets in return. That is conducive to freedom.\n \nHe p=\r\nondered on my words for a few days and replied. I will continue the discuss=\r\nion below with him on the list now.\n \n*        *        *\n \nYour question i=\r\ns a very important one and addressed by many scriptures such as Upanishads,=\r\n Yoga Vaasishtham, Bhagavad Gita etc.\n \nVasishtha taught in Yoga Vaasishtha=\r\nm that knowledge (understanding) and action are the two wings with which th=\r\ne bird of soul flies. It is not possible for one wing to reach the correct =\r\nspeed at once. As the wings are flapped, one wing will take off, the other =\r\nwill take off accordingly, the first wing gains more speed and so on. Event=\r\nually, when there is balance between the two wings, bird flies off.\n \nPerfe=\r\nct understanding and perfect actions do not come by themselves suddenly. Ac=\r\ntions and understanding work together, balance each other and improve each =\r\nother.\n \nOne can start off with some understanding and engage in actions th=\r\nat imbibe that understanding. As one engages in more and more actions that =\r\nare aligned with one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s understanding becomes better and bette=\r\nr. As one&#39;s understanding becomes better and better, it enables actions tha=\r\nt are more and more aligned with one&#39;s dharma. Better understanding results=\r\n in better actions and better actions result in better understanding. You c=\r\nannot separate knowledge from actions. As I said, Vasishtha was very clear =\r\nthat knowledge and actions are two wings. Some modern adwaitins erroneously=\r\n argue: &quot;You are That. There is nothing to do. Even the notion that you are=\r\n bound and you need to do something to become free is an illusion. You ARE =\r\nThat and you ARE free already.&quot; They de-emphasize action. But Vasishtha was=\r\n clear. As I showed in the other mail today, Sri Krishna also taught in Bha=\r\ngavad Gita that some actions aimed at paying off one&#39;s karmik debts are qui=\r\nte necessary and should never be given up as long one is embodied.\n \nIf you=\r\n experience fear or anxiety or like or dislike or pain or other such things=\r\n in the field of duality at any time, you are not really thinking like &quot;Tha=\r\nt&quot;. The meaning of being That is to be beyond such notions at *all* tismes.=\r\n\n \n*        *        *\n \nLet me give very simple and yet apt analogy.\n \nIf =\r\none is in a dream, there is no point in coming in the dream and telling one=\r\n &quot;this is just a dream. This is not your natural state. Wake up&quot;. Merely as=\r\nserting that to one in a dream will not wake one up from the dream! One wil=\r\nl continue to be in the dream. Even if one thinks &quot;this dream is not my rea=\r\nl state. I am actually awake. What I perceive is wakefulness&quot;, it will stil=\r\nl be *in the dream*. One is merely awake *in the dream* and not really awak=\r\ne.\n \nIn order to really wake up from the dream, some things need to happen =\r\nin the dream. One can try to do some things in the dream that are likely to=\r\n end the dream and wake one up. Thus, the notion that it is not real and me=\r\nrely a dream and hence there is no need to do anything is incorrect. Instea=\r\nd of doing stupid things and prolonging a dream, one can do the right thing=\r\ns and wake up soon.\n \nThus, engage in the right actions in the dream (that =\r\nlife in the field of duality is), to wake up to the reality (experience of =\r\nAbsolute at all times)!\n \n*        *        *\n \nAs I mentioned in the other=\r\n mail, constantly self-examine and contemplate. Remove all thoughts of self=\r\n-gratification, pride and expectation from others from the mind. Catch such=\r\n thoughts at the root and cut them off. Focus your energy on engaging in ac=\r\ntions that *give* things to others and the universe, without any considerat=\r\nions of self-gratification and with complete oblivion to what you receive i=\r\nn return. Keep doing selfless actions without any expectations. Eventually,=\r\n your understanding will become perfect and your actions will also become p=\r\nerfect. You will be free then.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBottomline: Both und=\r\nerstanding and actions are needed. Actions accompanied by correct understan=\r\nding are the key. As actions become more perfect and detached, understandin=\r\ng becomes more perfect. As understanding becomes more perfect, actions beco=\r\nme more perfect and detached. At the end, when actions and understanding be=\r\ncome perfect, one becomes free. One then realizes that it was all actually =\r\ngrace.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org/homam\nSpirituality writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotis=\r\nh writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nFree Jyotish less=\r\nons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n-------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n \n---- &lt;deleted&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimha -\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; How does one get rid of this finiteness ?

However, the good\n&gt; &gt; thing is =\r\nthat such an experience also tells one what is possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The goal i=\r\ns to be in that state at all times. Until that is achieved, so\n&gt; &gt; many kar=\r\nmas need to be performed by the ego. As I said, one has to finish\n&gt; &gt; off t=\r\nhe karmas that one signed up for. As one pays off more and more of\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;=\r\ns karmik debts, one becomes freer and freer. But, until one experiences\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n absolute or nearness to absolute at all times, one is not finished here!\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The goal is to replace the finite personality with the Infinite. As =\r\nlong as\n&gt; &gt; the finite personality is present, even a fleeting experience o=\r\nf Infinite\n&gt; &gt; becomes a source of pride, i.e. gets finitized! Until the fi=\r\nnite personality\n&gt; &gt; is replaced for ever by the Infinite, there is more to=\r\n do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- &lt;deleted&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear=\r\n Narasimha -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On introspection , its clear as you said that ego =\r\nand I ness is central\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; established.
