A will get a \nsimilar opportunity later (possibly in another life). At that time, he can \neither do the bad thing to B or resist the temptation again and postpone \nfurther. If A becomes a jeevanmukta by then, i.e. one who is liberated while \nliving and engaging in actions without any sense of I-ness, then he can pay \nback the bad thing without incurring further karmas. If A got moksha and got \nout of the game, then A is fine but B still has that karma pending. Nature \nwill find a stubstitute to pay back this karma to B. That person will get an \nopportunity to do the bad thing to B.\n\nWhen I say paying back, please note that the action and reaction are not \nnecessarily identical, but they are compatible.\n\nNow, answer to Utpal: A is out of cycle as he accepted what happened and B \nhas a bad karma. Either A or a substitute will get a chance to pay back that \nbad karma to B later. If A succumbs to the temptation when he gets an \nopportunity later to pay back, he is back in the cycle.\n\nYou do something to someone. They pay you back. The cycle is done. If they \nidentified with the action of payback, it becomes new karma for them. You \nwill again get a chance to pay back them again. If you do (and identify with \nthe action), you are back in the cycle. And so on.\n\nIt is quite complex. But the key to getting out of the cycle is: accepting \nwhat happens to you, being good to others and overcoming ego and the sense \nof &quot;I am doing&quot;.\n\n*        *        *\n\nKarma is not just good and bad things we do to people. It is also the \nthoughts entertained by the mind. Suppose you see a nice car and think &quot;how \nI wish I had such a car&quot;. Any action or thought that has some force behind \nit becomes a karma and gets a reaction from Nature. When your punya balance \nis sufficient in a future life, Nature will give you such a car, whether or \nnot you want it in that life! You may not know why you got it, but you got \nit because you asked for it earlier.\n\nNature is like a bank which keeps track of your wish list and your debt \nlist. It automatically withdraws from your karma account to pay back your \ndebts and it automatically withdraws from your karma account to pay for \nthings on your wish list.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, April 27, 2009 8:36 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n\n\nNamaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,\n\nI wish to add or say Echo the same thing in different words.\n\nPlease Consider this -\n\nA Cheats B (Say for the instance that Cycle started now)\nNext time B gets the oppotunity and strong desire to cheat A and B does it \nwith sense of EGO and enjoys that rvenge.\nNow if A accepts it calmly and naturally without any sadness and without any \nemotions of hatred towards B -Now then i feel that A is out of the \nperticular cycle but what about B.

Nature has created \n&gt; a\n&gt; situation where it can be paid back. In other words, Nature has placed \n&gt; that\n&gt; person in a position to cheat or hurt you and tempted him to do so.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) That person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he has used the\n&gt; opportunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he engages in \n&gt; the\n&gt; action while identifying with the action (&quot;I am doing it&quot;), he now gets a\n&gt; new karma. He will be paid back later.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both are correct. From his perspective, he is doing it with identification\n&gt; and he is incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are being paid\n&gt; back for what you did before.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; In order to break out of this cycle, accept it when somebody does \n&gt; something\n&gt; to you. Do not hate the person or pity yourself. Don&#39;t think &quot;why does it\n&gt; have to happen to me&quot;. Think only about your current action (&quot;what is the\n&gt; best thing for me to do NOW?&quot;) and do NOT think about what happened, why \n&gt; it\n&gt; happened, who did it and how things happening to you are unfair.\n&gt;\n&gt; The tricky thing is when Nature places you in a position to pay back\n&gt; somebody else&#39;s bad karma and creates a strong temptation for you to do \n&gt; so.\n&gt; You may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a bad thing to someone! But\n&gt; remember one thing. Any thought or action with a sense of doership (&quot;I am\n&gt; doing&quot;) will create a new karma, even if the other person brought it on\n&gt; himself with a previous action.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you can engage in an action without a sense of doership and \n&gt; surrendering\n&gt; the action to the Lord completely, you will not incur karma. But that is\n&gt; very very difficult - almost impossible for most. Of course, you can also\n&gt; postpone the payback through the use of your *will power*, i.e. avoid the\n&gt; temptation and not do the bad thing to the other person. As long as we \n&gt; live\n&gt; in a body, some karmas will need to be incurred. But good discretion,\n&gt; self-control and strong will power will enable one to postpone the most\n&gt; troublesome karmas to a later time.\n&gt;\n&gt; When the reactions to your previous karmas are paid back and through who \n&gt; is\n&gt; not in YOUR control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. So \n&gt; you\n&gt; can do nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to a large\n&gt; extent under your control. Use your will power to do the right things.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@grouply. com&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, April 26, 2009 2:19 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks you for the beautiful explanation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not very clear on some of the points you have mentioned:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; is it that everything that is happening to us in this life is all \n&gt; &gt; reaction\n&gt; &gt; to some of our past actions?it is difficult for me to understand this.\n&gt; &gt; To me, it can also be that someone is pushing this suffering onto us as\n&gt; &gt; his action than a reaction of our old karmas.\n&gt; &gt; In any case, if we are getting cheated and we know it clearly why should\n&gt; &gt; we sit back and just let things happen against us, why should we not \n&gt; &gt; fight\n&gt; &gt; back?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; KK\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Before I answer it, I want to say that I am \n&gt; &gt;&gt; impressed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with the decription of your friend. My pranaams to him. Does he live in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the greater Boston area too?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Karma and karmaphala (action and reaction) are like pushing something \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; being pushing back as a reaction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When you karmically push an object with some force and that object \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pushes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you back karmically with the same force at a later point of time, it is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not necessary that you resist it and apply some more force to push \n&gt; &gt;&gt; again.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed now. That \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reaction. How you take this push and whether you resist or not has\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; apply some force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its \n&gt; &gt;&gt; reaction\n&gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level of mental equanimity and stability does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have an ego. Each living person has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds\n&gt; &gt;&gt; him to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this, who knows so and so things, who does so and so things, who wants \n&gt; &gt;&gt; so\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the father of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). \n&gt; &gt;&gt; If\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbound \n&gt; &gt;&gt; from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body. So\n&gt; &gt;&gt; any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; gets\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; environment and re-attached to another body and environment. Nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tracks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your old apartment to your new apartment when you change address, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; delivers the reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I-ness in this life.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will\n&gt; &gt;&gt; continue to deliver the reactions to various previous actions from that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; election, being criticized by thousand people, being hit by wife, being\n&gt; &gt;&gt; abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being cheated by a friend\n&gt; &gt;&gt; etc etc are examples of reactions to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sense of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; previous good karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; excited or elated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; good\n&gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one \n&gt; &gt;&gt; feels\n&gt; &gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one \n&gt; &gt;&gt; should\n&gt; &gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; bad\n&gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoints him. You cheated\n&gt; &gt;&gt; someone. Nature will arrange such that that person cheats you now. How\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you feel about it now is not relevant as far as the old action-reaction\n&gt; &gt;&gt; equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm \n&gt; &gt;&gt; does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not stop Nature from doing its job.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that way. By not reacting to what is happening \n&gt; &gt;&gt; now,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; previous\n&gt; &gt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction to your own action (but if he does it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with self-identification with the action, it becomes a new karma for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; person. But, that is irrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; without doing anything, you finish off your karmic debt. Instead, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; suppose\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you fight and try to stop the person from cheating you. Then your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; current\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actions would become a NEW karma and you will have to face its reaction\n&gt; &gt;&gt; later. If you want to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have to behave like the person you described below. Accept whatever \n&gt; &gt;&gt; comes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with a calm and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; relaxed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the right thing to do at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the moment, with as little self-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this, your instincts and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Karma\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they are able to be in a neutral\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; frame\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected by what is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours lost his wife in a road accident a few\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; years\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ago. Her head was crashed into a pulp right before his eyes. He very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; calmly picked her up, took her to the hospital and took care of all \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duties towards her and the family. His wife was a very spiritual \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and so is he. Right before the accident, his wife told him of her\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; recent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation experience and that she would probably be leaving her body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; soon. her husband never shed a tear and was in the utmost calm and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cheerful frame of mind even during the funeral process. Some folks \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; felt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to be a bit odd. He is a highly educated professor with a stable \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mind.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; His\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wife and he shared a very high spiritual and mental bond and they \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; two\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; teenage sons. I have the utmost reverance towards him and also in awe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his spiritual level. My question is how would his karmas be burnt if \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; never feels the pain of such a perceived tragedy?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;name deleted for privacy&gt;\n\n\n"}}
