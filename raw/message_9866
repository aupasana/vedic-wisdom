Everyone,\n&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;I just thought of adding some clarifications.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;First of all, when =\r\nI mentioned about the utility of techniques of &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Lif=\r\ne Regression&quot; for handling the problem of spirit attachments as well as man=\r\ny other problems for which we do not have reasonable explanation, my assert=\r\nions were limited to the utility part only and not beyond that. I have no k=\r\nnowledge about whether past life exists or not, in fact I do not have any k=\r\nnowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the=\r\n knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge =\r\nin the proper sense of the term. However, in our this empirical life we hav=\r\ne to still continue with life irrespective of the fact of having absolute k=\r\nnowledge or not. Though we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds =\r\nof the earth but it is the other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;S=\r\nun rises=C2=A0in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in the west&quot; etc. To keep l=\r\nife going, we keep on continuing with activities which helps\n in keeping li=\r\nfe go on...It is in this sense that I&#39;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and =\r\n&quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;One should not comment about the wealth in=\r\nside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibil=\r\nities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just can not say that the u=\r\nniverse can behave in any particular limited ways. Before anyone comments a=\r\nbout the utility of any branch of knowledge one=C2=A0must first take a sinc=\r\nere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if=C2=A0one =\r\nreally takes a sincere dip into any subject one would definitely be convinc=\r\ned about the same.=C2=A0By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before t=\r\naking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=C2=A0by doing so one would pre=\r\nvent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=C2=A0blind belief in rel=\r\nigion and religious practices=C2=A0can be termed as dogmatic but also in sc=\r\nience if one loses the scientific temper.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Proof of pudding is in e=\r\nating it, all that I can say to the persons willing to address any of their=\r\n problems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility f=\r\nor=C2=A0those who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mi=\r\nnd. Those who are interested can read &quot; Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian W=\r\neiss&quot; to start with.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;To respected Narasimha sir, I would like to i=\r\nnform that these are not &quot;new age ideas&quot;. These were there much before in I=\r\nndia. to cite concept of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; of Jainism is one among them. Jaina=\r\ns used this technique of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; to reinforce renunciation in the fo=\r\nllowers.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that=C2=A0so far =\r\nas my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over phone,=\r\n but however, there are so many problems which can be handled even over pho=\r\nne. To cite one example - One girl was having=C2=A0one recurrent bad horrif=\r\nying dream for past 4/5 years and she=C2=A0approached me for the treatment.=\r\n=C2=A0But due to my=C2=A0official engagements I was camping at a far off pl=\r\nace for around 2 months.=C2=A0Her problem was getting worsened as it=C2=A0h=\r\nad=C2=A0 started affecting her professional career adversely. So having lef=\r\nt with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone. The phone sess=\r\nion continued for around one and half an hour and she got relieved from her=\r\n that recurrent dream and also started improving her professional life. Sin=\r\nce that day the dream has not yet visited her again.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;It all depend=\r\ns on the openness of the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. =\r\nThe universe is much more than what we see,what we can see and what we can =\r\nbelieve to see.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Regards\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Saturday, October 26, 20=\r\n13 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Nam=\r\naste,\n&gt;\n&gt;To add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understandi=\r\nng of the reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems. R=\r\neincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moment=\r\ns from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external consciou=\r\nsness. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any opport=\r\nunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be rec=\r\nalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved =\r\nand new set is generated based on need.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in =\r\nthe existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our i=\r\ndea of\n Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very different. =\r\nIt is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together\n =\r\nto give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disinte=\r\ngrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these=\r\n can coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts =\r\ncan simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part=\r\n. =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnatio=\r\nn, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while ano=\r\nther part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Lik=\r\ne a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his=\r\n energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarn=\r\nating in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits wit=\r\nh their philosophy.\n&gt;\n&gt;Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a =\r\nreincarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy gove=\r\nrned only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Ja=\r\nin scriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to g=\r\net rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Ni=\r\nrvana. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the ten=\r\ndency towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\nBut the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dis=\r\nsolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to=\r\n another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop thi=\r\ns soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/bo=\r\ndy vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and un=\r\nique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be a=\r\nble to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Div=\r\nine Life.=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, it is o=\r\nnly one among many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state \nof co=\r\nmplete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then th=\r\nere was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex life-actio=\r\nns. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea =\r\nof give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The i=\r\nmportant thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come =\r\nforth to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations imme=\r\ndiately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. T=\r\nhat is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people ca=\r\nn transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get =\r\nborn a hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. Wh=\r\nereas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope of play=\r\n, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and t=\r\nake of energy. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything el=\r\nse being perishable, the only indestructible link between past life and pre=\r\nsent life, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a =\r\ncomplete cinematic biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if ther=\r\ne have been lives when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at al=\r\nl, then those are dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. Fo=\r\nr Nature, those lives serve no purpose at all. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Moreover all these a=\r\nre possible ONLY if and when an individual starts living in and through the=\r\n soul in a very very strong manner. That is not easy. \n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt;=C2=A0R=\r\najarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee =\r\nin, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee l=\r\nike a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Saturday, 26 October=\r\n 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

I&#39;m pursuing this as a hobby only and I don&#39;t char=\r\nge for the services.  For persons who need urgent help can contact any good=\r\n professional hypnotherapist or past life regression therapist. There are l=\r\not many ways to handle varieties of issues for which one may not find any e=\r\nxplanation. Websites of two such professional and good institutes I can rec=\r\nommend are www.liferesearchacademy.com and www.hypnotherapyschoolindia.com.=\r\n if you Google for hypnotherapist and past life regression therapists for y=\r\nour area you might get many of them. But please check their credentials bef=\r\nore approaching anyone except for the two I referred\n above about whom I&#39;ve=\r\n personal knowledge of being highly competent.

I am sure there too one can find good exorcists, maybe not of our =\r\nreligion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have very little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana=\r\n, infact unfortunately have never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana t=\r\nill date.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava w=\r\nhich is considered to be of excellent potency for these kind of problems. T=\r\nhis form of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik=\r\n scriptures He is also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chan=\r\ndika. References to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least som=\r\ne versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been\n invoked for ce=\r\nnturies\n by\n followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against sp=\r\nirits, and specially during rituals\n of cremation ground. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The sta=\r\nndard mantra is (there are many variations of this mantra too, all are good=\r\n):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem =\r\nOm&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in =\r\none sitting. And this should be continued daily till such time that there i=\r\ns some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine=\r\n instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite im=\r\npossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days alm=\r\nost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession fr=\r\nom a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the o=\r\nne trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl wil=\r\nl have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Na=\r\nrasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess=\r\n being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the family=\r\n visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to v=\r\nisit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple=\r\n. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Arou=\r\nnd these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who=\r\n are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge a c=\r\nertain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come wit=\r\nh some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then=\r\n perform their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one me=\r\nthod. I am sure their maybe other methods too.

For there are various classes and kinds and type=\r\ns of entities which can possess an individual and some of them can be downr=\r\night nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As so many different people have advi=\r\nsed, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of t=\r\nhem will actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factor=\r\ns. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what k=\r\nind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link =\r\nfor the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source o=\r\nf exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person.\n Sometimes it =\r\ncan be\n something\n as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) res=\r\nide), or\n causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to s=\r\nuch possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases w=\r\nhere such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ET=\r\nC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of rem=\r\noving and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the sp=\r\nirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to genera=\r\nte in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and e=\r\nxtremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is a=\r\nn adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These things lik=\r\ne removing possession are specializations. These do not fall under the ambi=\r\nt of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, any sa=\r\ndhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every action=\r\n has its repercussion and one must know well how to\n handle the same too. A=\r\ngain\n if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which, based on =\r\nprevious karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individual, then=\r\n that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pleasant=\r\n consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is all a co=\r\nmplex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some ye=\r\nars ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he =\r\nwould ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame=\r\n for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmic l=\r\nink between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals dai=\r\nly to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promising g=\r\nood deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Mos=\r\nt cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nat=\r\nure, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best thing to do is a) find someone=\r\n\n who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the bes=\r\nt. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sa=\r\ndhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,pa=\r\nnchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa =\r\nwith sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of =\r\nhanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone =\r\nmay have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/f=\r\naith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. While doing th=\r\ne sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the po=\r\nssessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as h=\r\nard as possible. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best of luck and may God help the family.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethe=\r\nreal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter thro=\r\nugh them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamna=\r\ndas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.

I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises -  cre=\r\naking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different en=\r\nergies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rathe=\r\nr evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I would make u=\r\np because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but onc=\r\ne I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a=\r\n terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some st=\r\neps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly bec=\r\nome fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be that spiri=\r\nts live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people sta=\r\nying at that place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it&#39;s no=\r\nt just me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that pl=\r\nace before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep p=\r\nroperly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I started wak=\r\ning up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (u=\r\np to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rise=\r\ns, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral =\r\nbeings at night? Something that I can chant before going to sleep. This has=\r\n been bothering me for some time now and it interferes with my life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n---600603132-858043028-1382975916=:33948\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:He=\r\nlveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;fo=\r\nnt-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Was this &#39;Art of Living&#39; center in US?&nbsp;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16.363636016845703px; =\r\nfont-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Gra=\r\nnde&#39;, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16.36363601=\r\n6845703px; font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, =\r\n&#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: nor=\r\nmal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yahoo_quoted&quot; style=3D&quot;display=\r\n: block;&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica N=\r\neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, =\r\n&#39;Lucida\n Grande&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font si=\r\nze=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; On Monday, October 28, 2013 9:44 AM, vinayak tandl=\r\ne &lt;vinayakmechie@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=3D&quot;=\r\ny_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv9503145845&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:non=\r\ne;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv9503145845ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div =\r\nid=3D&quot;yiv9503145845ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv9503145845ygrp=\r\n-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-c=\r\nolor: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Hel=\r\nvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Na=\r\nmaste Guruji,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16p=\r\nx; font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida =\r\nGrande&#39;, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font=\r\n-size: 16px; font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial=\r\n, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: n=\r\normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Art of Living there is a process called as eternity proces=\r\ns by which we can know our past 7 life&#39;s.

To cite one example - One girl wa=\r\ns having&nbsp;one recurrent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she=\r\n&nbsp;approached me for the treatment.&nbsp;But due to my&nbsp;official eng=\r\nagements I was camping at a far off place for around 2 months.&nbsp;Her pro=\r\nblem was getting worsened as it&nbsp;had&nbsp; started affecting her profes=\r\nsional career adversely. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give he=\r\nr a session over phone. The phone session continued for around one and half=\r\n an hour and she got relieved from her that recurrent dream\n and also start=\r\ned improving her\n professional life.

Reincarnation is of the soul, an=\r\nd the soul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul=\r\n had a role to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has l=\r\nived a life where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come fort=\r\nh and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete =\r\nprocess. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based =\r\non need.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The Buddhists do not believe =\r\nin the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to ou=\r\nr idea of\n Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very differen=\r\nt. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces togethe=\r\nr\n to give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disi=\r\nntegrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of th=\r\nese can coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other par=\r\nts can simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different p=\r\nart. &nbsp; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarna=\r\ntion, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while =\r\nanother part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. =\r\nLike a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while =\r\nhis energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body inc=\r\narnating in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits =\r\nwith their philosophy.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Those philosoph=\r\nies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe o=\r\nnly as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of\n debts/b=\r\nalances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this te=\r\nrm. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and mov=\r\ne into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is o=\r\nf any final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunc=\r\niation of life and its processes.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;But =\r\nthe old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolv=\r\ned at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to ano=\r\nther and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this so=\r\nul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body v=\r\nehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique=\r\n soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able =\r\nto *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine =\r\nLife.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultim=\r\nate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.&nbsp; If&nbsp; moving int=\r\no a state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevita=\r\nble aim,\n then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform c=\r\nomplex\n life-actions. &lt;/span&gt;The law of Karma is here too, but it is not re=\r\nstricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the i=\r\ndea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the=\r\n soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes =\r\nthe karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing a=\r\nnd real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have kil=\r\nled hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did =\r\nnot have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of=\r\n those he had killed]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere th=\r\ne soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of =\r\nrnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;yiv9503145845ms__id1914 yiv9503145845ms__id664&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0,=\r\n 0, 0); font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size=\r\n: 16px; font-style: normal; background-color: transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv9503145845ms__id1915 yiv9503145845m=\r\ns__id665&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;ne=\r\nw york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; background-colo=\r\nr: transparent;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything =\r\nelse being perishable, the only indestructible link between past life and p=\r\nresent life, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never =\r\na complete cinematic biography recollection.
