Others may want to skim though...the i=\r\ndeas are beautifully explained. It is an extract from a talk given at the D=\r\nivine Life Society (Sivananda Ashram, Rishikesh), presumably by Swami Chida=\r\nnanda (doesn&#39;t say who the speaker is). \n\nhttp://sivanandaonline.org/newsup=\r\ndates/?p=3D165#respond\n\n\nIn summary, the article says:\n\nStages of spiritual=\r\n growth:\n\n1. The obstacles- lust, anger, greed. Represented by Madhu and Ka=\r\nitabha. \nThe solution/saviour- intensive karma yoga. Represented by MahaKal=\r\ni. \n\nIn essence, the annihilation of Madhu and Kaitabha by Maha Kali, is th=\r\ne removal of the impurities of lust, anger and greed by protracted karma yo=\r\nga. \n\n\n2. The obstacles- tossing of mind, and multiplying desires. Represen=\r\nted by Mahishasura and Raktabija.\nThe solution/saviour- worship of God. Rep=\r\nresented by Maha Lakshmi.\n\nIn essence, worship of God bhakti yoga, allows u=\r\ns to ovecome the tossing of mind and endless desires.\n\n3. The last obstacle=\r\ns- complacency with one&#39;s achievements, ignorance of what remains to be ach=\r\nieved. Represented by Shumba and Nishumba.\nThe solution/saviour- higher wis=\r\ndom that comes after the previous two stages. Represented by Maha Saraswati=\r\n. \n\nIt also says we are not lonely pedestrians on the spiritual path. Every=\r\n one of us is supported by the cosmos, as we are intimitely connected with =\r\neverything else! Apparantly even the smallest act has a significance. I fou=\r\nnd that interesting. I have sometimes felt it&#39;s a long and lonesome road...=\r\n.nice to think it isn&#39;t! :D\n\nOm Sri Durgayai Namaha\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n"}}
