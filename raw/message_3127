But it is ok. Atleast, you are=\r\n engaging your I-sense to work for the benefit of the world rather than sel=\r\nf-gratification. When do a homam or archana, you are trying to please a dei=\r\nty (personification of a particular good quality in all the people of the w=\r\norld). When you do social service, you are helping needy people. And so on.=\r\n\n\nWhile doing various kinds of sadhana, one tries to take the focus of mind=\r\n from the limited self (body, name, status, image etc) and expand it to a l=\r\narger entity (e.g. a deity, a community, a society, a country, universe etc=\r\n). One tries to focus the mind on others and not think much about oneself. =\r\nThis helps one overcome mind&#39;s natural tendency to focus on limited self an=\r\nd gratification of that limited self.\n\nWhile doing that, however, thoughts =\r\nmay arise &quot;I am doing this good and important work&quot;. Such thoughts bring th=\r\ne focus of mind back to the limited self (body, name, status, image etc). B=\r\ny telling oneself that the Lord is doing it though one and that one is mere=\r\nly an instrument, i.e. by cultivating the spirit of &quot;Sarvam Sri Krishnaarpa=\r\nnamastu&quot; , one tries to overcome that tendency towards self-gratification a=\r\nnd/or self-glorification.\n\nAfter repeated practice, such thinking becomes c=\r\nommon sense to one and one&#39;s mind gets focused on doing what one sees as on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma, without any sense of pride or self-gratification or self-glorif=\r\nication.\n\n* * *\n\nIf a priest doing an archana for you takes your name and n=\r\nakshatra in the sankalpam before the pooja, there is nothing to be worried.=\r\n In your mind, try to think as above.\n\nSome priests go much further and say=\r\n all kinds of highly specific things in sankalpa. For example, I have seen =\r\npriests say &quot;to give dharma, artha, kaama, moksha, well-being, strength, bo=\r\nldness, success, fearless, longevity, health, wealth etc to so and so perso=\r\nn, to remove all past, present and future sins and all past, present and fu=\r\nture problems related to all planets, shadowy planets, sub-planets in rasi,=\r\n navamsa, drekkana, trimsamsa etc charts at birth, in dasas and in transits=\r\n, and to give results as though all planets are placed in the 11th house an=\r\nd not in the actual house of placement&quot; etc etc. Some priests spend 5-10 mi=\r\nnutes mentioning so many specific desires in sankalpam. When you find a pri=\r\nest saying things like that, I suggest just taking it easy and not getting =\r\neither excited or disturbed. Just think in your mind &quot;I am doing this ritua=\r\nl as a humble offering to you. Please receive it kindly and give whatever y=\r\nou see as appropriate&quot; and try\n to focus the mind on the deity. What&#39;s in y=\r\nour heart is far more important than anything else.\n\n* * *\n\nCultivating the=\r\n sense that whatever good work you are doing is being done by the Lord *thr=\r\nough you* and whatever results (including very bad ones) are given to you a=\r\nre fruits granted by the Lord to your karmas which you should accept withou=\r\nt regrets, is an important activity that should go on outside of the ritual=\r\n time.\n\nFor example, when one&#39;s wife or husband (or someone close) yells at=\r\n one or abuses one, fairly or unfairly, one has a choice. One can either be=\r\ncome upset and angry and remain in that mood for a few hours wondering why =\r\nthe other person is so unfair/wrong, or one can just accept it as the fruit=\r\ns given by the Lord for one&#39;s previous actions and focus the mind on what g=\r\nood actions can be performed *now*. Similarly, when people praise one, one =\r\nhas a choice. One can either become excited and gloat in the praises or one=\r\n can think that the Lord used one as an instrument in getting that work don=\r\ne and focus the mind on what good actions can be performed *now*.\n\nBest reg=\r\nards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nSpi=\r\nrituality writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nJyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- -\n\n---- &lt;deleted&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;delet=\r\ned&gt;, you had replied that we must \n&gt; always offer all our actions and the f=\r\nruits of all our actions to \n&gt; Krishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is relatively straight fo=\r\nrward at the end of a homam.
