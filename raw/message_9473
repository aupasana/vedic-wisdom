Tr=\r\nicky to do, but it has worked time and again with many people.\n\nAsking ques=\r\ntions is a useful function of the intellect, but it has to lead to actually=\r\n doing some form of spiritual practice to actually find the answers.\n\nThere=\r\n&#39;s an interesting parable from Sri Ramakrishna in this regard...\n\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.rkmission.org.my/ramakrishna.html\n\n&quot;Two friends went into an orchard. One=\r\n of them possessing much worldly wisdom immediately began to count the mang=\r\no trees there and the number of mangoes each tree bore, and to estimate wha=\r\nt might be the value of the whole orchard. \n\nHis companion went to the owne=\r\nr, made friends with him, and then, quietly going to a tree, pluck the frui=\r\nts and eat them. \n\nWhom do you consider to be the wiser of the two? Eat man=\r\ngoes. It will satisfy your hunger. \n\nWhat is the good of counting the trees=\r\n and leaves and making calculation? The vain man of intellect busies himsel=\r\nf uselessly with finding out the `why&#39; and `wherefore&#39; of creation, while t=\r\nhe humble man of wisdom makes friends with the Creator and enjoys His gift =\r\nof supreme bliss.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s nice to know the whys and wherefores of creation b=\r\nut the human intellect is a frail instrument with limited capacity and will=\r\n not be able to find the answers. Peace of mind and the answers, according =\r\nto the Teachers, comes through Intuition, direct experience of reality. Thi=\r\ns in turn comes from spiritual practice. \n\nAll the best with your spiritual=\r\n practice....no doubt it will help you find the answers you are looking for=\r\n.\n\nSalutations and prostrations to the sari-clad Lady on the Tiger....\nOm S=\r\nri Durgayai Namaha...may She help us all find the answers.... ;)\n\nAparna\n\n\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vernman_1976&quot; &lt;vernman1976@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; does anyone know...who what and why we are her???.....so far I guess=\r\n most of us are going with the idea that some kind of primordial consciousn=\r\ness expressed duality....and projected ...created...or manifested what we k=\r\nnow of as reality....and we presume a spark of it is us...so to speak....an=\r\nd it goes through a long process to merge back with the whole...and its lik=\r\ne the journey never took place.....call it the cosmic dream if u will...\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; so we conceive of duality as shiva and or sakthi..or yin and yang if u w=\r\nill....and at a certain moment in our existence...we feel some kind of urge=\r\n to transcend.....and we try all methods to get there....\n&gt; \n&gt; now all I kn=\r\now is.....something exists...I cant say within or without me...I don&#39;t know=\r\n even what me denotes..there is a body....and what could be labelled a mind=\r\n....something that proceses thoughts and emotions...but all if it is runnin=\r\ng bye itself....there doesn&#39;t seem to be an entity or what not in charge...=\r\n..observe closely and u will get what I,m saying.......\n&gt; \n&gt; now I guess th=\r\ne question is...what is the gist of this so called spiritual path???......c=\r\nould it not be that like snowflakes of nature...each one of us is no more t=\r\nhan a momentary expression of consciousness?....why do we assume reincarnat=\r\nion to be true???\n&gt; \n&gt; to whom do we worship???and what exactly does worshi=\r\np mean???and who is doing the worship?.....\n&gt; \n&gt; repeating some mystical ma=\r\nntra or name of something that obviously cant be encapsulated in sound is c=\r\nonsidered by many to be spirituality..when obviously the mind that is repea=\r\nting and running around at the same time is both one and the same...the who=\r\nle process seems to me like a mind game....and we feel good about theses ga=\r\nmes....like we have done something to get 1 step closer to divinity..can we=\r\n get closer????isn&#39;t the cesspool of sludge we make in the morning just as =\r\ndivine....and all the time in the colon with us???....those who get the las=\r\nt statement would get it...the rest plse ignore...\n&gt; \n&gt; and how come we hav=\r\ne this idea that by japa,ing a gazillion times some sari clad woman on a ti=\r\nger is going to appear in a vision or in front of us and make our existence=\r\n free of suffering..and basically make everything O.K.?....\n&gt; \n&gt; too many t=\r\namil movies perhaps?...u can also substitute the sari clad woman for a man =\r\nin blue with 4 arms...or a young stud on a peacock...ur preference....\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n and all for what?most of us are truly at the end of the day motivated by s=\r\nome kind of gain...touch ur heart and tell me it is not so???no carrot in f=\r\nront of the donkey it wont move......\n&gt; \n&gt; tell me honestly....how can u ha=\r\nve love for something u don&#39;t know and have not experienced in any way???yo=\r\nur bakthi is probably something u conjured up in ur head....and at best....=\r\nan expression of ur existantial longings....\n&gt; \n&gt; we are all lonely and mis=\r\nerable at heart....and add to that the suffering of being human.....\n&gt; \n&gt; s=\r\no shall end this rant...with the question I began with....what the f is goi=\r\nng on guys???who what and where r we????????????????????????????????????tha=\r\nt is the question isn&#39;t it....and maybe also why......the day we stop askin=\r\ng,and accept someone elses idea as truth.....we stopped seeking.\n&gt; \n&gt; the s=\r\nearch isn&#39;t over till the fat cosmic lady sings........god bless.......what=\r\never that means..............\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
