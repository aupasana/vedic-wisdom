Some sages, like Ribhu, have been without any ashrama,\nwhich is a =\r\nparticular, prescribed mode of life. Such a one is called an\natiasrami. The=\r\n next topic concerns the pair of opposites, bondage and\nfreedom.\n\n622 The p=\r\nair of bondage and freedom, which are spoken of in the course of\ninstructio=\r\nn to disciples, does not really exist. Since it is settled that\nall pairs o=\r\nf opposites are unreal, how can this pair be real?\n\n623 The real Self is ev=\r\ner free. The bound one is only the soul, the\nconsequence of ignorance. Ther=\r\nefore, in truth, there is no deliverance. The\nthought of deliverance is due=\r\n only to the belief in bondage.\n\nHow to verify this unreality?\n\n624 =E2=80=\r\n=98If one makes the quest, =E2=80=9CWho is he for whom there is bondage?=E2=\r\n=80=9D, at the\nend of the quest the ever-free Self will be experienced.=E2=\r\n=80=99 This is what the\nmost holy one [Sri Ramana] has said.\n\n625 Since the=\r\n non-becoming of the supreme reality has been made clear by\nboth revelation=\r\n and the sages, and since it is that reality which is the\nreal Self, how ca=\r\nn it be said that that one became bound?\n\nWhoever does not accept the perfe=\r\nct supremacy of the reality is unfit to be\na disciple. He disqualifies hims=\r\nelf by not accepting this as true.\n\n626 If bondage were real, it would be w=\r\nithout end. Also, having a beginning,\ndeliverance would have an end. Thus, =\r\nthe unreality of bondage is\nirresistible.\nIt is an axiom of advaita Vedanta=\r\n that whatever is real has neither\nbeginning nor an end, and that what has =\r\na beginning must have an end, and is\ntherefore unreal, as set forth already=\r\n.\n\n627 We do not hear from the sage the saying, =E2=80=98I was bound before=\r\n but now I\nam free=E2=80=99. That supreme state is beyond time. How can its=\r\n beginning be\nimagined?\n\nWhat Bhagavan did say is next recorded.\n\n628 Bhaga=\r\nvan, when asked, =E2=80=98When did your holiness attain deliverance?=E2=80=\r\n=99,\nreplied, =E2=80=98Nothing has happened to me. I am the same always, un=\r\nchanged.=E2=80=99\n\nTo make this teaching intelligible Bhagavan used the fol=\r\nlowing two similes.\n\n629 This talk of deliverance is just like the singing,=\r\n by dwellers in\nPandharpur, of songs to the effect, =E2=80=98When shall we =\r\ngo to that place?=E2=80=99 and\nfinally singing, =E2=80=98We have reached th=\r\nat place=E2=80=99.\n\n630 =E2=80=98Just as someone in his dream, after wander=\r\ning abroad and returning\nhome, goes to sleep there and, waking, finds himse=\r\nlf in his own home, so is\ndeliverance.=E2=80=99 This is what our Guru has s=\r\naid.\n\nSo, deliverance is only a change in the understanding, as shown below=\r\n.\n\n631 Deliverance is just the clarification of the mind, the understanding=\r\n: =E2=80=98I\nam ever in my own real nature; all other experiences are illus=\r\nory.=E2=80=99 It is\nnot something that has newly come about.\n\nAnother very =\r\nnotable feature of the sage=E2=80=99s being is next taken up.\n\n632 The eter=\r\nnal greatness of the sage consists in this: that he neither\nwaxes nor wanes=\r\n by actions done or not done. For him there will never accrue\nany result fr=\r\nom actions, whether unpleasant or pleasant.\n\nThis is a necessary corollary =\r\nfrom the teaching that the sage, being only\nthe real Self, is egoless, and =\r\ntherefore not an actor, but at the most only\na witness, or not even a witne=\r\nss.\n\nSome sectarians identify the real Self with the sheath of the intellec=\r\nt, the\nvijnanamaya kosha. But they are not advaitins.\n\nPandharpur is a famo=\r\nus Krishna temple in Maharashtra. The verse refers to a\nsong and ritual tha=\r\nt is performed by devotees of this shrine. Bhagavan\nreferred to it in the f=\r\nollowing exchange, which is taken from Letters from\nSri Ramanasramam, lette=\r\nr 82, dated 27th January 1947:\n\nQuestion: Where can we see the soul? How ca=\r\nn we know it?\n\nBhagavan: Where can we see the soul? This question is like s=\r\ntaying in\nRamanasramam and asking =E2=80=98Where is Ramanasramam?=E2=80=99 =\r\nThe soul is at all times in\nyou and everywhere, and to imagine that it is s=\r\nomewhere far off and to\nsearch for it is like performing Panduranga bhajan.=\r\n This bhajan commences in\nthe first quarter of the night with tinkling bell=\r\ns tied to the feet of the\ndevotees, and with a brass lamp-stand placed in t=\r\nhe centre of the house. The\ndevotees go round and round the lamp-stand, dan=\r\ncing rhythmically to the\ntune, =E2=80=98Pandharpur is thus far! Pandharpur =\r\nis thus far! Come on, proceed!=E2=80=99,\nbut as they go round and round, th=\r\ney actually do not proceed even half a\nyard further. By the time the third =\r\nquarter of the night is reached, they\nwill begin to sing, =E2=80=98See! See=\r\n! There is Pandharpur! Here is Pandharpur! See,\nSee!=E2=80=99\n\nDuring the f=\r\nirst quarter of the night they were going round the same lamp as\nthey were =\r\nin the third quarter. It dawns and they sing, =E2=80=98We have arrived in\nP=\r\nandharpur. This is Pandharpur.=E2=80=99 So saying, they salute the lamp-sta=\r\nnd and\nend the bhajan. It is the same with this also. We go round and round=\r\n in\nsearch of Atma, saying, =E2=80=98Where is Atma? Where is Atma?=E2=80=99=\r\n till at last the\ndawn of jnana drishti [the vision of knowledge] is reache=\r\nd and we say, =E2=80=98This\nis Atma. This is me.=E2=80=99\n\nThis is explaine=\r\nd further by Bhagavan himself.\n\n633 Just as one engaged in listening to a s=\r\ntory does not really hear it, on\naccount of his mind having wandered far aw=\r\nay, so the sage, though apparently\ndoing actions, is not really an actor wi=\r\nth a mind full of previous habitual\nmodes of functioning.\n\nIt has been show=\r\nn before that the mind is just a bundle of habits of\nactivity, which means =\r\nthat when those habits have been extinguished, it\nceases to bind. The actio=\r\nns of the sage are not due to his personal will, as\nwill be shown later.\n\nB=\r\nut the condition of one whose mental vasanas are active is different, as\nsh=\r\nown below.\n\n634 But the ignorant man, because his mind is subject to vasana=\r\ns, becomes an\nactor, even without actively doing any action, just as a man =\r\nin his dream\nmay fall from the cliff of a mountain, though his body is lyin=\r\ng motionless\nin his bed.\n\nThe fact is, the mind is the real agent in action=\r\n, not the body, which by\nitself is inert and actionless.\n\nThe following is =\r\nfrom the Vasishtam:\n\n635 Action is not what is done by the body alone. That=\r\n alone is action which\nis done by the mind. The body, being insentient, can=\r\nnot be an actor. The\nmind being sentient, can be an actor.\n\n636 =E2=80=98Wh=\r\natever the body, the senses, life and the mind do by the force of\nprarabdha=\r\n karma, the sage is not affected by it.=E2=80=99 So said Bhagavan, our\nGuru=\r\n.\n\nThis is further sustained by comparison of the sage with God in his pers=\r\nonal\naspect.\n\n637 God is unaffected by his activities of creation, protecti=\r\non, etc. In\njust the same way the sage remains unaffected by his actions, s=\r\nince, from\nthe standpoint of the truth, there is no real difference between=\r\n them [God\nand the sage].\n\nIt is taught that God is not Himself the doer of=\r\n all that work, the work\nbeing done in His presence by His power, called ma=\r\nya, as said before.\n\n638 He appears to the ignorant as acting =E2=80=93 eat=\r\ning, walking, talking and\nremembering =E2=80=93 but in truth he is neither =\r\nan actor nor a recipient of the\nfruits of action, because all his activity =\r\nis entirely subject to God.\n\nThe following is what Bhagavan says on this to=\r\npic.\n\n639 If the Self were the actor, then the sage would receive the fruit=\r\ns of\naction. But when, by the quest of the real Self, the sense of doership=\r\n is\nlost, at the same time all the three kinds of karma will be lost. Under=\r\nstand\nthat this deliverance is eternal.\n\nThe following also was said by Bha=\r\ngavan.\n\n640 Just as a sleepy child eats the food given by his mother, but d=\r\noes not\nknow it is eating, in the same way the sage receives the fruits of =\r\nactions,\nwithout being an enjoyer or sufferer.\n\nBut that is not all.\n\n641 I=\r\nn truth, no one is performing actions. The difference between the\nknower an=\r\nd the non-knower of the Self is only this: the ignorant man\nbelieves himsel=\r\nf to be the performer of actions, but to the sage the thought\nof being an a=\r\nctor does not arise at all.\n\nHere is an incidental problem, due to a differ=\r\nence of views.\n\n642 The saying, =E2=80=98The agami karma and sanchita karma=\r\n are lost for the sage,\nso he is not reborn again; but the prarabdha karma =\r\nremains over=E2=80=99 is not true\nfrom the standpoint of the supreme truth.=\r\n\n\nThis Bhagavan illustrates with a simile from life.\n\n643 Just as, when a h=\r\nusband dies, none of his wives remain unwidowed, so\nwhen the actor [the ego=\r\n] dies, no actions remain over, which would yield\nresult [to the sage].\n\nAn=\r\nother simile is also available.\n\n644 Just as actions done in dream do not s=\r\nurvive on waking, so actions done\nduring the prevalence of ignorance do not=\r\n survive when the true nature of\nthe Self is experienced.\n\nWhen ignorance d=\r\nies, all its products also cease to be.\n\nBut the survival of prarabdha karm=\r\na is stated in the vedantic lore. The\nanswer to this is given.\n\nSource: htt=\r\np://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cdf6d5005ecc804a2802f27\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n621 In the course of life the sage, who has transcended all the =\r\nyogas, being established in the supreme state, may live like a yogi, or eve=\r\nn like a bhogi, but that yoga and that bhoga are not real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98=\r\nBhoga=E2=80=99 means enjoyment, and a bhogi is one, such as a householder, =\r\nwho lives for enjoyment.

But they are not advaitins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pandharpur is a famous Krishna templ=\r\ne in Maharashtra. The verse refers to a song and ritual that is performed b=\r\ny devotees of this shrine. Bhagavan referred to it in the following exchang=\r\ne, which is taken from Letters from Sri Ramanasramam, letter 82, dated 27th=\r\n January 1947:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Question: Where can we see the soul? How can we kno=\r\nw it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan: Where can we see the soul? This question is like sta=\r\nying in Ramanasramam and asking =E2=80=98Where is Ramanasramam?=E2=80=99 Th=\r\ne soul is at all times in you and everywhere, and to imagine that it is som=\r\newhere far off and to search for it is like performing Panduranga bhajan. T=\r\nhis bhajan commences in the first quarter of the night with tinkling bells =\r\ntied to the feet of the devotees, and with a brass lamp-stand placed in the=\r\n centre of the house. The devotees go round and round the lamp-stand, danci=\r\nng rhythmically to the tune, =E2=80=98Pandharpur is thus far! Pandharpur is=\r\n thus far! Come on, proceed!=E2=80=99, but as they go round and round, they=\r\n actually do not proceed even half a yard further. By the time the third qu=\r\narter of the night is reached, they will begin to sing, =E2=80=98See! See! =\r\nThere is Pandharpur! Here is Pandharpur! See, See!=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;During=\r\n the first quarter of the night they were going round the same lamp as they=\r\n were in the third quarter. It dawns and they sing, =E2=80=98We have arrive=\r\nd in Pandharpur. This is Pandharpur.=E2=80=99 So saying, they salute the la=\r\nmp-stand and end the bhajan. It is the same with this also. We go round and=\r\n round in search of Atma, saying, =E2=80=98Where is Atma? Where is Atma?=E2=\r\n=80=99 till at last the dawn of jnana drishti [the vision of knowledge] is =\r\nreached and we say, =E2=80=98This is Atma. This is me.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Th=\r\nis is explained further by Bhagavan himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold&quot;&gt;633 Just as one engaged in listening to a story does not really h=\r\near it, on account of his mind having wandered far away, so the sage, thoug=\r\nh apparently doing actions, is not really an actor with a mind full of prev=\r\nious habitual modes of functioning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It has been shown befor=\r\ne that the mind is just a bundle of habits of activity, which means that wh=\r\nen those habits have been extinguished, it ceases to bind. The actions of t=\r\nhe sage are not due to his personal will, as will be shown later.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nBut the condition of one whose mental vasanas are active is different, as s=\r\nhown below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;634 But the ignorant ma=\r\nn, because his mind is subject to vasanas, becomes an actor, even without a=\r\nctively doing any action, just as a man in his dream may fall from the clif=\r\nf of a mountain, though his body is lying motionless in his bed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;The fact is, the mind is the real agent in action, not the body, whic=\r\nh by itself is inert and actionless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following is from the Vasis=\r\nhtam:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;635 Action is not what is don=\r\ne by the body alone.

The mind being sentient, can be a=\r\nn actor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;636 =E2=80=98Whatever the body, the senses, life a=\r\nnd the mind do by the force of prarabdha karma, the sage is not affected by=\r\n it.=E2=80=99 So said Bhagavan, our Guru.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is further sustained =\r\nby comparison of the sage with God in his personal aspect.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;637 God=\r\n is unaffected by his activities of creation, protection, etc. In just the =\r\nsame way the sage remains unaffected by his actions, since, from the standp=\r\noint of the truth, there is no real difference between them [God and the sa=\r\nge].&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is taught that God is not Himself the doer of all that wor=\r\nk, the work being done in His presence by His power, called maya, as said b=\r\nefore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;638 He appears to the ignorant as acting =E2=80=93 eating, wa=\r\nlking, talking and remembering =E2=80=93 but in truth he is neither an acto=\r\nr nor a recipient of the fruits of action, because all his activity is enti=\r\nrely subject to God.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The following is what Bhagavan says on this t=\r\nopic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;639 If the Self were the actor, then the sage would receive th=\r\ne fruits of action. But when, by the quest of the real Self, the sense of d=\r\noership is lost, at the same time all the three kinds of karma will be lost=\r\n. Understand that this deliverance is eternal.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The following also =\r\nwas said by Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;640 Just as a=\r\n sleepy child eats the food given by his mother, but does not know it is ea=\r\nting, in the same way the sage receives the fruits of actions, without bein=\r\ng an enjoyer or sufferer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;But that is not all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;641 I=\r\nn truth, no one is performing actions. The difference between the knower an=\r\nd the non-knower of the Self is only this: the ignorant man believes himsel=\r\nf to be the performer of actions, but to the sage the thought of being an a=\r\nctor does not arise at all.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Here is an incidental problem, due to =\r\na difference of views.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;642 The saying, =E2=80=98The agami karma and =\r\nsanchita karma are lost for the sage, so he is not reborn again; but the pr=\r\narabdha karma remains over=E2=80=99 is not true from the standpoint of the =\r\nsupreme truth.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This Bhagavan illustrates with a simile from life.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;643 Just as, when a husband dies, n=\r\none of his wives remain unwidowed, so when the actor [the ego] dies, no act=\r\nions remain over, which would yield result [to the sage].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A=\r\nnother simile is also available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;64=\r\n4 Just as actions done in dream do not survive on waking, so actions done d=\r\nuring the prevalence of ignorance do not survive when the true nature of th=\r\ne Self is experienced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When ignorance dies, all its product=\r\ns also cease to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the survival of prarabdha karma is stated in=\r\n the vedantic lore.
