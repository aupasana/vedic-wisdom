This comes from milli=\r\nons of janmas and samskaras. \n=C2=A0\nMy spiritual father &quot;Vimalananda&quot; used=\r\n to say=C2=A0in a slightly different context that he believes in Sampradaha=\r\n or incineration.\nI applied it to this as well and it works quite well.=C2=\r\n=A0\nTwo things=C2=A0are going to be=C2=A0useful, \n1. Continue your mantra d=\r\nuring the act and it will act as a continuation of your sadhana.\n2. If your=\r\n partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not be disheartened by failure i=\r\nnitially. As time goes on, the=C2=A0thing in your mind which thinks of sex =\r\nis incinerated and slowly you find that a naked female(or male as=C2=A0may =\r\nbe the case)=C2=A0body is like a landscape picture just like any other pict=\r\nure made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, you need not b=\r\ne disturbed by it, you can certainly=C2=A0feel that the picture=C2=A0is ver=\r\ny beautiful=C2=A0but you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samasta=\r\n Sakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.... ...\nOnce this stage is reached then the mind =\r\nceases to think of sex all the while.\nYes you may still encounter it, but t=\r\nhat is another story.\n=C2=A0\n\n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nManish\n=C2=A0\n\n\n=C2=A0\nOn Thu,=\r\n Feb 25, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

The idea i=\r\ns that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and apprecia=\r\ntes it.\n=C2=A0\nChandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the div=\r\nine Mother fought, which explain how one can fight and overcome various wea=\r\nknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a regu=\r\nlar basis will promote the fighting spirit within one that fights these wea=\r\nknesses.\n=C2=A0\nThere is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying t=\r\no fight/overcome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maay=\r\naa. One aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maay=\r\naa. One aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. On=\r\ne aspect of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. When one realizes S=\r\nelf at the end, irrespective of the path taken, one finally sees that all t=\r\nhese are aspects of a Single Mother who is also essentially true Self.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora serie=\r\ns books by Dr. Robert\n&gt; Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the=\r\n subject.\n&gt; Perhaps I need to read more! \n=C2=A0\nAghora series books by Svo=\r\nboda are good, but Aghora is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to hav=\r\ne mixed feelings.\n=C2=A0\nGhora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;.=\r\n One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does=\r\n not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent =\r\nmanifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what i=\r\ns permanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nWhen someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while car=\r\nrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is=\r\n true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself th=\r\nat life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. =\r\nBut the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth =\r\nonly when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thin=\r\ng we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ours=\r\nelves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporar=\r\ny illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary ill=\r\nusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, =\r\ncan&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beauti=\r\nful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions. On=\r\nly the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?\n When =\r\nsomeone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t =\r\nwe tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary illusio=\r\nns. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nA true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind=\r\n rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on=\r\n them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking=\r\n about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what =\r\nis permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nVed=\r\nanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora =\r\npursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions a=\r\nnd the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he =\r\ncan eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.=\r\n=C2=A0But, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiv=\r\ning Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manif=\r\nestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating=\r\n feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling=\r\n on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A succ=\r\nessful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on the=\r\n fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and will not feel a=\r\nny kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating Se=\r\nlf.\n=C2=A0\nOf course, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chant=\r\ns vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am=\r\n consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and no=\r\nt be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on th=\r\ne impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brin=\r\njal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the p=\r\nermanent (Self).\n=C2=A0\nThus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselv=\r\nes the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and im=\r\npulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure =\r\nresults in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentiv=\r\ne in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a=\r\n Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty l=\r\naddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in =\r\nSelf while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even n=\r\not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the ot=\r\nher hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of fe=\r\nces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a ver=\r\ny bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nHowever, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone me=\r\nrely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nTake another simple example. Suppose someone=\r\n is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness=\r\n for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts =\r\nin the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadha=\r\nna.\n=C2=A0\nA regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind =\r\naway from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such th=\r\noughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if o=\r\nne keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination =\r\nin the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome th=\r\ne fascination some minds may have for sex?\n=C2=A0\nAn aghora will take it to=\r\n an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from =\r\nthe mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (o=\r\nne pure and the other impure), he may combine them into one without such di=\r\nstinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner=\r\n sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this m=\r\nay titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made=\r\n impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several months/=\r\nyears. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he =\r\nis doing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The associati=\r\non in his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked p=\r\nictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evo=\r\nke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly =\r\nrise in the head may not lead to denser and\n denser thoughts relating to se=\r\nx and distraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to medita=\r\ntion. After spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimat=\r\nely, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may =\r\nbe broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may =\r\nbe gone largely.\n=C2=A0\nMind has a lot of conditioning based on prior exper=\r\niences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break =\r\ndown some of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermi=\r\nne those structures.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, is this a fool-proof method? Not reall=\r\ny. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice me=\r\nrely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of=\r\n thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not se=\r\nrious/sincere/ ready to start with.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0Bottomline=\r\n is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high=\r\n stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push the problems unde=\r\nr the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is=\r\n not applicable to all.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0Like Manish said in a =\r\nmail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;?

In general, it is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize th=\r\ne time spent on them, instead of splitting the time between ten things. As =\r\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place ra=\r\nther than dig one metre in ten places, if one wants to find water.\n\nOne pos=\r\nsibility is to do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti wi=\r\nth various mantras one is attached to.\n\nI am not that knowledgeable about S=\r\nri Vidya.

Plus I=\r\n sometimes do special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1=\r\n.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasan=\r\na different from Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya a=\r\nnd how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahat=\r\nmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am=\r\n a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswa=\r\nmi Dikshitar recently.\n\nNagraj Kota\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The INTERNET now =\r\nhas a personality.

The variety we perceive is an illus=\r\nion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically.

So he may try a ritual where f=\r\neces is eaten.&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;But, please remember=\r\n that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being=\r\n consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, f=\r\nruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves=\r\n no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manife=\r\nstation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eatin=\r\ng feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;f=\r\neces&quot; with certain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. He wil=\r\nl be thinking that he is Self and he is eating\n Self.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedi=\r\nc verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consu=\r\nming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be f=\r\nully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impe=\r\nrmanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal cu=\r\nrry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permane=\r\nnt (Self).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telli=\r\nng themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every tho=\r\nught and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation whe=\r\nre failure results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as =\r\nan incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person w=\r\nho chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and e=\r\nats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb t=\r\nhe mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice=\r\n (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal=\r\n? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the =\r\ntaste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure resul=\r\nts in a very bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quic=\r\nkly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be=\r\n accomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive.

Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and =\r\nhomam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on=\r\n sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is causin=\r\ng guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A regular =\r\nperson will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thou=\r\nghts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, su=\r\nch thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for=\r\n 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not =\r\nreturn to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination some mi=\r\nnds may have for sex?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;An aghora will take it t=\r\no an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from=\r\n the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (=\r\none pure and the other impure), he may combine them into one without such d=\r\nistinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partne=\r\nr sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this =\r\nmay titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being mad=\r\ne impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several months=\r\n/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he=\r\n is doing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The associat=\r\nion in his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked =\r\npictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but ev=\r\noke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly=\r\n rise in the head may not lead to\n denser and denser thoughts relating to s=\r\nex and distraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to medit=\r\nation. After spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intima=\r\ntely, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may=\r\n be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may=\r\n be gone largely.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Mind has a lot of conditioni=\r\nng based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora so=\r\nmetimes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging in certain=\r\n practices that undermine those structures.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Ho=\r\nwever, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that th=\r\ne person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex=\r\n everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everyt=\r\nime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start =\r\nwith.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Bottomline is that an aghora takes p=\r\nroblems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, w=\r\nhereas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet and fight slo=\r\nwly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Like Mani=\r\nsh said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is =\r\nmerely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought pr=\r\nocess, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not s=\r\nuitable for all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people m=\r\nay feel attraction for it based on a wrong understanding and the thrill suc=\r\nh an understanding brings.&nbsp;Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perve=\r\nrsion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversi=\r\non. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Agh=\r\nora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by m=\r\naking failure very unpleasant.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;BTW, the follow=\r\ning mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths and explains the =\r\nbasic reality.

For&nbsp=\r\n;instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Di=\r\nvine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), wh=\r\no was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis&nbsp=\r\n;mention&nbsp;great details about all the&nbsp;nine avaranas and different =\r\nforms of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana.&nbsp;In the Dh=\r\nyana Krithi&nbsp;of those, in the very&nbsp;first line he says, &#39;Kamalambik=\r\ne, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.&nbsp;That line tells me that&nbsp;even thr=\r\nough Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So my question was in that perspe=\r\nctive. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Se=\r\nlf is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. &lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have started reading =\r\nDurga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before I sta=\r\nrt to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I reall=\r\ny cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashati! Have to see how mo=\r\nther will help me achieve my target. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by D=\r\nr.

My performing a Chandi homam everyday should=\r\n hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, there are some people who do n=\r\not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great diff=\r\niculty in their first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it =\r\ntakes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Integrating various=\r\n sadhanas is a personal problem that needs a personal solution. In general,=\r\n it is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent =\r\non them, instead of splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna P=\r\naramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig=\r\n one metre in ten places, if one wants to find water.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One possibilit=\r\ny is to do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with vari=\r\nous mantras one is attached to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am not that knowledgeable about Sr=\r\ni Vidya. However, from the\n little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a=\r\n symblic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purp=\r\nose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lalit=\r\na means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother wh=\r\no teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is st=\r\nern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness).=\r\n Both are valid paths.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software,=\r\n Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality:=\r\n &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish w=\r\nritings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;--- On Fri, 2/5/10, &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose=\r\n?to=3Dnagraj%40sbcglobal.net&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;nagraj@sbcglob=\r\nal. net&lt;/A&gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dn=\r\nagraj_um%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/com=\r\npose?to=3Dnagraj%40sbcglobal.net&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;nagraj@sbc=\r\nglobal. net&lt;/A&gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=\r\n=3Dnagraj_um%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;nagraj_um@yahoo. c=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom]\n Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yaho=\r\nogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 11:51 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dear Sri Narasimhara=\r\no garu,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homa=\r\nm everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to d=\r\no your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in su=\r\nch a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (2=\r\n0 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhi=\r\nshekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to ab=\r\nout 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals sever=\r\nal times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate t=\r\nhese along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Coul=\r\nd you please explain what is sri Vidya\n and how it is to be learnt? I am ve=\r\nry motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have=\r\n keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all th=\r\ne nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nagr=\r\naj Kota&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY=\r\n&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLO=\r\nCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; \nThe INT=\r\nERNET now has a personality.
