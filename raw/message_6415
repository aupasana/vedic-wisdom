The Yogis postulate the existence of Ishvara. Prakriti functions owin=\r\ng\nto the proximity of consciousness and Ishvara is the controller of Prakri=\r\nti.\nHe is quite distinct from and superior to the Jivas, says the Shruti.\n\n=\r\n108. It is a fact that the Jivas, too, are not affected by sufferings etc.,=\r\n\nas they too are unattached; but when they fail to comprehend their real\nna=\r\nture, they imagine that they are affected by sufferings, works and so\nforth=\r\n.\n\n116. So say people who worship the creator Brahma for obtaining children=\r\n and\nquote\npassages which say, =E2=80=98Brahma created the people=E2=80=99.=\r\n\n\n117. The Bhagavatas call Vishnu the only Ishvara because the lotus-born\nB=\r\nrahma\nissued from the navel of Vishnu.\n\n118. The Saivas on the authority of=\r\n their Agamas declare Shiva alone to be\nIshvara,\nas according to a traditio=\r\nn in the Puranas, Vishnu in spite of all his\nefforts could not discover the=\r\n feet of Shiva.\n\n119. The followers of the creed of Ganesha say that the el=\r\nephant-faced Lord\nis the\nonly Ishvara for Shiva in order to conquer the dem=\r\nons of the three cities\nworshipped\nGanesha.\n\n120. There are many other sect=\r\ns which try to declare their own favourite\ndeity to be\nthe supreme. They qu=\r\note hymns from Shruti and alleged traditions in support\nof their\nviews.\n\n12=\r\n1. So every entity from the Inner Ruler to inert objects is considered as\nI=\r\nshvara by someone or other, for we find that even the sacred fig tree, the\n=\r\nsun-plant and the\nbomboo etc., are worshipped by the people as family deiti=\r\nes.\n\n143. Even if all the learned people of the world try to determine the =\r\nnature\nof this world, they will find themselves confronted at some stage or=\r\n other\nby ignorance.\n\n144. Tell us, if you can, how the body and senses cam=\r\ne out of the seed, or\nhow\nconsciousness was born in the foetus. What answer=\r\ns will you give to these\nquestions\n?\n\n146. In the end you will have to say,=\r\n =E2=80=98I do not know=E2=80=99. Therefore the wise\ndeclare this world to =\r\nbe like a magic show.\n\n147. What can be more magical than the fact that the=\r\n seed in the uterus\nbecomes a conscious individual, that it develops head, =\r\nhands, feet and other\norgans, that it passes through the states of childhoo=\r\nd, youth and old age\nand that it perceives, eats,smells, hears, comes and g=\r\noes ?\n\n152. As the tree is latent in the seed, so the waking and dreaming w=\r\norlds\nare implicit in deep sleep. Similarly, the impressions of the entire\n=\r\nuniverse are latent in Maya.\n\n185. The creation and destruction of the worl=\r\nd are comparable to day and\nnight, to\nthe waking and sleeping states, to th=\r\ne opening and closing of the eyes and\nthe\nactivity and quiescense of the mi=\r\nnd.\n\n199. There are two types of Shruti text describing the creation of the=\r\n world\neither as a gradual evolution or as instantaneous. There is no\ncontr=\r\nadiction, for the dream\nworld sometimes arises gradually out of deep sleep,=\r\n but at other times it\narises\ninstantaneously.\n\n200. Hiranyagarbha or Sutra=\r\ntman, otherwise called the subtle-body, is the\ntotality of\nthe subtle bodie=\r\ns of all Jivas. He conceives Himself as the totality of all\negos or =E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99 - consciousnesses, like the threads of a piece of cloth; and =\r\nHe\nis said to be endowed with the powers of volition, conation and cognitio=\r\nn.\n\n209. In whatever form Ishvara is worshipped, the worshipper obtains the=\r\n\nappropriate\nreward through that form. If the method of worship and the con=\r\nception of the\nattributes of the deity worshipped are of a high order, the =\r\nreward also is\nof a high\norder; but if otherwise, it is not.\n\n210. The Libe=\r\nration, however, can be obtained through the knowledge of\nreality and not o=\r\ntherwise. The dreaming does not end until the dreamer\nawakes.\n\n216. From th=\r\ne worshippers of objects like grass to the followers of Yoga,\nall have\nwron=\r\ng ideas about Ishvara. From the materialist Charvakas to the followers\nof\nS=\r\nankhya, all have confused ideas about Jiva.\n\n219. Therefore the aspirants t=\r\no liberation should never engage themselves in\ndisputations about the natur=\r\ne of Jiva and Ishvara. They ought to practise\ndiscrimination and realise th=\r\ne reality of Brahman.\n\n220. (Doubt): Such disputation is a means to the und=\r\nerstanding of Brahman.\n(Reply): It may be so, but be careful to avoid being=\r\n drowned helplessly in\nthe sea of\nconfusion.\n\n221. (Doubt): All right, but =\r\nthe Vedantins must accept the Sankhya doctrine\nthat Jiva\nand Ishvara are as=\r\nsociationless, pure consciousness and eternal and the Yoga\ndoctrine that Ji=\r\nva and Ishvara, referred to as =E2=80=98thou=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98that=E2=\r\n=80=99\nrespectively in the\ndictum =E2=80=98That thou art=E2=80=99, are of a=\r\n pure nature.\n\nSource: http://www.celextel.org/othervedantabooks/panchadasi=\r\n.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=\r\n=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=\r\n=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016368340f8bac84804a48b1ae9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Translated by Swami Swahananda =\r\nPublished by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;102.
