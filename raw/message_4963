If you are una=\r\nble to use\n&gt; &gt; sesame seeds and use akshatas as a substitute for sesame see=\r\nds, it is ok to\n&gt; &gt; stick to the same mantra and imagine the akshatas to be=\r\n sesame seeds. That\n&gt; &gt; may be better than changing the text to &quot;akshatodak=\r\nam&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sesame seeds, atleast the white ones, are available in most pl=\r\naces,\n&gt; &gt; including the west.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can collect the water in a vessel=\r\n or bowl and offer it at the base of a\n&gt; &gt; plant or tree at the end of the =\r\nritual. That is better than leaving it on\n&gt; &gt; the floor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; This fortnight is a fantastic time to do pitri tarpanas. One can do pit=\r\nri\n&gt; &gt; tarpana on everyday during this fortnight and forget all other crite=\r\nria.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A lot of people these days may benefit from pitri tarpana. The=\r\n super-short\n&gt; &gt; procedure can be finished in 5 minutes and makes a lot of =\r\ndifference over\n&gt; &gt; the time. These are some chakras (energy centers) in th=\r\ne palm. When water\n&gt; &gt; flows over tham in a particular direction and though=\r\nts of freedom from\n&gt; &gt; certain subtle influences on one&#39;s mind are in one&#39;s=\r\n mind at the same time,\n&gt; &gt; it is conducive to internal changes which free =\r\none from those influences.\n&gt; &gt; Like with all rituals, you are engaging in e=\r\nxternal actions that promote\n&gt; &gt; certain kinds of internal transformation o=\r\nver time. Rituals work over time,\n&gt; &gt; when coupled with conducive thinking.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the old days, brahmanas (i.e. people interested in knowledge, s=\r\npiritual\n&gt; &gt; progress and liberation) used to do a short homam and pitri ta=\r\nrpana\n&gt; &gt; everyday. If that is not possible, atleast doing tarpana during t=\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; fortnight is a great idea.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Someone asked abou=\r\nt diet rules etc. For any spiritual sadhaka, eating as\n&gt; &gt; saattwik food as=\r\n one can is always a good idea. While doing sadhanas like\n&gt; &gt; pitri tarpana=\r\n or homam, it is good if one can stop eating meat or atleast\n&gt; &gt; cut down o=\r\nn it. Eat as simple and saattwik food as possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifil=\r\nms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; J=\r\nyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; --------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- Astro S=\r\neeker &lt;astro.seeker@... &lt;astro.seeker%40yahoo.in&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I downloaded the Pitri Tarpan Manual 2 days ago and am planning to =\r\nstart\n&gt; &gt; it from tomorrow for whole of this Pitri Paksha beginning with su=\r\nper-short\n&gt; &gt; procedure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I could not arrange for the seasame seeds al=\r\ntogether. The manual says, go\n&gt; &gt; with Akshats in that case. But, while I a=\r\nm offering the water with akshats\n&gt; &gt; (ideally seasame seeds) to Pitris in =\r\nsecond last section, the mantras use\n&gt; &gt; the word &quot;Tilodakam&quot;. If I am righ=\r\nt, this refers to the seasame seeds being\n&gt; &gt; offered. Is it fine to contin=\r\nue with these mantras only till I find the\n&gt; &gt; seasame seeds, or shall I mo=\r\ndify it mysylf with say &quot;Akshatodakam&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For today, I will go with as =\r\nsuggested, but it would be nice if you can\n&gt; &gt; guide the right way in absen=\r\nce of such things.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, is it OK to to put a paper sheet and a vesse=\r\nl in front of one, and\n&gt; &gt; to leave the akshats and water after the offerin=\r\ngs into them, than on tiled\n&gt; &gt; floors? And then later put these water and =\r\nakshats in some garden (or soil),\n&gt; &gt; from where they are absorbed into the=\r\n five elements easily. From fllor it\n&gt; &gt; will either be wiped off or will g=\r\net dried up there to be mopped off later.\n&gt; &gt; I think that is not good thin=\r\ng to do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Again for today I will do the same way.
