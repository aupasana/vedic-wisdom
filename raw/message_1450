Apart from the infrastructure, money is \nneeded for the materials on an ongoing basis. Then find a sadhaka (can be a \npurohit or a yogi or a normal person) who is devoted to the Mother and \ninterested in doing Chandi homam 3 times a day. Then make arrangements for \nbuying the materials, storing them and start homam. This need not be on a \ngrand scale, but the person doing should be simple and devoted.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sunita_vt&quot; &lt;sunita_vt@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, March 03, 2009 5:34 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi homa centers\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Narsimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a great idea about starting these centres.\n&gt;\n&gt; Narsimhaji,my father is a businessman.He has his factory in Vasai near\n&gt; Mumbai.In the same premises, but at a little distance he has built a\n&gt; LakshmiNarayan temple.The pranpratishtha was a big event some five\n&gt; years ago.Regular puja is offered at this temple by a purohit.There is\n&gt; a room for the purohit.\n&gt; There is also a big, permanent open havan kund --like the one you have\n&gt; written.We have done a 7-day long MahaVishnu yagya,Bhagvat katha and\n&gt; prvachan over there.\n&gt;  What i mean to say is that the infrastructure already exist.If you\n&gt; think this is fine,then please let me know what is to be done further.\n&gt;\n&gt; My Father--Kumar Bihari Pandey,is a very spritual person.He has had\n&gt; schooling only till 6 std.He has not read many scriptures,but he\n&gt; considers Narayani as his mother.He has written two books-Hari Anant\n&gt; Hari Katha Ananta & Narayani.Like you, he too says that he has only\n&gt; written what the mother spoke to him.He is a real bhakt and\n&gt; Karmyogi,and he will be very happy to help in any which way.\n&gt;\n&gt; So Please let me know what you think of this.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sunita\n\n\n"}}
