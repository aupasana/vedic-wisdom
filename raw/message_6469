In what quality one tool differs form another?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.The =\r\none primary difference between both systems is this. God pervades both the =\r\npure and impure in the world. To quote vimalananda from the third book of k=\r\narma &quot; He can seen both in the butcher and the goat that is being butchered=\r\n &quot; . It takes somebody of the level of Vimalananda to make no distinction b=\r\netween the butcher and the butchered or an Yogi of the Calibre of Trailinga=\r\n swami who worshipped Kashi vishweshwara with human waste to prove that god=\r\n pervades everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the traditional Vedic form of worship we use =\r\nonly the best pure sattvic substances to worship god.Also we specifically w=\r\norship only the positive gentle qualities of god. It is a slow step by step=\r\n process for one&#39;s inner growth.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.The Tantric form of worship is the =\r\ncry of the beloved unable to bear the separation from one&#39;s Istha. The wors=\r\nhipper dares to take the best shortcut available. Tantra does not just wors=\r\nhip the gentle forms of god ,it adores even the most violent form of god. T=\r\no give an example the food grains that we all eat are obtained after consid=\r\nerable violence inflicted on mother earth and the millions of organisms pre=\r\nsent in the soil . Death is what gives rise to life and not the other way a=\r\nround. Tantra gives an form to all the qualities of god and uses every subs=\r\ntance possible to achieve these goals.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is the intense love for god =\r\nwhich motivates this love driven craziness for an Aghori or tantric to wors=\r\nhip the fierce form of the mother so that she can strip away all mental con=\r\nditioning in a couple of lifetimes itself. A tantric will turn every activi=\r\nty of his into playful worship of the divine . It could be something as ext=\r\nreme as shava sadhana or something as mundane as eating one&#39;s meal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne path has many dangers for one is attempting to quickly cut through one&#39;s =\r\nkarmas and conditioning and that is why emphasis is laid on a living guru t=\r\no guide one in the path.Also when the deity comes to play the tests can be =\r\nquite severe .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One is a long winded safe path to eternal bliss  .Th=\r\ne other is a shortcut to eternal bliss passing through momentary hell. :) W=\r\nhich path one chooses is dependent on how much one yearns for the divine.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kishore ji, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tha=\r\nnks for link. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I shoudl have framed my que in better way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n - How is vedic worship different from tantra worship of same diety.

It is a powerful tool and if you notice th=\r\ne stotra you will find worship being done at the Nine enclosures of the sri=\r\n chakra and the forms of the goddess at each enclosure and triangle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is a misconception to think traditional worship done in temples i=\r\ns the sattvic form and tantric worship is worship of the tamasic form. Both=\r\n are one and the same ,just materials having been substituted.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n If you wish to read this is an nice document on the Khadgamala stotra from=\r\n Devipuram . They do a really good job of dispelling some of the myths arou=\r\nnd devi worship and also have thrown open the doors of devi worship to one =\r\nand all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One is an audio link with Amritananda Natha Saraswati=\r\n himself chanting it.His voice is mesmerizing and soothing.The other is the=\r\n stotra with meanings of each round of the stotra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://old.=\r\ndevipuram.com/downloads/khadgamala_stotram.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.shaktisadh=\r\nana.org/images/Khadgamala/KSFINAL.doc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vem=\r\nparla Ram Kishore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priyan=\r\nk_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many thanks for making it all clear, its very fine, but extr=\r\nemely important. summarizing for myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.

Then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n it is ok to dig in several places to become familiar with digging.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though one may specialize in one subject in higher studies, o=\r\nne learns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many subjects at a young age. But, eventually you have=\r\n to focus on one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subject. Similarly, worshipping several deities=\r\n with several mantras is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ok in the beginning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; My thumb rule is this: Leave all mantras and stick to one, if you feel \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comfortable with it. If you feel guilty and uncomfortable, then y=\r\nou are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably not ready yet and so keep doing your entire rout=\r\nine. But start \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; focusing on one mantra and do more of it, i.e. do=\r\n others for a small \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; duration and spend most doing one mantra.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do not have perfect enough knowledge of astrology to =\r\nrely on it.

But lagna lord Mercury is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; super-strong and shows Vis=\r\nhnu. Saturn shows ascetic and Sun shows Rama. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, Sun-Saturn-Mer=\r\ncury combination to me shows Rama in an ascetic form \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during vana=\r\nvas. Worship Rama. Develop the HanumadBhava (think and act \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like =\r\nHanuman) and worship Rama.
