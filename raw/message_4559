The first are ecstatic expe=\r\nriences caused by a\ndisruption of the homeostasis of the human organism. Th=\r\nese can occur as\na result of fasting, sleep deprivation, drugs, breathing e=\r\nxercises,\npain, dancing, and so on. All of these activities can put us &quot;out=\r\n of\nhomeostasis&quot; =96 by changing our body temperature, blood pressure\nor me=\r\ntabolic rate, causing dehydration and exhaustion or chemical\nchanges =96 an=\r\nd when this happens there&#39;s a chance that we&#39;ll\nexperience a higher state o=\r\nf consciousness. (Although this certainly\ndoesn&#39;t always happen, of course.=\r\n Most of the time the only effect\nthat depriving yourself of sleep and food=\r\n often has is to make you feel\nmiserably tired and hungry.)\n\n\n\nThe second t=\r\nype of spiritual experiences are more serene and calm states\nwhich occur wh=\r\nen there is an intensification and stillness of\nlife-energy (or vitality) i=\r\nnside us. This can happen in any situation\nwhen we&#39;re very relaxed, when th=\r\nere&#39;s peacefulness around us,\nand when the mental chatter inside our heads =\r\nfades away. In meditation,\nwe make a conscious effort to intensify and stil=\r\nl our life-energy by\nbeing inactive, by withdrawing our attention from the =\r\nworld around us,\nand by focusing on a mantra (or a candle flame or on our b=\r\nreathing or\nany other object) to slow down and quieten our mental chatter. =\r\nAs a\nresult, meditation is probably the most effective way of generating\nsp=\r\niritual experiences.\n\n\n\nHowever, they can also happen more spontaneously =\r\n=96 in natural\nsurroundings, for example, when there&#39;s peacefulness around =\r\nyou and\nthe beauty of nature has a similar effect to a mantra in meditation=\r\n,\nfocusing your attention and quietening your mental chatter. They often\noc=\r\ncur when people are listening to music or contemplating works of art.\nCerta=\r\nin sports are also very conducive to spiritual experiences, such as\nlong-di=\r\nstance running or swimming. This is also probably part of the\nreason why sp=\r\niritual experiences can occur during or after sex. The\nsheer pleasure of se=\r\nx can have the effect of shifting our attention away\nfrom our ego-minds, wh=\r\nich may fall silent as a result. ]\n\n\n\nWell, I would not argue with any of t=\r\nhat. I would simply ask you as to\nif there is `spiritual&#39; experience then w=\r\nhat is non spiritual\nexperience? And who says so? Also, what do you mean by=\r\n `higher state\nof consciousness&#39; ?  What makes it higher than what?  Does i=\r\nt mean\nUP?  And what is this `higher&#39; state of consciousness like?  And\nis =\r\nthere anything wrong with `lower&#39; states of consciousness? \nAnd what exists=\r\n in-between the higher and the lower states; and what is\nit like there ?   =\r\nDo you perchance speak of altered states of\nconsciousness? Time consciousne=\r\nss and eternal consciousness maybe?  Is\nexisting in the timeless formless m=\r\node of being more spiritual than\nsitting under a tree in the sunshine?   Wh=\r\ny segregate and call one good\nand the other not good? What is the ego mind?=\r\n  Do you mean the daily\npersonality?  What is wrong with that?
