My mental affiliations are closer to the yOga and advaita-vEdAnta philos=\r\nophies (needless to mention, the way I understand them). So far, based on m=\r\ny affiliations and understanding, I&#39;m of the opinion that a Realized Being =\r\n(however he may have realized) is Divine in all its absoluteness (i.e. noth=\r\ning distinguishes them from The Divinity). The way I understand &#39;tat tvam a=\r\nsi&#39;, mOksha, Atma sAkshAtkAra, yOga, kaivalya, nirvANa etc. \n\nWhile their p=\r\nrarabdha may have been different, once they are realized there is nothing t=\r\nhat distinguishes them from what we call the Ultimate Divinity. So by logic=\r\nal extension, an avatAr is just the re-incarnation of any Realized Being ir=\r\nrespective of that Being having attained to the Highest in 1 life, 10 lives=\r\n, 100 lives or even a billion lives. Once they are Realized, their coming b=\r\nack in a future life is based on absolute free will and not by kArmic vAsan=\r\nAs that draw them to a womb. In a nutshell, I saw no reason to distinguish =\r\nbetween Divine Descending (as an avatAr) vs. Man Ascending (as a Realized B=\r\neing). I was also forceful in the conversation that the entire Manifest Exi=\r\nstence is Divine Descending and used that rationale to further fortify my p=\r\nosition that if we discount effects of prArabdha/sanchita, a Human Ascended=\r\n yOgi/jnAni can(if willing) be as omnipotent/omniscient as a Divine Descend=\r\ned avatAr. The conversation ended with not much conclusion. \n\nThe last few =\r\ndays, I had been revisiting this within myself a few times - specifically t=\r\nhe rationale for such classification in the below three eras. I&#39;d like to h=\r\near from the members on this forum regarding their understanding of an avat=\r\nAr, rishi, jnAni/yOgi etc. Please do mention the &#39;religious/spiritual tradi=\r\ntion&#39; you subscribe to, if possible. \n\n\nRamayana Era - rAma/paraSu rAma (av=\r\natAr), vaSishTa/viSvAmitra/agastya (rishis), janaka/ashtAvakra/yAjnavalkya/=\r\nrishyaSringa (jnAnis/yOgis)\n\nMahabharata Era - Krishna (avatAr), parASarA/v=\r\nyAsa/Suka/paraSurAma (rishis), dharma vyadha(jnAni)\n\n20th Century - Shirdi =\r\nSai (avatAr), ramaNa(rishi), rAma krishna(yOgi), Jiddu Krishnamurthi (jnAni=\r\n)\n\nRegards,\n-Prasad\n\nPS: I did ignore all bhaktas and many others who could=\r\n fall in the above categories. I just quoted one/two in each as that suffic=\r\nes the subject of the discussion. Please don&#39;t take the discussion towards =\r\nwhy some one else not mentioned here is or is not an avatAr/rishi/jnAi/yOgi=\r\n etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
