If you find that you=\r\nr mind is more &#39;inline&#39; then you most probably had a good spell of meditati=\r\non with or without sleep. \n\nPlease forgive my mistakes\n\nregards\n\n--- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jitender Dahiya&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; N=\r\namaste,\n&gt; Can somebody please tell me what is the difference between sleep =\r\nand meditation. Sometimes while meditating i forget everything and then few=\r\n seconds later realise that i am here for meditation. Is it sleep or medita=\r\ntion?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; jitender\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
