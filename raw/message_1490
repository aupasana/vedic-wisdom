It will be a shame if the so-called prosperity takes one \naway from True spiritual prosperity. Try to find some time for sadhana.\n\n&gt; May request to know how to get the same great feeling\n&gt; again and again with my busy office work schedule.\n\nYou have to find a way to squeeze some time and do more sadhana. There is \nreally no other way.\n\nIf one digests that &quot;great feeling&quot; fully and makes it one&#39;s own, it can \naccompany one in whatever one does. Otherwise, it comes occasionally during \nmeditation and then goes away. Until it becomes permanent and your own, \nthere is no other way but to keep doing sadhana.\n\nConsider homam.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;gulatiganesh&quot; &lt;gulatiganesh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, March 09, 2009 6:58 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] On Kundalini (Re: Re: Urdhwa-Retas)\n\n\nDear Shri Narasimha Guru Ji,\n\nSadar Namaskar,\n\nMay request to call you my Guruji?\n\nGuruJi, The example quoted is very interesting.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; Whatever is one&#39;s path, Kundalini is not only awakened but goes to \n&gt; Sahasrara\n&gt; when one is established in undifferentiated Self. Even if one does not \n&gt; think\n&gt; in those terms, it still happens. It is incorrect to say that one can\n&gt; realize the highest truths without Kundalini awakened. A more accurate\n&gt; statement would be that one can realize the highest truths without \n&gt; engaging\n&gt; in any specific practices geared at awakening or raising Kundalini.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some people following the so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or other raja/hatha\n&gt; yoga paths specifically try to awaken Kundalini. However, such practices \n&gt; are\n&gt; not at all needed for awakening Kundalini. People belonging to various\n&gt; traditions and paths, not just limited to Hinduism, can experience \n&gt; Kundalini\n&gt; awakening, without knowing anything about the name or the symbolism. There\n&gt; are a lot of misconceptions about Kundalini.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Kundalini is essentially the force of one&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened and\n&gt; raised kundalini implies a more refined and higher self-awareness.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the lowest level, we bind our selves to specific bodies and our\n&gt; self-awareness is limited to a body, a name and other things associated \n&gt; with\n&gt; the body and name. This experience of self as a body corresponds to\n&gt; Kundalini sleeping at Mooladhara. At the highest level, we are the\n&gt; undifferentiated Self, known as Brahman, that is all-pervading. This\n&gt; &#39;experience&#39; of self corresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As\n&gt; self-awareness goes from the former to the latter, it may traverse through\n&gt; many stages in between. Correspondingly, many experiences are possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Kundalini rises as high as it can when it awakens for the first time, like \n&gt; a\n&gt; spring suppressed for a long time. However, it comes down again and the\n&gt; process of rise from then onwards will be slower, Kundalini will work its\n&gt; way up while the nadis are continuously cleaned (i.e. undesirable\n&gt; conditioning of mind is cleaned). When Kundalini rises high at the time of\n&gt; awakening, it may encounter impurities in nadis and yet rise high through\n&gt; the impurities. This may manifest physically as a powerful experience\n&gt; similar to heavy electricity flowing in the back.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are thousands of nadis in the sookshma sareera. The exact path taken\n&gt; by Kundalini as it rises for the first time is not fixed. It may change \n&gt; from\n&gt; person to person, based on the impurities in various nadis. The exact\n&gt; &quot;experience&quot; will vary depending on the path traversed and the final point\n&gt; reached by self-awareness (kundalini), before withdrawal.\n&gt;\n&gt; I actually know one person who had kundalini awakening, rise to Sahasrara\n&gt; and samadhi for 7 days, all happening at the same time. His nadis had\n&gt; already been purified. Once kundalini awakened, he directly went into\n&gt; samadhi, stayed there for 7 days and came back as a fully realized person.\n&gt; But it is a much longer journey for most.\n&gt;\n&gt; Saying &quot;this is what happens in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The\n&gt; exact experience changes from person to person, depending on the path\n&gt; traversed the final point reached by Kundalini. However, I can say one \n&gt; thing\n&gt; confidently: Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, one will not have any\n&gt; confusion about what happened. But, until kundalini awakening occurs, one\n&gt; may confuse various other experiences (such as some movement of vayu in\n&gt; various nadis) for kundalini movement and wrongly think that kundalini is\n&gt; awakened.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Sensation like ants or worms crawling along the spine or in the head are \n&gt; NOT\n&gt; due to kundalini awakening or rise. That can be due to a little vaayu\n&gt; flowing in various nadis. This can be a premonitory sign (but not a\n&gt; guarantee) of kundalini awakening. Same thing can be said about the\n&gt; sensation of tilting  to one side (back or left or right) or the sensation\n&gt; of having completely fallen back (even though one is sitting normally in\n&gt; reality). There are several such premonitory signs.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; As a reference, I can narrate the experience of ONE person. He was\n&gt; meditating with a Veda mantra everyday. His guru had told him a few months\n&gt; earlier that his time for Kundalini awakening had come. However, he had\n&gt; absolutely no idea what kundalini was and was totally uninformed about\n&gt; nadis, chakras and kundalini. He did not engage in any specific raja/hatha\n&gt; yoga practices. All he did was to sit with his back erect and eyes closed\n&gt; and meditate with a veda mantra. In the weeks before kundalini awakening, \n&gt; he\n&gt; started experiencing various premonitory signs. He guru told him not to be\n&gt; distracted by them and to keep the focus on the mantra and try to forget\n&gt; everything else. When mind starts dwelling on an experience, it gets stuck\n&gt; there and cannot go higher.\n&gt;\n&gt; When he was meditating oneday, his mind was perfectly and intensely \n&gt; focused\n&gt; on the mantra and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Suddenly he became\n&gt; aware of his body. It felt like there was a really tremendous explosion at\n&gt; the base of his spine. Then it felt like a huge amount of electric current\n&gt; was going up his spine from the base. Then it felt like he was not a body\n&gt; but a small point. Then it felt like he was going up like a rocket at a\n&gt; tremendous speed. Then it felt like there was a tremendously bright white\n&gt; light and there was nothing else. It felt like he was not a small point in\n&gt; that light, but he was the light itself. There was an undescribable sense \n&gt; of\n&gt; peace and happiness. Suddenly, from nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is this?\n&gt; What happened to my body? I have responsibilities still.&quot; Then he became\n&gt; aware of himself as a body sitting in pooja room. When he left pooja room\n&gt; and went out, he felt great love for everyone and happiness. For example, \n&gt; a\n&gt; serial was coming on TV and characters in the serial that he normally\n&gt; disliked for their shallow personalities suddenly felt like real people \n&gt; and\n&gt; he had great love and compassion for those TV serial characters (and other\n&gt; real people too). That state of love and compassion lasted a while and \n&gt; then\n&gt; he was normal.\n&gt;\n&gt; This short experience was only the beginning of a journey. He experienced\n&gt; many things later on. These experiences were different from each other. As \n&gt; I\n&gt; said earlier, the experience varies based on the path traversed and the\n&gt; point reached by the self-awareness (kundalini). On various occasions,\n&gt; kundalini rose and he saw several sights and several beings within and \n&gt; heard\n&gt; several sounds, including veda mantras and beejaaksharas, again within.\n&gt;\n&gt; He realized the transientness of a lot that we cling on to and the \n&gt; existence\n&gt; of something far higher and more permanent.\n&gt;\n&gt; All this slowly started to change his attitude. His senses turned inwards\n&gt; and he critically started to analyze his own thoughts and motives and \n&gt; worked\n&gt; on correcting his attitude. The impact of what was happening around him,\n&gt; what others did and said started to make lesser and lesser impact on him.\n&gt; Luckily, he had a guru who put things in perspective and said that \n&gt; kundalini\n&gt; awakening was just a beginning and the real work was ahead. Depending on\n&gt; one&#39;s readiness, that real work can take many many years or even lives.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Kundalini awakening is only a beginning. It is not an end. Even the rise \n&gt; of\n&gt; kundalini to a chakra is not an end. In fact, a big percentage of people\n&gt; with awakened kundalini end up getting stuck at mooladhara itself. Very \n&gt; few\n&gt; make it to the next chakra or the one after, but end up getting stuck \n&gt; there.\n&gt; Very very few make it to higher chakras. And a very small minority \n&gt; actually\n&gt; realise self.\n&gt;\n&gt; Complete overcoming of ego and sthita prajnataa described by Sri Krishna \n&gt; in\n&gt; BhagavadGita is the only real end goal of sadhana, whether you are into \n&gt; raja\n&gt; yoga or karma yoga or bhakti yoga or jnaana yoga. Thinking of a mystical\n&gt; experience can only distract one from this goal. I urge sadhakas, \n&gt; especially\n&gt; those who respect my advice, to forget about kundalini and chakras and \n&gt; just\n&gt; keep doing homam and japam (or whatever path they have chosen), keep\n&gt; purifying themselves with sadhana, keep working on their attitude and\n&gt; thought process and keep improving self-control. When (or as) mind becomes\n&gt; purified and one overcomes ego, whatever needs to happen with kundalini \n&gt; WILL\n&gt; happen automatically. Thinking of things in terms of kundalini and \n&gt; mystical\n&gt; experiences is a big deterrent rather than a boost, in one&#39;s spiritual\n&gt; sadhana. Instead of trying to manipulate kundalini, try to manipulate the\n&gt; way your mind works and perfect your self-control. Kundalini will\n&gt; automatically follow. One will do well to remember these words.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 3:30 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Urdhwa-Retas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; Relevant to this on going subject, i remember reading autobiography of \n&gt; Shri\n&gt; Yogeshwarji (Prakah na Panthe) in which he had mentioned that Kundalini\n&gt; Awakening is not mandatory for realization.

When one attains a perfect focus on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra and distracting thoughts cease, praana moves downward from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lungs/stomach and apaana moves upward. After praana and apaana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; combine,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they can move upward at a rapid speed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When praana and apaana combine for the first time, it may feel like an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explosion within one. As praana moves up, it will feel like one is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; freed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the body and one does not exist. This is similar to death, except\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that there is fear and confusion at death and one may feel a kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bliss when this happens during meditation. However, if one&#39;s focus on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra relaxes and one become &quot;aware of&quot; the experience and starts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; analyzing it with the rational mind, there is a chance of one becoming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worried and confused. So one should sustain the state where there is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; full focus on mantra and no other distractions, for as long as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; These things happen automatically without thinking about them and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in any specific practicies. In fact, thinking about them,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; desiring them and doing specific practices may become an obstacle and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; delay things. If you surrender to a deity and do a mantra with a high\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level of focus, that is enough. Do NOT run after any experience and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think of an experience as an end result. The focus should be mantra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra alone.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even when an experience occurs, I tell people to not be tied to it and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not think too much about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suchaka dream is a vision of something that is going to happen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 03, 2009 5:17 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Remedial Measures Difference (Re:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Resolving Points)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A few repititions of the mantra bring about a situation where the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possesses the sadhaka and the sadhaka&#39;s prana goes upward very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly( Urdhwa Retas),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; During all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; face, etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the room (even though the sadhak&#39;s eyes are closed).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The sadhak typically becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn person.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is� very little� according to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; death\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; heads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover�\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of identification \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some� call this the� Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n\n\n"}}
