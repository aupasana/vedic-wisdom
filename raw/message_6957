He must be above the tricks and bondages of samsara. He should deve=\r\nlop dispassion towards objects which he sees or hears. He must be encircled=\r\n by the fence of dispassion from all sides. As soon as disgust arises in th=\r\ne mind for all objects of the world, then one should take to sannyasa witho=\r\nut any further hesitation. A passionate man should not take sannyasa. A per=\r\nson who takes sannyasa even when he is being overpowered by passion, goes t=\r\no the regions of darkness and gloom. Whose tongue, genital, stomach and han=\r\nds are properly disciplined, that man is fit to take sannyasa. A Brahmana s=\r\nhould take to sannyasa even while he is yet a brahmachari=E2=80&quot;without mar=\r\nriage=E2=80&quot;for samsara is essenceless. He should try to seek that Essence =\r\nthrough renunciation. A man who possesses deep dispassion cannot marry. Wor=\r\nks and duties are only for the worldly man; not for the man of renunciation=\r\n.\n\nAs soon as the supreme truth is ascertained, one should abandon his hous=\r\ne, family, and take up a staff and leave off his sacred thread and the hair=\r\ns on the head.\n\n\n"}}
