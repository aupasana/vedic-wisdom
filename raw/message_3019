It is a state of intense mental concentration=\r\n on something.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kalpa means create or perceive (the word kalpana is fr=\r\nom the same root). Vikalpa means existence of variety. Savikalpa means &quot;wit=\r\nh vikalpa&quot;. Savikalpa samadhi is a state of intense concentration of the mi=\r\nnd, while creational variety or objectification still exists in the mind. O=\r\nne perceives that there is an &quot;I&quot; and there are &quot;other&quot; objects (e.g. deiti=\r\nes, demons, people etc). But one is able to focus the mind intensely on one=\r\n object (e.g. a deity) and able to achieve oneness with that object. Even r=\r\neaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous thing and many great yogis also c=\r\nannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In nirvikalpa samadhi, the creatio=\r\nnal variety and objectification ceases (nirvikalpa=3Dnir+vikalpa, nir=3Ddev=\r\noid of). Mind reaches a state where there is no perception of I and &quot;other&quot;=\r\n objects. One&#39;s consciousness is absorbed in supreme consciousness (Brahman=\r\n or Aatman), without any perception of a variety of objects. This state is =\r\nreached by very very few yogis.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sahaja samadhi is a state where the m=\r\nind is *simultaneously* perceiving a variety of objects *and* absorbed in t=\r\nhe supreme consciousness!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one is norma=\r\nlly perceiving a variety objects, one&#39;s mind is absorbed in an *individuali=\r\nzed* consciousness that is colored with the conditioning of that individual=\r\n&#39;s experiences over various lives. When one sees a beautiful person, one&#39;s =\r\nmind may get certain thoughts (depending on the experiences, values and des=\r\nires accumulated from many lives). When somebody is praising one, one&#39;s min=\r\nd may get certain thoughts. When somebody is criticizing one, one&#39;s mind ma=\r\ny get certain thoughts. And so on. One&#39;s mind has likes, dislikes, attracti=\r\nons, repulsions etc, based on the accumulated experiences, values and desir=\r\nes of that individualized consciousness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In sahaja samadhi, one has n=\r\no individualized consciousness and one&#39;s mind is absorbed in the infinite s=\r\nupreme consciousness that is not colored by the experiences and conditionin=\r\ng of a single individual. One is actively living in the material world; one=\r\n&#39;s mind is perceiving various objects of various attributes through jnanend=\r\nriyas; and, one&#39;s mind is engaging in various actions in the material world=\r\n though karmendriyas. Yet, one has no individualized conditioning or I-ness=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Very very very few beings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis and god=\r\ns, can reach that state. For most others, that state is not really a possib=\r\nility.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I gave an analogy earlier to explain=\r\n various aspects of consciousness, using parts of a computer.\n&gt;  \n&gt; ahamkaa=\r\nra (I-ness) - CPU\n&gt; chitta (conditioning) - DRAM\n&gt; buddhi - ALU or logic co=\r\nprocessor\n&gt; manas - I/O controller\n&gt; jnanendriyas - input channels\n&gt; karmen=\r\ndriyas - output channels\n&gt; praanas - on-board power supply\n&gt; deha (body) - =\r\nmechanical parts, chassis etc\n&gt;  \n&gt; Normally, CPU is running a complex prog=\r\nram where a lot of input channels and output channels are active. DRAM has =\r\na lot of stored data and CPU is refreshing it frequently. ALU is running se=\r\nveral algorithms based on stored data and a lot of I/O data gets stored/ret=\r\nrieved from DRAM all the time. This is analogous to a person&#39;s normal state=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a state where the computer is in a power=\r\n standby. On-board power supply is hardly supplying any power, all input an=\r\nd output channels are turned off, I/O controller is turned off and ALU is n=\r\not running any algorithms. If a computer goes into power standy and exits i=\r\nt quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. Similarly, a person rea=\r\nching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly will resume previous activi=\r\nties. If a computer stays in the power standby for too long, it will be tur=\r\nned off and its state may be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays in n=\r\nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, one will simply merge in Brahman and cannot=\r\n resume previous activities.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sahaja samadhi is akin to a computer run=\r\nning a bare minimum program that accesses a program running on a central su=\r\nper computer on a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are running on a central su=\r\nper computer and our individual computer&#39;s CPU simply has a small routine t=\r\nhat accesses the results of the algorithm running on the super computer and=\r\n controls the local I/O controller accordingly. There isn&#39;t much data store=\r\nd locally and there is no algorithm running locally. One&#39;s praanas are supp=\r\nlying power, one&#39;s jnanendriyas are getting inputs and one&#39;s karmendriyas a=\r\nre engaging in actions, one&#39;s manas is controlling this Input/Ouput activit=\r\ny and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by running a small program tha=\r\nt accesses a super computer that is monitoring all the computers of the wor=\r\nld and deciding what this computer should do.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; As I said, very very very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is =\r\nbeyond the reach of even the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis cannot e=\r\nven reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to r=\r\negular consciousness after a while and start to accumulate conditioning aga=\r\nin (chitta, i.e. DRAM). The CPU is running some program or the other, howev=\r\ner small, and accumulating more data in DRAM and building up an algorithm i=\r\nn ALU. Minimization of I-ness is possible, but elimination of I-ness while =\r\nembodied is very difficult! If any limited I-ness is left and any condition=\r\ning (I am this, I need this, I like this etc) is left, then it is NOT sahaj=\r\na samadhi. Sahaja samadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness and connec=\r\nting the supreme universal I-ness directly to one&#39;s mind and body.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I =\r\ncannot make judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my business. I=\r\n will take on individuals only when they interfere with my dharma and my se=\r\nnse of dharma dictates that I should take them on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But the bottomline=\r\n is that sahaja samadhi state is no joke and only yogis of an absolutely tr=\r\nemendous caliber reach it. Those who reach this state are like the god - su=\r\npreme cosmic being - himself.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me give a=\r\nnother analogy. This life is like a long dream. Saviklapa samadhi is like w=\r\nakig up *within* the dream. Nirvikalpa samadhi is like waking up from the d=\r\nream. Sahaja samadhi is like being in the dream and yet being awake.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nThis may confuse people, but this analogy shows how complex and difficult s=\r\nahaja samadhi is. The previous computer analogy highlights how things work =\r\nin a sahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how difficult it is.\n&gt;  \n&gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarp=\r\nana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softwar=\r\ne (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhat is sahaja samadhi and how is it different from nirvikalpa samadhi?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; best regards\n&gt; &gt; Hari\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enligh=\r\ntened Master living in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sahaj Samadhi all times.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
