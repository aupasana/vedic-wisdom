I have browsed several posts here and I do not know of any reference i=\r\nn any traditional shastras, so I have a question regarding the performance =\r\nof homam in one&#39;s mind. There must be times in one&#39;s life when several rest=\r\nrictions of time or place or any other reasons - do not allow one to perfor=\r\nm an external homam under the &quot;perfect&quot; conditions that one would like.  \n\n=\r\n1. So how does one go about this? Does one mentally visualize oneself perfo=\r\nrming all the external rituals from A-Z? What if one&#39;s mind cannot &quot;multi-t=\r\nask&quot; and synchronize the mental recitation of mantras with the mental perfo=\r\nrmance of actions? What if one cannot maintain the same standards of extern=\r\nal environment purity, discipline etc? Is it then best to avoid mental homa=\r\nm altogether?\n\n2. Can one derive the same benefit from a mental homam that =\r\none would derive from an external homam?\n\n3. Could a regular performance of=\r\n mental homam remove the impediments that is blocking one in doing homam in=\r\n real life and may it result in one becoming fortunate enough to carry out =\r\nreal-life homam by the grace of God?\n\nMany many Thanks\n\n\n"}}
