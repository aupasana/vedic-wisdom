However, you are free to address me as you fe=\r\nel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I just came across=\r\n Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times r=\r\nepeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identi=\r\nfies with it.\n&gt; &gt; Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, =\r\nthe state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an ext=\r\nremely important statement to answer our queries.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Important inform=\r\nation about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was =\r\na big time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he=\r\n didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical b=\r\nody. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally ate meat=\r\n. I gave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) th=\r\nat it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. F=\r\nurther, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very fr=\r\nequently to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he d=\r\noes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the que=\r\nstions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are th=\r\noughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When =\r\nwe take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or an=\r\ny other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are=\r\n all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. =\r\nThey are knower of everything or many things in the universe. Their individ=\r\nual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *=\r\nknow* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our top=\r\nic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew =\r\ntobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There wo=\r\nuld be surely a specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs bec=\r\nause as I said, they know complete background behind their each action and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  moreover their self identification is missing from the action and henc=\r\ne it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose w=\r\nithout binding them in any cause-effect chain.\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna used to freq=\r\nuently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from others. H=\r\ne has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume anythin=\r\ng and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything=\r\n without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake=\r\n is extremely important.\n&gt; &gt; If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in wes=\r\nt, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is not possible for majority=\r\n of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. He might b=\r\ne removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he c=\r\nan be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate thei=\r\nr habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also possi=\r\nble at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with =\r\nthe `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have show=\r\nered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s =\r\npossible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural in=\r\nconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Na=\r\nture know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in US=\r\nA while he was still in India and did not even planned to go to USA. When t=\r\nhe boy, after some\n&gt; &gt;  years actually met Swami in USA for the first time,=\r\n swami immediately told him to stay away from water and when he requested s=\r\nwami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him=\r\n that he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will give him Sil=\r\nver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda a=\r\nnd after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda =\r\nwhich literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S=\r\no moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding t=\r\no take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sa=\r\ninbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and su=\r\nch masters and justify our completely self identified and utterly selfish c=\r\nruel/unjust actions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Great coincidenc=\r\ne of thoughts!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on Non-Ve=\r\ng eating.=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eating is not=\r\n advisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on=\r\n Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he =\r\nsurvived many days on just eating meat when he was living in USA also relis=\r\nhed it.

That is why you find a meat-=\r\neater reborn either as a predator or prey or as both in succession. Human b=\r\neings cry a lot at funerals of their own kind but they have absolutely no t=\r\nhought for the sufferings of the animals they slaughter. They never hesitat=\r\ne to kill and eat. Just think, first they kill the chicken. Often they will=\r\n cut its throat and let it bleed to death, which is a most painful way to d=\r\nie. Then it will be cleaned, cooked and eaten, and if it happens to be toug=\r\nh everyone will curse it for not satisfying their palates. How many humans =\r\nwould give beautiful tender lean meat if they were slaughtered, dressed, pr=\r\nepared and served?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget that animal mother=\r\ns too love their children. Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes throu=\r\ngh when her chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment=\r\n of motherliness, do they consider how much she suffers when she sees the s=\r\nlaughter of her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own body and nourish=\r\ned with her milk, whom she loves more than her own life?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do these so =\r\ncalled humans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to mother cow? Cou=\r\nld they endure their own children being murdered before their own eyes?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; How is Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not humans, whose intellect is=\r\n subtle enough to self-identify with another being of a different species a=\r\nnd experience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternative but to m=\r\nake them suffer, allowing the animals they have tortured to torture them in=\r\n return. Fair&#39;s fair, after all. If I cut your throat in this birth you hav=\r\ne every right to cut mine in the next or some succeeding birth.
