You can find some answers in the archives. I will briefly answer again.\n \nOn your first point: Yes, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th chapter of BhagavadGita: &quot;yaGYaanaam japayaGYo.asmi&quot; (of all sacrifices/rituals, I am the japa yajna, i.e. chanting of mantras).\n \n*        *        *\n \nWe can get it in right perspective by noting that the very previous line says &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;.\n \nYes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence of universe. However, is it possible for everyone to meditate just using &quot;Om&quot; and reach god? Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras such as the mahamantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with &quot;Om&quot;, because Krishna said I am &quot;Om&quot; among mantras? Of course, not.\n \nSame thing holds to japam vs other sadhanas such as homam.\n \nJust as one may need ropes and other gear to climb mount everest, one may need to employ mantras other than &quot;Om&quot; and practices other than &quot;japam&quot; to overcome one&#39;s short-comings and reach the summit of the absolute, represented by Om (and all other things mentioned by Krishna).\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhen you do an external sacrifical ritual such as homam, your body is engaging in actions. So your mind has to be attached to the body and use it in a particular way. Can one reach samadhi while doing homam? Unlikely. One is more likely to reach samadhi when one stops the external actions. Mind may be withdrawn completely from the body and absorb fully in the mantra at some stage then.\n \nFrom the point of view, japam (sitting still and meditating on a mantra) is the ultimate sadhana.\n \nHowever, not everyone can reach god like that. There are so many vasanas (conditioning) in the mind that needs to be purged/purified slowly. Until that is done, japam may not help one reach god. Until then, taking the help of an external pure object (such as fire) that has a purifying effect on one&#39;s subtle consciousness can be helpful. It *prepares* one for good japam.\n \n*        *        *\n \nA lot of priests do homam and then leave the fire and go away. In the homam manuals, I have made it a point to insist that people do japam with their favorite mantra at the end of the homam, while sitting still with closed eyes. The idea is that homam purifies subtle consciousness and *prepares* one for reaching god, while it is finally japam that takes one to god. After every homam, one&#39;s internal purity is at a maximum (a local maximum, temporally speaking - sorry for the technical jargon) and japam will be more fruitful than at other times.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNow onto other questions:\n \n(1) It is unfruitful in the sense that it does not take you closer to god. It is fruitful in the sense that it stops you from going much further away from god. After all, if you weren&#39;t engaged in that japam and you were doing some other activity, probably your mind will wander even more.\n \nI suggest looking at disturbing thoughts in the middle of a japam as a heckler interrupting your speech. Instead of arguing and fighting with the heckler, simply take note of him, pause for a second and move on. Instead of panicking or worrying, simply take note of your thoughts, pause for a second and move on.\n \n(2) Mantra means that which protects (tra) the mind (mana). Various vasanas (conditioning) are pulling the mind in different directions to react to various situations in various ways and that activity tires out the mind. You protect it by anchoring it in a mantra and teaching it to overcome the pulls of vasana.\n \nThe proof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is working for you or not is whether there is a slow internal transformation in you or not, whether your internal reaction to various external things is changing for the better or not.\n \n(3) Difficult. This is where a good guru is helpful.\n \nActually, in this age, technical perfection is almost ruled out. I suggest doing whatever one does with a sense of surrender and humility. If there is something partly correct that somebody is doing, it will slowly increase with time and Nature will remove imperfections with time.\n \n(4) I can  write Obama&#39;s name and Gordon&#39;s name on sheets of paper next to me and pretend that they came there and sat there. Will they really do it? On the other hand, if I am a world leader holding a summit, probably I can make them actually come and sit there.\n \nNyasa means placement. When you do nyasa, you place various vibrations (sound patterns) or energies (deities) in various body parts. For most of us with distracted minds, it is merely a formality and means nothing. Only a sadhaka with a pure, pointed and focused mind can actually place various vibrations and energies in various body parts.\n \nI always suggest to people to do nyasa as taught by elders (so that the knowledge lives and is passed on), but not worry too much about it.\n \nAs I said, we are in the midst of deepening Kali and the level of sadhakas is not as high as in the old days. Technical perfection will become rarer and rarer. It is better to focus on surrender and humility.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Veneet Kumar &lt;kveneet@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; In the Bhagvata Gita, Krishna says that I am &quot;Japa&quot; amongst all Yajnas. This statement establishes the supremacy of Japa over all other kinds of rituals. I have the following queries regarding Japa.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Many a times while doing japa the mind wanders. The chanting done at these instants are done without any &quot;bhavana&quot; or sense of devotion in the mind and are merely a physical chanting. Are such japas unfruitful?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Is there some way to validate that the japa shall actually bring certain merits or nullify the targeted evils? \n&gt; \n&gt; 3) How can an ordinary person determine whether the japa he is doing (or has done) is being done in a proper manner? For example if there was some error in pronunciation or some nyasa was not performed correctly which invalidated the japa - can it be detected by the sadhaka himself by some means? \n&gt; \n&gt; 4) There is a tradition of doing some nyasa etc before doing mantras where deities are invited on various body parts. Do those deities actually come and protect the entire process of Japa? Can one perceive their presence in anyway - say maybe by observing a change in the aura around the sadhaka?\n&gt; \n&gt; with regards\n\n\n"}}
