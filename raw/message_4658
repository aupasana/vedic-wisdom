He was usually found\nsit=\r\nting on the elevated place outside the cave.

Bhagavan had come down from the hill =\r\nafter his\nmother=E2=80=99s samadhi and an Ashram grew around him. I did odd=\r\n jobs like\ncollecting flowers for worship, drawing water from the well, gri=\r\nnding\nsandalwood paste etc. For sometime I was performing the puja at Bhaga=\r\nvan=E2=80=99s\nmother=E2=80=99s shrine.\n\nOne day Chinnaswami asked me to tak=\r\ne up the preparation of the morning\niddlies, the steamed rice and pulse cak=\r\nes common to South India.

In preparing\niddlies I achieved such excellence that vis=\r\nitors commented that nowhere had\nthey tasted iddlies comparable to those of=\r\n the Ashram.\n\nHe was very particular about avoiding waste. He showed me how=\r\n to use a ladle\nso that not even a drop of food would fall on the ground, h=\r\now to avoid\nspilling while pouring and how to start a fire with just a few =\r\ndrops of\nkerosene.
