Today, I am not in a great moo=\r\nd and let me show my disagreement :-)\n\n Come out of Soumya, rudra (ugra) de=\r\nvata, etc. your personal devata is your personal. You can get angry with hi=\r\nm, love him, think he has not done enough for you, and still love him. \nI a=\r\nm surprised these lessons have come from someone who questioned his (once) =\r\nguru, why one cannot use rudraksha to pray Lord Vishnu and use tulasi beads=\r\n to pray Lord Siva and bhakti can go beyond those !\n\nAll these dust will se=\r\nttle / ugra devata will punish but give faster results are just unacceptabl=\r\ne, I wish there is proof for those, unless we say pudding here :-)\n\nLet&#39;s s=\r\nay, you have to move back to India, would you consider it as &quot;my homam has =\r\nworked and I have been punished so that I can prosper spiritually&quot; or if yo=\r\nu get to stay back in US would you say &quot;my homam has worked and my devata h=\r\nas granted me my wishes&quot; ! The answer you do not know. None of us even unde=\r\nrstand what is right and what is wrong for us or for the world. You live wi=\r\nth what you think is right for you. \n\nTake it Steve Jobs way. Give your bes=\r\nt shot and if you lose, you can learn from the lessons :-)  He came to Indi=\r\na, stayed in Sh Neem Karoli Baba&#39;s (I guess I got the name right) ashram an=\r\nd went back with thoughts that Einstein and Faraday have done more for huma=\r\nns ! He went to do what he likes and is convinced with. The point is, what =\r\ndo you like ? If you love to do homam, just keep doing it and see what chan=\r\nge it brings *in you*, not what changes it brings *to you*. \n\nPeople like m=\r\ne who questioned a lot took years just to understand Srila Prabhupada&#39;s wor=\r\nds. While someone like Sh Jananivasa Prabhu and Sh Bhakti Raghava Maharaj h=\r\nad faith in Lordships of Sh RadhaKrsna and SP and dedicated their lives to =\r\nKrsna bhakti. I was fortunate to meet the former, while I was unfortunate n=\r\not to have been initiated by the latter, you will find both of them Sh Mani=\r\nsh Pandit&#39;s video on Lord Krsna. They are in the video for a reason for sur=\r\ne, they are exalted devotees. The difference between me and the exalted dev=\r\notees of Iskcon is, they are truly surrendered to Lord and I am waiting for=\r\n the Lord to surrender to me and help me when needed ! Someday, when I lear=\r\nn, I will crib less :-)\n\nOne more example here, if it interests you. When I=\r\n went to Iskcon Santa clara, the temple was small. If I were maintaining th=\r\nat temple, the first thing I would have mentioned is I have been doing so m=\r\nuch to build a bigger temple, but *one day there will be a bigger temple, L=\r\nord willing*. This is what Vaisesika Prabhu who heads the temple mentioned =\r\n&quot;We are all fortunate that their holy Lordships agreed to stay with us for =\r\nthe last 7 years in this garage, let us do our best to give them a better p=\r\nlace&quot;. Enough said. \n\nDo not get into what deities would do, they know what=\r\n to do. Whether they throw the rotten fruits first or not is not known to u=\r\ns. While spreading of homam is totally amazing and appreciated, the stuff l=\r\nike soumya devatas are slow and ugra devatas are fast is labeling them with=\r\nout knowing them completely. At Iskcon, Lord Radha Krsna and Sh Narasimhade=\r\nv are prayed on the same altar.\n\nFinally, it is not that you will get spiri=\r\ntual, the kundalini will touch sahasrara and you are happily out ! Srila Pr=\r\nabhupada once told Harikesa maharaj &quot;Go to Russia and start preaching and s=\r\npread HareKrsna mahamantra&quot;. Harikesa maharaj mentioned &quot;They eat meat and =\r\ndo other sinful activities, what will happen to my Krsna consciousness&quot;. SP=\r\n said &quot;To hell with your Krsna consciousness, there are fallen souls who ne=\r\ned delivery&quot;. Nicely put :-)\n\nSumming it up, I complain to Lordships if thi=\r\nngs donot go well, still I chant everyday as I love them. Exalted devotees =\r\nof Iskcon will not do it that way and may not crib like me, but the point i=\r\ns they are the Lords.\n\nAnyways, I put this quickly, hope it makes sense. \n\n=\r\nregards\nrAma\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_da=\r\ny@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; PVR\n&gt; \n&gt; Respected sir, I had sent your 3-4 mails last we=\r\nek at PVR regarding my situation as i am completely shaken.

However, it is tough to=\r\n prove so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Secondly, it is also possible that some material setbac=\r\nks may be given \n&gt; &gt; by a deity to remove confusions from the mind and make=\r\n one realize what \n&gt; &gt; is permanent and what is impermanent. Sometimes, in =\r\norder to overcome \n&gt; &gt; the tendency towards anxiety and depression, god may=\r\n push one into a \n&gt; &gt; terrible situation that aggravates one&#39;s anxiety, bef=\r\nore clarity dawns \n&gt; &gt; on one. Strange are the ways of god. Many great sain=\r\nts went through \n&gt; &gt; terrible sufferings as their lives transformed to beco=\r\nme fruitful and \n&gt; &gt; meaningful! What we think is good for us may actually =\r\nbe bad in the long \n&gt; &gt; run. If we surrender to god, things we want in the =\r\nshort term may or may \n&gt; &gt; not happen, but our life will be steered in the =\r\nright direction in the \n&gt; &gt; long term. God knows better than us, what is be=\r\ntter for us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If there is doubt in your mind that Vishnu sahasra na=\r\nama homam caused \n&gt; &gt; problems for you, it may be better to not restart it.=\r\n Give it some time. \n&gt; &gt; When you find inspiration again, possibly at a lat=\r\ner time, you can start \n&gt; &gt; again. It is sometimes not useful to do a sadha=\r\nna with such deep \n&gt; &gt; fear/doubt.
