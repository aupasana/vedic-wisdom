Love the Tibetan teachings- the=\r\n Tibetan book of living and dying is one of my favourite spiritual books.\n\n=\r\nI&#39;ve always wanted to see him in Dharamsala but could never get leave from =\r\nwork to travel that side when he was there ( he&#39;s always traveling). But I =\r\nnearly missed my long awaited chance to be in his presence. I nearly missed=\r\n my train this morning thanks to Durga&#39;s sense of humour. The taxi I booked=\r\n in advance for the train station unexpectedly didn&#39;t show up. It&#39;s usually=\r\n very difficult to get a taxi at the last minute but I tried anyway as I wa=\r\ns desperate, and one was surprisingly available. Anyway, if there are no mo=\r\nre mishaps I will attend his talk &quot;stand up and be the change&quot; this afterno=\r\non!\n  \nTake care, and have a nice weekend- I&#39;ve enjoyed our chat. :)\n\nAparn=\r\na\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Aparna, \n&gt; \n&gt; Great you going for Dalai lama, i followed his tal=\r\nks and tibetian buddhism for quite a while. \n&gt; \n&gt; i think talks for western=\r\n audience dilutes the essence. I think you are more emotional types so go a=\r\nnd soak up his presence and majestic. he is a living buddha. visit him in d=\r\nharamshala and ull get bang on empowerment.\n&gt; \n&gt; even gopis didnt knew what=\r\n they were at heart. there is no becomming, there is only being. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; an=\r\nd i thought aghoris could only wake up shamshan not a peaceful vedic forum.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; enjoy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_108=\r\n0&quot; &lt;sunrise_1080@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the links Priya=\r\nnk ji, I will check them out when I&#39;m at a computer next (am writing this f=\r\nrom my phone on a train- on my way to attend a talk by the Dalai Lama in Ma=\r\nnchester, very curious to know what he&#39;s like).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry if I&#39;ve offe=\r\nnded people inadvertently. It really wasn&#39;t my intention. Anyway if Durga i=\r\ns upset with what I&#39;ve said to her, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll take me to task for it.=\r\n But I will speak to her as I please- we each have a right to speak to God =\r\nwith anger as much as with love. Somebody wise once said, offer all emotion=\r\ns that arise to God- both the good and bad ones. So I will continue to dire=\r\nct anger at Durga if anger arises in my mind for any reason. She is the onl=\r\ny one who can handle it as she gave it to\n&gt; &gt; me. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do respect al=\r\nl members of this forum including those who are currently annoyed with me. =\r\nApologies. :) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have a good day everyone.

Sound advice no doubt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunat=\r\nely Durga is partial to some of her children it seems, and not all of us ar=\r\ne blessed with the intense desire to chant as you seem to be. Stop rubbing =\r\nit in please. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the use of asking us to chant more?=\r\n Ask her to give us this desire, as she seems to have done for you. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which brings me to ranting a bit about the general injustice of =\r\nour esteemed Durga. The Atman is sexless, but the Atman in female form has =\r\nbeen treated worse than the Atman in male form over the centuries...even to=\r\nday it is being murdered in the womb (female foeticide), raped, burnt in Sa=\r\nti etc etc. Yes yes it is deathless etc, but while in this ignorant state, =\r\nit still suffers in the form of women. I hasten to add that I am no feminis=\r\nt but right now, I&#39;m furious with Durga. How outrageous that for centuries,=\r\n and even today, women were not allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (w=\r\nhich is to the Goddess). Why aren&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of f=\r\nemale to male saints is probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what =\r\nis the point of covering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avid=\r\nya Maya), and then yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the=\r\n scriptures). If she wants to save us, she will have to create in us the de=\r\nsire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  to do japa or whatever. I wash my hands of the whole thing.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So don&#39;t tell us to chant, tell her to tell us to chant. Li=\r\nke she told you to. It&#39;s not our fault.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok rant over. I&#39;m =\r\ngoing to control my temper and do some Om Namo Narayanaya repetition now. W=\r\nho knows when it&#39;s time for the cremation ground? You did it for a select f=\r\new, but not for the rest of us millions- Damn you Durga. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAparna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
