What does it mean by &quot;affecting&quot;?\n=C2=A0\nThe diagr=\r\nams, not just by Lahiri Mahasaya but even other books, explain the connecti=\r\non of the nadis etc, but no where in his description of spiritual progess (=\r\nfrom the 26 dairies of Lahiri Mahasaya) does he say that awakening of the a=\r\ngya chakra will automatically awaken the mooladhara.

Where is the beginning and the end of the sushumna =\r\npassing through 6 cerebro-spinal chakras ?\n\nIn the physical body, it appear=\r\ns as a linear movement from the lowest mooladhara to the highest ajna chakr=\r\na - but the nadis&#39; emanating from these &quot;Shad-chakras&quot; - meet in a circular=\r\n manner inside the Sahasrara Chakra (See the diagram of Astral Nadis&#39; prepa=\r\nred by YogiRaj ShyamaCharan Lahiri, published in Gita Commentary by Yoganan=\r\nda).\n\nThus, the highest Ajna is connected to the lowest Mooladhara and the =\r\nawakening of one of them affects the other, a fact rather well-documented i=\r\nn Yoga books. A fact, required to understand why Ganesh, deity of Mooladhar=\r\na, is worshipped first.\n\n&gt; In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiated consci=\r\nousness (Brahman or &gt;Aatman), where there are no I-ness or any objectificat=\r\nion. Just &gt;below it, there are several lokas that people do not mention \n&gt; =\r\nnormally.\n\nWith every invocation of Gayatri Mantra, we mention 3 or 7 of th=\r\nese lokas. Don&#39;t we do it &quot;Normally&quot; ? \n\nIn any case, we are not discussing=\r\n about the actual experiences or undifferentiated consciousness, the 6 tatt=\r\nwas that cause creation are still very much differentiated in Nature.\n\nPata=\r\nnjalis&#39; Chitta Vrittis&#39; correspond to the 5 tattwas and are all happening o=\r\nn the background of Chitta, the all-pervading 6th tattwa. The normal-human-=\r\n experience happens by the 5 modifications/ movement of Chitta (finest crea=\r\ntion).\n\nHow would the Soul become aware of the more material Aakash Tattwa =\r\n(and thus a single coherent self pervading the material physical body), if =\r\nit were not standing behind the Chitta (SuperEther) ?\n\nThus, all our experi=\r\nences of matter are through non-material Chitta, and it doesn&#39;t imply that =\r\n6th tattwa doesn&#39;t exist. If you could calm all those modifications of Chit=\r\nta, you would have your self-realized.\n\n&gt; In Aajnaa chakra lies the primord=\r\nial state of the universe where \n&gt; there is just space and time, but no fiv=\r\ne elements. \n\nNothing comes out from nothing. How can the lower tattwas evo=\r\nlve from higher tattwas, if even their subtle representations are purged fr=\r\nom existence altogether ?\n\nGreatest of the Seers have already put down the =\r\nscriptures in writing, so that people like us can benefit.\n\nRegards,\nNitish=\r\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am only addressing the five elements mentioned in upan=\r\nishads.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiated consciousness (Brahm=\r\nan or Aatman), where there are no I-ness or any objectification.

It seems to be his extrapolation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What you quo=\r\nted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional view that I am familiar wi=\r\nth. Other scriptures refer to the same order of creation, including &quot;Yoga V=\r\naasishtham&quot; , where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction and li=\r\nberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic und=\r\nerstanding is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. Th=\r\ne five chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra repres=\r\nent ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, =\r\nearth element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element a=\r\nre effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, =\r\nwater element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element a=\r\nre effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and wa=\r\nter etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth e=\r\nlement shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and=\r\n fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particula=\r\nr thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state=\r\n and made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.=\r\ng. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water el=\r\nement. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five =\r\nelements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body=\r\n that looks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart from the physic=\r\nal aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qualities, certa=\r\nin needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has about who one =\r\nis, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness.=\r\n Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* =\r\nin nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Ku=\r\nndalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* =\r\nor *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still re=\r\nmaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many people who talk about experiences of =\r\nKundalini in higher chakras are often talking merely about some amount of v=\r\naayus flowing in those chakras (which may still be a nice experience) and h=\r\nave *not* experienced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really l=\r\neaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have n=\r\notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, ea=\r\nch element is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the physic=\r\nal as well as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface even one =\r\nelement (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration =\r\nof time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are e=\r\nffaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and e=\r\nther. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced elements return to work in the=\r\n reverse order - ether, air, fire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does phy=\r\nsics describe reality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe/model reality=\r\n at the gross physical level, as perceived by the external senses. However,=\r\n one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses playing a rol=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in =\r\nwhich one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between th=\r\nem. In another example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense=\r\n focus and &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot=\r\n be perceived by the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern =\r\nscience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that =\r\ncan be perceived by the external senses, because different people can exper=\r\nience the same reality using their senses individually and verify the obser=\r\nvation. However, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by s=\r\nenses are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and someti=\r\nmes liberating influence on people. Inability to study and model them is a =\r\nbig drawback of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One may cat=\r\negorize dreams and internal yogic experiences as imaginations or hallucinat=\r\nions, because there is no independent validation, and call them unworthy of=\r\n a study. But there are cases that make one wonder. For example, see the fo=\r\nllowing messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mi=\r\nnd and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- w=\r\nisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a spec=\r\nific yogic experience that was described in detail and another person seeme=\r\nd to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating to the experie=\r\nnce, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, =\r\nthough it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Re:=\r\n Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/mes=\r\nsage/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had a specific=\r\n yogic experience that was described in detail and another person seemed to=\r\n know about it and supplied a couple of tangible details relating to the ex=\r\nperience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first per=\r\nson, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.c=\r\nom/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, on=\r\ne person had a specific yogic experience involving a deity and another pers=\r\non perceived with his external senses a vision involving the same deity, th=\r\nough others in the room could not perceive anything with their external sen=\r\nses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the fir=\r\nst person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Such ex=\r\namples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *some* experienc=\r\nes that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses are observab=\r\nle by others, though not everyone may be able to observe. Then, one cannot =\r\nrule out the possibility of *some* experiences that cannot be measured or p=\r\nerceived by the external senses being a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can=\r\n access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern science study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Be=\r\ncause the only thing that can be studied and measured is the reality involv=\r\ning the gross body and its senses, one may suggest that experiences of the =\r\nsubtle body may be studied by observing various parts of the gross physical=\r\n body. For example, one can look at the nervous signals flowing through var=\r\nious parts of the brain and try to correlate them with the experiences of t=\r\nhe subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. B=\r\nut, it assumes that subtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there=\r\n is some correspondence between what happens in the causal, subtle and gros=\r\ns bodies, it is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in whi=\r\nch case the concept of causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. wh=\r\natever they model can be moderled using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nf you drive through a neighborhood and observe the houses from the road, yo=\r\nu can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular house with a lot o=\r\nf lights and sound and many cars parked outside may be having a party. Peop=\r\nle in one particular house with no lights are probably out of town. But you=\r\n can never be sure what is going on in the house, how many people are insid=\r\ne, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at the house from out=\r\nside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous signals in various =\r\npoints of the brain, you may be able to see some basic things, but not much=\r\n. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond your reach and study, if yo=\r\nur tools are limited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study that part of the reality=\r\n which is beyond the scope of external senses, unless scientists become yog=\r\nis and develop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of =\r\nancient times had mastery of the internal world (which is the microcosm of =\r\nthe entire universe) and could observe any space-time point, even the great=\r\nest yogis of today cannot control their state completely.

He did mention in details about the process of cr=\r\neation as he saw it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As per him, at the beginning was the =\r\npoint of ultimate chaos. Then from there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As th=\r\nis &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produced some universal energies =\r\nwhich are more commonly known as the universal deities like Shiva, Vishnu e=\r\ntc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are the actual physi=\r\ncal elements as we see it, but more the essence of the element, hence his u=\r\nse of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction with the chaos re=\r\nsulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Pr=\r\nithwi, each one resulting from the previous and each one resulting in some =\r\nenergy states, which in the end resulted in 33 crore possible states of ene=\r\nrgy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in there (at least for me), and =\r\nI want to get at it.. I feel there may be some correlation between that and=\r\n the 11-dimensional physics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of =\r\nmyself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a nice idea and I would like to know more=\r\n about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as I could fathom (I am no physicist, n=\r\neither do I have the ability to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theory),=\r\n as it stands now, it is quite half formed. There being multiple theories o=\r\nf the String variety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 d=\r\nimensional one) is one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some a=\r\nspects of the physical world. Finding a correlation between this and the id=\r\nea of the five elements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can =\r\nunderstand some correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the =\r\nCopenhegan Interpretation) , non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian myst=\r\nicism, but a link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Well, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know more abo=\r\nut how exactly you can link these two, because I myself with my limited und=\r\nerstand fail to see any viable correlation at all as of now, specially, sin=\r\nce the M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other =\r\nthing one must think about is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does=\r\n physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two=\r\n are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need=\r\n not be exactly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once f=\r\namously quoted that everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one =\r\nknow what it really is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and=\r\n creation is almost the essence of everything. The day physics gets THAT de=\r\nep, there would be really nothing more left to do. Physics is still quite f=\r\nar away from that stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@ &gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if I get the t=\r\nhrust of your point.

If=\r\n you can provide an exact quote with page number and name of the book, I wi=\r\nll try and check. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He explains in details abou=\r\nt the &quot;granthi bhedans&quot; before one goes into actually &lt;EM&gt;awakening&lt;/EM&gt;&nb=\r\nsp; any chakra for that matter.

Tattwa has a very specific technical=\r\n meaning. When you say that Gunas by &quot;inherent duality&quot; in nature give rise=\r\n to 6 tattwas, I guess you are using a simple multiplication of 3 x 2 and a=\r\nrriving at six. My question, then why not a simple 3 raised to the power 2 =\r\nresulting in 9 tattwas?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;No, this is not really=\r\n a case of basic maths I presume.

However, very very very few can understand what happens in the chakras j=\r\nust below Sahasrara and above Aajnaa, where there is still I-ness and objec=\r\ntification, but at a very very high level that is beyond the play of elemen=\r\nts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is a lot more happening between Sahasrara and Aa=\r\njnaa than elsewhere, but we are not well-equipped to understand it...&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas=\r\n Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spir=\r\nituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.=\r\nnet/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastr=\r\nologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srij=\r\nagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ ...&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You menti=\r\noned 5 tattwas, while there are 6 tattwas - that are associated with the 6 =\r\ncerebro-spinal chakras - a result of all possible combination of 3 gunas of=\r\n nature.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Gunas Tattwa Chakras&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Satvic\n Tamas - SuperEther - Medulla &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Satvic Satva - =\r\nEther (Aakash tattwa) - Throat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Satvic Rajas - Air (Vayu tattwa=\r\n) - Heart&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rajasic Rajas - Fire (Agni tattwa) - Navel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Rajasic Tamas - Water (Jala tattwa) - Sacral&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tamasic Tamas=\r\n - Earth (Prithvi tattwa) - Coccygeal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; SuperEther=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1.

It =\r\nseems to be his extrapolation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What yo=\r\nu quoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional view that I am famili=\r\nar with. Other scriptures refer to the same order of creation, including &quot;Y=\r\noga Vaasishtham&quot; , where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction a=\r\nnd liberation to Lord Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic understanding is also con=\r\nsistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five chakras downwar=\r\nds from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, fire, =\r\nwater and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element within o=\r\nne is\n surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effaced in one&#39;s s=\r\nelf-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water element within =\r\none is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are effaced in one&#39;s s=\r\nelf-awareness. And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and=\r\n water etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Eart=\r\nh element shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible =\r\nand fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a partic=\r\nular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid st=\r\nate and made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing =\r\n(e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water=\r\n element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the fi=\r\nve elements.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, o=\r\nne perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way\n physi=\r\ncally. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who =\r\nhas certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those con=\r\ncepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini rep=\r\nresents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if=\r\n *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who o=\r\nne is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if=\r\n *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative id=\r\nea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Many people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher cha=\r\nkras are often talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those =\r\nchakras (which may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced K=\r\nundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one=\r\n will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notions of\n owning anyth=\r\ning. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced =\r\nin one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subt=\r\nle level of existence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from o=\r\nne&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of time, is not at all=\r\n easy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are=\r\n effaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and=\r\n ether. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced elements return to work in t=\r\nhe reverse order - ether, air, fire, water and earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physic=\r\ns and spiritual realities:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does p=\r\nhysics describe reality?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries=\r\n to describe/model reality at the gross physical level, as perceived by the=\r\n external senses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot;\n things without the ex=\r\nternal senses playing a role.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As a sim=\r\nple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;se=\r\ne&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In another example, =\r\na yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some sc=\r\nenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceived by the ext=\r\nernal senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that =\r\ncan be perceived by the external senses, because different people can exper=\r\nience the same reality using their senses individually and verify the obser=\r\nvation. However, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by s=\r\nenses are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and someti=\r\nmes liberating influence on people. Inability to study and model them is a =\r\nbig drawback of modern science.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams and interna=\r\nl yogic experiences as imaginations or hallucinations, because there is no =\r\nindependent validation, and call them unworthy of a study. But there are ca=\r\nses that make one wonder. For example, see the following messages from the =\r\narchives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mind=\r\n and mantras (message 951)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a specific yogic exp=\r\nerience that was described in detail and another person seemed to know abou=\r\nt it and supplied one tangible detail relating to the experience, suggestin=\r\ng that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was =\r\nbeyond the external senses of either\n person!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/391&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 391&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had a specific =\r\nyogic experience that was described in detail and another person seemed to =\r\nknow about it and supplied a couple of tangible details relating to the exp=\r\nerience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first pers=\r\non, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/=\r\n2498&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-=\r\n wisdom/message/ 2498&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above=\r\n message, one person had a specific yogic\n experience involving a deity and=\r\n another person perceived with his external senses a vision involving the s=\r\name deity, though others in the room could not perceive anything with their=\r\n external senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experien=\r\nce of the first person through a specific prism.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot =\r\nprove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *some* experiences that cannot=\r\n be measured or perceived by the external senses are observable by others, =\r\nthough not everyone may be able to observe. Then, one cannot rule out the p=\r\nossibility of *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by th=\r\ne external senses being a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern science study it?&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can be studied =\r\nand measured is the reality\n involving the gross body and its senses, one m=\r\nay suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be studied by observing =\r\nvarious parts of the gross physical body. For example, one can look at the =\r\nnervous signals flowing through various parts of the brain and try to corre=\r\nlate them with the experiences of the subtle body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes t=\r\nhat subtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there is some corresp=\r\nondence between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is =\r\na many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the conc=\r\nept of causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they mode=\r\nl can be moderled using just the gross body!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; If you drive through a neighborhood and observe the houses from the =\r\nroad, you can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular house with=\r\n a lot of lights and\n sound and many cars parked outside may be having a pa=\r\nrty. People in one particular house with no lights are probably out of town=\r\n. But you can never be sure what is going on in the house, how many people =\r\nare inside, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at the house=\r\n from outside.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking a=\r\nt the nervous signals in various points of the brain, you may be able to se=\r\ne some basic things, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are b=\r\neyond your reach and study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical=\r\n domain.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study that part of the r=\r\neality which is beyond the scope of external senses, unless scientists beco=\r\nme yogis and develop mastery of the internal world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal wor=\r\nld (which is\n the microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any s=\r\npace-time point, even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their stat=\r\ne completely. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experie=\r\nnce some part of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where=\r\n Kundalini goes and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes=\r\n. Rishis seemed to have a perfect control.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do=\r\n a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; t=\r\narget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish less=\r\nons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;=\r\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijag=\r\nannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;raja=\r\nrshi14@ &gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail went of=\r\nf incomplete. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff\n =\r\nfrom the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the hig=\r\nhest order) - it maybe of some help to you. He did mention in details about=\r\n the process of creation as he saw it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; As per him, at the beginning was the point of ultimate chaos. Th=\r\nen from there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with=\r\n the chaos, it produced some universal energies which are more commonly kno=\r\nwn as the universal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidy=\r\nut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are the actual physical elements as we see it, =\r\nbut more the essence of the element, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and=\r\n &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction with the chaos resulted in some more energy =\r\nstates. Thus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting f=\r\nrom the previous and each one resulting in some energy states, which in the=\r\n end resulted in 33 crore possible states of energy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in there (at least for me), =\r\nand I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some correlation between that=\r\n and the 11-dimensional physics of super string theory too, but I get ahead=\r\n of myself..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a nice =\r\nidea and I would like to know more about it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I=\r\n have the ability to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stan=\r\nds now, it is quite half formed. There being multiple theories of the Strin=\r\ng variety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional =\r\none) is one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of t=\r\nhe physical world. Finding a correlation between this and the idea of the f=\r\nive elements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can understand =\r\nsome correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least\n the Copenhegan=\r\n Interpretation) , non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but=\r\n a link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would l=\r\nike to know more about how exactly you can link these two, because I myself=\r\n with my limited understand fail to see any viable correlation at all as of=\r\n now, specially, since the M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think abou=\r\nt is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe reality=\r\n? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two are different. Mathemati=\r\ncs provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly as realit=\r\ny is. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously qu=\r\noted that everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what =\r\nit really is!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; The idea of t=\r\nhe pach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of everything. The day=\r\n physics gets THAT deep, there would be really nothing more left to do. Phy=\r\nsics is still quite far away from that stage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;v=\r\nedicastrostudent@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Dear Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if=\r\n I get the thrust of your point.

That too if we are destined to find out we will, or else no.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastr=\r\nostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@=\r\n ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Order of Creat=\r\nion (of mahabhuta/tattwa)\n ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ =\r\nyahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 29 September, 2=\r\n009, 1:12 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear =\r\nNarasimhaji and others,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; In Taittiriya Upanishad (&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.sacred-/&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.sacred-&lt;/A&gt; texts.com/ hin/sbe15/ sbe15034. h=\r\ntm), the following is the order of creation (Max Mueller interpretation) :&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;From that Self 2 =\r\n(Brahman) sprang ether (=C3=83=C6=92=C3=82=C2=A2k=C3=83=C6=92=C3=82=C2=A2sa=\r\n, that through which we hear); from ether air (that through which we hear a=\r\nnd feel); from air fire (that through which we hear, feel, and see); from f=\r\nire water (that through which we hear, feel, see, and taste); from water ea=\r\nrth (that through which we hear, feel, see, taste, and smell)&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This sounds\n logical to me in =\r\nthat I expected Akasa to be first and earth to be last.
