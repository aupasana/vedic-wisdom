Instead of doing a \nlittle of each mant=\r\nra and covering many mantras, I suggest picking \nany ONE mantra and doing i=\r\nt as many times as one can. If one is \nunable to choose a mantra, I suggest=\r\n Mrityunjaya mantra. If one wants \na simpler mantra, I suggest &quot;Om hreem na=\r\nmashshivaaya&quot; . However, there \nare many options in the manual.\n&gt; \n&gt; My adv=\r\nance greetings for a happy Maha Shivaratri!\n&gt; \n&gt; It is hoped that spiritual=\r\n seekers take advantage of this manual.\n&gt; \n&gt; Company of fire has a highly b=\r\neneficial effect on mind and homam \n(fire ritual) is far more effective tha=\r\nn japam (meditation) in \npurifying mind and removing obstacles. Almost all =\r\nthe remedial \nmeasures (upayas) taught by Maharshi Parasara in Brihat Paras=\r\nara Hora \nSastram (BPHS) involve homam and not japam. As the internal purif=\r\nying \nfire within individuals becomes weaker with deepening Kali yuga, \nval=\r\nue of external fire in meditation increases.
