Without such\nan ex=\r\nperience, Sanatana Dharma is rendered devoid of all meaning and\npurpose. To=\r\n love God is to embrace Dharma. And to embrace Dharma\nthoroughly and withou=\r\nt reservation is what it means to be a Hindu.\n\nOne of the most unfortunate =\r\nand most damaging stereotypes that many\npresent-day Hindus have about Sanat=\r\nana Dharma is that a) deep\nspirituality and b) practical action in the worl=\r\nd simply do not mix.\nIn the minds of such people, serious spiritual practic=\r\ne and practical\nsocial action are mutually exclusive paths, of which we can=\r\n only\nchoose one. Such a defeatist scenario is in actuality the very\nopposi=\r\nte of the realty of Sanatana Dharma. Indeed, holding this\nincorrect opinion=\r\n that one cannot be both spiritual and also engaged\nin the world is in itse=\r\nlf just another sad manifestation of the self-\ndenigrating syndrome that we=\r\n see so prevalent among nominal Hindus\ntoday.\n\nWhen we look at both the his=\r\ntory and the teachings of Sanatana Dharma\nspecifically, and of all religion=\r\ns generally, we see that the reality\nis the opposite of these gross, and ve=\r\nry much modern, Western-\ninspired, stereotypes. The myth of the other-world=\r\nly mystic having\nbeen rendered incapable of engaging the world around him i=\r\nn a\npractical and activist manner is an exaggerated stereotype arising\nmore=\r\n from the speculative minds of spiritually unaware speculators of\nreligion =\r\nthan from anything corresponding to reality. Rather than\nbeing socially deb=\r\nilitating, spirituality has always proven itself to\nbe the most powerful mo=\r\ntivator for highly practical and effective\naction in the world.\n\nBhakti, or=\r\n single minded devotional meditation upon Bhagavan (God),\nis not a hindranc=\r\ne to practical social and political action in the\nworld. On the contrary, b=\r\nhakti has been, by its very inherent\nnature, a powerful and dynamic social =\r\nforce in the past. Bhakti is\nan unparalleled motivating force that has indu=\r\nced revolutionary and\nprogressive change. It will also serve as the driving=\r\n spiritual\nforce that will revive and strengthen Dharma well into the 21st\n=\r\nCentury.\n\nIf we examine the very long history of Sanatana Dharma, we see th=\r\nat\nit was almost exclusively deeply spiritually-realized people who were\nal=\r\nways the most practical and successful men (and women) of action.\nValmiki, =\r\nfor example, was originally a bandit who then later became a\ndedicated Rama=\r\n-bhakta and ascetic sage. It was only after this\npersonal spiritual transfo=\r\nrmation affected him to the core of his\nbeing that he then found himself em=\r\npowered to compose the enormous\nliterary masterpiece known as the Ramayana =\r\nin its 24,000 Sanskrit\nverses. Indeed, the entire corpus of Sanskrit shastr=\r\nas (scriptures)\nwere written by hundreds of spiritually-inspired saints, wh=\r\nose very\nmotivation for writing about philosophy, religion, politics, Yoga,=\r\n\nmathematics, sciences, medicine, etc., etc. was their own radically\nperson=\r\nal self-transformative experience of the presence of God within\nthem. Witho=\r\nut the committed scholarship of such spiritually-inspired\nsages, Hinduism a=\r\nnd India would today have been entirely devoid of an\nintellectual and cultu=\r\nral history! It was the empowerment provided\nto these sages by God that equ=\r\nipped them to realize unparalleled feat\nof scholarly and literary accomplis=\r\nhment in this world.\n\nAfter the ascendance of Buddhism and Jainism in Hindu=\r\n India, it was\nagain God-realized men of action who - far from retreating f=\r\nrom the\nworld and living in their sadhana huts - led dynamic movements that=\r\n\nsaved Sanatana Dharma from imminent extinction. The great sage Sri\nShankar=\r\na Acharya was known as Dig-vijaya (&quot;Conqueror of All\nDirections&quot;) because h=\r\ne quite literally conquered the four corners of\nIndia, peacefully reestabli=\r\nshing Vaidika Siddhanta (the Vedic Truth)\nas the preeminent philosophical s=\r\nystem on earth, and the only\nlegitimate path for knowing Brahman (God). Sha=\r\nnkara was shy in his\nassertion that Sanatana Dharma was the most legitimate=\r\n and direct way\nof knowing God, and each and every other system was substan=\r\ndard in\ncomparison. He is known to have engaged in hundreds of debates with=\r\n\nthe avaidika (non-Hindu) Buddhists, soundly defeating them with the\nsuperi=\r\nority of Vedic teachings, and converting their followers en\nmasse to Sanata=\r\nna Dharma. Hardly an otherworldly dreamer was he!\n\nThe great Vedantist phil=\r\nosopher Ramanuja Acharya, similarly, was a\nradical bhakta (practitioner of =\r\nBhakti-yoga) who nonetheless wrote\nsome of the most philosophically profoun=\r\nd masterpieces India has ever\nproduced, while simultaneously traversing the=\r\n length of breadth of\nBharata (India) to reestablish the path of bhakti as =\r\nthe greatest\nexpression of Vedanta philosophy. Ramanuja created a revolutio=\r\nn in\npeople&#39;s understanding and appreciation of the ancient bhakti\ntraditio=\r\nn, reviving bhakti in the four corners of India, and changing\nthe course of=\r\n Indian and world history.\n\nLike Shankara centuries before him, the Vaisnav=\r\na Vedantist Sri Madhva\nAcharya traveled widely, actively converting thousan=\r\nds of Buddhists\nand Jains to Sanatana Dharma, and reestablishing Vaidika Dh=\r\narma in\nSouth India. He also urged the kings of South India to physically\ne=\r\nxpel thousands of avaidika Jain leaders from their kingdoms,\nconverting man=\r\ny important kings to the fold of Sanatana Dharma.\n\nTulasidas, Surdas, Mirab=\r\nhai, Chaitanya, Sahajananda Svami\n(Swaminarayana), and a thousand other God=\r\n-intoxicated revolutionaries\nfearlessly revived the people&#39;s faith Sanatana=\r\n Dharma during the\nIslamic holocaust in northern India. Without the practic=\r\nal\nleadership and hard work of these many bhakti-inspired saints,\nSanatana =\r\nDharma would most likely have been annihilated by the\nAbrahamic purveyors o=\r\nf genocide hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe biographies of many hundreds of Raja=\r\nrshis - or courageous and\nimplacable God-realized kings - are recorded in t=\r\nhe Puranas. Such\nphilosopher-kings were often known as Chakravartins, due t=\r\no the fact\nthat they ruled their kingdoms while wielding the figurative &quot;Wh=\r\neel\nof Dharma&quot;. Such Chakravartins and Rajarshis were at once the\npersonifi=\r\ncations of both Dharmic spirituality and martial nobility.\nSuch rulers exhi=\r\nbited qualities that represented the very best of\nboth the spiritual and th=\r\ne practical worlds. They were philosopher-\nkings, ascetic-warriors, saintly=\r\n-rulers, and martial-yogis. These\nspiritual men-of-action were capable of d=\r\nelivering a profound and\nmoving discourse on Dharma one day, and then leadi=\r\nng an army of\nmultiple phalanxes into bloody battle to defend Dharma the ne=\r\nxt.\nThese Chakravartins were saints-of-action! They are also perfect\nmodels=\r\n of the qualities that we so desperately need in Hindu leaders\ntoday.\n\nThe =\r\nDharmic world is waiting with fervent yearning for the arrival of\nsuch Chak=\r\nravartins today, who will be able to save Sanatana Dharma\nwith the intensit=\r\ny of their devotion, and the powerful authority of\ntheir sovereign will.\n\nH=\r\now many untold thousands of true brahmana (intellectuals/priests)\nleaders l=\r\nike Chanakya have helped to preserve Sanatana Dharma and\nserved as brave gu=\r\nardians of Dharmic culture? How many saints have\nserved as trusted advisors=\r\n to kings and empires throughout the\nhistory of India, helping to steer the=\r\n great &quot;ship of state&quot; toward\nto the path of Dharma?\n\nHow many unlimited nu=\r\nmbers of fearless yogis, gurus, acharyas, and\nsaints have worked endlessly =\r\nto keep Sanatana Dharma alive in the\nface of terrible challenges, conquests=\r\n, persecutions, and betrayals\nfrom within the likes of which so many of tod=\r\nay&#39;s &quot;Hindu activists&quot;\nliving in the lap of comfort in Twenty-first Century=\r\n America, New\nDelhi, and Mumbai, can only pretend to comprehend, but can ne=\r\nver hope\nto imitate?\n\nDid Swami Vivekananda ignore the real world, or did h=\r\ne fearlessly\nengage the world, traveling thousands of miles from the only h=\r\nome he\nknew in order to share the light of Sanatana Dharma with an uncaring=\r\n\nworld? What of such contemporary spiritual soldiers as Sri\nBhaktivedanta S=\r\nwami Prabhupada, or Sri Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, or\nDr. David Frawley (Pa=\r\nndit Sri Vamadeva Shastri), or Sri Shastri\nPandurang Athawale? It has only =\r\nbeen due to the hard work of such\nsages as these that Sanatana Dharma has b=\r\neen preserved for as long as\nit has.\n\nSanatana Dharma will be saved by the =\r\nemergence of many more such\nsaints and leaders in the immediate future - an=\r\nd such saintly leaders\nwill arise, not from the stars above, but from the r=\r\nanks of the Hindu\ncommunity itself. Ours is not a messianic, faith-based re=\r\nligion.\nUnlike the Abrahamic sects, spiritually-inspired Hindus do not sit =\r\nin\nprayer huts and wait for messiahs, saviors, or avataras (the next of\nwho=\r\nm will not be arriving for another 420,000 years!). We don&#39;t hide\nin prayer=\r\n closets as the world burns around us hoping only for our\nown salvation. Ag=\r\nain, this is only a childish stereotype of the\nreligious Hindu. Rather, Hin=\r\ndus are a very practical and innovative\npeople. When times are dire, God-in=\r\nspired leadership always arises\nfrom within the Hindu community.\n\nMy messag=\r\ne to the Hindu community is this: if you want to see an\nempowered and fearl=\r\ness Hindu leadership arise to lead Dharma into the\nTwenty-First Century, th=\r\nen YOU must become the leaders you seek. And\nyou must do so, not out of a c=\r\nraving for money, fame, or power, but\nas a devotional offering of your life=\r\n humbly surrendered at the\ndivine feet of Bhagavan. True Hindu leadership c=\r\nan only arise from\nwithin the Hindu community itself.\n\nIt will only be God-=\r\nempowered Hindu leaders, fueled by the blissful\nrays of bhakti, fearless in=\r\n the face of opposition, and dedicated to\ngiving their lives for the greate=\r\nr benefit of the Hindu People and\nthe Dharma Nation, who will be capable of=\r\n leading Sanatana Dharma and\nof securing its future in the years to come. I=\r\nndeed, IT IS ONLY\nBECAUSE THEY ARE GOD-EMPOWERED that such leaders will be =\r\nready,\nequipped, and able to storm into the world unafraid and confident in=\r\n\ntheir ability to compel positive change upon society, politics, and\ncultur=\r\ne. It is only the power of bhakti that can fuel such\ndedication and fearles=\r\nsness.\n\nBhakti can be the only motivational force strong enough to ensure t=\r\nhe\ndegree of self-sacrifice necessary to create true leadership. It is\nnot =\r\nenough to identify yourself as a &quot;Hindu activist&quot; merely because\nyou find S=\r\nanatana Dharma interesting, inspiring, a neat culture that\nshouldn&#39;t disapp=\r\near, or just because you somehow think it&#39;s your\nethnic heritage. Such triv=\r\nial concerns are not enough to promote\neffective action. The only way a Hin=\r\ndu leader will be truly\neffective is if he/she has had a direct vision of G=\r\nod in his/her\nheart so powerful that they see it as their own personal serv=\r\nice to\nBhavagan to teach others how to love Him. Any lesser motivation only=\r\n\nleads to the invisible chains of ego. Only when we have leaders who\nare on=\r\n fire with devotion (bhakti) to God will Dharma be saved.\n\nThroughout the h=\r\nistory of Sanatana Dharma, bhakti has served as a\npowerful social force, an=\r\nd has consequently served to change the\ncourse of human history. Bhakti wil=\r\nl once again serve as a social\nforce today as we face a world that is yearn=\r\ning for truth, for\ngoodness, and for meaningful relief from the manifold su=\r\nfferings\nproduced by the failed offerings of the cold, secular world we hav=\r\ne\ncreated. The life-enhancing power of bhakti, coupled with honest and\nfear=\r\nless leadership, will bring about nothing less that the Dharma\nRevolution t=\r\nhat we need in our age.
