You need some =\r\nwood. I used to put at least 8-10 bundles of samidha sticks (each bundle ha=\r\nving around 15-20 sticks of 6 inchs length) along with the coconut - at dif=\r\nferent intervals - so that the coconut eventually catche fire. \n\nIn case th=\r\ne coconut does not burn completely, it should be burnt off in the next homa=\r\n done by the same person. Ideally it should be burnt off in the same homa, =\r\nif not, then make sure that you do the next homa as soon as possible. \n\n\n-R=\r\negards\n Rajarshi\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedi=\r\nc_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am aware that you are using =\r\nfull green coconut as Purnahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; What i wish to know from you is that =\r\ndo you feel that green coconut can be tried in the Homam done with Dry coco=\r\nnuts?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am thinking for some times to at least try out once with My 10=\r\n inch Homam Container.

If that can be given in the fire, nothin=\r\ng like it! Let me elaborate a bit \n&gt; &gt; more on the last portion of the belo=\r\nw mail.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Normally we do a homa in a homa kunda which is placed on t=\r\nhe floor. The gap - \n&gt; &gt; physical distance - between the person doing the h=\r\noma and the kunda is not too \n&gt; &gt; big. In such circumstances it is good to =\r\nbe a little cautious while giving a \n&gt; &gt; full coconut. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0If someone has a fire pit dug, or the homa-kunda base is resonably=C2=A0=\r\nbelow the \n&gt; &gt; surface level where one is sitting, that is ideal for giving=\r\n a coconut in fire.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0I used to give a whole coconut (sometime=\r\ns 2 coconuts)=C2=A0in my normal homa kunda \n&gt; &gt; (16 inchx 16 inch). The coc=\r\nonut would take at least one and half hours to burn \n&gt; &gt; properly. I would =\r\nuse that time to meditate, while pouring ghee on the coconut \n&gt; &gt; at freque=\r\nnt intervals. But the coconut will at one point spurt hot water. \n&gt; &gt; Norma=\r\nlly it will spray and=C2=A0diffuse the fire,=C2=A0so keep enough ghee and c=\r\namphor \n&gt; &gt; ready!=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sometimes however=C2=A0the water may=C2=\r\n=A0get=C2=A0sprayed=C2=A0on the body of the person. That is \n&gt; &gt; why it is =\r\nbest if there is some reasonable gap between the person and the homa \n&gt; &gt; k=\r\nunda, like in a fire pit. Prefer large coconuts than smaller ones. Large on=\r\nes \n&gt; &gt; are easier to control in fire. Smaller coconuts are more unpredicta=\r\nble. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On a different note, I have had a few occassions when c=\r\noconuts have burst \n&gt; &gt; uncomfortably in the kunda spraying water on me. On=\r\nce my face got scalded such \n&gt; &gt; that I could not shave for a few weeks. Ho=\r\nwever, the interesting thing is that \n&gt; &gt; the bursting of a coconut and wat=\r\ner getting sprayed maybe uncomfortable and \n&gt; &gt; painful, BUT invariable it=\r\n=C2=A0sublimates some major karma that is coming. It is \n&gt; &gt; NEVER a radom =\r\nact. I have learnt through experience. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And coconut will prod=\r\nuce a lot of smoke too. That is another factor to be taken \n&gt; &gt; into accoun=\r\nt. However, all said and done, it is the best offering one can make \n&gt; &gt; in=\r\n fire. The effects are simply=C2=A0amazing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you really want to =\r\ntake your homa experience to the next level, try full \n&gt; &gt; coconuts. And if=\r\n you have a firepit dug, then nothing like it...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasi=\r\nmha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sun, 13 M=\r\narch, 2011 9:04:24 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Offering whole fresh coco=\r\nnut in homam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Depending on the materi=\r\nals offered in homam, the effect on one&#39;s subtle \n&gt; &gt; consciousness changes=\r\n. One of the nice substances that one can offer in \n&gt; &gt; homam fire is a who=\r\nle fresh coconut. Though dry coconut (copra) can also \n&gt; &gt; be offered, norm=\r\nal fresh whole coconut with water in it is a fantastic \n&gt; &gt; material. Tradi=\r\ntionally this is what was offered as poornaahuti \n&gt; &gt; (symbolic of head, i.=\r\ne. ego).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BTW, those who do homam with a small fire using dry cocon=\r\nut pieces \n&gt; &gt; should ignore this mail completely. Offering a whole fresh c=\r\noconut in \n&gt; &gt; fire is practical only for those who do homam with a big fir=\r\ne using logs \n&gt; &gt; of wood. You want to offer something only if you can full=\r\ny burn it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If a fresh coconut is offered in fire, it will take a w=\r\nhile to burn \n&gt; &gt; completely, because it has layers (fiber, shell, white st=\r\nuff and water \n&gt; &gt; etc, just like our own ego-consciousness!). If one offer=\r\ns it in the end \n&gt; &gt; of homam, it will be a challenge to make it burn fully=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One idea is to offer it in the beginning instead of the end, and=\r\n give it \n&gt; &gt; time to burn, as one goes through homam. I, for example, offe=\r\nr a fresh \n&gt; &gt; coconut in my daily homam at the end of offerings to Ganapat=\r\nhi at the \n&gt; &gt; beginning of homam. Then I invoke Chandi and offer Chandipat=\r\nh in fire \n&gt; &gt; with various offerings. During the course, the fresh coconut=\r\n burns fully \n&gt; &gt; and gets reduced to ashes by the end. Having offered a wh=\r\nole fresh \n&gt; &gt; coconut in homam daily for six months, I can tell you that i=\r\nt is a very \n&gt; &gt; good idea (if and only if it is practical in your case).\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One risk is that coconut can break in a spot and hot water can gush=\r\n at \n&gt; &gt; you at a speed. Though that can be avoided with a little understan=\r\nding \n&gt; &gt; of the dynamics, one should not do this if one is worried about t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; inhury.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sh=\r\nort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films t=\r\nhat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; -----------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
