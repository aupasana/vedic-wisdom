But it is ok. Atleast, you=\r\n are engaging your I-sense to work for the benefit of the world rather than=\r\n self-gratification. When do a homam or archana, you are trying to please a=\r\n deity (personification of a particular good quality in all the people of t=\r\nhe world). When you do social service, you are helping needy people. And so=\r\n on.\n\nWhile doing various kinds of sadhana, one tries to take the focus of =\r\nmind from the limited self (body, name, status, image etc) and expand it to=\r\n a larger entity (e.g. a deity, a community, a society, a country, universe=\r\n etc). One tries to focus the mind on others and not think much about onese=\r\nlf. This helps one overcome mind&#39;s natural tendency to focus on limited sel=\r\nf and gratification of that limited self.\n\nWhile doing that, however, thoug=\r\nhts may arise &quot;I am doing this good and important work&quot;. Such thoughts brin=\r\ng the focus of mind back to the limited self (body, name, status, image etc=\r\n). By telling oneself that the Lord is doing it though one and that one is =\r\nmerely an instrument, i.e. by cultivating the spirit of &quot;Sarvam Sri Krishna=\r\narpanamastu&quot;, one tries to overcome that tendency towards self-gratificatio=\r\nn and/or self-glorification.\n\nAfter repeated practice, such thinking become=\r\ns common sense to one and one&#39;s mind gets focused on doing what one sees as=\r\n one&#39;s dharma, without any sense of pride or self-gratification or self-glo=\r\nrification.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nIf a priest doing an arch=\r\nana for you takes your name and nakshatra in the sankalpam before the pooja=\r\n, there is nothing to be worried. In your mind, try to think as above.\n\nSom=\r\ne priests go much further and say all kinds of highly specific things in sa=\r\nnkalpa. For example, I have seen priests say &quot;to give dharma, artha, kaama,=\r\n moksha, well-being, strength, boldness, success, fearless, longevity, heal=\r\nth, wealth etc to so and so person, to remove all past, present and future =\r\nsins and all past, present and future problems related to all planets, shad=\r\nowy planets, sub-planets in rasi, navamsa, drekkana, trimsamsa etc charts a=\r\nt birth, in dasas and in transits, and to give results as though all planet=\r\ns are placed in the 11th house and not in the actual house of placement&quot; et=\r\nc etc. Some priests spend 5-10 minutes mentioning so many specific desires =\r\nin sankalpam. When you find a priest saying things like that, I suggest jus=\r\nt taking it easy and not getting either excited or disturbed. Just think in=\r\n your mind &quot;I am doing this ritual as a humble offering to you. Please rece=\r\nive it kindly and give whatever you see as appropriate&quot; and try\n to focus t=\r\nhe mind on the deity. What&#39;s in your heart is far more important than anyth=\r\ning else.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nCultivating the sense that =\r\nwhatever good work you are doing is being done by the Lord *through you* an=\r\nd whatever results (including very bad ones) are given to you are fruits gr=\r\nanted by the Lord to your karmas which you should accept without regrets, i=\r\ns an important activity that should go on outside of the ritual time.\n\nFor =\r\nexample, when one&#39;s wife or husband (or someone close) yells at one or abus=\r\nes one, fairly or unfairly, one has a choice. One can either become upset a=\r\nnd angry and remain in that mood for a few hours wondering why the other pe=\r\nrson is so unfair/wrong, or one can just accept it as the fruits given by t=\r\nhe Lord for one&#39;s previous actions and focus the mind on what good actions =\r\ncan be performed *now*. Similarly, when people praise one, one has a choice=\r\n.

One can either become upset and angry and remain in that mood for a=\r\n few hours wondering why the other person is so unfair/wrong, or one can ju=\r\nst accept it as the fruits given by the Lord for one&#39;s previous actions and=\r\n focus the mind on what good actions can be performed *now*. Similarly, whe=\r\nn people praise one, one has a\n choice. One can either become excited and g=\r\nloat in the praises or one can think that the Lord used one as an instrumen=\r\nt in getting that work done and focus the mind on what good actions can be =\r\nperformed *now*.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotis=\r\nhWritings&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.=\r\nnet/&quot;\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri T=\r\narpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- &lt;deleted&gt;=\r\n wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;, you had =\r\nreplied that we must&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; always offer all our actions and the fr=\r\nuits of all our actions to&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Krishna.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is=\r\n relatively straight forward at the end of a homam.
