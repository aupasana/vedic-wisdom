There the mind, being consumed by the\ncons=\r\nciousness-light of the Self, ceases to exist, along with the ego.\n\nWhat is =\r\nthis power?\n\n514 That power is indeed the grace of God, who is the real Sel=\r\nf in the\nHeart. It is of the nature of right awareness. By yielding up ones=\r\nelf to it,\nthe aspirant becomes blessed.\n\n515 In that great burning state, =\r\nthe sky of pure consciousness, the\never-real and auspicious real Self dance=\r\ns in the form of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. In the\nfire of t=\r\nhis right awareness, which is the sole reality, the universe, along\nwith th=\r\ne ego, is destroyed.\n\nThis fire consumes the whole of creation with its roo=\r\nt, the ego, leaving not\neven ashes. The real Self is said to be dancing, to=\r\n indicate the bliss of\nthat state.\n\nSo, there is no dance in the literal se=\r\nnse.\n\n516 However, since that same sky of consciousness is his real nature,=\r\n how\ncan he, being formless, dance there? This metaphor shows that his form=\r\n is\nbliss, and that the dance is motionless.\n\n517 In that state there is no=\r\n maya, no avidya [ignorance], no space, no\ntime, and no individual called t=\r\nhe soul. There, only the real Self, having\nthe form of pure consciousness, =\r\nexists, and nothing else.\n\nThis state of aloneness is called kaivalya.\n\nMay=\r\na and avidya are mutually dependent. Neither can exist without the other.\nS=\r\no both are lost in this conflagration. This has been definitely stated in\no=\r\nne of the hymns to Sri Arunachala by Bhagavan.\n\n518 In that transcendental =\r\nstate the power of God, named maya, whose\nexpanded form is the whole world,=\r\n is wholly lost in that motionless supreme\none, along with the whole of her=\r\n creation.\n\nFor him that dwells eternally in that supreme state, there is n=\r\neither maya\nnor avidya, nor the world.\n\n519 Therefore, in that supreme stat=\r\ne of peace there shines, unhindered, the\ntrue form of the real Self. The on=\r\ne that survives in that state, abiding as\nhis own real Self, is designated =\r\nby the sages as the free one.\n\nBondage being due to the false identificatio=\r\nn of the body as the Self, it is\nlost when the ego-sense is lost. There is =\r\nno more any false identification.\n\nThe mind is lost. But at the same time t=\r\nhe pair of pleasure and pain is also\nlost. This is illustrated as follows:\n=\r\n\n520 Just as a woman, suffering intolerably in her father-in-law=E2=80=99s =\r\nhouse,\nobtains peace in her mother=E2=80=99s house, so the mind, harried by=\r\n samsaric\nsuffering, wins peace by returning to its source, the real Self.\n=\r\n\nWhat about the unfree souls in the world? Does the free one see them, and =\r\nis\nhe anxious for them?\n\n521 As a man awakening from a dream no longer sees=\r\n any of the dream persons,\nso the one who has awakened from the sleep of ig=\r\nnorance, and who is\ntherefore alone as the sole reality, does not see anyon=\r\ne as other than his\nown real Self.\n\nIn all persons alike, the real Self is =\r\nunaffected. Ignorance and bondage are\nnot for him, but for the mind or the =\r\nego, the imaginary individual soul, who\nnever had any real existence.\n\n522 =\r\nHow can that state, the natural state of peace, become knowable by the\ninte=\r\nllect =E2=80=93 that state of him who dwells engrossed in the bliss of that=\r\n\nSelf, having no knowledge of others as different from himself?\n\nJust as th=\r\nat state is unthinkable by the intellect, so too is the one who\nhas won tha=\r\nt state and dwells eternally there.\n\n523 How can any man understand, by the=\r\n unaided power of his own intellect,\none who is mind-free, bodiless and wor=\r\nldless?\n\nThe one who is established in that state of deliverance is called =\r\na sage, or\n=E2=80=98Prabuddha=E2=80=99 or Buddha. He cannot be known becaus=\r\ne he has none of the\nattributes of an individual.\n\nHe is one with the etern=\r\nal subject, the supreme reality, and so cannot be\nmade an object for anyone=\r\n to know.\n\n524 Because that one has no particular marks or features, the mi=\r\nnd cannot\nthink of it, nor words describe it. The words of the Vedanta teac=\r\nh its real\nnature only by negating everything as =E2=80=98not That=E2=80=99=\r\n.\n\nThe Vedantas never try to give a positive description. Even those senten=\r\nces\nthat seem to give such a description are interpreted as distinguishing =\r\nit\nfrom things that can be visualised or thought of.\n\nThat unthinkable one =\r\nis for that reason infinite, unlimited.\n\n525 Whatever is describable in wor=\r\nds or thinkable by the mind is, for that\nreason alone, finite. Because the =\r\nreal Self is beyond the reach of the mind\nand the intellect, those who are =\r\nestablished in the Self call it =E2=80=98the\ninfinite=E2=80=99.\n\nOnly the i=\r\nnfinite is blissful, not the finite, says the Chandogya Upanishad.\n\n526 Wha=\r\ntever is said concerning the supreme reality by the sages or by\nVedanta has=\r\n for its purpose only the removal of the mistaken notions of the\ndisciple.\n=\r\nNo positive statements can be made. The ultimate teaching is by silence.\n\n5=\r\n27 Just as Sita indicated Rama by negating all the other princes, so the\nVe=\r\ndantas indicate the truth of the Self by negating all else [that could be\nm=\r\nistakenly believed to be the Self].\n\n528 Since the Self, shining alone as t=\r\nhe sole existing reality, can neither\nbe known nor taught, the teachings of=\r\n the Guru do nothing for the aspirant\nexcept free him of his ignorance.\n\nIg=\r\nnorance causes him to identify something as the Self, which is not That.\n\nS=\r\nince the Self shines by its own consciousness-light, there is no need to do=\r\n\nanything more. In the egoless state, the real Self cannot be mistaken,\nbec=\r\nause there it survives alone.\n\nThe darkness (ignorance) that conceals the S=\r\nelf is just the visible and\ntangible world seen by the outward-going mind, =\r\nas is shown next.\n\n529 Since the Self, consciousness itself, is concealed b=\r\ny the darkness,\nwhich consists of worldly knowledge, the teachings of the G=\r\nuru bless the\naspirant by removing that ignorant knowledge.\n\n530 To create =\r\nan empty space in a room one only has to remove the\nencumbering, unwanted l=\r\number. In the same way, to realise the Self nothing\nmore is needed than the=\r\n removal of false knowledge.\n\nNothing more need be done when the false noti=\r\non of a serpent is removed. The\nreal rope reveals itself. So too, when the =\r\nveiling, false knowledge is\nremoved, the Self shines by its own light of co=\r\nnsciousness.\n\nAnother simile, given by Bhagavan, is given here.\n\n531 How ca=\r\nn the Self be something to be obtained? From the point of view of\ntruth, it=\r\n was never lost.The gaining of the Self that is spoken of is only\nthe death=\r\n of the ego, the appearance of which makes the Self as good as\nlost.\n\nIt is=\r\n also said by Bhagavan that the truth is rightly taught only by\nsilence. Th=\r\nis is explained next.\n\n532 Speech is fourfold, as transcendent, seeing, med=\r\nium and articulate\nspeech.That transcendent speech is only silence. And tha=\r\nt silence is itself\nthe true nature of the supreme reality.\n\n533 The articu=\r\nlate form of speech was born of the medium speech; its mother\nis the seeing=\r\n speech; that its mother is the transcendent speech, is well\nknown. That sa=\r\nme supreme speech is silence, the form of the supreme\nconsciousness.\n\nSo, t=\r\nhe grossest form of speech, being the great-grand daughter of the\nsilence, =\r\ncannot reach the real Self.\n\nAgain, how does speech arise? There is abstrac=\r\nt knowledge, whence arises the\nego, which in turn gives rise to thought, an=\r\nd thought to the spoken word. So\nthe word is the great grandson of the orig=\r\ninal source. If the word can\nproduce effect, judge for yourself how much mo=\r\nre powerful must be the\npreaching through silence!\n\n534 True speech is only=\r\n the silence of the sage, who is the eternal dweller\nin the transcendental =\r\nstate. How can gross speech, born of the belief in\ndifferences, speak of th=\r\ne supreme one, in which differences are lost?\n\n535 Therefore the most ancie=\r\nnt Guru [Dakshinamurti] taught the truth of the\nSelf by silence. And by ach=\r\nieving silence of speech and mind, those ancient\ndisciples became aware of =\r\nthat truth.\n\nHere the reference is to the incarnation of God as Dakshinamur=\r\nti, the God of\nright awareness, dwelling in that state of awareness. The di=\r\nsciples, Sanaka,\nSanandana, Sanatana and Sanatkumara attained the supreme s=\r\ntate by being\nsilent, just like their Guru.\n\n536 Well-qualified disciples b=\r\necame themselves sages through the silent\nteaching of their Guru. Teaching =\r\nby words does not work in imparting true\nknowledge of the real Self.\n\nThe g=\r\nreatness of the Guru=E2=80=99s silence is next indicated.\n\nSource: http://w=\r\nww.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=\r\n=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--002354332c6e89af1804a1666555\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;512 Bhagavan Vasishta has said:=\r\n =E2=80=98If one separates the body [from oneself] and remains at rest in o=\r\nne=E2=80=99s own Self, which is consciousness, then one=E2=80=99s ego-sense=\r\n perishes.=E2=80=99 That is, he attains the egoless state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nWhat happens when the quest is thus persisted in long enough?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;513 Th=\r\ne mind, seeking the Self, gets captured by some mysterious inner power and =\r\ndives into the Heart.

That same supreme s=\r\npeech is silence, the form of the supreme consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;So, the g=\r\nrossest form of speech, being the great-grand daughter of the silence, cann=\r\not reach the real Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again,=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;=\r\n&gt;how does speech arise? There is abstract knowledge, whence arises the ego,=\r\n which in turn gives rise to thought, and thought to the spoken word. So th=\r\ne word is the great grandson of the original source. If the word can produc=\r\ne effect, judge for yourself how much more powerful must be the preaching t=\r\nhrough silence!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;534 True speech is only the silence of the =\r\nsage, who is the eternal dweller in the transcendental state. How can gross=\r\n speech, born of the belief in differences, speak of the supreme one, in wh=\r\nich differences are lost?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;535 Therefore the most ancient Guru [Dak=\r\nshinamurti] taught the truth of the Self by silence. And by achieving silen=\r\nce of speech and mind, those ancient disciples became aware of that truth.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here the reference is to the incarnation of God as Dakshinamurti, th=\r\ne God of right awareness, dwelling in that state of awareness. The disciple=\r\ns, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanatkumara attained the supreme state b=\r\ny being silent, just like their Guru.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;536 Well-qualified disciples=\r\n became themselves sages through the silent teaching of their Guru. Teachin=\r\ng by words does not work in imparting true knowledge of the real Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;The greatness of the Guru=E2=80=99s silence is next indicated.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.david=\r\ngodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman=\r\n.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;marg=\r\nin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;ma=\r\nrgin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=\r\n=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--002354332c6e89af1804a1666555--\r\n\n"}}
