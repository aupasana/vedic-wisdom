Thanks for the nice quote from Ramakrishna.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though i=\r\nndividual will (or free will) is non-existent from the perspective of a rea=\r\nlized soul, it does exist for one who has an individual self-awareness (I-n=\r\ness) that is limited to a body. One can do whatever one wants - good and ba=\r\nd - and declare at the end like a great philosopher, &quot;god did it through me=\r\n&quot;. But, the fact is that god did it through him, through his individual I-n=\r\ness. The fruits of the action will be reaped by his individual I-ness in fu=\r\nture. If the fruits are very unpleasant, one may feel great pain. One will =\r\nnot then think &quot;god is doing things through me and god is experiencing this=\r\n pain through me&quot;. Instead, one will cry out loud, &quot;I am in pain&quot;! Until on=\r\ne severs individual I-ness completely, there is no point in rhetorical decl=\r\narations of god doing everything.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have seen some Indian movies in w=\r\nhich the villain quotes Bhagavad Gita and declares &quot;I am not the doer. Kris=\r\nhna is the doer. He is doing this through me&quot; and then goes on to do evil a=\r\ncts. That is not the correct attitude. If everyone entertains that attitude=\r\n and does whatever one wants, there will be more sin in the world as Ramakr=\r\nishna correctly said below.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As long as one has invidiaul I-ness, one =\r\nwill continue to be held responsible for actions committed by that I-ness a=\r\nnd reap the good and bad fruits (and be born many times if needed).

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But my questio=\r\nn is because I cannot reconcile this with freewill.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Both cannot be co=\r\nrrect. It is either this or that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Both are correct, but at differe=\r\nnt levels. I will elaborate. However, this is philosophically complex and t=\r\nhose who do not follow what I say should not worry at all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Non-dual self has no division of self into various ob=\r\njects or space or time. There is no concept of time or space or space-time =\r\ncontinuum within non-dual self. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sen=\r\nse of space or time or objectification.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Supreme cosmic being is th=\r\ne link between duality and non-duality. Supreme cosmic being arising in thi=\r\ns non-dual self captures the entire field of duality within Him. All beings=\r\n, entire space and all space-time continua within the field of duality exis=\r\nt within Him. From the perspective of supreme cosmic being, all beings of t=\r\nhe dual world are His parts and all their individual wills are parts of His=\r\n cosmic will. As all space-time continua are within Him, there is nothing t=\r\nhat is unknown to Him. Past, present and future; here, there and everywhere=\r\n; I, you and others, this possibility, that possibility and yet another pos=\r\nsibility - all are accessible and fully &quot;known&quot; to His self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Now, let us come lower and into the field of duality. The field of dua=\r\nlity consists of infinite divisions of space, time and space-time continua.=\r\n There are infinite possibilities within this field.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Normally, peo=\r\nple stuck deeply within duality have a linear sense of time and perceive ju=\r\nst a part of one space-time continuum. However, field of duality also conta=\r\nins planes of consciousness where different senses of time and different sp=\r\nace-time continua (that may intersect at various points) exist. A yogi who =\r\nexperiences such a space-time continuum in such a plane of consciousness ma=\r\ny experience a point of time that maps to a future time in a regular space-=\r\ntime continuum being experienced by you. Also, what is 1 minute in one spac=\r\ne-time continuum may be 1 year in another space-time continuum. Time is not=\r\n as straight-forward an entity as one may think. Basically, the field of du=\r\nality contains infinite space-time continua and what one experiences depend=\r\ns on the plane of consciousness that one&#39;s self-awareness (Kundalini) is in=\r\n. But, most of us experience part of a specific space-time continuum and he=\r\nnce think that that is the only reality. But relaity consists of infinite s=\r\npace-time continua that intersect each other. These are all different possi=\r\nbilities and you chart out your course based on your actions and Nature&#39;s r=\r\neactions to your actions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From the pe=\r\nrspective of a yogi who is in a different space-time continuum, your state =\r\nmay be known at a time that is in &quot;future&quot; as per the space-time continuum =\r\nin which you exist. But, from the perspective of the space-time continuum t=\r\nhat you are in, your state at that future time is not yet known and depends=\r\n on your current action.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If a yogi in a different space-time conti=\r\nnuum has seen your state in future, his observation is merely an observatio=\r\nn and from his reference frame. It has no causal relationship to your curre=\r\nnt action or your future state. He is merely an observer and he does not ca=\r\nuse anything to happen. His observation is specific to some space-time pair=\r\ns and does not cover all the space-time pairs that you will traverse as you=\r\n travel to reach the space-time pair where he observed you (if at all you d=\r\no!).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let us go further. Is there only=\r\n one future possible for you? Or, does the path traversed by you in space-t=\r\nime continuum not fixed but variable based on your actions? Can your action=\r\ns at important cross-roads alter the course you traverse?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If so, w=\r\nhat is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time pair? Is his obs=\r\nervation only a possibility or a certainty? One may say &quot;how can one observ=\r\ne a possibility? Anything we observe must be a certainty.&quot; But is that corr=\r\nect? Aren&#39;t the field of duality and the infinite space-time continua conta=\r\nined in it merely a set of infinite possibilities?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some great rish=\r\nis can see not just a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at the =\r\nsame time, i.e. they can see various possibilities based on various possibl=\r\ne actions. However, visions seen by most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just one =\r\npossibility.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: At the level=\r\n at which we exist, there is certainly something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within =\r\nthe limits imposed by the reactions given by nature to your own previous ac=\r\ntions, you do have a scope for engaging in different actions at this time. =\r\nDepending on which action you engage in, the future can be slightly differe=\r\nnt. Some actions can even make the future significantly different. A rishi =\r\nmay be able to chart out a significant portion of the field of possibilitie=\r\ns for future (e.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out most possibil=\r\nities upto 20 moves from now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a few po=\r\nssibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a few mo=\r\nves or guessing a future position). But the supreme cosmic being knows the =\r\nentire field of possibilities, as they all exist within Him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Howev=\r\ner, your actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of =\r\nyour consciousness!) some of those possibilities. One may know all the poss=\r\nibilities quite deeply and even guess the possibility that will come to fru=\r\nition, but it is your actions that actually make some of those possibilitie=\r\ns a reality.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt;   To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Namaste Narasimh=\r\naji\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us,=\r\n however, I could not help it that an inevitable question popped up in my m=\r\nind. One of the oft discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         If ev=\r\nents have already been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, t=\r\nhey happen in our plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be hum=\r\nbug?

Both cannot be correct.

But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts sa=\r\ny - then such a self correcting option is already negated out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n     Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any choice i=\r\nn the sense that finally everyone will end up merging with the divine.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;         So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         -Regards\n&gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         The upsur=\r\nge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         --- On Tue=\r\n, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           From: Narasim=\r\nha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;           Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future,=\r\n bestest homam, purity and overcoming ego\n&gt; &gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;           Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;           Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           I mentioned an episode of a smal=\r\nl boy who did a very short Chandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations a=\r\nbove the fire in the following mail:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           http://groups. yaho=\r\no.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           This boy was bor=\r\nn and brought up in US and is not proficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. =\r\nHe did not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what =\r\nhe saw and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms=\r\n he saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dust=\r\ny road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           =\r\n* * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smilin=\r\ng. But, when I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious tho=\r\nught. This was abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that th=\r\ne future that is to come has not already happened. It has already happened =\r\nin reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. You know what I m=\r\nean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, =\r\n&quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to sa=\r\ny what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or ar=\r\nticulate. His main characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, =\r\nsweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. B=\r\nut he could not express himself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           I helped him, &quot;do you m=\r\nean to say that future has already happened at some level, but will reveal =\r\nitself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot an=\r\nd become ready in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. But peopl=\r\ne seeing it on the screen later will think it is happening in front of them=\r\n. Are you saying something like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           He exclaimed, &quot;ex=\r\nactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to happen in future,=\r\n it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be able to see it befor=\r\ne future comes, because it has already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Though=\r\n he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along these lines. When =\r\nI told him the man riding the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki a=\r\nnd he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given his age and ability =\r\nto think and understand things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him =\r\nthat he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he was trying to think=\r\n how it was possible and came to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in=\r\n his own way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Time seems linear at the level of regular =\r\nconsciousness. However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of ti=\r\nme becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when one is established in no=\r\nn-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n   The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama =\r\nmantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were =\r\nmeditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It=\r\n was quite different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy m=\r\nade my mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely e=\r\nxpressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time =\r\nto leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           I had experienc=\r\ned the same kind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experienced th=\r\ne same energy when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was =\r\ndoing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opp=\r\nortunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing wi=\r\nthin 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshi=\r\npped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all th=\r\ne three occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;           Interestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, th=\r\nat boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, this is the =\r\nbestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but =\r\nit just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n      This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than =\r\nwhat I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a po=\r\nwerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is the=\r\n most important thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Rituals help purify one and purit=\r\ny helps one do a ritual better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chi=\r\ncken problem and one has to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;           Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay att=\r\nention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The only wor=\r\nthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your ego be=\r\ncomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to external things=\r\n better and you can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc b=\r\netter. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and t=\r\nhis is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all problems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           * * *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challeng=\r\ning, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - includi=\r\nng your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s p=\r\nroperty and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these properties o=\r\nf god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion &quot;this i=\r\ns mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of his master&#39;s properties=\r\n, but without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;           Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for=\r\n taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best =\r\ncare of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does=\r\n not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is master&#39;s=\r\n property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best jo=\r\nb with what one possesses and not worry about what one does not possess or =\r\nwhat is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           Developing the attitude of=\r\n a servant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the oce=\r\nan of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       =\r\n    Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;           Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;           ------------ ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;           Do a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt;           Do Pitri T=\r\narpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt;           Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt;           Fre=\r\ne Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt;          =\r\n Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n     Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n         ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
