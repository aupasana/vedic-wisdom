In the morning when i saw your messag=\r\ne, first thing came to my mind is that How much influence Sain baba or Kabi=\r\nr has on Muslims today? Immediately Shirdi temple and long queue came to my=\r\n imagination and can we find any Muslims there?\n\nThe fact remains that be i=\r\nt Sain Baba or Kabir or another saint, unifying effect is only on Hindus an=\r\nd their followers today are also only those.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;It was heartening to me wh=\r\nen I saw it. I saw a ray of hope&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nHonestly, I am not very excited with t=\r\nhis.\n\nThe Fundamental reasons which Rajarshi has mentioned are true. and th=\r\nose are the very reasons which prevents even the broad minded Islamic indiv=\r\nidual to succumb finally.\n\nIn my opinion, it requires a radical force from =\r\nwithin the followers of Islam itself which can change their outlook for goo=\r\nd.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarsh=\r\ni nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I r=\r\nead the other mail.

Wajid Ali Sh=\r\nah - the nawab of Oudh was one such person. Vimalananda says he was a Kinna=\r\nra who had incarnated on this plane. Quite possible. He used to go mad for =\r\nlove of Krishna and keep playing teh dance of Gopis for Krishna. Although h=\r\ne used to do his five times=C3=82 Namaz as well. There were other such Sufi=\r\ns too I have heard who were devoted to Krishna.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; That is wha=\r\nt Dr. Zakir highlighted. You say tree is God, men are God, hills are God, S=\r\nun, moon and everything is God while We say that everything is of Allah (Go=\r\nd).\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Trust Dr Naik when he is speaking on the Koran. Do not =\r\ntrust him when he speaks on anything else. He does know his Koran well.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Look at this logically. Islam considers Muhammed to be Insan-e=\r\n-Kamil, the perfected man. If that perfected man could not have a directed =\r\ncommunion with Allah ever, and needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic=\r\n) as in intermediary,=C3=82 why should any=C3=82 other muslim ever have a d=\r\nirect connection with Allah? Therefore Islam forbids this idea.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; There is one idea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Actually as far as I know - I maybe wrong - Shaitan was an=\r\n Angel, fallen by ego. The entities which live by fire as per Islam are cal=\r\nled the Jinns. They are another class who mostly dwell in the smoke that co=\r\nmes from fire. They supposedly carry information from earth to the heavens =\r\nand use fire as a tool for the same.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Often muslim tantriks =\r\nand Islamic occult practitioner use Jinns for different purposes. I don&#39;t k=\r\nnow what is the exact correspondence to Hindu terminologies for the entity =\r\ncalled Jinn, but I know people who do actually use Jinns and work out so ca=\r\nlled miracles. Maybe they are something like spirits or beings of some astr=\r\nal plane. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; However, one who does Homa need for a=C3=82 deit=\r\ny need not worry about these in the least. When a deity like Mahaganapati o=\r\nr Chandika in present, nothing else will dare interfere.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Bu=\r\nt the real reason why most muslims have an issue with fire is because in on=\r\ne Hadith it is mentioned prophet Muhammed disliked fire because it reminded=\r\n him of Hellfire. Fire to them is a symbol of the final times where the sin=\r\nners and the kufrs will be thrown by Allah into a huge fire.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; sadly in the view of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree =\r\napart in different directions or actually they try to make it such that the=\r\ny never meet.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Hmm, I would beg to disagree. In my reading o=\r\nf Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies and use half truths =\r\nwhen it comes to other religion. For Islam he quotes correctly and wholesom=\r\nely. The difference between Islam and non Islamic ideology - specially Hind=\r\nus/Buddism/ Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C3=82 An explanation for this m=\r\naybe digressing and long.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; But generally, if I were born in =\r\na muslim family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths day in and day=\r\n out and trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muhammed as the p=\r\nerfected man, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I would conside=\r\nr Zakir Naik to be 100 % correct. The differences are so fundamental that u=\r\nnless one is ready to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, there cannot be=\r\n a reconciliation.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Remember, Aurnagzeb started memorizing t=\r\nhe koran for 9 years.

I am speaking from personal interaction. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; At some point I used to get very angry with muslims. Now I don=\r\n&#39;t.

The creator is always seperate from the creation.=\r\nPeriod. Anything else is Kufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muh=\r\nammed and the Koran, my interpretation is that all that was an attempt at d=\r\nisguising Kufr with an Islamic garb. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The=\r\n person who changed the life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=C3=82 Sha=\r\nms-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular legend which says Shams was so=\r\n powerful that he couild raise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with =\r\nhim and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went to a dead body and said, &quot;In t=\r\nhe name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happened. He tried a few times and=\r\n yet nothing happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead=\r\n body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally you =\r\ncannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah as per true Islam - and exec=\r\nuted him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who =\r\nwas executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Truth.=\r\n This statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional Islam. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaal=\r\nis in India. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lor=\r\nd Shiva for a son before Shivaji was born.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Generally, e=\r\nxcept for the famous=C3=82 Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect =\r\nfor most Sufis saint. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though Sufis always showed a dif=\r\nferent more subjective interpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim =\r\nscholars were never fooled. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic=\r\n. Even today. And I do not blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and t=\r\nhe hadiths with tell you in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedan=\r\nta or any sort of God communion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress i=\r\nnto my views of what ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic i=\r\nf a true, traditional and authentic version of Islam is to be followed.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famous in modern day cities wher=\r\ne we find the fashionably spiritual higher middle class. But like most thin=\r\ngs under the sun, they hardly know anything about anything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n --- On Thu, 19/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Re: Poetry of Bulle Shah - Sufi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 19 November, 2009, 5:21 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Some years back t=\r\nhis specific poem of Baba Bulle Shah - a sufi &gt;mystic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can you =\r\nprovid me knowledge of this Sufi sect. is it one of the branch from Islam?.=\r\n I&#39;ve come across some articles in the past which indicates that some of th=\r\ne Sufi saints were even Krishna Bhakta and have sang songs for praising Kri=\r\nshna in their sufi style.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi1=\r\n4@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83,=C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSome years back this specific poem of Baba Bulle Shah - a sufi mystic - was=\r\n made into a very popular song in India.
