In particular, deceased beings lost on earth with deep desires can be problematic. Though spooky things as shown in movies like a spirit moving physical objects are very difficult (a lowly being without gross body interacting with the gross bodies of others and affecting a change in them is difficult), it is certainly possible for them to affect one&#39;s subtle mind.\n \n*        *        *\n \nYes, several mantras of several deities come with their own keelana mantras.\n \nHowever, the power is not in a mantra alone. One&#39;s sadhana enables a mantra. If a mantra is like a sword, sadhana with it is like sharpening the blunt sword. So one needs to spend years sharpening the sword (doing sadhana), before it becomes useful. Of course, if you receive a sword already sharpened by someone (i.e. one with a lot of sadhana with a mantra taught it to you directly), it can be useful right away. However, do not expect anyone to hand out a sharp sword to you in today&#39;s times.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf one is doing homam, it is unlikely that any spirits mess around. In fact, fire will slowly remove other influences on one&#39;s subtle consciousness and fill it with its own influence. Fire is too mighty. Thus, I suggest not worrying about keelana when doing homam outdoors.\n \nWhen and if you just *meditate* outdoors (i.e. no homam), especially in a smashaana (cemetary), then you should consider keelana. However, like I said, there is no point in mugging up a mantra and repeating it. Think of whatever mantra or deity you have an affinity to.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; saying * Jai Manish *  helps me to face any critical situations\n \nIf thinking of a person helps one, one may do so. One can think of specific deities, gurus, rishis, saints and yogis. But, it is possible that your rinas may enable you to extract some protection from that person, while someone else may not be able to do the same.\n \n*        *        *\n \nManish explicitly told me long back that we should steer clear of aggrandizing personalities (even if it is correct!) and stick to sadhana. Instead of creating awe regarding personalities, our goal is to enable more and more people to do homam. Just today, Manish wrote in response to someone who sent us a mail about some developments related to Chandi homam in his city: &quot;Divine Mother showed me the numbers of ordinary people who will be worshipping fire in the future. It is in millions at the very least. I was honoured that She chose me, a complete fool to start this. This is not my or Narasimha&#39;s doing, it is simply Her will that all of us are reborn again to do Her bidding. She is the Universe, origin and dissolution, I marvel everyday at how She controls it all without any effort.&quot;\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &quot;sayantan.bose&quot; &lt;sayantan.bose@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Pranam Narsimha ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; if someone is doing a Maha Ganapati Homam in the natural setting like in outdoors or some temples do we need to do Kilana? if not then when is the requirement to do Kilana before doing the homam?\n&gt; Do we have different mantras for Kilanas for different deities?\n&gt; \n&gt; Although speaking from practical experiences and not just out of emotions ... at anytime just chanting or even praying : saying * Jai Manish *  helps me to face any critical situations which i come across almost daily .. yet i am eager to know in details about Kilana !\n&gt; \n&gt; regards, \n&gt; \n&gt; Sayantan\n&gt; \n&gt; Jai Shree Ram...\n\n\n"}}
