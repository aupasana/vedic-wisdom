No sense in accumulating new karmas whi=\r\nle trying to demolish the existing ones. I fully agree that one should avoi=\r\nd becoming complacent- life is indeed short and uncertain. I guess the conc=\r\nlusion is to do as intense a sadhana as possible every day. Or if one belie=\r\nves that God does everything through one- including sadhana- then one can p=\r\nray to God &quot;let the sadhana be of the intensity and nature that is pleasing=\r\n to You.&quot; Sadhana is likely to flow better if one thinks God is ultimately =\r\ndoing it through me (though it feels like &#39;I&#39; am doing it). I have to try a=\r\ns hard as I can but it helps to remember I&#39;m not really in charge. To devel=\r\nop this feeling I think it helps to remind oneself that this body through w=\r\nhich we do things runs on a heart, lungs, brain and other vital organs that=\r\n we are clearly not voluntarily controlling. Clearly Nature/God has set the=\r\nse in motion. And similarly one can infer that He also keeps the mind and &#39;=\r\nI&#39; sense going. (Am in the middle of a second night shift so apologies for =\r\nany rambling- am a bit short of sleep this week). Your point makes a lot of=\r\n sense - couldn&#39;t agree more.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nAparna\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, sandhyopasaka &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for me to do it in four years,\n&gt; &gt; but mayb=\r\ne in 60 years\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Each of us came into the world, with our present body=\r\n, with a baggage of\n&gt; various mental tendencies (many of which are &quot;negativ=\r\ne&quot;). Then, from\n&gt; childhood until the present time, we added to that baggag=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, we want to do two things -- (i) make sure that we aren&#39;t adding=\r\n to the\n&gt; existing mountain of previous karma, and (ii) slowly burn off the=\r\n mountain\n&gt; of karma.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are not adding to the existing mountain d=\r\nay-by-day, and you have the\n&gt; same mental focus, you may get the same resul=\r\nts by doing the japa over a\n&gt; longer time span. However, if you are not eve=\r\nn able to burn off the current\n&gt; day&#39;s baggage through sadhana, doing a sma=\r\nll amount of japa over a long\n&gt; period of time may not help.\n&gt; \n&gt; You defin=\r\nitely have the right spirit ... modify the sadhana to be practical\n&gt; for yo=\r\nu, and do the best that you can. However, we have to be careful not\n&gt; to be=\r\n complacent. Our life spans are short, and we are all experts at\n&gt; accumula=\r\nting new karmas at alarming rates.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a result of intense sadhanas ove=\r\nr shorter time spans, we might be able\n&gt; to stop the day-by-day accumulatio=\r\nn of karmas that we normally engage in.\n&gt; That is when the sadhana has a ch=\r\nance to be effective.\n&gt; \n&gt; sasneham,\n&gt; \n&gt;     ajit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Jul 1=\r\n5, 2013 at 11:52 AM, sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sivananda=\r\n on Japa:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If you do Japa of a Mantra 13 crores of times you will h=\r\nave Darshan of\n&gt; &gt; your Ishta Devata in physical form.
