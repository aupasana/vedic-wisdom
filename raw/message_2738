My comments on that is:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. I-ness deriv=\r\ned from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other =\r\nidea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; Reason:\n&gt; Soul is the only Truth and control=\r\nler, everything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 =\r\nideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. A n=\r\new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-cons=\r\nciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from =\r\nManas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating fa=\r\nculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - =\r\nas you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own se=\r\nnse of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,=\r\n\n&gt; Nitish\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pv=\r\nr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of indi=\r\nvidualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am tha=\r\nt&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course no=\r\nt! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel of=\r\nfended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may fee=\r\nl elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or pra=\r\nise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name=\r\n is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed t=\r\no patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still =\r\nthink &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these =\r\nexamples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totall=\r\ny about the physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as =\r\n&quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;se=\r\ne&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happeni=\r\nng to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, th=\r\nere is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara =\r\nor I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to =\r\nphysical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond=\r\n the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do not =\r\nhave ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incorrec=\r\nt. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is wh=\r\nat I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everything he doe=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do=\r\n interact with each other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of th=\r\nose interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating =\r\nmind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor =\r\nmind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (orga=\r\nns of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what t=\r\no write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totall=\r\ny out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the log=\r\nical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts=\r\n of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while intera=\r\ncting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions may be =\r\ndeemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, thoug=\r\nh my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Your understandi=\r\nng is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara natu=\r\nrally belong to the ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcom=\r\ne only in the physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings =\r\n(those without a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of=\r\n Ahamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddh=\r\ni also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense of=\r\n I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;=\r\ns individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up =\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed =\r\nto the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of =\r\nAhamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality=\r\n of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it ha=\r\ns already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamk=\r\nara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of =\r\nAhamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for=\r\n neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of ano=\r\nther, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi=\r\n would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 f=\r\nunctions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas o=\r\nf causal body are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effe=\r\nct to each other. Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense=\r\n of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-=\r\nideas, their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;deri=\r\nved&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those=\r\n with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, be=\r\ncause they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But=\r\n ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individuali=\r\nzed consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings can=\r\nnot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same wa=\r\ny to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the ve=\r\nil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of =\r\nthe entire individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightene=\r\nd) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An Ast=\r\nral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of =\r\nthe entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks=\r\n of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire indivi=\r\ndualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul no=\r\nt derived from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being =\r\nloses astral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work throu=\r\ngh all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh =\r\nresides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getti=\r\nng controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this particul=\r\nar body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physica=\r\nl bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so=\r\n they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense=\r\n-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39;=\r\n physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out=\r\n of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind=\r\n) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (=\r\ncausal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrecte=\r\nd Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Causal bo=\r\ndy is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (C=\r\nhitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Ac=\r\ntion, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 =\r\nchemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body exp=\r\nires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go aw=\r\nay at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the =\r\ncorresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas=\r\n slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for a=\r\nll other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal bo=\r\ndy is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nManas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtl=\r\ne Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be dev=\r\neloped or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha,=\r\n through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store th=\r\ne residual impressions of all the past incarnations. However, being constit=\r\nuted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas=\r\n) those impressions, just like a container containing an inflammable liquid=\r\n doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Vi=\r\nparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is S=\r\natva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (re=\r\nfer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditi=\r\noned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down=\r\n, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuiti=\r\non becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva =\r\nGuna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katma=\r\ntaivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instr=\r\nument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since=\r\n astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, sme=\r\nll, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism =\r\ndoes not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karm=\r\na. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is as=\r\nsociated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness =\r\n, must be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of =\r\na Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings =\r\nwho cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos a=\r\nre permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye =\r\nimplies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In=\r\n Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst a=\r\nfter objects, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects,=\r\n is non-attachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way=\r\n to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the co=\r\nnsciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as=\r\n an astral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yogas=\r\nhchittavrittin irodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of C=\r\nhitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transfe=\r\nrring the consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or =\r\notherwise as a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogrou=\r\nps. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For example, eg=\r\no or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, but e=\r\nxtends to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in the =\r\ncausal body and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta =\r\n(remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts o=\r\nf the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor =\r\nmind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) ana=\r\nlyzes current and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or condi=\r\ntioned mind) stores various observations or retrieves previously stored obs=\r\nervations, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness=\r\n permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scriptures have broken down the individua=\r\nlized consciousness into various groups by functionality, like five koshas,=\r\n three sareeras, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four =\r\nantahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very =\r\nbasis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though t=\r\nhe word jnaana means different things to different people, a jnaana yogi pu=\r\nrsues Self by the path of contemplation and discrimination. When a jnaana y=\r\nogi reaches the final target, all bodies and koshas are merged in cosmos.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Window=\r\ns): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) webs=\r\nite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.ar=\r\nya@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; In my opinion, there are three distinct phases that lead the sould to ris=\r\ne above Ego, Mind and Chitta - corresponding to the three bodies physical (=\r\nSthoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) resp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRising above Ego is Jnana - Merging Physical body in Physical cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral cosmos\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga - Merging Causal body in Causal cosmos\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaA=\r\nrudha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nit=\r\nish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha =\r\nP.V.R.

One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and w=\r\nithout a beginning or an end). One will go on eliminating things that one i=\r\ns aware of as not being Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and=\r\n is perishable. So it is not Self. One introspects like this and, though th=\r\ne process of elimination, finally finds the true Self.
