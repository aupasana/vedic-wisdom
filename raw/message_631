Yes he may have guided many=\r\n\n&gt; spiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique.\n&gt; 2) Did=\r\n he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book\n&gt; about it i=\r\nn many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after that?\n&gt; 3) He did pa=\r\nss away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of giving\n&gt; spirtual talks? =\r\nIt seems unusual.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have also read somewhere that once a person reache=\r\ns a spiritual\n&gt; state, he cannot remain in human body for more than few day=\r\ns, was this\n&gt; the case?\n&gt; \n&gt; May be others who have read this book can shar=\r\ne more light.\n&gt; I do recommend to seekers of spirutuality to read this book=\r\n if one has\n&gt; time, it is available for free to download as a pdf book on h=\r\nis web\nsite.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for the better=\r\nment and\n&gt; upliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown.

I am going back to the period of \n&gt; &gt; 1973/74.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near \n&gt; &gt; Dw=\r\narka.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowa=\r\nnce \n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite=\r\n to Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with =\r\nsome \n&gt; &gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call=\r\n him as Mr. Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee =\r\nof=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him h=\r\ne was always talking \n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day=\r\n. There was a weekly \n&gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He w=\r\nas singing devotional songs created \n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while=\r\n singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngster=\r\ns were attending this weekly \n&gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was =\r\nthen 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to se=\r\nashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only about Tha=\r\nkur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is re=\r\nmembering me. My \n&gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I sh=\r\nall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years=\r\n old son came to call him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that=\r\n there will be a plane \n&gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I =\r\nwas very much impressed about \n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. =\r\nOne day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, \n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go throu=\r\ngh bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but =\r\nbus did not come from Dwarka as was \n&gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This w=\r\nas surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had so=\r\nme super \n&gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I=\r\n was attracted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be di=\r\nsciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I su=\r\nrrendered \n&gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before T=\r\nhakur picture. I prayed \n&gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as=\r\n his follower and bestow his \n&gt; &gt; grace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a =\r\ndiscussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my d=\r\nuty was to start from 7 am I was \n&gt; &gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I to=\r\nld to my wife in the morning that I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev =\r\nas my Gurudev.

I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember =\r\nthat Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to=\r\n test him before accepting him.
