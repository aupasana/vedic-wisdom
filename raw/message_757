That is not a ba=\r\nd thing after all.\n \nIn general, chanting in the mind without sound is bett=\r\ner.\n \nWhen doing a homam, some minimal sound is recommended. Even if there =\r\nis some movement of lips or atleast of the vocal cords, that is enough. Tha=\r\nt is enough to make some vaikhari sound (physical vibration of air). When y=\r\nou rely on an external fire, the physical vibration of air (sound) forms a =\r\nconnection between you and fire. You use that fire then to create powerful =\r\nsubtle vibrations, far more powerful than what you can generate.\n \nWhen doi=\r\nng japam, internal chanting without lips or vocal cords having any movement=\r\n is perfectly acceptable. In fact, it is better that way. When relying on t=\r\nhe internal fire alone, physical vibration of sound is not needed and avoid=\r\ning it can help focus the energy and generate stronger subtle vibrations.\n =\r\n\n*        *        *\n \nYou were earlier asking about skipping some things v=\r\ns doing everything fully, in Chandipath. An interesting experience happened=\r\n in my daily Chandi homam in the very morning after I replied to you. I thi=\r\nnk it was a Chaturdasi morning. I finished the homam and was about to offer=\r\n poornaahuti. There are a few Vedic mantras that I normally read before poo=\r\nrnaahuti. The fire was burning very bright. I closed my eyes, kept the poor=\r\nnaahuti on my head and started to chant the mantras. But suddenly I got thi=\r\ns palpable feeling that the Mother was standing in front of me in the fire =\r\nand asking me to hurry up. It felt very strongly like she was saying &quot;enoug=\r\nh with those mantras. They do not matter now. Just give me the poornaahuti,=\r\n NOW.&quot; I did not think much. I surrendered fully to Her as manifested in my=\r\n mind. It may just be the imagination of a fool, but I surrendered to Her a=\r\ns She existed in my mind at that time. I left the standard mantras and just=\r\n said &quot;om aim hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche vaushat&quot; and offered the dr=\r\ny coconut in fire with eyes closed still. With eyes closed still, I went in=\r\nto meditation immediately. I had a really nice meditation session.\n \nBest r=\r\negards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nD=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sri=\r\nJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ashwin Rawal \n  To: vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, December 13, 2008 9:14 AM\n  Subjec=\r\nt: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Maha Ganapati Homam/Chandi Homam\n\n        Dear Si=\r\nr,\n        In my journey of 60 years, somebody guided me like this with aut=\r\nhority.

The instruction was to spread homam and create a community of sadhakas =\r\nacross the world who worship various deities in fire. It can be any deities=\r\n.\n\n          2. The beauty of Chandi Path is that it instills a great sense=\r\n of discipline in one. Even 13 chapters take a long time, without anyting b=\r\nefore or after.\n\n          Kavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri sooktam, nyasas=\r\n and moola mantra are recommended before, while nyasas, moola mantra and de=\r\nvi sooktam are recommended after.\n\n          However, in my humble opinion,=\r\n nothing is really compulsory. Doing just the 13 chapters everyday can be v=\r\nery powerful after a while. I see nothing wrong in it.\n\n          3. Both a=\r\nre correct and work differently. However, those who try who pronounce the b=\r\neeja mantras as &quot;aing hreeng&quot; invariably misponounce them. The &quot;g&quot; becomes =\r\nexplicit. Ideally, you should start pronouncing as though you are going to =\r\nsay &quot;aing&quot; and abruptly stop just when you are about to say &quot;g&quot;, without sa=\r\nying it. It is not easy to pronounce this correctly.\n\n          Instead of =\r\ntrying &quot;aing hreeng&quot; and messing it up, it is better to just say &quot;aim hreem=\r\n&quot;.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n          Internal purity and lack (or m=\r\ninimization) of individualized ego is the key in any sadhana.

Do not wo=\r\nrry about them.\n\n          Eating an elaborate set of appetizers and desser=\r\nts before and after a meal may be recommended. But one can get indigestion =\r\nfrom it too.

Similarly, read whatever you read with a=\r\n sense of surrender and limited ego.\n\n          Instead of doing everything=\r\n with a lower focus, it is better to just do 13 chapters with a higher focu=\r\ns.\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasimha\n          ------------ ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n          Do a Shor=\r\nt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n          Do Pitri=\r\n Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n          Spir=\r\nituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n          Free Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n          Free Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n          Sri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n          ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n         =\r\n   ----- Original Message ----- \n            From: Ashwin Rawal \n          =\r\n  To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n            Sent: Tuesday, December 0=\r\n9, 2008 6:51 AM\n            Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Maha Ganapati Homam/Cha=\r\nndi Homam\n\n\n                  Dear Narsimhaji\n                  1.Since I h=\r\nave joined this group before some couple of months, some previous mails I h=\r\nave not read.

However, Manish =\r\ndid not reveal that incident to me until much later. All he told me at that=\r\n time was that Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and that I should=\r\n teach a simple procedure to him.\n\n                    I experimented with =\r\nhomam, started doing occasionally and liked it. I started doing a quick pro=\r\ncedure everyday. After doing it daily for a few months, I finally got down =\r\nto the original task - teaching Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual=\r\n for that purpose. In hindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people =\r\nin addition to Narayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and man=\r\ny other people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my min=\r\nd concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan to =\r\nstart doing homam, many people across the world started with him. What a fo=\r\nrtunate soul..\n\n                    * * *\n\n                    It was proba=\r\nbly for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the onset itself what the M=\r\nother asked him to do. My attitude and mental state would&#39;ve been different=\r\n while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve been more egoistic and also hurrie=\r\nd more. Because the only thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my s=\r\nweet time, arrived at the correct balance and also wrote it down without ma=\r\nny pretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I really =\r\nbenefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, it would have h=\r\nad more rajas given my mental state then and I would not have had made the =\r\nsame progress I made, while preparing myself to teach homam to Narayan.\n\n  =\r\n                  Manish told me the full story only when I was better prep=\r\nared to handle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface of=\r\n the manual as asked by him then.\n\n                    * * *\n\n             =\r\n       A good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can =\r\nwreak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.\n\n                   =\r\n One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole day med=\r\nitating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came=\r\n out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told Manish, he =\r\nonly said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I started before sunrise and went on =\r\ntill 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for ba=\r\nth and a small lunch and another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I w=\r\nas basically sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. =\r\nIt was a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the=\r\n day.\n\n                    I noticed on the next day that the previous day =\r\nwas Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very aus=\r\npicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day is 1000 t=\r\nimes more powerful than on other days. Though I had not noticed it before, =\r\nI picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was excited. When I mentioned thi=\r\ns to Manish with excitement a few days later, he said calmly &quot;I knew it ear=\r\nlier itself. But I did not tell you because knowing it would&#39;ve distracted =\r\nyou. You would have been excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya a=\r\nnd that excitement would&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought more rajas=\r\n into the sadhana.&quot;\n\n                    He was absolutely right. As such, =\r\nI was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and =\r\nlimited the mental focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing thi=\r\ns sadhana on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride and excitement=\r\n, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is=\r\n a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent progress, it can s=\r\nuddenly return and pull one down! After hearing Manish&#39;s words, I introspec=\r\nted and found that my ego was still alive and kicking and that he was wise =\r\nnot to feed it with more delicious food!\n\n                    Lucky are tho=\r\nse who have a guru who can succintly tell them what is useful rather than w=\r\nhat sounds good. Lucky are those who have a guru (or someone else) who can =\r\ngo to the heart of their problem and point it out, so that they can weed it=\r\n out through further introspection and weaken it through conscious effort.\n=\r\n\n                    * * *\n\n                    I remember one more similar=\r\n incident. Before the shata chandi homam in early 2006, a priest we respect=\r\n a lot took me to a Siddha (a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at m=\r\ne, he mentioned the name of one of the saptarshis and said that I very clos=\r\ne to him and that I would do some important work in this birth.\n\n          =\r\n          When I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He imm=\r\nediately became serious and said &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more identity?=\r\n Your ego is already strong with the identity of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit s=\r\ncholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the astrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha=\r\n, the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. It will take great effort to overcome those id=\r\nentities and find True Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you=\r\n really need yet another new identity to feed your ego further? See, what h=\r\ne said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for your progress. Yo=\r\nu have to rise above all identities.&quot;\n\n                    How true and wis=\r\ne!\n\n                    * * *\n\n                    Just as a fat and mighty=\r\n dog may win over a lean and weak dog and get all the food given by the mas=\r\nter, ahamkara (ego or the sense of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit of d=\r\netachment and gets all the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain=\r\n the fat dog and feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try t=\r\no restrain ego and increase detachment.\n\n                    Manish has a u=\r\nnique way of looking at things and some simple points he made brought so mu=\r\nch clarity to my thinking and sped up my spiritual evolution in this life. =\r\nEven without giving any specific mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do=\r\n, he lit the lamp of knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light=\r\n were already there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was block=\r\ning the light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick la=\r\nyer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that encloses the la=\r\nmp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may be too caught up to n=\r\notice that dirt ourselves..\n\n                    * * *\n\n                   =\r\n Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one should a=\r\nlso try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on an ongoing basis. There=\r\n is no magic pill. For most people, this does not take just a single moment=\r\n or day or month or year. It CAN take a long time.

Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along with\n         =\r\n           &gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best path for m=\r\nost. \n                    &gt; \n                    &gt; Let me share one inciden=\r\nt, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom I also\n                    &gt; consid=\r\ner my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata Chandi\n            =\r\n        &gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really joking=\r\n!\n                    &gt; When I got back to the US, he called me again and r=\r\neminded me. It then\n                    &gt; occured to me he was really being=\r\n serious. So, I started searching on\n                    &gt; the net and I fo=\r\nund a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I took\n                    &gt;=\r\n it up and performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then\n          =\r\n          &gt; reminded me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was e=\r\nntirely\n                    &gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I could=\r\nn&#39;t distinguish between\n                    &gt; an instruction and sloka :). =\r\nAround this time, Narasimha occasionally\n                    &gt; performed a =\r\nlonger version of the homam and I particpated in it, but\n                  =\r\n  &gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide me, which he\n    =\r\n                &gt; did, but still it did not get through my really dense bra=\r\nins :). I\n                    &gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were su=\r\nch that I never gave up,\n                    &gt; instead I made a sincere pra=\r\nyer to Lord Ganesha, that If he really\n                    &gt; intends that I=\r\n perform the homa, then he should kindly show me the\n                    &gt; =\r\nway. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has decided\n      =\r\n              &gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just =\r\ncouldnt\n                    &gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-head=\r\ned omnipotent for his\n                    &gt; grace.

A servant simply serves the =\r\nmaster. Similarly, all the \n                    &gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your=\r\n other activities are your way to serve your \n                    &gt; &gt; maste=\r\nr.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may=\r\n be very wealthy and have many big checks \n                    &gt; &gt; everyday=\r\n to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail others. \n               =\r\n     &gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank =\r\nand \n                    &gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of d=\r\noing anything in this \n                    &gt; &gt; world and yet god needs huma=\r\nn beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this \n                    &gt; &gt; world. T=\r\nhat is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n                   =\r\n &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. The \n    =\r\n                &gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through various phys=\r\nical persons \n                    &gt; &gt; present on earth.\n                   =\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, =\r\npurify ourselves and try \n                    &gt; &gt; to help others, because t=\r\nhat is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carries \n                    &gt; &gt; maste=\r\nr&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work t=\r\nends to promote ego \n                    &gt; &gt; and we need to guard against i=\r\nt. A servant carrying a million dollar \n                    &gt; &gt; check to th=\r\ne bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n                    &gt; &gt;=\r\n carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely \n       =\r\n             &gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both ar=\r\ne just \n                    &gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry o=\r\nut his agenda. Similarly, \n                    &gt; &gt; one who does what are co=\r\nnsidered great deeds in this world and one \n                    &gt; &gt; who doe=\r\ns what are considered meagre deeds in this world are both \n                =\r\n    &gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \n  =\r\n                  &gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider onesel=\r\nf superior to \n                    &gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are =\r\nconsidered superior by the world, \n                    &gt; &gt; but he/she is ju=\r\nst as foolish as a servant who considers \n                    &gt; &gt; himself/h=\r\nerself superior to another servant carrying something less \n               =\r\n     &gt; &gt; valuable.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; If =\r\nthis attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one&#39;s \n           =\r\n         &gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n=\r\n                    &gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas place one in.

Can a homam\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arrangi=\r\nng red bricks, with sand base be \n                    &gt; &gt; used instead of a=\r\n\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n       =\r\n             &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is=\r\n \n                    &gt; &gt; actually better than doing it in closed space. Bu=\r\nt realize that a \n                    &gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an =\r\numbrella around to protect the fire \n                    &gt; &gt; if it rains wh=\r\nile you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is \n                    &gt; &gt;=\r\n extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks =\r\nand sand \n                    &gt; &gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma k=\r\nunda.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While perfor=\r\nming the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n                    &gt; &gt; should on=\r\ne repeat the\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the au=\r\ndio?\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat me=\r\nntally while listening attentively (not \n                    &gt; &gt; casually).=\r\n Actually, even listening to mantras with all the attention \n              =\r\n      &gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n                    &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thi=\r\nnking of \n                    &gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose =\r\nperson Y is listening to it \n                    &gt; &gt; with focus and thinkin=\r\ng of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \n                    &gt; &gt; may=\r\n do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the \n           =\r\n         &gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. O=\r\nne can \n                    &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be p=\r\nrotected. The key is \n                    &gt; &gt; control over the mind and kee=\r\nping the mind focused on the mantra.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n           =\r\n         &gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between meditation and \n     =\r\n               &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in medit=\r\nation and it \n                    &gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as =\r\nwell in a homam. So making some \n                    &gt; &gt; external sound (ev=\r\nen if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent \n                    &gt; &gt; =\r\nchanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any O=\r\nther \n                    &gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n                    &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n              =\r\n      &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacre=\r\nd thread ceremony) \n                    &gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. B=\r\nachelor or married is irrelevant.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n              =\r\n      &gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \n         =\r\n           &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them=\r\n \n                    &gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only veg=\r\netarian food on the \n                    &gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bath b=\r\nefore homam. Another rule I will \n                    &gt; &gt; recommend is to a=\r\nvoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants=\r\n to do \n                    &gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing =\r\nto take responsibility and \n                    &gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Su=\r\nch a person can think of me or my guru as guru \n                    &gt; &gt; and=\r\n perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the \n        =\r\n            &gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of=\r\n purity \n                    &gt; &gt; through homam and other spiritual practice=\r\ns. Sacred thread or no \n                    &gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa=\r\n or no mantropadesa, it does not matter \n                    &gt; &gt; after a wh=\r\nile, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The \n                 =\r\n   &gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this u=\r\np \n                    &gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of puri=\r\nty.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; As long as one des=\r\nires no specific material benefits (and \n                    &gt; &gt; ready to r=\r\neceive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual \n                  =\r\n  &gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering for \n=\r\n                    &gt; &gt; me.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be \n          =\r\n          &gt; &gt; fine?\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; Fo=\r\nr Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n                  =\r\n  &gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n              =\r\n      &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; Ment=\r\nioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \n                    =\r\n&gt; &gt; trip.\n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; When I went =\r\nto India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n                    &gt; &gt; travele=\r\nd together to several places (on a specific project). We ended \n           =\r\n         &gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we w=\r\nere). \n                    &gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an=\r\n umbrella with me. As \n                    &gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/J=\r\nuly in India, I did not take it \n                    &gt; &gt; seriously. We were=\r\n in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n                    &gt; &gt; roo=\r\nftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish \n          =\r\n          &gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city=\r\n after \n                    &gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n       =\r\n             &gt; &gt; &gt; \n                    &gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did rain a=\r\ns soon as our homas \n                    &gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poo=\r\nrnaahuti, it suddenly started raining \n                    &gt; &gt; with really =\r\nbig drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on \n                   =\r\n &gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two small =\r\n\n                    &gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We hel=\r\nd the cloth cover \n                    &gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in=\r\n the two homa kundas went off and \n                    &gt; &gt; then packed ever=\r\nything and went down.

An interesting expe=\r\nrience happened in my daily Chandi \nhomam in the very morning after I repli=\r\ned to you. I think it was a Chaturdasi \nmorning. I finished the homam and w=\r\nas about to offer poornaahuti. There are a \nfew Vedic mantras that I normal=\r\nly read before poornaahuti. The fire was burning \nvery bright. I closed my =\r\neyes, kept the poornaahuti on my head and started to \nchant the mantras. Bu=\r\nt suddenly I got this palpable feeling that the Mother was \nstanding in fro=\r\nnt of me in the fire and asking me to hurry up. It felt very \nstrongly like=\r\n she was saying &quot;enough with those mantras. They do not matter now. \nJust g=\r\nive me the poornaahuti, NOW.&quot; I did not think much. I surrendered fully to =\r\n\nHer as manifested in my mind. It may just be the imagination of a fool, bu=\r\nt I \nsurrendered to Her as She existed in my mind at that time. I left the =\r\nstandard \nmantras and just said &quot;om aim hreem kleem chaamundaayai vichche v=\r\naushat&quot; and \noffered the dry coconut in fire with eyes closed still. With e=\r\nyes closed still, \nI went into meditation immediately.

However, Manish did not reveal that incident=\r\n to me \n                    until much later. All he told me at that time w=\r\nas that \n                    Narayan really needed to do homam everyday and=\r\n that I should \n                    teach a simple procedure to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;I experimented with \n                    homam, started doing occasionally=\r\n and liked it. I started \n                    doing a quick procedure every=\r\nday. After doing it daily for a \n                    few months, I finally =\r\ngot down to the original task - \n                    teaching Narayan. I ch=\r\nose to write a detailed manual for \n                    that purpose. In hi=\r\nndsight, I made the correct choice, as \n                    many people in =\r\naddition to Narayan are able to do homam \n                    using the man=\r\nual now! I and many other people have benefited \n                    (and w=\r\nill benefit). However, as far as my mind concerned, \n                    al=\r\nl this started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan \n                 =\r\n   to start doing homam, many people across the world started \n            =\r\n        with him. What a fortunate soul..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was \n     =\r\n               probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the \n  =\r\n                  onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude=\r\n \n                    and mental state would&#39;ve been different while workin=\r\ng on \n                    the manual. I would&#39;ve been more egoistic and als=\r\no hurried \n                    more. Because the only thing I was told was =\r\nto teach \n                    Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the=\r\n correct \n                    balance and also wrote it down without many p=\r\nretensions. The \n                    whole effort ended up being more saatt=\r\nwik and I really \n                    benefited from the exercise. If I had=\r\n known the full story, \n                    it would have had more rajas gi=\r\nven my mental state then and \n                    I would not have had made=\r\n the same progress I made, while \n                    preparing myself to t=\r\neach homam to Narayan.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Manish \n                    told me the full =\r\nstory only when I was better prepared to \n                    handle the in=\r\nformation and, of course, I added it to the \n                    preface of=\r\n the manual as asked by him then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * \n                    *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nA good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary \n                    informa=\r\ntion that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember \n                    ano=\r\nther incident.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One day in the spring of the same \n                  =\r\n  year, I decided to spend a whole day meditating with Gayatri \n           =\r\n         mantra during the coming weekend. The inspiration came out \n      =\r\n              of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. When I told \n =\r\n                   Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I start=\r\ned \n                    before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for=\r\n 3-4 \n                    breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath =\r\nand a small \n                    lunch and another 10 min break for another=\r\n bath at dusk, I \n                    was basically sitting in the same pla=\r\nce and meditating with \n                    Gayatri mantra. It was a very g=\r\nood experience. I was in a \n                    very nice state at the end =\r\nof the day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I noticed on \n                    the next day that the =\r\nprevious day was Akshaya Triteeya \n                    (Vaisakha Sukla Trit=\r\neeya). It is considered a very \n                    auspicious day and it i=\r\ns believed that spiritual sadhana on \n                    that day is 1000 =\r\ntimes more powerful than on other days. \n                    Though I had n=\r\not noticed it before, I picked a perfect day \n                    for the s=\r\nadhana. I was excited. When I mentioned this to \n                    Manish=\r\n with excitement a few days later, he said calmly &quot;I \n                    k=\r\nnew it earlier itself. But I did not tell you because \n                    =\r\nknowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been \n                  =\r\n  excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that \n              =\r\n      excitement would&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought \n           =\r\n         more rajas into the sadhana.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He was absolutely \n          =\r\n          right. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a sadhana. The \n     =\r\n               ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus on =\r\n\n                    the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadha=\r\nna on \n                    a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride =\r\nand \n                    excitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saatt=\r\nwik focus \n                    on mantra further. Ego is a very dangerous e=\r\nntity. Even \n                    after one makes excellent progress, it can=\r\n suddenly return \n                    and pull one down! After hearing Mani=\r\nsh&#39;s words, I \n                    introspected and found that my ego was s=\r\ntill alive and \n                    kicking and that he was wise not to fee=\r\nd it with more \n                    delicious food!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lucky are those =\r\nwho have a guru who \n                    can succintly tell them what is us=\r\neful rather than what \n                    sounds good. Lucky are those who=\r\n have a guru (or someone \n                    else) who can go to the heart=\r\n of their problem and point it \n                    out, so that they can w=\r\need it out through further \n                    introspection and weaken it=\r\n through conscious\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
