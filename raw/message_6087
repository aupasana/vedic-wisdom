I really enjoy reading all =\r\nthese. Particularly notable are the inspirational posts from Shri PVR ji as=\r\n usual and personal anectodes from Shri Utpalji and Shri Rajarshiji. After =\r\nreading all these, I feel as to how fortunate I am that I had a formal guru=\r\n from whom I learnt the procedure of doing homam. PVRji made that understan=\r\nding a lot more deeper by discussing various aspects of Shrik and Shruvam s=\r\nometime ago. But I admire the enthusiasm of Shri Rajarshiji for diving into=\r\n homams just by observing a priest doing homams and the persistance of Shri=\r\n Utpal ji for keep on trying to do homams in some way or the other, being e=\r\nven in Middle East! But I would invite discussions on Chatushpatra and Shat=\r\npatra prayogas of Bodhayana for a deeper understanding of the same. I know =\r\nthat Ganapathi, Gayatri homams are generally practised as Chatushpatra with=\r\n Shrik, Shruvam, Ajya Patra and Kalasa, but I am not sure about\n Shatpatra =\r\nprayogas. All I know is Navagraha homa and Sudarshana homa are practised as=\r\n shatpatra prayoga. Is all this applicable to Bodhayana methods and Krishna=\r\n yajurvedam only? What are the practises as prescribed in other schools? Fo=\r\nr instance, I recently watched a North Indian poojari do homam at our local=\r\n temple. He said he is doing havan as per the Rik Vedam procedure. To begin=\r\n with, instead of &quot;Chatvari Shringastrayoh&quot; he chanted &quot;Agnenaya Supatha Ra=\r\naye Asmaan&quot; which we recite at the end thanking Agnideva for co-operating. =\r\nAlso, he did not have the ending &quot;Anvamamstha!&quot; corresponding to &quot;Anumanyas=\r\nwa&quot; mantras. Also, he did not do tarpana or bali or varshoddhara or even th=\r\ne most important &quot;meditation&quot;. Causes doubt to me if he knows any method of=\r\n homa at all! Also, Arya Samaj way of doing havans is another example. I wo=\r\nuld like to know what people think of all these various methods.
