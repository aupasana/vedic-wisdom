It is indeed one of =\r\nthe cornerstones of Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; that a consonant cannot exist by itself an=\r\nd its life is given by the Vowel.\n&gt; &gt; But for whatever reason in Hindi they=\r\n mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry\n&gt; &gt; that habit to other languages a=\r\ns well and recently I heard one of the North\n&gt; &gt; Indian bhajan singers (I d=\r\non&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja\n&gt; &gt; Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govin=\r\ndam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which\n&gt; &gt; sounded quite odd=\r\n to me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj\n&gt; &gt; Bhasha and A=\r\nvadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; more impo=\r\nrtant than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also\n&gt; &gt; with=\r\nout proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\npproach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sa=\r\nroja\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that and not like =\r\n&quot;Sri\n&gt; &gt; Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;. You may shed more light on this aspect as w=\r\nell.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=86&#39;=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC=C3=85=\r\n=C2=A1=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNagraj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/7/11, aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Common Sanskrit Pronunciation Errors\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; (Part 1)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: T=\r\nhursday, April 7, 2011, 11:34 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=C6&#39;=C3=86&#39;=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC=C3=85=C2=A1=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry and jus=\r\nt ignore\n&gt; &gt; this idiot!&quot;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear narasimha guruji\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing a great job to this universe by sharing=\r\n your knwledge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and correcting,but you are tooooo humble!!!.Trut=\r\nh ia truth and what\n&gt; &gt; ever you are saying is also truth .no need to consi=\r\nder yourself as an idiot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

It is the nature of =\r\nKali yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my feeli=\r\nng that many people, including highly learned Vedic\n&gt; &gt; scholars, pronounce=\r\n some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantras)\n&gt; &gt; incorrectly.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, pronunciation is not everything. Hav=\r\ning devotion and\n&gt; &gt; the spirit of surrender to god is even more important.=\r\n However,\n&gt; &gt; pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciat=\r\nion is very\n&gt; &gt; important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda ma=\r\nntra can stop one\n&gt; &gt; from the most complete experience of the mantra. In f=\r\nact, we have a lot of\n&gt; &gt; people who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, =\r\nbut very few who can\n&gt; &gt; actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I will write my views on correct\n&gt; &gt; pr=\r\nonunciation and point out some common errors. If you do not think that\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncorrect pronunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the errors or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please =\r\nignore\n&gt; &gt; my writings on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open =\r\nto changing\n&gt; &gt; your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views=\r\n and adopt my\n&gt; &gt; suggestions if you find them appropriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the en=\r\nd of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc.=\r\n Most priests and scholars pronounce this\n&gt; &gt; sound incorrectly. They chang=\r\ne &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot;\n&gt; &gt; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reas=\r\non why this corruption came into practice, but it\n&gt; &gt; is a corruption never=\r\ntheless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as=\r\n one\n&gt; &gt; letter/syllable/akshara. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot;=\r\n by adding\n&gt; &gt; a vowel sound at the end, it becomes two aksharas. This incr=\r\neases the number\n&gt; &gt; of aksharas, changes the chhandas and changes the mean=\r\ning also. You may\n&gt; &gt; still experience something when meditating on the man=\r\ntra, but you will never\n&gt; &gt; experience the mantra to the fullest with that =\r\npronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowe=\r\nls (swaras) are the praana (life\n&gt; &gt; force) of an akshara. If you have just=\r\n a consonant without a vowel after it,\n&gt; &gt; then it has no praana. It is ksh=\r\nara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For\n&gt; &gt; example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; =\r\nas is (without adding any sounds to it), you\n&gt; &gt; cannot sustain the sound a=\r\nnd the listener cannot decipher what exactly you\n&gt; &gt; pronounced. It has no =\r\nlife force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound =\r\n&quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because\n&gt; &gt; &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply j=\r\noins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has\n&gt; &gt; the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and =\r\nbecomes part of that akshara. In chhandas,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one let=\r\nter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot;\n&gt; &gt; correctly, it is difficult fo=\r\nr the listener to know for sure whether you\n&gt; &gt; said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;y=\r\naan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully,\n&gt; &gt; but otherwise difficult.=\r\n The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt\n&gt; &gt; transient sound without =\r\npraana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes=\r\n people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or\n&gt; &gt; &quot;i&quot; or some oth=\r\ner vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a\n&gt; &gt; praana and=\r\n becomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the\n&gt; &gt; chhand=\r\nas changes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started =\r\npronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot;\n&gt; &gt; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and b=\r\necomes very clear to hear, so that\n&gt; &gt; his students would not get confused =\r\nwhen learning. Probably the students\n&gt; &gt; thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (in=\r\nstead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that\n&gt; &gt; mis-pronunciation. Probably, that=\r\n became a standard practice after a couple\n&gt; &gt; of centuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change i=\r\nt to\n&gt; &gt; &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and l=\r\neave it\n&gt; &gt; there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the end. T=\r\nhe same thing\n&gt; &gt; holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in con=\r\nsonants applies to all\n&gt; &gt; consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more =\r\ncommonly encountered. There\n&gt; &gt; can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc als=\r\no. There also, people normally\n&gt; &gt; add an artificial vowel sound at the end=\r\n and end up changing the chhandas\n&gt; &gt; and altering the flow of energy in th=\r\ne mantra. That is also wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot;=\r\n =3D\n&gt; &gt; story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =\r\n=3D money).\n&gt; &gt; In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha l=\r\nooks very similar\n&gt; &gt; and just one dot in the middle is different. It is po=\r\nssible that some people\n&gt; &gt; started mispronouncing this sound because of th=\r\neir inability to see the dot\n&gt; &gt; and others started following. Now pronounc=\r\ning tha as dha became mainstream\n&gt; &gt; and one pronouncing correctly will be =\r\nthe odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We=\r\n never have two different symbols for\n&gt; &gt; the same sound or two different s=\r\nounds for the same symbol. The letters\n&gt; &gt; &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different an=\r\nd their sounds are different too. Pronounce\n&gt; &gt; &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body =\r\nor &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to\n&gt; &gt; get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;ka=\r\nthaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many p=\r\noojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama\n&gt; &gt; moksha chaturvidha purushaartha si=\r\nddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the\n&gt; &gt; purusharthas (purposes of hu=\r\nman existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties),\n&gt; &gt; artha (work and money), ka=\r\nama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing\n&gt; &gt; detachment)&quot;. Most peop=\r\nle end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as\n&gt; &gt; &quot;dharmaardha kaama =\r\nmoksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; Even &quot;siddhardham=\r\n&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a\n&gt; &gt; human&quot;. Mis-=\r\npronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen\n&gt; &gt; it comm=\r\nitted by many many trained priests!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you re=\r\nad Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention\n&gt; &gt; to the difference=\r\n between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them\n&gt; &gt; differently. When =\r\nyou see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention\n&gt; &gt; to ensure tha=\r\nt you are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes (in my view) commo=\r\nnly made by\n&gt; &gt; most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I wil=\r\nl be pointing\n&gt; &gt; them out slowly in the next few months, whenever the Moth=\r\ner allows me to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please give me your considerat=\r\nion and take my input into\n&gt; &gt; consideration in altering your pronunciation=\r\n (if you are open to that).
