What ails her, she who is aft=\r\ner all so vast and might be so strong? There is surely some enormous defect=\r\n, something vital is wanting in us, nor is it difficult to lay our finger o=\r\nn the spot. We have all things else, but we are empty of strength, void of =\r\nenergy. We have abandoned Shakti and are therefore abandoned by Shakti. The=\r\n Mother is not in our hearts, in our brains, in our arms.\n\nIs it love, enth=\r\nusiasm, Bhakti that is wanting? These are ingrained in the Indian nature, b=\r\nut in the absence of Shakti we cannot concentrate, we cannot direct, we can=\r\nnot even preserve it. Bhakti is the leaping flame, Shakti is the fuel. If t=\r\nhe fuel is scanty how long can the fire endure?...\n\nThe deeper we look, the=\r\n more we shall be convinced that the one thing wanting, which we must striv=\r\ne to acquire before all others, is strength?strength physical, strength men=\r\ntal, strength moral, but above all strength spiritual which is the one inex=\r\nhaustible and imperishable source of all the others. If we have strength ev=\r\nerything else will be added to us easily and naturally. In the absence of s=\r\ntrength we are like men in a dream who have hands but cannot seize or strik=\r\ne, who have feet but cannot run....\n\nWhat is our mother-country? It is not =\r\na piece of earth, nor a figure of speech, nor a fiction of the mind. It is =\r\na mighty Shakti, composed of the Shaktis of all the millions of units that =\r\nmake up the nation, just as Bhawani Mahisha Mardini sprang into being from =\r\nthe Shakti of all the millions of gods assembled in one mass of force and w=\r\nelded into unity. The Shakti we call India, Bhawani Bharati, is the living =\r\nunity of the Shaktis of three hundred million people,[3] but she is inactiv=\r\ne, imprisoned in the magic circle of Tamas, the self-indulgent inertia and =\r\nignorance of her sons....\n\nWe have to create strength where it did not exis=\r\nt before; we have to change our natures, and become new men with new hearts=\r\n, to be born again.... We need a nucleus of men in whom the Shakti is devel=\r\noped to its uttermost extent, in whom it fills every corner of the personal=\r\nity and overflows to fertilise the earth. These, having the fire of Bhawani=\r\n in their hearts and brains, will go forth and carry the flame to every noo=\r\nk and cranny of our land.&quot;\n\n\nBeautiful.\n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
