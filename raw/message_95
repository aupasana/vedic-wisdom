All further modifications in that field of duality to \ncreate various forms is also Shakti only, in Her various aspects.\n\n&gt; Would you say that the &#39;witness&#39;, mind, consciousness\n&gt; or whatever &quot;label&quot; we apply, is the state of nirguna Brahman,\n&gt; Shakti or (at different times) both?\n\nThe ego-mind or consciousness that experiences various objects in the field \nof duality is an aspect of Shakti. However, it is Nirguna Brahman too, just \nas everything else in the field of duality in reality is. So it is both!\n\nWhen the consciousness is in the state of Shakti (or modified Brahman), it \nexperiences various dual objects in the field of duality and is aware of \n&quot;self&quot; also as an object in the same field.\n\nWhen the consciousness is in the state of unmodified nirguna Brahman, it is \nno longer aware of self as an object in the field of duality. It no longer \nexperiences any objects in the field of duality. There is no longer any \nobjectification and it no longer experiences a field of duality at all.\n\nAfter switching between the two states, the consciousness may reach a \ndifferent state. In this state, consciousness is in the state of Shakti and \nunmodified nirguna Brahman at the same time. The consciousness experiences \nvarious objects in the field of duality and interacts with them. Yet, it is \nfirmly rooted in the understanding that all those objects and their field of \nduality are actually modifications of nirguna Brahman only.\n\nThis is a very very tough state to reach. Of course, even the state of \nnirguna Brahman (second state mentioned above) is tough to reach, but the \nthird one is tougher.\n\n*        *        *\n\nRishis do not denounce Maya (&quot;field of duality&quot; which is the basis of all \n&quot;experience&quot;). The very word Maya is translated as &quot;delusion&quot;, which has a \nnegative connotation. In fact, there is no perfect equivalent of that word \nin English.\n\nWhile some may look down upon Maya, a rishi does not dismiss Maya and does \nnot talk about &quot;overcoming&quot; Maya! A rishi talks about realizing that Maya is \njust a modification of nirguna Brahman. A rishi looks to reach the third \nstate I mentioned above. Thus, one can operate in the field of duality \nwithout losing the understanding of the underlying nondual Self. Such a \nperson does not give up action in the field of duality and acts and \ninteracts with the objects of that field (and yet free from reactions to \nthose actions and the bondage caused).\n\nJust as a bird flies with two wings, such a person flies with the dual wings \nof knowledge and action. Neither knowledge is compromised nor action (in the \nfield of duality) is sacrificed.\n\nVasishtha taught the same to Rama in &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;. Krishna taught the \nsame to Arjuna in &quot;BhagavadGita&quot;.\n\nIf &quot;action&quot; is sacrificed or &quot;Maya&quot; is trivialized/denounced and the second \nstate mentioned above is over-emphasized, the order in this dual world will \nbe disturbed. That perhaps happened to some degree in the last couple of \nmillennia.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI realize that this discussion may be difficult to follow for some. After \nall, it is not easy the express the essence of &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; in a few \nemails, though I tried like a fool. Please ignore this email then and \ninstead read Yoga Vaasishtham and Upanishats.\n\nExperience is more important than scholarship or theoretical discussions. \nCertain things are only experienced and not learnt by reading or hearing. \nYoga Vaasishtham is one rare book reading which can actually take a prepared \nperson close to experiencing, but most books are not like that. Thus, \nspiritual sadhana is far more important than typing and reading emails like \nthis. Satsang (good company) and discussions with learned people may help if \none is also doing some sadhana. But sadhana is the key.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, July 11, 2007 10:53 AM\nSubject: [sivacharya] Re: On Adwaitism, Shiva&#39;s Worship and Different Paths\n\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; Many thanks for your clear reply - free\n&gt; of metaphysical speculation and aimed at the\n&gt; heart of the matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am beginning to understand where you stand\n&gt; on this, but on one thing I am still unclear.\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you say that the &#39;witness&#39;, mind, consciousness\n&gt; or whatever &quot;label&quot; we apply, is the state of nirguna Brahman,\n&gt; Shakti or (at different times) both?\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I right in thinking that the contraction of\n&gt; nirguna Brahman is, in fact, Shakti and the further\n&gt; contraction of Shakti is our ego-mind?\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems our &#39;being&#39; is capable of both contracting\n&gt; to an individual ego or expanding through more\n&gt; subtle levels of duality to the infinite.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Kris\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In sivacharya@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Kris,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The Female element represents the Energy (Shakti). The desires, actions\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; knowledge of each being are caused by the movement of life force within\n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; being, which is personified as a Female deity. If there is no energy,\n&gt;&gt; there\n&gt;&gt; is no movement of life force and there is nothing to desire or despise,\n&gt;&gt; nothing to do or avoid and nothing to know or ignore. We just have the\n&gt;&gt; singular non-duality and there is no field of duality then. It is the\n&gt;&gt; Shakti\n&gt;&gt; that gives birth (Mother!) to all desires, actions and knowledge and the\n&gt;&gt; field of apparent duality in which all desires, actions and knowledge\n&gt;&gt; operate.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Shiva is essentially nirguna Brahman, while Shakti is the energy that\n&gt;&gt; causes\n&gt;&gt; a movement in Brahman and gives birth to a field of duality.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; While Brahman (nondual reality) is ONE and only one, the field of duality\n&gt;&gt; has a lot of variety. The field of duality (also known as &quot;maya&quot; or\n&gt;&gt; &quot;delusion&quot;) has scope for different types of desire, action and\n&gt;&gt; knowledge.\n&gt;&gt; The energies that cause different desires, different actions and\n&gt;&gt; different\n&gt;&gt; aspects of knowledge is personified as different female deities.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You can also trace all those energies to the primordial energy that is\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; root of all energies in Brahman. However, at that stage, we are almost\n&gt;&gt; beyond names, gunas and depictions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even within each person, there are different Energies that cause\n&gt;&gt; different\n&gt;&gt; desires, actions and knowledge. But there is one root energy that causes\n&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; distinct identity in that person. All other energies stem from that\n&gt;&gt; energy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is that root energy that creates the entire field of duality in which\n&gt;&gt; THAT person operates. This energy is the cause of the self-awareness or\n&gt;&gt; ego-consciousness in that person. This energy (that causes\n&gt;&gt; ego-consciousness) is also called &quot;Kundalini shakti&quot;. Instead of having\n&gt;&gt; no\n&gt;&gt; concept of self and no objectification and being immersed in the non-dual\n&gt;&gt; Brahman, due to this shakti, one views a part of Brahman as &quot;self&quot; with\n&gt;&gt; certain attributes, certain vasanas (mental conditioning) etc. This\n&gt;&gt; energy\n&gt;&gt; can either &quot;bind&quot; one to a limited concept of self or &quot;liberate&quot; one with\n&gt;&gt; an\n&gt;&gt; infinite concept of self. In most people, it is the former.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One can view this shakti as a microcosmic representation of the Divine\n&gt;&gt; Mother within oneself.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, July 09, 2007 3:48 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [sivacharya] Re: On Adwaitism, Shiva&#39;s Worship and Different\n&gt;&gt; Paths\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In both the paths, one overcomes the simple and finite concept of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I-ness\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with something more infinite.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Well said.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; May I ask another question?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Whilst it seems that Shiva is a given constant his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; partner is depicted in different ways.
