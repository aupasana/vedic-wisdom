Do it with a spirit of humility and devotion and think: &quot;I \ndon&#39;t know the correct way to do it and am doing it to the best of my \nability. Please forgive me for my mistakes and give me a hand to lift me \nup&quot;.\n\nA lot of people are very afraid of a lot of saattwik rituals also these days \nand prefer to call a priest for everything. It is perfectly fine to do a lot \nof saattwik rituals by oneself. The above attitude helps too.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dheena0104&quot; &lt;dheena0104@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, February 26, 2008 11:01 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Sri Chakra pooja-Permissibility\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha P.V.R.
