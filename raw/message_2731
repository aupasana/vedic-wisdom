When earth, water=\r\n, fire, air and finally ether are dissolved, \n&gt; Vasishtha says that cosmic =\r\nspace remains.

What is the basis of your statement within the scope of Jyotish sh=\r\nastra ? Does it deny or approve the existence of the 6th tattwa viz SuperEt=\r\nher ?

It is \n&gt; neither necess=\r\nary not sufficient to focus on ANY chakra for Kundalini to \n&gt; rise. For exa=\r\nmple, a true Kundalini awakening experience was described in \n&gt; the followi=\r\nng mail. That person was not meditating/focusing on ANY chakra \n&gt; and he ac=\r\ntually never thinks in terms of chakras. He just meditated with a \n&gt; Veda m=\r\nantra and focused the mind on the mantra and a deity that he is \n&gt; attached=\r\n to.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Kundalini (Re: Re: Urdhwa-Retas) - message 1476\n&gt; http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1476\n&gt; \n&gt; Irrespective of what one i=\r\ns focusing on, Kundalini goes from Moolaadhaara to \n&gt; Swaadhishthaana to Ma=\r\nnipoora to Anaahata and so on. That order if fixed. \n&gt; Kundalini will leave=\r\n a chakra and go to the next chakra if and only if one&#39;s \n&gt; notion of &quot;I&quot; i=\r\ns free from certain things at that time. Leaving each chakra \n&gt; has differe=\r\nnt requirements and has do with the corresponding element and \n&gt; limitation=\r\ns represented by it. As long as your self-awareness is \n&gt; characterized by =\r\nthe qualities represented by Moolaadhaara , Kundalini \n&gt; cannot advance fro=\r\nm Moolaadhaara.\n&gt; \n&gt; Intense focus on something (e.g. a mantra or a deity) =\r\nmay free one \n&gt; temporarily from the limitations represented by a chakra, e=\r\nnabling Kundalini \n&gt; to leave the chakra. If Kundalini left Moolaadhaara ch=\r\nakra, it does not mean \n&gt; the person was (or should be) meditating on Moola=\r\nadhaara chakra or \n&gt; Swaadhishthaana chakra. THAT is irrelevant. What is re=\r\nlevant instead is \n&gt; whether the person overcame the limitations represente=\r\nd by Moolaadhaara \n&gt; chakra. Same with other chakras.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us go back to the order of elements:\n&gt; \n&gt; Apart from Upanishad=\r\ns, Vasishtha clearly mentions in Yoga Vaasishtham that \n&gt; creation order is=\r\n ether, air, fire, water and earth and dissolution order is \n&gt; the reverse.=\r\n When earth, water, fire, air and finally ether are dissolved, \n&gt; Vasishtha=\r\n says that cosmic space remains. This is the same thing that Nitish \n&gt; was =\r\nquoting as &quot;super ether&quot;, but it is not considered as an &quot;element&quot; by \n&gt; Va=\r\nsishtha. When that too is dissolved, one merges in Brahman. From Brahman \n&gt;=\r\n comes the cosmic space and from it come the five elements.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sahasrara =\r\nchakra represents Brahman. Here there is no ego principle (I-ness \n&gt; or aha=\r\nmkara) and no objectification. Aajnaa chakra represents the cosmic \n&gt; space=\r\n which is accompanied by the concept of Time. The ego principle \n&gt; (I-ness)=\r\n is active here and there is a sense of I, but it is very subtle and \n&gt; has=\r\n not yet expanded. When this ego principle expands, element of ether is \n&gt; =\r\ncreated from it and later air, fire, water and earth are created. Chakras \n=\r\n&gt; from Visuddhi to Moolaadhaara represent ether to earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; The creation=\r\n of five elements from the cosmic space is explained by \n&gt; shastras, but ho=\r\nw Brahman gave rise to cosmic space and Time (where there is \n&gt; objectifica=\r\ntion and I-ness) is mysterious. Cosmic space and Time represent \n&gt; the earl=\r\ny stages of the field of duality, while Brahman represents \n&gt; non-duality. =\r\nThe transition between the two involves several stages that are \n&gt; mysterio=\r\nus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Correspondingly, there are several secretive chakras in between Sa=\r\nhasraara \n&gt; chakra and Aajnaa chakra. They are at the top of the forehead a=\r\nnd at the top \n&gt; of the head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether it makes sense to you or not, so=\r\nme great yogis consider some of \n&gt; those chakras to be better than Sahasraa=\r\nra. In Sahasraara, there is no \n&gt; I-ness, no objects and no experience. In =\r\nthe secretive chakras just under \n&gt; it, there is a very subtle I-ness, ther=\r\ne are objects and very subtle \n&gt; experiences. There is some &quot;rasa&quot; (juice/e=\r\nxperience) to be had by I-ness \n&gt; here.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; I can=\r\nnot recommend any text on Kundalini as definitive. &quot;The Serpent Power: \n&gt; S=\r\nhat chakra Nirupana&quot; by Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodruff - sp?) is \n&gt; consi=\r\ndered a good text, but I honestly did not find it valuable. It is just \n&gt; t=\r\nheoretical. Manish values Vimalananda very highly and asked me to buy \n&gt; &quot;K=\r\nundalini&quot; by Robert Svoboda. He told me, &quot;though not perfect, this is the \n=\r\n&gt; best book you can find these days on the subject. Whether you read it or =\r\n\n&gt; not, buy it so that you can later compare notes with what you experience=\r\n.&quot; \n&gt; Whatever I have learnt experientially so far is quite consistent with=\r\n the \n&gt; simple and lucid ideas represented in that book.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, va=\r\nrious upanishads and works of Shankaracharya will give you a \n&gt; clearer per=\r\nspective on some issues and enhance your internal understanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Shankaracharya said in &quot;bhaja govindam&quot; composition: &quot;O=\r\n fool, pray to \n&gt; Govinda tirelessly. When your time&#39;s up, all this knowled=\r\nge and these \n&gt; technicalities aren&#39;t going to save you.&quot; Moreover, differe=\r\nnt people \n&gt; sometimes think in different terms and misunderstand others. I=\r\nt is like a \n&gt; Pascal language programmer reading C language software, gues=\r\nsing what it \n&gt; means and reporting bugs based on wrong understanding of th=\r\ne language.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is with a sense of discomfort and amusement that I writ=\r\ne about these \n&gt; technical matters these days. I suppose I have to deal wit=\r\nh these \n&gt; technicalities because some important people that I care about a=\r\nre \n&gt; interested in these technicalities at this point of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; If peo=\r\nple just do homam or japam or whatever sadhana they chose and focus \n&gt; all =\r\nof their mental energy on their chosen deity, it will be more useful...\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/t=\r\narpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;vedicas=\r\ntrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nSent: Friday, October 02, 2009 2:24 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Order =\r\nof Creation, Physics & Reality\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What exa=\r\nctly is your proof that effacing of tattwas/chakras must be \n&gt; &gt; pursued in=\r\n serial order? The well known Pt. Gopi Krishna, who only \n&gt; &gt; meditated on =\r\nSahasrara (crown of his head) had the experience appended \n&gt; &gt; below, pleas=\r\ne read if you havent seen it earlier. Also what is your proof \n&gt; &gt; that med=\r\nitating on a chakra effaces it - this is not obvious - why might \n&gt; &gt; it no=\r\nt intensify it while purifying it? Is there any definitive text on \n&gt; &gt; Kun=\r\ndalini (Sat cakra nirupana is just too broad and symbolic for me)..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gopi Krishna:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Over a period of years=\r\n, he developed the ability to sit for a period of \n&gt; &gt; hours in concentrati=\r\non without any discomfort. The following account which \n&gt; &gt; took place in 1=\r\n937 describes his first Kundalini experience which occurred \n&gt; &gt; while he w=\r\nas visualizing &quot;an imaginary Lotus in full bloom, radiating \n&gt; &gt; light&quot; at =\r\nthe crown of his head.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Suddenly, with a roar like that of a wate=\r\nrfall, I felt a stream of \n&gt; &gt; liquid light entering my brain through the s=\r\npinal cord.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Entirely unprepared for such a development, I was co=\r\nmpletely taken by \n&gt; &gt; surprise; but regaining my self-control, keeping my =\r\nmind on the point of \n&gt; &gt; concentration. The illumination grew brighter and=\r\n brighter, the roaring \n&gt; &gt; louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and t=\r\nhen felt myself slipping \n&gt; &gt; out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo =\r\nof light. It is impossible to \n&gt; &gt; describe the experience accurately. I fe=\r\nlt the point of consciousness that \n&gt; &gt; was myself growing wider surrounded=\r\n by waves of light. It grew wider and \n&gt; &gt; wider, spreading outward while t=\r\nhe body, normally the immediate object of \n&gt; &gt; its perception, appeared to =\r\nhave receded into the distance until I became \n&gt; &gt; entirely unconscious of =\r\nit. I was now all consciousness without any \n&gt; &gt; outline, without any idea =\r\nof corporeal appendage, without any feeling or \n&gt; &gt; sensation coming from t=\r\nhe senses, immersed in a sea of light \n&gt; &gt; simultaneously conscious and awa=\r\nre at every point, spread out, as it were, \n&gt; &gt; in all directions without a=\r\nny barrier or material obstruction. I was no \n&gt; &gt; longer myself, or to be m=\r\nore accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a \n&gt; &gt; small point of aware=\r\nness confined to a body, but instead was a vast circle \n&gt; &gt; of consciousnes=\r\ns in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in \n&gt; &gt; a state of=\r\n exultation and happiness impossible to describe.\n&gt; &gt;    Krishna, Pandit Go=\r\npi, Kundalini: Path to Higher Consciousness (New \n&gt; &gt; Delhi: Orient Paperba=\r\ncks, 1992), pps. 6-7 &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhap=\r\ns thinks of a body that looks and feels \n&gt; &gt;&gt; in a particular way physicall=\r\ny. Apart from the physical aspect, one may \n&gt; &gt;&gt; think of &quot;I&quot; as someone wh=\r\no has certain qualities, certain needs, certain \n&gt; &gt;&gt; belongings etc. All t=\r\nhose concepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; self-awareness and=\r\n Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cannot leave Moo=\r\nlaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature \n&gt; &gt;&gt; within one&#39;=\r\ns cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cannot =\r\nleave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or \n&gt; &gt;&gt; *fluid=\r\n* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still \n&gt; &gt;&gt; remai=\r\nning. And so on.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Many people who talk about experiences of Kundal=\r\nini in higher chakras are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; often talking merely about some amount of v=\r\naayus flowing in those chakras \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (which may still be a nice experience)=\r\n and have *not* experienced \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundal=\r\nini really leaves Moolaadhaara, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; one will not perceive a solid body, o=\r\nne will not have notions of owning \n&gt; &gt;&gt; anything. Similarly, as Kundalini =\r\nmoves up each chakra, each element is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; effaced in one&#39;s cumulative ide=\r\na of who one is, at the physical as well \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as the subtle level of exist=\r\nence! To completely efface even one element \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (earth) from one&#39;s notion=\r\n of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; time, is not at all easy=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progresses towar=\r\nds samadhi \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again=\r\n comes down, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; effaced elements return to work in the reverse order - e=\r\nther, air, fire, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; water and earth.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
