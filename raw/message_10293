I tracked most of the a=\r\nstrologers. Almost all were wrong. Many said\nthere is absolutely no chance.=\r\n And among other&#39;s who gave him a chance,\nthey were also sceptical. Bejan D=\r\naruwalla had said there is 54% chance of\nModi as PM. Narasimha ji said 60%.=\r\n These predictions were wrong as 50%\nchance is for even Mulayam, Mayawati o=\r\nr for that matter anyone contesting.\nAnyone saying above 90-95% may be call=\r\ned correct though with the extent of\nfinal victory, those who said 100% sho=\r\nuld be considered correct.\n\n2. I will look for Narasimha Ji&#39;s other predict=\r\nion of political instability\nover next 2 years. It does not look true looki=\r\nng at present victory status\nof BJP/NDA. His statement on AAP&#39;s performance=\r\n in my view is incorrect.\nPunjab&#39;s success (though unexpected a month back)=\r\n is limited and them\nlosing Delhi means spectacular failure. Kejriwal is si=\r\nlent on twitter for\nlast 2 days and to me it shows he is unhappy with perfo=\r\nrmance.\n\n3. Somebody had commented on Exit polls being wrong. On the contra=\r\nry, most\nwere right. Todays Chanakya was right to last digit (291 =C2=B1 14=\r\n\n#*Cong*&lt;https://twitter.com/search?q=3D%23Cong&src=3Dhash&gt;57 =C2=B1 9\n#*ND=\r\nA* &lt;https://twitter.com/search?q=3D%23NDA&src=3Dhash&gt; 340 =C2=B114\n#*UPA*&lt;h=\r\nttps://twitter.com/search?q=3D%23UPA&src=3Dhash&gt;70 =C2=B19 Others 133\n=C2=\r\n=B111 Seats). CVoter got vote percentage right (Just 1%\nvariation), not the=\r\n seat conversion. Even www.5forty3.com had predicted 320\nseats for NDA and =\r\nabsolute majority for BJP. The only reason other polls\nwere not right to la=\r\nst digit (Even though they got overall trend) is\nbecause in a &#39;wave electio=\r\nn&#39; it is difficult to get seat conversion right.\nHow will anyone predict 72=\r\n seats in UP (Chanakya predicted 70 and had got\nlot of flak). Overall, exit=\r\n polls were far more satisfying than most\nastrologers\n\n4. I have a quotatio=\r\nn of Swami Vivekananda gifted to me by someone &quot;You are\nthe creator of your=\r\n own destiny&quot;. While I do not have the context of this,\nModi has proved thi=\r\ns to be true. If he had believed in astrologers, he\nwould not have gone on =\r\n24th April to file nominations as that was\nconsidered a non-auspicious day.=\r\n But my understanding is that he wanted\nlimelight for elections being held =\r\non that day and went with that instinct.\nHe got what he wanted and astrolog=\r\ners were proved wrong. Also, when he had\nsetup mission 272, it seemed impos=\r\nsible target (No astrologer backing too),\nagain he went &#39;single minded devo=\r\ntion and passion&#39; to what he wanted.\nCreated his own destiny.\n\n5. Now, on t=\r\nhe rants of gentleman below. Let me state it with conviction\nthat he seems =\r\nto be a follower of AAP philosophy. No astrological reason\nbut because his =\r\nfollowers are perennially angry, totally selfish and will\nmake big statemen=\r\nts without backing that with action. Following are the\nissues raised by Kan=\r\nnan in his rants\n\n*a) 2002 &#39;Genocide&#39;*\n\nGenocide is a term used for near or=\r\n total annihilation of a religious\ngroup. Stupid ranters use such strong wo=\r\nrds when 25% of people who dies in\nGujarat riots were &#39;Hindus&#39;. That when t=\r\nhey are 90% of population in\nGujarat. Many other (Mainly Hindus) have peris=\r\nhed in bomb attacks & Jehadi\nactions like Mumbai attacks. A factual descrip=\r\ntion is available here\nhttp://kiranasis.blogspot.in/2011/09/godhra-train-bu=\r\nrning-yet-another-rewind.html\n.\nHowever, there will never be end to questio=\r\nns if Modi did enough or not .\nKannan ji is free to live in his angry delus=\r\nions forever.\n\n*b) PR machinery like APCO*\n\n*Fact 1*: Heard Dentsu? It is a=\r\n PR machinery from Japan who were given 500\ncr contract for Rahul&#39;s image.\n=\r\n*Fact 2*: Congress spent more money in TV advertising than BJP.\n*Fact 3*: C=\r\nongress also used Govt money to advertise about schemes and\nstarted TV adve=\r\nrtisement months before BJP\n\nWhy did Congress&#39;s fail so badly while BJP&#39;s P=\r\nR spectacular success? Being\nfrom marketing background, I can go in deep de=\r\ntail and give you\nterminologies but I will leave you with the words of a ma=\r\nn of wisdom which\nyou will need to read many times to understand.\n\n*&quot;First =\r\nbecome &#39;that&#39; & projection happens automatically&quot;*\n\n\n*c) MNC backing & no d=\r\nevelopment*\n\nCorporate backing is clear. No development is a failed argumen=\r\nt and I need\nnot give links to prove it. All election season we have heard =\r\nand\nannihilated all arguments and counter-arguments. I am sure you know tho=\r\nse\nbut ranted nevertheless\n\nEven the harshest of Modi&#39;s critics agree that =\r\nthis man has boundless\nenergy and works very hard. He is techno savvy and v=\r\nisionary. Those who\nlistened to his speech in Varanasi yesterday would know=\r\n that he gave the\ncity and country a cleanliness mission for 2019 and tied =\r\nit to Gandhi&#39;s\n150th anniversary. That&#39;s vision and a way to motivate.\n\n*d)=\r\n Hindus sitting outside should not comment*\n\nOn the contrary, Hindus when t=\r\nhey go outside India rediscover their roots.\nThey also compare with Western=\r\n progress and want that for India. India is a\nsacred land for all Hindus wh=\r\nerever they may be in world. They have all\nrights to worry about it as anyo=\r\nne living in India has. *Chanakya* had said\nthe following wise statement th=\r\nousand of years back and Mr. Iyenger should\nread it many times\n\n*&quot;No countr=\r\ny is foreign to a man of knowledge&quot;*\n\n*e) America is devil*\n\nThen stop your=\r\n usage of American inventions. Don&#39;t use electricity,\nInternet, TV, AC etc.=\r\n Start living in a hut and then preach. It is same\nkind of rants which Isla=\r\nmists use. They want all inventions, all dollars\nfrom America but will want=\r\n it&#39;s death.\n\nIn reality, it is great that people who understand Dharma are=\r\n in America\nand working to change it from inside. Someday one of them may b=\r\necome it&#39;s\nleader and will change the fate of entire earth. Hindus before 1=\r\n0th Century\nAD were very enterprising and visited entire globe. Something h=\r\nappened\nafterwards and they developed these stupid theories.\n\n*f)  My bhara=\r\nt mata needs no one&#39;s luck. Sanatan Dharma will protect\nitself.*\n\nYour Bhar=\r\nat Mata has been reduced to 10% of it&#39;s influence which once\nspread from Af=\r\nghanistan to Indonesia & even exported to China. 30% area has\nbeen cut in l=\r\nast century itself. Hindus & other minorities have been\nbrutally annihilate=\r\nd in Pakistan and in Bangladesh. Dharma is in danger\ninside what is remaini=\r\nng. What did your Bharat Mata did?\n\nInstead of pulling back the one who tal=\r\nks of unity and regaining strength,\nlook at history and learn. As Narasimha=\r\n ji once very eloquently said *&quot;Even\nGod functions through humans&quot;*\n\n*I hav=\r\ne met countless Iyers and Iyengers in my life and as a cohesive\ngroup, they=\r\n are among the most intelligent humans on earth. Perhaps\ngenerations of dev=\r\notion to knowledge had an impact at DNA level. But\nintelligence is not the =\r\nsame as wisdom as I can see now. *\n\n*And someone so devoted to rants may be=\r\n simmering with anger and urge to\nrespond now, missing all my points.*\n\nReg=\r\nards\nPuneet\n\n\nOn Tue, May 13, 2014 at 10:26 AM, &#39;Kannan Iyengar&#39;\nprof.kanna=\r\nn.iyengar@...

The only reason =\r\nother polls were not right to last digit (Even though they got overall tren=\r\nd) is because in a &#39;wave election&#39; it is difficult to get seat conv=\r\nersion right. How will anyone predict 72 seats in UP (Chanakya predicted 70=\r\n and had got lot of flak). Overall, exit polls were far more satisfying tha=\r\nn most astrologers&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;4. I have a quotation of =\r\nSwami Vivekananda gifted to me by someone &quot;You are the creator of your=\r\n own destiny&quot;. While I do not have the context of this, Modi has prove=\r\nd this to be true. If he had believed in astrologers, he would not have gon=\r\ne on 24th April to file nominations as that was considered a non-auspicious=\r\n day. But my understanding is that he wanted limelight for elections being =\r\nheld on that day and went with that instinct. He got what he wanted and ast=\r\nrologers were proved wrong. Also, when he had setup mission 272, it seemed =\r\nimpossible target (No astrologer backing too), again he went &#39;single mi=\r\nnded devotion and passion&#39; to=C2=A0what he wanted. Created his own dest=\r\niny.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;5. Now, on the rants of gentleman below=\r\n.
