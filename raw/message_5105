Similarly, a guru with s=\r\nome achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disciple. However,=\r\n one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank account with =\r\na zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. Similarl=\r\ny, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and buil=\r\nd one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as a=\r\n formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahea=\r\nd and do it.\n \n(2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for=\r\n getting specific material results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrende=\r\nr and making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not tha=\r\nt important. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can pre=\r\npare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n \nHowever, as I sa=\r\nid several times, there are very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Natu=\r\nre has destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I s=\r\nuggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, getting wha=\r\ntever material results god wants to give and making spiritual progress. If =\r\none is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material results (for o=\r\nneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature will make arrangem=\r\nents for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts, =\r\none should start with the attitude of (ii).\n \n(3) If you want to do Chandip=\r\nath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, do it  with the attitude of &quot;=\r\nI have several material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Beca=\r\nuse of this ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results =\r\nand not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I =\r\nwant to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. Yo=\r\nu are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an ini=\r\ntiation!\n \n(4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer=\r\n hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. =\r\nI gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fr=\r\nuits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retriev=\r\ne one good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it ge=\r\nntly and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the=\r\n person is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of=\r\n rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten frui=\r\nts will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket=\r\n. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give=\r\n you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like G=\r\nanapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, b=\r\nut the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or =\r\nKali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out fast=\r\ner.\n \nAt the end, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but=\r\n fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each =\r\nof those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n \nNevertheless, one u=\r\nnable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding =\r\nfierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initiati=\r\non if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a pract=\r\nice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without initiation. If=\r\n some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your own=\r\n actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are wea=\r\nk-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n \n(5) Some people who never lit a lamp=\r\n in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Som=\r\ne people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the first time just =\r\n2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. =\r\nI know that some of them have transformed a lot and have experienced some t=\r\nhings too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the F=\r\nierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.\n \n(6) In this age of ign=\r\norance and rank materialism, if someone has even a faint idea that spiritua=\r\nl progress is important, is looking for god and is attracted to a specific =\r\nadvanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person obviously has some good kar=\r\nmas and good vasanas. That person has done that sadhana in the past. Previo=\r\nus life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n \n(7) If you have a good unders=\r\ntanding of what is what, how things work, why one should do something, how =\r\nto do it, what is more important and what is less important, that is what i=\r\nnitiation is all about!\n \nBest regards\nNarasimha\n--------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyo=\r\ntish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n  =\r\n   Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n-----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n \n---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ya=\r\nhoo.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; It is my personal opinion that Stron=\r\ng and long standing urge should be considered as Initiation at least in thi=\r\ns age.\n&gt; I know a person who wanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but w=\r\nas not able to almost for a year.
