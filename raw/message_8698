I know these are excellent for=\r\n health, and will try and do more. Thanks for reminding me.\n\nThe only &#39;medi=\r\ntation&#39; I currently do is japa. I focus on the sound, but yes, b I do have =\r\na picture of Vishnu (as Guruvayoorappan of the famous Kerala temple) to med=\r\nitate on. \n\nI am travelling to Delhi tomorrow, and then onwards to Rishikes=\r\nh next week. Will definitely stand in water and do a little japa (hope I ca=\r\nn stand the freezing water of Mother Ganga, which is incredibly cold even i=\r\nn peak summer). Thank you for this nice suggestion.\n\nI agree brahmacharya i=\r\ns not easy, although essential in spiritual life. I feel the only way to ge=\r\nt established in this is to offer any lower thoughts such as lust, anger, g=\r\nreed, hatred, envy and pride to the Divine. It&#39;s one hell of a battle thoug=\r\nh...\n\nBtw I recently started reading the &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot; by Thomas Ke=\r\nmpis, a famous Catholic monk and saint from 500 years ago. What an inspirin=\r\ng book....his words are so similar to the instructions given by our Indian =\r\nsages. Very interesting and practical instructions for progress on the spir=\r\nitual path. Just wanted to reccommend it to anyone who is interested. \n\nhtt=\r\np://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/new2/ImitationOfChrist-mcrst.p=\r\ndf\n\n\nWarm regards,\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Na=\r\nrayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0That is o=\r\nfficial standard reply for everyone who ask such questions. After all there=\r\n are many others who ask same things\n&gt; I will try to write few things which=\r\n I did myself. May be it will help you.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1--- Everything works because =\r\nof Divine Grace. It is not our japa, tapa, haven or other spiritual work wh=\r\nich is cause of Darshan. No, it is Divine Grace which shows us the path. Ev=\r\nerything comes under it.\n&gt; 2-- Are you doing any pranayam or breathing exer=\r\ncises on a regular basis. Rebirthing exercise is lot like sudershankriya bu=\r\nt much softer. Doing this or others will clear the nadis in the body and wi=\r\nll bring new light even once a week.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3--- Are you doing any meditation=\r\ns in your very busy and responsible life. =A0Yoga nidra is a very good medi=\r\ntation and many times combining breathing exercises and meditations even in=\r\n 10/15 days works wonder.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4--- I hope very much that you have a focus =\r\nof your japa like a Beautiful Picture of Divine Lord.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5--- Next time y=\r\nou go to Rishikesh, try to do some japa standing in SriGangaji after doing =\r\nprayers to Her. But please do not take any risks. When I did it on opposite=\r\n bank, in month of December people kept a eye on me. Being a woman brings i=\r\nt own problem if there is no man there to support. But you do not have to d=\r\no it if you do not want it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6---You might notice feeling of sex increa=\r\nses as the japa increases. It is a very difficult problem. You are a lucky =\r\nperson because you have women teachers in your ashram with whom you could t=\r\nalk. It is not that you need any advise because people come to you for that=\r\n. But it is a very difficult problem to deal with in spiritual life\n&gt; \n&gt; 7-=\r\n--Please do not put blockage by saying that you want Darshan even with inne=\r\nr eye. Let Them decide. After all you want to see Them and They want to see=\r\n you.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; 8--- Relax. I hope you are not in any physical pain apart fro=\r\nm longing for Darshan. So take things easy. Let the spiritual energy slowly=\r\n build up. Things will happen, Look for Divine Grace.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are severa=\r\nl other things which I did. I am sure you will also know.\n&gt; \n&gt; LaxmiNarayan=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;s=\r\nunrise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Monday, 17 Sep=\r\ntember 2012, 12:53\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi LaxmiNarayanji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I recently asked a senior monk at the Sivan=\r\nanda Ashram in Rishikesh as to whether it is possible to have Darshan of Na=\r\nrayana i.e. see Him in the form described in all our scriptures with 4 arms=\r\n, holding the conch, discus, mace and lotus. I said to him, there are count=\r\nless stories of devotees having Darshan of their God, is it actually possib=\r\nle today, in this day and age?\n&gt; \n&gt; He said, yes most certainly! But he sai=\r\nd Darshan of God means feeling the Divine Presence in yourself, and all thi=\r\nngs, living and non-living, in every atom, everywhere. This, he said, is Da=\r\nrshan.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am continuing with japa in the hope of one day getting to thi=\r\ns stage of feeling the presence of God everywhere at all times. \n&gt; \n&gt; Howev=\r\ner, having said that, I have not given up the idea of &#39;seeing&#39; God (may be =\r\nwith the &#39;inner eye&#39;) in the form of Vishnu and Krishna- yes, with mace, di=\r\nscus, flute and all!!\n&gt; \n&gt; The Bhagavatam says that Dhruva, Prahlad, even t=\r\nhe elephant king Gajendra saw Vishnu....then why not me?!! Of course I&#39;ll h=\r\nave to do a lot of japa, a lot of sadhana, remove all negative emotions, be=\r\ncome a paragon of virtue (Oh god!) but I believe that if I do, it&#39;s bound t=\r\no happen. May take a few lifetimes though (but I&#39;m going to try and do it t=\r\nhis time, you&#39;ve got to try at least!).\n&gt; \n&gt; If ulta Rama nama could transf=\r\norm rogue Ratnakar into saint Valmiki, and grant him Darshan of Sri Rama, t=\r\nhen why cannot Om NamoNarayana convert rogue Aparna into saint Aparna one d=\r\nay and give her Darshan of Vishnu/Krishna....I believe that the mantra can =\r\ndo anything. Anything. We&#39;ll all be saints one day....ain&#39;t got no choice, =\r\nHe&#39;ll see to it. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the message. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; =A0 =A0 I still cannot understand why it is wrong to ha=\r\nve a spiritual experiences or to think about them. After all we cannot go t=\r\no a shop and just buy them. If we are doing sadhana and we need support the=\r\ny are going to happen. Why deny them? Suppose someone is doing the complete=\r\n purscharan =A0of mantra, is to wrong =A0not to expect something amazing mi=\r\nght happen at the end of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some years ago there was a Hindi auth=\r\nor who was well off and had a Temple in their home for several generations.=\r\n Something happened in this authors life and he felt lot of trauma and coul=\r\nd not find mental peace. In his later life he took up doing prayers and jap=\r\na etc as he was taught in his younger days. One night his daughter said to =\r\nhim, you are doing so much prayers etc, have you had any experiences.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; The author became upset and said, no, he had not any experiences. Many =\r\ntimes he thinks that he is siting in front of a stone in the temple and it =\r\nis all useless. But he will not give up his prayers as his time is coming n=\r\nearer.\n&gt; &gt; Next morning when this author was in his Temple and priest was d=\r\noing ManglaAarti, The Deity\n&gt; &gt; Spoke to him and comforted him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=A0Several days later when he went to a famous Temple in Rajasthan, again t=\r\nhe Divine Lord spoke to him there and comforted him and said there is no di=\r\nfference between Him and Deities in his home Temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I read t=\r\nhis story I knew immediately it was a true story. Very similar things have =\r\nhappened with me to help me and comfort me.=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We are going from A=\r\n to B. Is it a relentless journey? Are there no breaks, petrol stations or =\r\nshops where we can get out and stretch ourselves. Are there any road signs.=\r\n Spiritual experiences are like these. They guide us and show us if we are =\r\non a right path.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was thinking of writing to this devotee who had=\r\n this powerful experience in Temple. Please write about it. What you experi=\r\nenced and what really happened. It will give knowledge to others. But then =\r\nI realised that I am a lone ranger here and many times go against the strea=\r\nm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =A0Many people are very young here and take NarasimhaBhai as th=\r\neir guru or spiritual adviser. So if guruji is saying something, chela and =\r\nclients cannot go against it. Othewise their fire-pot, ghee-pot and coco-po=\r\nt will be confiscated.=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was also like this in my life. I took =\r\ndiksha=A0 from my Late Uncle who was famous in his days.\n&gt; &gt; When I tried t=\r\no talk to him about Darshan of Divine Lord, he became very negative and sai=\r\nd it is not possible. I kept very quite. I did not try to give examples of =\r\nsaints like Tulsidas or others who had Darshan. I had not done any spiritua=\r\nl sadhana and so no personal experiences.\n&gt; &gt; .=A0\n&gt; &gt; Since then my life h=\r\nas changed due to different spiritual experiences. Sure I am still in lot o=\r\nf pain and not in a complete bliss all the the time but I know Divine Being=\r\ns can very easily give Darshan And having spiritual experiences are very he=\r\nlpful for spiritual growth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; || Om ShaantihShaantihShaanti=\r\nh ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
