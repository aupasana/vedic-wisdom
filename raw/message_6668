The eagle rushes only to its nest hoping to find rest there. Similarly=\r\n\nthe Jiva eager only to experience the bliss of Brahman rushes to sleep.\n\n5=\r\n5. Just as what happens outside in the street may be called external and\nwh=\r\nat is done inside the house internal, so the experiences of the waking\nstat=\r\ne may be called external and the dreams produced inside the mind and the\nne=\r\nrvous system may be called internal.\n\n56. The Shruti says: =E2=80=98In slee=\r\np even a father is no father=E2=80=99. Then in the\nabsence of all worldly i=\r\ndeas the Jivahood is lost and a state of pure\nconsciousness prevails.\n\n58. =\r\nA text of the Atharva Veda says: =E2=80=98In the state of deep sleep, when =\r\nall\nthe objects of experience have been absorbed and only darkness (Tamas)\n=\r\nprevails, the Jiva\nenjoys bliss=E2=80=99.\n\n59. A man from deep sleep rememb=\r\ners his happiness and ignorance and says: =E2=80=98I\nwas sleeping happily; =\r\nI knew nothing then=E2=80=99.\n\n60. Recollection presupposes experience. So =\r\nin sleep there was experience.\nThe bliss\nexperienced in dreamless sleep is =\r\nrevealed by consciousness itself which\nalso reveals\nthe undifferentiated ig=\r\nnorance (Ajnana) covering bliss in that state.\n\n69. The self (Chidabhasa) i=\r\nn the waking and dream states, is connected or\nassociated with various shea=\r\nths such as Vijnanamaya and appears as many\n(i.e.,\nplays various roles). In=\r\n the deep sleep state, however, they get merged and\nbecome\nlatent like a do=\r\nugh of many (powdered) wheat-grains.\n\n72. In the enjoyment of the bliss of =\r\nBrahman in deep sleep, the\nconsciousness\nreflected in ignorance is the mean=\r\ns. Prompted by its Karma, good or bad, the\nJiva\ngives up the enjoyment of b=\r\nliss and goes out to the waking state.\n\n74. For a short time after the waki=\r\nng up the impression of the bliss of\nBrahman enjoyed during sleep continues=\r\n. For he remains for some time calm\nand happy,without taking any interest i=\r\nn the enjoyment of external objects.\n\n75. Then, impelled by his past action=\r\ns ready to bear fruits, he begins to\nthink of duties and their implementati=\r\non entailing sufferings of many kinds\nand gradually forgets the bliss of Br=\r\nahman experienced (a few minutes\nbefore).\n\n77. (Objection): Well, if a mere=\r\n state of quietude were enjoyment of the\nbliss of\nBrahman then the lazy and=\r\n the worldly would achieve the end of their life.\nWhat then\nis the use of t=\r\nhe teacher and the scriptures ?\n\n78. (Reply): Your contention would be corr=\r\nect, if he realised that the bliss\nthat he\nexperienced was the bliss of Bra=\r\nhman. But who can know Brahman that is so\nimmensely profound without the he=\r\nlp of the teacher and the scripture ?\n\n79. (Objection): I know what Brahman=\r\n is from what you yourself have said.\nWhy then am I without the bliss of re=\r\nalisation ? (Reply): Listen to the\nstory of a man who like yourself imagine=\r\nd that he was wise.\n\n80. This man, hearing that a large reward was offered =\r\nto anyone who knew the\nfour\nVedas, said, =E2=80=98I know from you that ther=\r\ne are four Vedas. So give me the\nreward=E2=80=99.\n\n81. (Objection): He knew=\r\n the number, not the text, of the Vedas fully.\n(Reply): You\ntoo have not kn=\r\nown Brahman fully.\n\n82. (Objection): Brahman is by nature indivisible and i=\r\ns bliss absolute,\nuntouched by\nMaya and its effects. How can you speak of t=\r\nhe knowledge of Brahman as\ncomplete\nor incomplete ?\n\n83. (Reply): Do you si=\r\nmply say the word =E2=80=98Brahman=E2=80=99 or do you see its meaning\n? If\n=\r\nyou know only the word, it remains for you to acquire knowledge of its\nmean=\r\ning.\n\n92. In the waking state the Jiva gets identified with the body, as fi=\r\nre with\na red-hot ball of iron. As a result of this he comes to feel with c=\r\nertainty:\n=E2=80=98I am a man=E2=80=99.\n\n116. =E2=80=98Mind has been descri=\r\nbed as of two types, pure and impure. The impure\nis that which is tainted b=\r\ny desires, the pure is that which is free from\ndesires=E2=80=99.\n\n117. =E2=\r\n=80=98The mind alone is the cause of bondage and release. Attachment to\nobj=\r\nects leads to bondage and freedom from attachment to them leads to\nrelease=\r\n=E2=80=99.\n\n125. A man carrying a burden on his head feels relief when he r=\r\nemoves the\nload;similarly a man freed from worldly entanglements feels he i=\r\ns in rest.\n\n132. The knower of truth, experiencing the bliss of Brahman in =\r\nthe waking\nstate experiences it also in the dreaming state, because it is t=\r\nhe\nimpressions received in the waking state that give rise to dreams.\n\nXII.=\r\n THE BLISS OF THE SELF\n\n5. Yajnavalkya instructed this by pointing out to h=\r\nis beloved wife,\nMaitreyi, that =E2=80=98a wife does not love her husband f=\r\nor his sake=E2=80=99.\n\n6. The husband, wife or son, riches or animals, Brah=\r\nmanahood or\nKshatriyahood, the\ndifferent worlds, the gods, the Vedas, the e=\r\nlements and all other objects\nare dear to\none for the sake of one=E2=80=99s=\r\n own Self.\n\n7. A wife shows affection to her husband when she desires his c=\r\nompany; the\nhusband too reciprocates but not when he is engaged in worship =\r\nor afflicted\nwith\nillness, hunger and so forth.\n\n8. Her love is not for her=\r\n husband=E2=80=99s sake but for her own. Similarly the\nhusband=E2=80=99s\nlo=\r\nve also is for his own satisfaction and not for hers.\n\nSource: http://www.c=\r\nelextel.org/othervedantabooks/panchadasi.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0015176f0bb8ce6b6504a6d29edb\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Translated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chenna=\r\ni&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;49.
