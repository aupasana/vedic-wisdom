When I was a young boy, I used to read many books=\r\n\nsuch as Yogananda, etc. One day, I found a very old print of \nSwami Viveka=\r\nnanda&#39;s collected works at a paper recyling shop.\nWith great interest I sta=\r\nrted reading the pages, till I came upon\na passage where Swamiji tackles Lo=\r\nrd Krishna&#39;s historicity.\nI managed to find this passage once again now, af=\r\nter many years, just because  I  still remember some of his words very clea=\r\nrly.  \n\nNeedless to say, a multitude of conflicts arose in my young impress=\r\nionable mind, as one great personality of India seemed to doubt Lord Krishn=\r\na&#39;s existence itself and I was not mature enough to deal with this conflict=\r\n at that time.\n\nPerhaps being a realized seer doesn&#39;t necessarily imply  ha=\r\nving excellent grasp of material facts or analysis, something that we overl=\r\nook easily at times. Note for instance in the below paragraph, how Sri Vive=\r\nkananda, ever the rationalist, calls milk-ocean , curd-ocean, as fantastic =\r\ncreations of the brain. Perhaps they are creations of the brain, or they pe=\r\nrhaps are veiled pointers to some planes of existence, since the puranas an=\r\nd vedas mostly talk in\ncovered terms.\n\n\nSwamy Vivekananda on Lord Krishna f=\r\nrom: Complete Works, Volume 4.\n  &quot;\nThen as to the second point in question,=\r\n much doubt exists about the personality of Krishna. In one place in the Ch=\r\nh=E2ndogya Upanishad we find mention of Krishna, the son of Devaki, who rec=\r\neived spiritual instructions from one Ghora, a Yogi. In the Mahabharata, Kr=\r\nishna is the king of Dw=E2rak=E2; and in the Vishnu Pur=E2na we find a desc=\r\nription of Krishna playing with the Gopis. Again, in the Bh=E2gavata, the a=\r\nccount of his R=E2salil=E2 is detailed at length. In very ancient times in =\r\nour country there was in vogue an Utsava called Madanotsava (celebration in=\r\n honour of Cupid). That very thing was transformed into Dola and thrust upo=\r\nn the shoulders of Krishna. Who can be so bold as to assert that the Rasali=\r\nla and other things connected with him were not similarly fastened upon him=\r\n? In ancient times there was very little tendency in our country to find ou=\r\nt truths by historical research. So any one could say what he thought best =\r\nwithout substantiating it with proper facts and evidence. Another thing: in=\r\n those ancient times there was very little hankering after name and fame in=\r\n men. So it often happened that one man composed a book and made it pass cu=\r\nrrent in the name of his Guru or of someone else. In such cases it is very =\r\nhazardous for the investigator of historical facts to get at the truth. In =\r\nancient times they had no knowledge whatever of geography; imagination ran =\r\nriot. And so we meet with such fantastic creations of the brain as sweet-oc=\r\nean, milk-ocean, clarified-butter-ocean, curd-ocean, etc! In the Puranas, w=\r\ne find one living ten thousand years, another a hundred thousand years! But=\r\n the Vedas say, ????????? ?????? =97 &quot;Man lives a hundred years.&quot; Whom shal=\r\nl we follow here? So, to reach a correct conclusion in the case of Krishna =\r\nis well-nigh impossible.\n\n\nIt is human nature to build round the real chara=\r\ncter of a great man all sorts of imaginary superhuman attributes. As regard=\r\ns Krishna the same must have happened, but it seems quite probable that he =\r\nwas a king. Quite probable I say, because in ancient times in our country i=\r\nt was chiefly the kings who exerted themselves most in the preaching of Bra=\r\nhma-Jn=E2na. Another point to be especially noted here is that whoever migh=\r\nt have been the author of the Gita, we find its teachings the same as those=\r\n in the whole of the Mahabharata. From this we can safely infer that in the=\r\n age of the Mahabharata some great man arose and preached the Brahma-Jn=E2n=\r\na in this new garb to the then existing society. Another fact comes to the =\r\nfore that in the olden days, as one sect after another arose, there also ca=\r\nme into existence and use among them one new scripture or another. It happe=\r\nned, too, that in the lapse of time both the sect and its scripture died ou=\r\nt, or the sect ceased to exist but its scripture remained. Similarly, it wa=\r\ns quite probable that the Gita was the scripture of such a sect which had e=\r\nmbodied its high and noble ideas in this sacred book.\n   \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste=\r\n Narasimha Garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;At the same time, be mindful of the fact that a spir=\r\nitual giant&#39;s &gt;view may be unpalatable to you because of your own limitatio=\r\nns, &gt;i.e. you may be missing something.

But, \n&gt; &gt; blessed jnaanis and karma yogis like Vivekananda=\r\n or Aurobindo would often \n&gt; &gt; end up advocating correct views even if they=\r\n use wrong facts occasionally to \n&gt; &gt; support their views.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If I am=\r\n not mistakened, the current temple at Puri was built around 1000 AD \n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nr so.
