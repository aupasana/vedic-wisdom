Lagna\nwould be \n&gt; powerful with 1st, 9th (dharma and bhagya) =\r\nand 10th (karma) lords\nand also \n&gt; the 8th lord (tapascharya).\n&gt; \n&gt; Jupiter=\r\n in lagna is great for sadhana. Thus, Sagittarius lagna is\ngreat. \n&gt; That m=\r\nay not work out for several people, as it is in the early\nafternoon.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nlso, Pisces lagna would be good. Lagna lord Jupiter in 10th, Sun\nand Saturn=\r\n \n&gt; in 6th and Rahu in 11th would be well-placed. Aries lagna would have a =\r\n\n&gt; powerful 6th house of siddhi and 9th house of dharma and bhagya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpa=\r\nna\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Sw=\r\nadhin&quot; &lt;beherajapan@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesd=\r\nay, September 02, 2008 2:05 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Muhurta for Ganapa=\r\nti homam on the coming Ganesh \n&gt; Chaturthi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha ji\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Many of us will take the opportunity to do the Ganapati homam on the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; coming vinayaka chathurthi.
