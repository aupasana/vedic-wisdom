Is today really a Maargasira P=\r\nournima?\n&gt;  \n&gt; People name the lunar months these days based on the raasi o=\r\nccupied by Moon at the time of Sun-Moon conjunction, i.e. end of Amaavaasya=\r\n. Sun-Moon conjunction in Pisces begins Chaitra month, in Aries begins Vais=\r\nakha month and so on. However, is this perfect or has an error been introdu=\r\nced in the last few millennia due to deepening Kali?\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you look at t=\r\nhe names of months themselves, they are based on the star on Pournima (Full=\r\n Moon day). For example, Moon is in Pisces (Poorvabhadra 4th paadam, Uttara=\r\nbhadra, Revati) at the beginning of Chaitra month. But on the Pournima day =\r\nthat follows, he is in Chitra or its vicinity.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is likely that the =\r\nzodiac was divided into 12 equal parts (not necessarily aligned with 12 ras=\r\nis) and the position occupied by Moon at Full Moon of a month determined th=\r\ne name of the month. These 12 months were then named based on a main star i=\r\nn those 12 parts. Chitra star for Chaitra month, Visakha star for Vaisakha =\r\nmonth, Jyeshtha star for Jyeshtha month and so on. Aaswayuja, Kaarthika, Ma=\r\nargasira and Pushya months are associated with Aswini, Krittika, Mrigasira =\r\nand Pushya stars respectively.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though Dec 30/31, 2009 is supposed to =\r\nbe Pushya Pournima, Moon will be nowhere near Pushya star. He will instead =\r\nbe in Mrigasira and Aardra. That is likely to be the real Maargasira Pourni=\r\nma. Today is supposed to be Maargasira Pournima, but Moon is nowhere near M=\r\nrigasira. He is instead in Krittika for most of the day and in Rohini in th=\r\ne evening. This is likely to be Kaarthika Pournima.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;         =\r\n          http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyot=\r\nishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt;   T=\r\no: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, December 01, 2009 4:46 =\r\nAM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dattatreya Jayanti\n&gt; \n&gt;         Happy and au=\r\nspicious Dattatreya Jayanti to everyone!\n&gt;          \n&gt;         The upsurge =\r\n(of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
