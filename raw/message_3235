The =\r\nphysical structure of human beings, animals, birds and that of plants diffe=\r\nr. The tools provided for the intake of food are different. When attempts a=\r\nre being made to consume food beyond the scope of tools provided(teeth stru=\r\ncture for eg.,) for the present incarnation it only means the bio-memories =\r\nare strong. Jiva could have picked up any body at random in an unconscious =\r\nstate in the past. The need of the hour is to have a cognitive shift from u=\r\nnconscious state of functioning to conscious state of functioning. There is=\r\n no need to talk for vegetarianism or non-vegetarianism. Any memories be it=\r\n pleasant or unpleasant are the previous samskaras/engrams, which put forth=\r\n hurdles, need to be tackled through utter/complete & conscious submission =\r\nto the cosmic intelligence known as the Almighty.\nOne need to be=C2=A0absol=\r\nutely=C2=A0conscious of the food he/she wants to consume. =C2=A0Let the foo=\r\nd chosen be acceptable to the being as an initial step. =C2=A0With this awa=\r\nreness the food chosen needs to be offered to the Almighty with utmost reve=\r\nrence and gratitude. =C2=A0This offered food to the Lord which is purified =\r\nby His Dhristi is now Prasada. =C2=A0The word Prasada needs to be understoo=\r\nd by the being consciously.

Self-identification of plants and trees is very =\r\nsubtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is plucked or cut off from a plant o=\r\nr tree, the emotion experienced by it is very subtle. On the other hand, if=\r\n a body part is cut off in an animal or a human being, the emotion experien=\r\nced is much stronger. Even after death, an animal may identify with the bod=\r\ny and think of it as &quot;I&quot;.\n\n \n\nThe kaarmik debt formed by eating the flesh o=\r\nf an animal, which the animal&#39;s mind considers as a part of &quot;I&quot; and is high=\r\nly attached to, is much bigger than the kaarmik debt formed by eating leave=\r\ns, vegetables or fruits of a plant or a tree or killing bacteria.\n\n \n\nAs lo=\r\nng as we live in a physical body, creation of new kaarmik debts is inevitab=\r\nle. But we strive to minimize the debts we create newly.\n\n \n\n*        *    =\r\n    *\n\n \n\nYou are what you eat. Our body and various chemicals and hormones=\r\n in it are formed based on what we eat.\n\n \n\nMeat is highly taamasik. Eating=\r\n meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and identification with body=\r\n and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all, if one is eating f=\r\nlesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, the quality of body=\r\n attachment will become denser in one. This is not conducive to spiritual p=\r\nrogress.\n\n \n\n*        *        *\n\n \n\nIt is possible that a spiritual giant =\r\nfrom past ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However, it is not easy=\r\n to emulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identification with the =\r\nbody and make spiritual progress, is better off eating saattwik food (simpl=\r\ne vegetables, fruits, greens, grains etc with mild spices).\n\n \n\nIf a meat-e=\r\nating person stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and lenti=\r\nls/dals (for protein) for several months, while trying to read spiritual li=\r\nterature and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see that it makes =\r\na big difference.\n\n \n\n*        *        *\n\n \n\nSomeone mentioned that Vyasa =\r\nliked fish, Radha cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there =\r\nis a lot of misguided propaganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by =\r\nspecific quotes from classics or scriptures that can be verified by scholar=\r\ns are best ignored.\n\n \n\nSwami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a cl=\r\narion call to Indians to be more pro-active and energetic. But that does no=\r\nt require eating meat.
