Now usually this state is achieved through=\r\n some increased saadhana or spiritual practice but it can come involentaril=\r\ny as well, although that is a bit rare.  If you say that you are meditating=\r\n less than before then just have a quick eye check up done as well to rule =\r\nout anything medical but from what you describe it does indicate higher vis=\r\nual awareness of energies.   \n\nA few points\n\n1. Usually darker colors such =\r\nas Blue, Purple, Indigo, and Magenta are associated with higher forms of sp=\r\nirituality (VIBGYOR).  Clairvoyants claim to report deeper color auras arou=\r\nnd spiritual practitioners although they also claim that a highly evolved s=\r\npiritual person would have a white or a light pink aura\n\n2. Colors could al=\r\nso associated with closeness to specific dieties that one mediates on.  For=\r\n example one meditating on the Devi might visualize red more in their medit=\r\nation or sleep where as on meditating on Rama may see more solar colors etc=\r\n.  \n\n2. There is no universal standard of the interpretation of energy visu=\r\nalization. As an example, one person may associate spirituality with blue w=\r\nhereas another &quot;energy sensitive&quot; may associate white.  There could be no r=\r\nelationship between the color you visualize and a particular characteristic=\r\n as well.  If you are energy sensitive you will have to develop your own un=\r\nderstanding of what each color means and usually it takes time, practice, a=\r\nnd greater spiritual saadhana.  \n\n3. I would recommend that you get a coupl=\r\ne of books on auras and learn more about energies and colors and they even =\r\nhave some exercises to develop this siddhi further. \n\n4. Most importantly, =\r\nas Narasimha says, don&#39;t get mesmerized by the scenery along the way and lo=\r\nse sight of the destination.  If you are attaining a siddhi, knowingly or u=\r\nnknowingly, then use this to get closer to the divine and ask him/her for g=\r\nuidance so that this may be used for the welfare for which it is intended. =\r\n Surrender the fruits of any siddhi to the divine and don&#39;t let it get to y=\r\nour head.  \n\nRegards\n\nSumeet\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nisha_=\r\nmuktewar&quot; &lt;nisha_muktewar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to seek=\r\n an answer for certain experiences. I would be obliged if anyone can share =\r\nhis/ her thoughts (or suggested reading material) on this. \n&gt; \n&gt; These days=\r\n whenever I close my eyes even for a while I can see a purple color, someti=\r\nmes even with a magenta combination.  To go a step further, at times while =\r\ntalking to someone if I casually close my eyes I can his/ her image with al=\r\nl the red, orange, yellow & blue colors (something like an aura). However, =\r\nI do not see an image for each and every person. At certain times, I have s=\r\neen colors for objects/ non-living beings too. And at the same time I might=\r\n not see anything with my eyes closed even when the room is full of people.=\r\n  Splashing water on my face feels like spraying blue shades on red/magenta=\r\n. Not sure, why this is and if it makes any sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; Its been almost mor=\r\ne than a month now and I am really curious to find out the reason. Earlier,=\r\n I even thought that I may have some problem with my eyes. Generally, the o=\r\nnly time I see these colors (especially purple & green) is while meditating=\r\n. To be honest, although I pray to God daily, I havent been getting enough =\r\ntime to meditate regularly for the past few weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gar=\r\ngi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
