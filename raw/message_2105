I am\nreproducing extract from Narasimha&#39;s =\r\nmessage regarding Sanskrit grammar.\nOne important thing which has come to m=\r\ny mind is that, because it is\nVisarga, in Sanskrit scripts, it is denoted b=\r\ny : and NOT by  &#39;Ha&#39; akshar\nwritten in devanagari. that shows that there is=\r\n some important\ndifference in pronunciation and the sound should not be mad=\r\ne explicitly\nas Ha but one should let go the air while pronouncing it.  it =\r\nis\ndifferent thing that apparently it sounds like Ha.\n\n&gt; &gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo =\r\nyo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in\nSanskrit\n&gt; &gt; as &quot;:&quot; and =\r\nnotated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;.\nYou are\n&gt; &gt; supposed=\r\n to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation.\nPronunciation\n&gt; &gt; of &quot;=\r\nnaH&quot; is very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again,\nthis is\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nupposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south\nIndians, make=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; it &quot;naha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is\nadd=\r\ned to\n&gt; &gt; the mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In this style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is\nprono=\r\nunced\n&gt; &gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words,\nrespective=\r\nly\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it\na=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; letting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the\n=\r\n3\n&gt; &gt; words.\n\n***\n\n&gt; I also need confirmation about Vighneshwara whom we wo=\r\nrship as remover\nof obstacles being &gt;the creator of obstacles as well.\n\nFir=\r\nst time i thought about Vigneshwara in line with what you mentioned.\nif we =\r\nsplit the word which are joined then it is Vigna + Ishwara =3D God\nof Obsta=\r\ncle. it can very well mean that the God who controls obstacles.\nnow if we d=\r\nerive meaning that Ganapati (Vigneshwara) is the controller\nof Obstacles th=\r\nen what you mentioned seems quite correct because the one\nwho controls obst=\r\nacle has the power to put forth the obstacle as well as\nremove it.\n\n&gt; Furth=\r\nermore, is there some significance of the trunk turned to the\nright as oppo=\r\nsed to the left &gt;or the middle?\n\nI do not know WHY but It is a popular opin=\r\nion in Maharashtra and Gujarat\n(may be in the other places as well) that Mu=\r\nrti or picture of Ganapati\nhaving Right Sided trunk are very active (Live) =\r\nand hence they should be\nhandled with extreme care. i mean, the idol or pic=\r\nture should never\nremain without Pujan etc... Generally people are afraid o=\r\nf keeping such\na idol in their homes because they feel that if they are no =\r\nable to\nproperly worship the idol then some kind of misfortune will befall =\r\non\nthem. Other thing is that, there is also belief that if the idol is\nprop=\r\nerly propitiated then it can give great fortune.\n\nit is not out of place to=\r\n mention here that about a year back somebody\ngave me a Ganapati idol havin=\r\ng Right side trunk. i kept it in my small\npuja place. i think i hardly ever=\r\n worship the idol but when i started\nHomam i used to keep the idol in the h=\r\nomam. although i knew the above\nbelief, i was never afraid of misfortune. a=\r\nfterwards i came to Mumbai\nfor vacation and i bought another idol of metal.=\r\n now i had (still have)\n2 idols and i used to keep only metal idol (with le=\r\nft side trunk) but i\nhad some kind of guilt feeling that i am not able to k=\r\neep the earlier\none idol so i decided to give the metal idol to one of my c=\r\nolleagues who\nwas going to shift to a new house. i gave them the idol but t=\r\nhey were\nlittle hesitant and gave me back. i asked my Guru about it and he =\r\nasked\nto keep both the idols in the Homam and i started doing that. now dur=\r\ning\nmy Homam, there are both Ganapati present, one with Right side trunk an=\r\nd\none with left side. one who is ready to punish and the one who just let\ng=\r\no like visarga :).\n\nbut truly speaking, my fear for such things have almost=\r\n gone. No\ntrepidation by whatever beliefs. Whether it is Ganapati of Right =\r\nsided\ntrunk or mistakes in rituals or wrong pronunciation of veda mantra or=\r\n\nsuch other things.\n\n\n\n***\n\nI have no answers for the rest of the things yo=\r\nu asked.\n\nsorry if i&#39;ve deviated.\n\nbest regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, Utpa=\r\nlji for pointing out the correction in &quot;Ganapataye&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is not &quot;Nama:&quot; equ=\r\nivalent of NamaH?\n&gt;\n&gt; I also need confirmation about Vighneshwara whom we w=\r\norship as remover\nof obstacles being the creator of obstacles as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nAfterall was he not the vighna in is father&#39;s path as a result of\nwhich he =\r\nlost his head?\n&gt;\n&gt; Furthermore, is there some significance of the trunk tur=\r\nned to the\nright as opposed to the left or the middle?\n&gt;\n&gt; Any meaning atta=\r\nched to what Ganapati holds in his hands and in the\ntrunk?\n&gt;\n&gt; What is the =\r\nmeaning of &quot;Gana&quot;?...is it the elements or the energies\nthat underlie creat=\r\nion?\n&gt;\n&gt; Or is it the Ganas in Shiva&#39;s retinue?\n&gt;\n&gt; Who are the ganas who a=\r\nccompany Shiva?\n&gt;\n&gt; i saw some videos of ganapati &quot;drinking&quot; milk and was v=\r\nery impressed!\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards and best wishes\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; vedic_pathak@\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; one correction f=\r\nor the Mantra in your message.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The correct is &quot;Gam Ganapataye Nama:=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt;=\r\n\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; namaste narasimha ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does the same a=\r\npply to &quot;gam&quot;? yesterday while discussing the\nmantra &quot;Om\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gam Ganapati=\r\nye Namah&quot; with a friend, she told me that &quot;gam&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pronounced as &quot;gon=\r\ng&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
