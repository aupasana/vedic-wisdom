This means, &quot;may my ancestors come here and a=\r\nccept my water oblations&quot;.\n\nDoes bowing here means:\n(1) Nodding the head wi=\r\nth folded hands in the postrue we are or\n(2) Touching the forehead to the g=\r\nround.\n\nI am asking this question becasue we are in a specific posture (e.g=\r\n. left knee in contact with ground etc) and to touch the forehead to the gr=\r\nound we have to unlock our legs from the given posture.\n\nWhat has happened =\r\na few times is that I unlocked the legs and touched my forehead to the grou=\r\nnd - but then forgot to resume the correct posture (i.e. touching the left =\r\nknee to the ground). I am training my self to follow the instructions corre=\r\nctly. Personally I&#39;d like to bow down by touching foreahead to the ground, =\r\nand then resume the posture. I hope it is OK either ways, and wish to confi=\r\nrm whether *changing your posture* during Tarpana to Bow down is OK, PREFER=\r\nRED or PROHIBITED. \n\nPlease guide.\nReverently,\nMahesh\n\n\n"}}
