It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.\n \n=\r\nIt is my feeling that many people, including highly learned Vedic scholars,=\r\n pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantras) incorre=\r\nctly.\n \nOf course, pronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the=\r\n spirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, pronunciation =\r\nis a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is very important in Ved=\r\na mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the most =\r\ncomplete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who can=\r\n memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;experienc=\r\ne&quot; a mantra.\n \nOver the next few months, I will write my views on correct p=\r\nronunciation and point out some common errors. If you do not think that cor=\r\nrect pronunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment of th=\r\ne errors or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please ignore =\r\nmy writings on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to changing=\r\n your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views and adopt my s=\r\nuggestions if you find them appropriate.\n \nI shared a few observations on 2=\r\n007 Nov 16. Some more observations will follow today.\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \nTake the &quot;ai&quot;/&quot;ae&quot; sound in the beejaakshara &quot;aim&quot;/&quot;aem&quot;.\n \nNorth Indian=\r\ns pronounce this sound almost like the sound &quot;a&quot; in the English words &quot;fan&quot;=\r\n, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;hat&quot; etc. South Indians pronounce this sound almost like the soun=\r\nd &quot;uy&quot; in the English words &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;guy&quot;.\n \nIn general, south India was =\r\nrelatively shielded from the western invaders in the last couple of millenn=\r\nia, who entered India from the northwest. As a result, the corruption in th=\r\ne tradition is less in south India. However, it is incorrect to say that so=\r\nuth Indian pronunciation is always superior to north Indian pronunciation. =\r\nThe above is a case where I side with the north Indian pronunciation.\n \nLet=\r\n us examine this logically. There are rules in Sanskrita grammar for combin=\r\ning different sounds (&quot;sandhi&quot; - joining sounds). The rules in Sanskrita gr=\r\nammar is logical and nor arbitrary. This is a big clue to deducing the corr=\r\nect pronunciation of certain sounds that are corrupted today.\n \nTake the fo=\r\nllowing two sounds:\n \n(1) Take the sound &quot;aa&quot; (as in &quot;mahaa&quot;, &quot;tathaa&quot; etc)=\r\n. This is pronounced as &quot;a&quot; in the English words &quot;car&quot; and &quot;far&quot;.\n(2) Take =\r\nthe sound &quot;e&quot; (as in &quot;etat&quot;, &quot;evam&quot; etc). This is pronounced as &quot;a&quot; in the =\r\nEnglish words &quot;make&quot; and &quot;take&quot;.\n \nIf sound 1 is followed immediately by so=\r\nund 2 without any break whatsoever, they combine and become one sound. That=\r\n combined sound is supposed to be the sound &quot;ai&quot;/&quot;ae&quot; in &quot;aim&quot;/&quot;aem&quot; beeja.=\r\n This is called &quot;vriddhi sandhi&quot; in Sanskrita grammar.\n \nNow, try to pronou=\r\nnce sound 1 and, without a break, immediately pronounce sound 2. That resul=\r\nts in the sound similar to &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;fan&quot;, &quot;man&quot; and &quot;hat&quot; (you can verify=\r\n this for yourself). This suggests that the north Indian pronunciation is m=\r\nore accurate. I am convinced that the south Indian pronunciation of the &quot;ai=\r\nm&quot;/&quot;aem&quot; beeja is incorrect and the north Indian pronunciation is correct.\n=\r\n \nThis particular letter comes in many mantras - Vaidika, Taantrika and Pou=\r\nraanika. My advice is to pronounce it as &quot;ae&quot; in all the mantras.\n \n*      =\r\n  *        *\n \nThere is one more issue related to beejaaksharas that a yaho=\r\nogroup member asked me to talk about. Some people pronounce &quot;aem hreem klee=\r\nm&quot; as &quot;aeng hreeng kleeng&quot;. In other words, the anunaasika (nasal sound) at=\r\n the end of each beejaakshara is pronounced as &quot;ng&quot; (the nasal in &quot;ka varga=\r\n&quot;) instead of &quot;m&quot; (the nasal in &quot;pa varga&quot;).\n \nUnfortunately, grammar rules=\r\n do not help here and I do not have a clear stand. My guess is that both ar=\r\ne correct and give different results.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn Veda mantr=\r\nas, there is one issue regarding the pronunciation of nasal sounds. The roo=\r\nt of the above issue that I skirted may be related to it actually.\n \nThe &quot;m=\r\n&quot; at the end of words sometimes changes into a different nasal sound when y=\r\nou join two words into one word (i.e. no break in between in pronunciation)=\r\n. For example, take &quot;gaNapatiM havaamahe&quot;. If you remove the break between =\r\nthe two words, the nasal at the end of the first word changes from &quot;m&quot; to a=\r\n different nasal sound. This is represented by a dot with a crescent Moon i=\r\nn Devanagari texts and with a &quot;g&quot; and then a &quot;m&quot; symbol in texts transcribe=\r\nd in south Indian languages. Unfortunately, most Vedic scholars trained in =\r\nsouth Indian traditions pronounce this nasal as &quot;gum&quot; or &quot;gam&quot;. They pronou=\r\nnce &quot;gaNapatiM havaamahe&quot; as &quot;gaNapatigum havaamahe&quot; or &quot;gaNapatigam havaam=\r\nahe&quot;.\n \nThis is definitely wrong, though it is an extremely extremely wide-=\r\nspread convention.\n \nA nasal (m) cannot change into a consonant (g), an vow=\r\nel (u or a) and then another nasal (m). That is quite absurd. In fact, you =\r\nare adding one extra akshara when you do it. The word &quot;gaNapatiM&quot; has 4 aks=\r\nharas. But, if you pronounce it as &quot;gaNapatigum&quot; or &quot;gaNapatigam&quot;, it ends =\r\nup being 5 aksharas, with &quot;gum&quot;/&quot;gam&quot; being a separate akshara by itself. I=\r\nf a consonant has an vowel after it, the vowel serves as the praana (life f=\r\norce) and it becomes an akshara. The sound &quot;M&quot; as the end of &quot;gaNapatiM&quot; is=\r\n not an akshara - it clings on to &quot;ti&quot; and becomes an extension of the prev=\r\nious akshara. On the other hand, &quot;gum&quot;/&quot;gam&quot; is a separate askahra due to t=\r\nhe praana in it (u or a).\n \nThus, people are adding one akshara to Veda man=\r\ntras when pronouncing with &quot;gum&quot;/&quot;gam&quot;. This changes the chhandas and also =\r\nmesses up the meaning.\n \nA clue to the correct pronunciation of this exists=\r\n in another corrupt tradition in another part of India. The word &quot;narasiMha=\r\n&quot; is pronounced as &quot;narasingha&quot; in some parts of India. In Veda mantras, it=\r\n is written as &quot;narasi(gM)ha&quot;, where (gM) is the sound mentioned as &quot;gum&quot; o=\r\nr &quot;gam&quot; above (e.g. &quot;tanno naarasi(gM)haH prachodayaat&quot; in Narasimga Gayatr=\r\ni).\n \nI suggest that the truth is in between these two corrupt traditions!\n=\r\n \nMy view is that the anunaasika (nasal) in these cases (mostly, a nasal co=\r\nming just before &quot;y&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, shh&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;h&quot; or just before vo=\r\nwels) should be pronounced as the nasal in &quot;ka varga&quot;. This is like the &quot;n&quot;=\r\n sound in the English words &quot;monkey&quot; or &quot;king&quot;. When you say &quot;narasi&lt;nasal&gt;=\r\nha&quot;, the &lt;nasal&gt; is neither n nor m. It is the nasal that comes just before=\r\n k or g. So, start pronouncing it as though you are going to pronounce &quot;nar=\r\nasing&quot; and stop just before you say &quot;g&quot; and say &quot;ha&quot; instead. Then you get =\r\nsomething very similar to &quot;narasingha&quot;, but without &quot;g&quot; being explicit! The=\r\nre should be an intention of &quot;g&quot; but no explicit &quot;g&quot;. This can be represent=\r\ned as &quot;narasin(g)ha&quot;. This same sound is probably represented in Vedic lite=\r\nrature as &quot;gM&quot;.\n \nI am not 100% sure if what I suggest is correct, but I am=\r\n 100% sure that the standard pronunciation as &quot;gum&quot;/&quot;gam&quot; is wrong. If one =\r\njust pronounces it as &quot;gaNapatiM havaamahe&quot;, for example, one will be bette=\r\nr off. It is atleast meaningful and obey chhandas. What people normally say=\r\n has no meaning and breaks chhandas.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere are seve=\r\nral other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in the pronunc=\r\niation of Sanskrita mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the next=\r\n few days/weeks/months, whenever the Mother allows me to.\n \nPlease give me =\r\nyour consideration and take my input into consideration in altering your pr=\r\nonunciation (if you are open to it). If you don&#39;t find any sense in what I =\r\nam saying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I can understand tha=\r\nt. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, because She insp=\r\nired me to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing that there are S=\r\nOME who are destined to change their pronunciation based on my views. That =\r\nis why I am writing these mails.\n \nIf you do not like this discussion, I am=\r\n sorry and just ignore this idiot!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.hom=\r\ne.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_02C4_01C82C91.4EDC7550\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3199&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Ramakrishna Para=\r\nmahamsa once said that even Vedas \nare corrupted these days.

If \nyou remove the break between the two words, the nasal at the =\r\nend of the first \nword changes from &quot;m&quot; to a different nasal sound. This is=\r\n represented by a dot \nwith a crescent Moon in Devanagari texts and with a =\r\n&quot;g&quot; and then a &quot;m&quot; symbol in \ntexts transcribed in south Indian languages. =\r\nUnfortunately, most Vedic scholars \ntrained in south Indian traditions pron=\r\nounce this nasal&nbsp;as &quot;gum&quot; or &quot;gam&quot;. \nThey pronounce &quot;gaNapatiM havaama=\r\nhe&quot; as &quot;gaNapatigum havaamahe&quot; or &quot;gaNapatigam \nhavaamahe&quot;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;This is definitely wrong, though it is a=\r\nn \nextremely extremely&nbsp;wide-spread convention.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;A nasal (m) cannot change into a consonant \n(g),=\r\n an vowel (u or a) and then another nasal (m). That is quite absurd. In \nfa=\r\nct, you are adding one extra akshara when you do it. The word &quot;gaNapatiM&quot; h=\r\nas \n4 aksharas. But, if you pronounce it as &quot;gaNapatigum&quot; or &quot;gaNapatigam&quot;,=\r\n it ends \nup being 5 aksharas, with &quot;gum&quot;/&quot;gam&quot; being a separate akshara by=\r\n itself. If a \nconsonant has an vowel after it, the vowel serves as the pra=\r\nana (life force) and \nit becomes an akshara. The sound &quot;M&quot; as the end of &quot;g=\r\naNapatiM&quot; is not an akshara \n- it clings on to &quot;ti&quot; and becomes an extensio=\r\nn of the previous akshara. On the \nother hand, &quot;gum&quot;/&quot;gam&quot; is a separate as=\r\nkahra due to the praana in it (u or \na).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Thus, people are adding one akshara to Veda \nmantras when p=\r\nronouncing with &quot;gum&quot;/&quot;gam&quot;.

The word &quot;narasiMha&quot; is \npronounced as &quot;narasingha&quot; in some parts of =\r\nIndia. In Veda mantras, it is \nwritten as &quot;narasi(gM)ha&quot;, where (gM) is the=\r\n sound mentioned as &quot;gum&quot; or &quot;gam&quot; \nabove (e.g. &quot;tanno naarasi(gM)haH prach=\r\nodayaat&quot; in Narasimga \nGayatri).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I suggest that th=\r\ne truth is in between these two \ncorrupt traditions!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D=\r\n2&gt;My view is that the anunaasika (nasal) in these \ncases (mostly, a nasal c=\r\noming just before &quot;y&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, shh&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, \n&quot;h&quot; or just before =\r\nvowels) should be pronounced as the nasal in &quot;ka varga&quot;. This \nis like the =\r\n&quot;n&quot; sound in the English words &quot;monkey&quot; or &quot;king&quot;. When you say \n&quot;narasi&lt=\r\n;nasal&gt;ha&quot;, the &lt;nasal&gt; is neither n nor m. It is the nasal \nthat =\r\ncomes just before k or g. So, start pronouncing it as though you are going =\r\n\nto pronounce &quot;narasing&quot; and stop just before you say &quot;g&quot; and say &quot;ha&quot; inst=\r\nead. \nThen you get something very similar to &quot;narasingha&quot;, but without &quot;g&quot; =\r\nbeing \nexplicit! There should be an intention of &quot;g&quot; but no explicit &quot;g&quot;. T=\r\nhis can be \nrepresented as &quot;narasin(g)ha&quot;. This same sound is probably repr=\r\nesented in Vedic \nliterature as &quot;gM&quot;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\nsize=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I am not 100%=\r\n sure if what I suggest is correct, \nbut I am 100% sure that the standard p=\r\nronunciation as &quot;gum&quot;/&quot;gam&quot; is wrong.
