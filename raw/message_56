On the one hand, we supposedly enjoy more \npros=\r\nperity, longevity, comforts, and conveniences in the United \nStates than an=\r\ny other civilization has even dreamed of in previous \nhistory.  Supposedly.=\r\n\n\nOn the other hand, however, America is currently going through one of \nth=\r\ne biggest mental health crises that any nation in history has ever \nexperie=\r\nnced.  Various forms of depression, anxiety disorders and \nneuroses are aff=\r\necting millions of Americans.  Depressive disorders \naffect approximately 1=\r\n8.8 million American adults, or about 9.5% of \nthe U.S. population age 18 a=\r\nnd older in any given year. For those \ncases of depression that are reporte=\r\nd, many more remain unreported, \nand thus unknown.  This current mental hea=\r\nlth crisis includes such \nailments as major depressive disorder, dysthymic =\r\ndisorder, and \nbipolar disorder.  \n\nWhat is especially disturbing is that d=\r\nepression is increasingly a \ncommon occurrence among the nation&#39;s young, a =\r\ndemographic that should \nbe enjoying the fun and carefree life usually asso=\r\nciated with \nchildhood.  Pre-schoolers are the fastest-growing market for \n=\r\nantidepressants. At least four percent of preschoolers -- over a \nmillion! =\r\n-- are considered clinically depressed.  CNN recently \nreported on a study =\r\nthat revealed that as many as 3 million teenagers \ncontemplated suicide in =\r\n2006.  The rate of increase of depression \namong children is an astounding =\r\n23%.\n\n30% of women are depressed. Men&#39;s figures were previously thought to =\r\n\nbe half that of women, but new estimates show that the actual figures \nare=\r\n higher than at first suspected. \n\nDepression will be the second largest ki=\r\nller after heart disease by \n2020 -- and medical studies have shown that de=\r\npression is a \ncontributory factor to fatal coronary disease. \n\nDepression =\r\nresults in more absenteeism and loss of employment than \nalmost any other p=\r\nhysical disorder, and costs employers more than \nUS$51 billion per year in =\r\nabsenteeism and lost productivity, not \nincluding high medical and pharmace=\r\nutical bills. \n\nThe treatment modalities often used in the attempt to comba=\r\nt \ndepression are diverse and have varied results.  Some of these \ntreatmen=\r\nts include talk therapy and anti-depression medications.  \nCurrently, sever=\r\nal million Americans are on various anti-depressants, \nincluding Prozac, Le=\r\nxapro, and Amitriptyline.  Many of these anti-\ndepression medications have =\r\nhad only mixed results.  \n\nAntidepressants work for 35% to 45% of the depre=\r\nssed population, \nwhile more recent figures suggest as low as 30%. Standard=\r\n \nantidepressants, SSRIs such as Prozac, Paxil (Aropax) and Zoloft, \nhave r=\r\necently been revealed to have serious risks, and are linked to \nsuicide, vi=\r\nolence, psychosis, abnormal bleeding, and brain tumors. \n\nThough most docto=\r\nrs advise a combination of therapy and \nantidepressants, cognitive behavior=\r\nal therapy (CBT) has an 80% \nrelapse rate in the long term. \n\nWhile medicat=\r\nion and therapy can often take the edge off of the \nexperience of depressio=\r\nn, they are far from successful in all \ninstances.  The only truly effectiv=\r\ne cure lies in going to the root \nof depression.  That root is ultimately s=\r\npiritual in nature.  \n\nDepression is itself only a direct symptomatic manif=\r\nestation of the \nradical secularization of human society.  Previous to secu=\r\nlar \nmodernity, depression was a much less prevalent phenomenon.  And when =\r\n\nit was experienced, the reasons were more clearly environmental and \ncausa=\r\nl than they are now.  In the past, depression was directly \nassociated with=\r\n a specific event or occurrence in the person&#39;s life \nthat directly caused =\r\nthe depression.  Today, however, an increasing \nnumber of depressed persons=\r\n are experiencing more generalized \ndepression, a type of general existenti=\r\nal angst, the exact cause of \nwhich it is difficult for them to pinpoint.  =\r\nSome of the leading \ncauses of depression today include a sense of meaningl=\r\nessness; \nconsuming and generalized fear; spiritual crises, and the high \nd=\r\negrees of stress and anxiety that has become accepted as normal in \nmodern,=\r\n radically secularized, everyday life.  \n\nFor younger people, especially, w=\r\nhen asked why they are experiencing \ndeep depression, many youth will point=\r\n to a complete sense of \nmeaninglessness in their lives.  The don&#39;t know wh=\r\ny they are here, \nwhat their purpose in life is, why they are bothering to =\r\nlearn and \nwork hard, and why our present-day, materialistic society is gea=\r\nred \nin such a way as to provide them with no real answers to their quest \n=\r\nfor meaning.  While pop culture, technology, and the youth scene \nserves as=\r\n a temporary outlet for many teens, more often than not it \nonly serves to =\r\ntremendously exacerbate the problem of depression.  \n\nSecular modernity pre=\r\nsents us with a social-philosophical construct \nthat is artificial, anti-na=\r\ntural, and ultimately destructive and \nunhealthy in nature.  In our society=\r\n, we have been deprived of the \nage-tested, fundamental vehicles through wh=\r\nich we can excel \nspiritually, intellectually, and culturally.  Spiritualit=\r\ny and \nDharma, which form the basis of all meaningful human growth and \npro=\r\ngress, has been systematically and viciously erased from modern \nsecular so=\r\ncieties to such a radical extent that hundreds of millions \nof persons worl=\r\ndwide are vividly feeling the ill effects of a life \ndevoid of meaning, val=\r\nue, nobility, goodness, heroism, and the quest \nfor Truth.  \n\nThe search fo=\r\nr truth has been replaced in the lives of billions with \nthe search for ent=\r\nertainment.  \n\nRather than encouraging such spiritual values as courage, no=\r\nbility, \nand heroism, the modern world today encourages the coldly \nunsatis=\r\nfying propaganda of radical egalitarianism.  Rather than \nencouraging the n=\r\nurturing of the inner life of the spirit, and the \nnatural joy, peace and f=\r\nulfillment that results from a healthy \nspiritually-centered life, today it=\r\n is only selfish economic \nadvancement and the value of purchasing power th=\r\nat is advocated.  \nRather than a lifestyle of mental, physical and spiritua=\r\nl health, \ntoday lifestyles of selfish hedonism, consumerism, greed, fame, =\r\nand \nlust are upheld as the ideal course of behavior, and the values \ntowar=\r\nd which all should aspire.  \n\nDharma, the principle of living one&#39;s life in=\r\n accordance with Natural \nLaw and God&#39;s will in a manner that is healthy, f=\r\nulfilling, \nnurturing, and truly progressive, has now been replaced with an=\r\n \nartificial and life-denying lifestyle that only produces a profound \nsens=\r\ne of meaninglessness and anxiety.  \n\nThe ultimate cure for society&#39;s presen=\r\nt crisis of depression and \nmeaninglessness is to re-embrace a life of mean=\r\ning, a life of \nDharma.  Dharma, by its very definition, denotes the sustai=\r\nning \nfoundation of all reality.  Dharma is the concept that all that we \ne=\r\nxperience in this world is based upon a higher, spiritual reality \nthat pro=\r\nvides the ordering principles necessary for the proper \nfunction of the wor=\r\nld.  To understand Dharma is to understand the \nworld, and the natural laws=\r\n behind all things that make life a \nmeaningful and beautiful expression of=\r\n the Divine in spacial-temporal \nreality.  To know Dharma is to know life&#39;s=\r\n ultimate meaning.  And the \nway to fully know Dharma is through the proces=\r\ns of meditation.  \n\nFor millennia, a spiritually based practice of meditati=\r\non has been \nshown to be very effective in combating such problems as stres=\r\ns, \nanxiety, fear, and feelings of meaninglessness.  Because meditation \nad=\r\ndresses the root causes of depression and anxiety, the time honored \ntechni=\r\nques of meditation can be a much more effective cure for \ndepression than e=\r\nither talk-therapy or medication.  \n\nMeditation is a natural, easy and prov=\r\nen method that has been shown \nin hundreds of clinical studies to bring abo=\r\nut deep states of peace, \ncalm and mental clarity.  In addition, a specific=\r\nally spiritual \nregimen of daily meditation can help to foster a deep sense=\r\n of \nmeaning and spiritual comfort.  \n\nMeditation has been shown to work on=\r\n two distinct levels: a) the \ncognitive level, and b) the spiritual level. =\r\n On the cognitive level, \nmeditation helps to bring about a deep equipoise =\r\nand a calming relief \nto one&#39;s overactive mind.  Today, especially, the min=\r\nd is constantly \nbombarded with an unending stream of diverse information -=\r\n some \nvaluable, most useless.  As a direct result of such information \nbom=\r\nbardment, the mind is in an almost constant state of agitation and \nconfusi=\r\non.  Meditation serves to calm the mind, allowing our \nattention to shift f=\r\nrom the storm of external stimuli to the deep \ninner peace that is the natu=\r\nral state of the soul.  As a consequence \nof having a calm mind, we then fi=\r\nnd that we can think and make \nimportant decisions with much more clarity, =\r\ninsight, and power.  We \nare now able to process information in a way that =\r\nserves us, rather \nthan merely being the victims of myriad sensory impressi=\r\nons and \ninformation overload.\n\nOn the more spiritual level, meditation has=\r\n the ability to provide us \nwith deep levels of self-realization and God-re=\r\nalization that, up \ntill now, may have seemed to be impossible attainments =\r\nto many of \nus.  By meditating with the expressed goal of making spiritual =\r\n\nprogress, and knowing God and self, we then traverse beyond the \nmerely co=\r\ngnitive and mental, and begin to penetrate the inner realms \nof eternal spi=\r\nrit.  When we have self-realization, we now experience \nthe transcendent pe=\r\nace and calm that is the natural result of living \nin spirit.  When we have=\r\n God-realization, we are now in communion \nwith the very source of our bein=\r\ng, the eternal, loving Absolute who \nis our very best of friends, and great=\r\nest of well-wishers.  In such a \ntranscendent state of spiritual attainment=\r\n, no anxiety, stress, \ndepression, or fear can ever burden our minds or hea=\r\nrts again.  For \nwe have now, through the process of spiritual meditation, =\r\nrealized \nthe infinite well of spiritual peace that lies naturally within. =\r\n \n\nThe root cause of most depression today, then, is the pervasive sense \no=\r\nf meaninglessness that naturally accompanies life in a radically \nseculariz=\r\ned, materialistic society.  The cure to such existential \nmeaninglessness i=\r\ns to partake profoundly in the spiritual nature of \nour true selves and the=\r\n spiritual foundations underlying our everyday \nconcerns.  The artificial c=\r\nonstruct of materialism needs to be \nreplaced with Dharma, and the natural =\r\nlifestyle and spiritual way of \nbeing that Dharma teaches us to embrace.  T=\r\nhe most effective way of \naccessing the spiritual reality that is our true =\r\nself, and thus to \nover-come the unnatural state of depression, is God-cent=\r\nered \nmeditation as taught in the ancient tradition of Sanatana Dharma.  \n\n=\r\nFor further information about overcoming depressing and learning to \nembrac=\r\ne happiness again through meditation, please contact the \nInternational San=\r\natana Dharma Society:  \n\nwww.dharmacentral.com\ninfo@...  \n(60=\r\n8) 280-8375\n\n\n\nThe Author:\n\nDr. Frank Morales, Ph.D. (Sri Dharma Pravartaka=\r\n Acharya) is an \nAmerican who has been practicing Sanatana Dharma for over =\r\n30 years. \nHe has a Ph.D. in Religious Studies and is recognized by the glo=\r\nbal \nHindu community as one of the leading Hindu Acharyas (Spiritual \nPrece=\r\nptors) in the nation.
