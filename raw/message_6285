You have forgotten Him. But he still cares for you. Troubles are=\r\n His blessings in disguise. He wants to mould your body and mind as fit ins=\r\ntruments for His unhampered play or Lila. He ministers or attends to your w=\r\nants in a better manner than you yourself will do. Keep the load down that =\r\nyou are carrying on your shoulder unnecessarily on account of your egoism. =\r\nGive up your self-created responsibilities and be at perfect ease. Have per=\r\nfect faith in Him. Do total unreserved self-surrender. Run to Him now. He i=\r\ns waiting with outstretched hands to embrace you. He will do everything for=\r\n you. Believe me. Take my word for it. Open your heart to Him quite freely =\r\nlike a child. All miseries will come to an end. Say unto Him at least once =\r\nwith Bhava sincerely : I am Thine, my Lord. All is Thine, Thy will be done.=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
