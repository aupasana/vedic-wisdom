One may be afraid of telling one&#39;s father (or mother) &quot;I love you&quot;. \nEspecially one who has a strict disciplinarian for father may be too \nhesitant and concerned about mistakes. Well, my friend, even if you make a \nmistake when telling &quot;I love you&quot; to your father or mother, nothing bad will \nhappen. Even if they punish you a little, it is for your own good. Your \nmother and father want you to succeed.\n\nEven if you say &quot;I love you&quot; without much emotion and as a formality, they \ndo not mind. They still love you. After following formality for some time, \nthe emotion will come by itself!\n\nThe trick is to actually *see* god as father/mother. If that attitude is \nthere, the emotion in saying &quot;I love you&quot; (i.e. devotion in saying mantras) \nwill come by itself in time.\n\nThink of the above and think of your ishta devata as the father. Try to \nthink that whatever you have is given by him and you owe everything to him.\n\n2. This is irrelevant. Don&#39;t worry about it. With a veda mantra, \npronunciation must be fixed. If you are doing some other mantra, do not \nworry about a constant pronunciation.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &lt;kshroum@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, January 21, 2009 11:56 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] What if bhakti is not felt when chanting mantra\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha ji, Namaskar,\n&gt;  You&#39;ve mentioned in your last post about not focusing too much on\n&gt; technicality/theory and actually start doing it was an eye opener. I\n&gt; was really afraid of doing it wrong (esp. my ishta devta is nrisingha\n&gt; deva and I wanted to be careful)\n&gt; I have a problem though, I am trying as much as i can, but two\n&gt; things are happening that are not under my control and your guidance\n&gt; will be kindly appreciated.\n&gt; 1. I try really hard to feel bhakti but i try to keep my mind as\n&gt; distraction less as possible , but neither i feel bhakti and as i am\n&gt; aware of all the distractions throughout the japa, i really feel bad\n&gt; at the end of it. What else should i be doing to atleast feel my\n&gt; attachment toward my ishta devta.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. the laya of mantra changes slowly. after some purascharans, the\n&gt; melody changes and different characters starts getting different\n&gt; emphasis e.g. when saying nrisihgha , gha comes out more vocal no\n&gt; matter what i try. should i be sticking to one laya , should i let it\n&gt; mold as i keep doing it?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n\n\n"}}
