After being empoyed once again, which was also the motive at that t=\r\nime to recite those mantra, I used to recite them randomly at home at same =\r\nplace say once in a week time and that great feeling is not coming.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Whatever is one&#39;s path, Kundalini is not only awakened but goes to Saha=\r\nsrara \n&gt; when one is established in undifferentiated Self. Even if one does=\r\n not think \n&gt; in those terms, it still happens. It is incorrect to say that=\r\n one can \n&gt; realize the highest truths without Kundalini awakened. A more a=\r\nccurate \n&gt; statement would be that one can realize the highest truths witho=\r\nut engaging \n&gt; in any specific practices geared at awakening or raising Kun=\r\ndalini.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people following the so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or other =\r\nraja/hatha \n&gt; yoga paths specifically try to awaken Kundalini. However, suc=\r\nh practices are \n&gt; not at all needed for awakening Kundalini. People belong=\r\ning to various \n&gt; traditions and paths, not just limited to Hinduism, can e=\r\nxperience Kundalini \n&gt; awakening, without knowing anything about the name o=\r\nr the symbolism. There \n&gt; are a lot of misconceptions about Kundalini.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Kundalini is essentially the force of one&#39;s self-=\r\nawareness. Awakened and \n&gt; raised kundalini implies a more refined and high=\r\ner self-awareness.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the lowest level, we bind our selves to specific=\r\n bodies and our \n&gt; self-awareness is limited to a body, a name and other th=\r\nings associated with \n&gt; the body and name. This experience of self as a bod=\r\ny corresponds to \n&gt; Kundalini sleeping at Mooladhara. At the highest level,=\r\n we are the \n&gt; undifferentiated Self, known as Brahman, that is all-pervadi=\r\nng. This \n&gt; &#39;experience&#39; of self corresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As =\r\n\n&gt; self-awareness goes from the former to the latter, it may traverse throu=\r\ngh \n&gt; many stages in between. Correspondingly, many experiences are possibl=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Kundalini rises as high as it can when it =\r\nawakens for the first time, like a \n&gt; spring suppressed for a long time. Ho=\r\nwever, it comes down again and the \n&gt; process of rise from then onwards wil=\r\nl be slower, Kundalini will work its \n&gt; way up while the nadis are continuo=\r\nusly cleaned (i.e. undesirable \n&gt; conditioning of mind is cleaned). When Ku=\r\nndalini rises high at the time of \n&gt; awakening, it may encounter impurities=\r\n in nadis and yet rise high through \n&gt; the impurities. This may manifest ph=\r\nysically as a powerful experience \n&gt; similar to heavy electricity flowing i=\r\nn the back.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are thousands of nadis in the sookshma sareera. The =\r\nexact path taken \n&gt; by Kundalini as it rises for the first time is not fixe=\r\nd. It may change from \n&gt; person to person, based on the impurities in vario=\r\nus nadis. The exact \n&gt; &quot;experience&quot; will vary depending on the path travers=\r\ned and the final point \n&gt; reached by self-awareness (kundalini), before wit=\r\nhdrawal.\n&gt; \n&gt; I actually know one person who had kundalini awakening, rise =\r\nto Sahasrara \n&gt; and samadhi for 7 days, all happening at the same time. His=\r\n nadis had \n&gt; already been purified. Once kundalini awakened, he directly w=\r\nent into \n&gt; samadhi, stayed there for 7 days and came back as a fully reali=\r\nzed person. \n&gt; But it is a much longer journey for most.\n&gt; \n&gt; Saying &quot;this =\r\nis what happens in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The \n&gt; exact experi=\r\nence changes from person to person, depending on the path \n&gt; traversed the =\r\nfinal point reached by Kundalini. However, I can say one thing \n&gt; confident=\r\nly: Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, one will not have any \n&gt; confus=\r\nion about what happened. But, until kundalini awakening occurs, one \n&gt; may =\r\nconfuse various other experiences (such as some movement of vayu in \n&gt; vari=\r\nous nadis) for kundalini movement and wrongly think that kundalini is \n&gt; aw=\r\nakened.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Sensation like ants or worms crawling=\r\n along the spine or in the head are NOT \n&gt; due to kundalini awakening or ri=\r\nse. That can be due to a little vaayu \n&gt; flowing in various nadis. This can=\r\n be a premonitory sign (but not a \n&gt; guarantee) of kundalini awakening. Sam=\r\ne thing can be said about the \n&gt; sensation of tilting  to one side (back or=\r\n left or right) or the sensation \n&gt; of having completely fallen back (even =\r\nthough one is sitting normally in \n&gt; reality). There are several such premo=\r\nnitory signs.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; As a reference, I can narrate t=\r\nhe experience of ONE person. He was \n&gt; meditating with a Veda mantra everyd=\r\nay. His guru had told him a few months \n&gt; earlier that his time for Kundali=\r\nni awakening had come. However, he had \n&gt; absolutely no idea what kundalini=\r\n was and was totally uninformed about \n&gt; nadis, chakras and kundalini. He d=\r\nid not engage in any specific raja/hatha \n&gt; yoga practices. All he did was =\r\nto sit with his back erect and eyes closed \n&gt; and meditate with a veda mant=\r\nra. In the weeks before kundalini awakening, he \n&gt; started experiencing var=\r\nious premonitory signs. He guru told him not to be \n&gt; distracted by them an=\r\nd to keep the focus on the mantra and try to forget \n&gt; everything else. Whe=\r\nn mind starts dwelling on an experience, it gets stuck \n&gt; there and cannot =\r\ngo higher.\n&gt; \n&gt; When he was meditating oneday, his mind was perfectly and i=\r\nntensely focused \n&gt; on the mantra and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Su=\r\nddenly he became \n&gt; aware of his body. It felt like there was a really trem=\r\nendous explosion at \n&gt; the base of his spine. Then it felt like a huge amou=\r\nnt of electric current \n&gt; was going up his spine from the base. Then it fel=\r\nt like he was not a body \n&gt; but a small point. Then it felt like he was goi=\r\nng up like a rocket at a \n&gt; tremendous speed. Then it felt like there was a=\r\n tremendously bright white \n&gt; light and there was nothing else. It felt lik=\r\ne he was not a small point in \n&gt; that light, but he was the light itself. T=\r\nhere was an undescribable sense of \n&gt; peace and happiness. Suddenly, from n=\r\nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is this? \n&gt; What happened to my body? I have r=\r\nesponsibilities still.&quot; Then he became \n&gt; aware of himself as a body sittin=\r\ng in pooja room. When he left pooja room \n&gt; and went out, he felt great lov=\r\ne for everyone and happiness. For example, a \n&gt; serial was coming on TV and=\r\n characters in the serial that he normally \n&gt; disliked for their shallow pe=\r\nrsonalities suddenly felt like real people and \n&gt; he had great love and com=\r\npassion for those TV serial characters (and other \n&gt; real people too). That=\r\n state of love and compassion lasted a while and then \n&gt; he was normal.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; This short experience was only the beginning of a journey. He experienced=\r\n \n&gt; many things later on. These experiences were different from each other.=\r\n As I \n&gt; said earlier, the experience varies based on the path traversed an=\r\nd the \n&gt; point reached by the self-awareness (kundalini). On various occasi=\r\nons, \n&gt; kundalini rose and he saw several sights and several beings within =\r\nand heard \n&gt; several sounds, including veda mantras and beejaaksharas, agai=\r\nn within.\n&gt; \n&gt; He realized the transientness of a lot that we cling on to a=\r\nnd the existence \n&gt; of something far higher and more permanent.\n&gt; \n&gt; All th=\r\nis slowly started to change his attitude. His senses turned inwards \n&gt; and =\r\nhe critically started to analyze his own thoughts and motives and worked \n&gt;=\r\n on correcting his attitude. The impact of what was happening around him, \n=\r\n&gt; what others did and said started to make lesser and lesser impact on him.=\r\n \n&gt; Luckily, he had a guru who put things in perspective and said that kund=\r\nalini \n&gt; awakening was just a beginning and the real work was ahead. Depend=\r\ning on \n&gt; one&#39;s readiness, that real work can take many many years or even =\r\nlives.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Kundalini awakening is only a beginnin=\r\ng. It is not an end. Even the rise of \n&gt; kundalini to a chakra is not an en=\r\nd. In fact, a big percentage of people \n&gt; with awakened kundalini end up ge=\r\ntting stuck at mooladhara itself. Very few \n&gt; make it to the next chakra or=\r\n the one after, but end up getting stuck there. \n&gt; Very very few make it to=\r\n higher chakras. And a very small minority actually \n&gt; realise self.\n&gt; \n&gt; C=\r\nomplete overcoming of ego and sthita prajnataa described by Sri Krishna in =\r\n\n&gt; BhagavadGita is the only real end goal of sadhana, whether you are into =\r\nraja \n&gt; yoga or karma yoga or bhakti yoga or jnaana yoga. Thinking of a mys=\r\ntical \n&gt; experience can only distract one from this goal. I urge sadhakas, =\r\nespecially \n&gt; those who respect my advice, to forget about kundalini and ch=\r\nakras and just \n&gt; keep doing homam and japam (or whatever path they have ch=\r\nosen), keep \n&gt; purifying themselves with sadhana, keep working on their att=\r\nitude and \n&gt; thought process and keep improving self-control. When (or as) =\r\nmind becomes \n&gt; purified and one overcomes ego, whatever needs to happen wi=\r\nth kundalini WILL \n&gt; happen automatically. Thinking of things in terms of k=\r\nundalini and mystical \n&gt; experiences is a big deterrent rather than a boost=\r\n, in one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; sadhana. Instead of trying to manipulate kundalini,=\r\n try to manipulate the \n&gt; way your mind works and perfect your self-control=\r\n. Kundalini will \n&gt; automatically follow. One will do well to remember thes=\r\ne words.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath =\r\nCentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message --=\r\n--- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 3:30 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\ne: Urdhwa-Retas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Relevant to this on going subject, i =\r\nremember reading autobiography of Shri \n&gt; Yogeshwarji (Prakah na Panthe) in=\r\n which he had mentioned that Kundalini \n&gt; Awakening is not mandatory for re=\r\nalization.

When one attains a perfect focus on a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; man=\r\ntra and distracting thoughts cease, praana moves downward from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lungs=\r\n/stomach and apaana moves upward.

This is similar to death, except \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that there=\r\n is fear and confusion at death and one may feel a kind of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bliss whe=\r\nn this happens during meditation.

How can i \n&gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhen the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; perso=\r\nnality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(=\r\nDevata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity =\r\ncommanding a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good =\r\nor be it that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is =\r\ncrucial. Ugra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himsel=\r\nf, so self \n&gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual ev=\r\nolution \n&gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very little=C2 accord=\r\ning to me which is black magic. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your S=\r\nhakti and deity is a higher shakti \n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKa=\r\nli, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( =\r\nProvided you have Vijnana). After the death \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadh=\r\naka joins the realm of the deity or if he was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a=\r\n Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Atta=\r\ncking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nof the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment( \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same At=\r\nma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karma=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is=\r\n not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the univer=\r\nse).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisach=\r\na, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, more=\r\nover=C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of identifi=\r\ncation with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are genera=\r\nlly termed as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirit=\r\ns which they have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable e=\r\nxperience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few life=\r\ntimes, then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and =\r\nsuch a sadhak \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because =\r\nof his previous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this=\r\n mantra only in this lifetime may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind=\r\n every mantra are crucial and may not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on s=\r\nome good day, do 1000 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C2 call this th=\r\ne=C2 Gayatri, but the real \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constr=\r\naints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rud=\r\nraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(fro=\r\nm the mind and the body, not just the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, gro=\r\nw a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels a=\r\nre empty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do t=\r\nhis whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality b=\r\nefore and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may =\r\nbe short, so do some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as l=\r\nong as is physically \n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of t=\r\nhe concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regar=\r\nds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a clarification from=\r\n me if you feel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
