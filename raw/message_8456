Whatever opinion \npeople want to hold of this tree and its peaches, good or bad, they are \nfree to do so.\n\nAll I am doing is to point out that I am a peach tree and not a mango \ntree. After that, whether people continue to pick my peaches (either \naccepting their being mere peaches or still believing that they are \nactually mangoes) or go elsewhere looking for real mangoes, is their \ncall.\n\nIt will not upset me if anyone sees me as a guru. But they should \nrealize that I do not see myself as a guru. Irresepctive of all this, I \nwill continue to do whatever I have been doing until now.\n\nHappy Guru Pournima!

What makes you a good role model/Guru/whether you like it or not, \n&gt; is your unquestionable honesty, not your &#39;perfection&#39;. I reserve &#39;my \n&gt; right&#39; to look up at you ; I understand that each individual has his \n&gt; own path, determined by both known and invisible forces driving us on \n&gt; each step of the way. SSS, for ex didn&#39;t work for me- but I was quite \n&gt; certain that your personal and intellectual spiritual honesty would \n&gt; always prevail in revealing the results of your research- what more \n&gt; can I ask for? You&#39;ve posted signs and that is by itself huge help. \n&gt; Your sharing of your understanding and journey has been tremendous \n&gt; help for my growth. You&#39;ve never asked to be followed, particularly \n&gt; not blindly, and I believe that&#39;s been  a huge incentive for \n&gt; individual efforts, exploration and growth.\n&gt; Thank you so much for being &#39;my rock&#39;over the years, thus helping me \n&gt; immensely .\n&gt;\n&gt; Happy Guru Pournima Narasimha\n&gt; Love,\n&gt; Anna   S.A.R.\n&gt; bonamente108@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com; vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com; \n&gt; JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com; JyotishWritings@yahoogroups.com; \n&gt; spjc_boston@yahoogroups.com Sent: Sunday, July 1, 2012 10:04:47 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-astrology] Happy Guru Pournima\n&gt;\n&gt;   Namaste friends,\n&gt;\n&gt; Happy Guru Pournima and I bow to the Guru Tattva that is present in \n&gt; all of you.\n&gt;\n&gt; On this occasion, I want to clarify one thing, on which I kept quiet \n&gt; for many years.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some people look up to me as a &quot;guru&quot;, in either astrology or \n&gt; spirituality or both.\n&gt;\n&gt; When it comes to astrology, people who follow me should have known by \n&gt; now that I am still searching for something that satisfies me. The \n&gt; knowledge/ignorance I keep sharing (because that is the best I can do \n&gt; now) is most likely different from what rishis meant. So there is no \n&gt; point in looking up to me as a &quot;guru&quot; and following me with fervour. \n&gt; Do your own search instead (and maximize the chance of someone finding \n&gt; truth).\n&gt;\n&gt; When it comes to spirituality, I am NOT an enlightened person and not \n&gt; capable of making anyone enlightened. Even if the un-enlightened \n&gt; spiritual state I am in is good enough for someone, I do not know how \n&gt; to replicate it in someone, either through writings or talks or \n&gt; thoughts. In other words, I am capable of giving one NEITHER what one \n&gt; needs in the long run NOR what I have right now. All I can give \n&gt; others, through my writings, is an understanding that is qualified by \n&gt; their and my conditioning (like a white conch exchanged between two \n&gt; people with dirty hands may have the dirty hand prints of the giver or \n&gt; the taker). Yes, I can also share knowhow of some tools that may help \n&gt; you in your pursuit, but that does not make me a guru either.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is not just some humble talk, but the *unquestionable* and honest \n&gt; reality. It is better if people who are somehow fascinated with me \n&gt; and/or look up to me as a guru and think about me with reverence, \n&gt; divert that attention and reverence towards God. Unlike me, God CAN \n&gt; make you a better astrologer or a better spiritual sadhaka or both.\n&gt;\n&gt; Happy Guru Pournima again!\n&gt;\n&gt; Love & regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n"}}
