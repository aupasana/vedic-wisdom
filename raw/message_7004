I know \n&gt; someone whose daughter is suffering from ment=\r\nal disorder/depression. She \n&gt; has=A0generally had a weak mind but the situ=\r\nation right now is quite bad.\n&gt; Time and again it has been emphasized that =\r\nhoma helps overcome/destroy previous \n&gt; bad karmas and such mental conditio=\r\nns are nothing but a result of previous bad \n&gt; karmas. If homa is to be per=\r\nformed, for which deity would you recommend in this \n&gt; situation? Just to l=\r\net you know, their favorite deity is Ganapati, so I am \n&gt; thinking Ganapati=\r\n homa should be enough but your opinion in this matter would be \n&gt; nice.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Bhupendra\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
