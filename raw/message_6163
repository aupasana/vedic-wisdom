In lieu of a proper kundam I use a\nstainless steel pot as a support for a stainless bowl, and this\nparticular arrangement proved to be just right viz the smoke problem.\nLet me elaborate: the bowl&#39;s bottom is not laying on a surface,\ninstead ti is supported by the bowl&#39;s rim, being inserted into a pot,\nand hence the bottom gets very hot resulting in better combustion and\nless smoke. (at the same time the pot does not get too hot)\n\nThe other smoke-free detail is keeping a fuel supply to a minimum,\nincluding the ghee and grains. As a result you get a nice flame and\nless smoke. I know, it is difficult not to throw too much, but\npractice calms your passion.\n\nNowadays I get nice and uniform flames, very small amount of smoke and\nonly a very small amount of cinder at the end of a procedure.\n\nIf only my Sanskrit improved that much :lol:\n\nDavor\n\n"}}
