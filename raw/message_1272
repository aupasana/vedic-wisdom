I am curious as =\r\nto how you dispose of the homam ashes everyday?\n\n2. On the usage of puffed =\r\nrice, dhanyams etc, Are these to be used\n   dipped in ghee? \n   I have read=\r\n somewhere for e.g. that sesame seeds are dipped in ghee\n   for the offerin=\r\ng.\n\n3. Like another gentleman asked, What is the brihat or extended\n   proc=\r\nedure? I see that the Jayadi homam step and\n   punyahavachanam, Varuna pooj=\r\na at the beginning etc are missing.\n   For completeness, would you elaborat=\r\ne on the missing steps?\n\n4. A suggestion. \n   Please post references to the=\r\n source of each step/mantra.\n   I feel that this would greatly solidify the=\r\n document and make it\n   formal. I completely understand that this is meant=\r\n as a spiritual\n   guide, and yet one doesn&#39;t preclude the other.\n   \n   Fo=\r\nr example: What is the source of using the chamakam verses in\n   the Vasord=\r\nhara step?\n   My suggestion is to post it exactly as one would in a scienti=\r\nfic\n   paper, with a reference number, and the last page listing\n   the ref=\r\nerence sources.\n   Similarly on the verses used in Uttarangam etc.\n\n   \n   =\r\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
