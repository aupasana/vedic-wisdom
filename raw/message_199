Even today, a very very \nvery small portion of earth is inhabited. It is very likely that an even \nsmaller portion of earth was inhabited then. The odds of conducting \nexcavations at the correct place to the correct depth to discover a 2 \nmillion year old civilization are very low.\n\nThe suggestion that Rama lived just 2,500 years before Krishna is, honestly \nspeaking, quite silly.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, February 19, 2008 1:33 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help\n\n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
