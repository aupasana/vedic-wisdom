The best way t=\r\no suppress other thoughts is to move the mind back to mantra whenever one o=\r\nbserves another stream of thought, without any guilt or frustration.

We tell hi=\r\nm that he should go to so and so institution (e.g. IIT, IISc, , REC, IIM et=\r\nc). But we know that going to IIT or getting 90% score in exams is NOT the =\r\ngoal of education. The goal of education is to understand the subject well =\r\nand have a good career. It is possible to get 90% score without understandi=\r\nng well and it is possible to go to IIT and not understand the subject well=\r\n.\n\nSimilarly, the goal of spiritual sadhana is to get better control over m=\r\nind, overcome the internal enemies as much as possible and become liberated=\r\n. But, we tell people to do so and so\n rituals, follow so and so procedures=\r\n/formulas , go to so and so temple etc.\n\nSome formulas were created so that=\r\n there is some structure to sadhana. But there is nothing absolute about th=\r\nose\n formulas.\n\nYes, if your gurus told you the formula of n times japam, n=\r\n/10 times homam, n/100 times tarpana etc and you want to follow it, please =\r\ndo so. No harm in it. Some people believe that such a procedure gives &quot;sidd=\r\nhi&quot; in a mantra.\n\nHowever, please note that there are many people who did p=\r\nurascharanas using such formulas and did not really get any &quot;siddhi&quot; in the=\r\n mantra. On the other hand, there are people who did not stick to those for=\r\nmulas and yet found god through the mantra.\n\nIn my opinion, you can do just=\r\n japam with a mantra without worrying about 1/10th count homam, 1/100th cou=\r\nnt tarpana etc. Or you can also do a mantra entirely in homam without any j=\r\napam or tarpana. Choose one practice and do it until your mind is so absorb=\r\ned in it that your mind is chanting that mantra sub-consciously when it is =\r\nfree (like some people hum catchy songs when they are free).\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *\n\nRegarding the astrological formulas for evaluating the impact of a mant=\r\nra, I would like disown those concepts originally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath =\r\nand shared by me in my astrology classes. There are many technicalities, bu=\r\nt many many corruptions in the way knowledge is preserved. Most rules and t=\r\nechnicalities of mantra shashtra apply to people who do prayogas to get spe=\r\ncific material results (and naturally those rules have been intentionally c=\r\norrupted by Nature in preparation of deepening Kali).\n\nBottomline is that a=\r\n mantra done for spiritual progress works based on your mental visualizatio=\r\nn of the mantra and its deity and the latent forces of conditioning in your=\r\n mind. All the house calculations based on the numbers of letters and numbe=\r\nr of words are irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mantra like Gayatri mantra can =\r\nbe done by anyone without worrying about technicalities.\n\nRegarding adding =\r\n&quot;Om&quot;\n or &quot;Om Bhur bhuvas suvah&quot; or Om bhuh om bhuvah om suvah om mahah..&quot; e=\r\ntc, there are many standard approaches. I suggest using what you were taugh=\r\nt by your gurus and not worrying too much about it.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nUtpal =\r\nasked about count vs time. Counts sometimes force people to speed things up=\r\n. In my humble opinion, it is fine or even better to set a time limit (e.g.=\r\n one hour, two hours etc) and do japam for that time irrespective of the co=\r\nunt.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Le=\r\nssons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam an=\r\nd Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that\n make a\n difference: http://Saraswat=\r\niFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- -\n\n--- On Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. c=\r\nom&gt; wrote:\nFrom: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Re: Repost:Manishji&#39; s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure\nTo: vedic-wis=\r\ndom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 11:47 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Narasimhagaru, \n=C2=A0\nThank you for suc=\r\nh a nice explanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see s=\r\nignificant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatr=\r\ni Japam in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in=\r\n future I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was o=\r\nne a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months a=\r\nnd then I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, howe=\r\nver, I have called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) an=\r\nd we all did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our =\r\nSharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam,=\r\n sahasramsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the n=\r\number of brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be =\r\nfed, to finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big =\r\njapams must be done. Can you shed more light on\n this? \n=C2=A0\nAlso, Gayatr=\r\ni mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if the =\r\nvyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah=\r\n=C2=A0). How should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th ho=\r\nuse, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explanati=\r\non? Sorry for digressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly integrated =\r\nhere and could not avoid this question). Please tell me if my interpretatio=\r\nn is right and also please tell me which approach is better. \n=C2=A0\nNagraj=\r\n\n\n--- On Wed, 1/20/10, Narasimha P.V.R.

Then =\r\npossibly give a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like that=\r\n, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.\n\nOf course, if needs no break, one c=\r\nan do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be =\r\ndifficult for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.\n\nFor succe=\r\nss in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex and c=\r\nontrol of anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti (pur=\r\nifying energy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses some s=\r\nhakti.\n\nEvery factor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. The =\r\ntradition of growing beard exists in many religions and it is not without a=\r\n reason. We discussed this sometime back.\n\nIf one is living a lifestyle whe=\r\nre one avoids\n contact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. living=\r\n in a remote monastery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one i=\r\ns living a lifestyle where one comes in contact with tempting situations re=\r\ngularly (e.g. living in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), b=\r\neard can be very useful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is=\r\n not the complete solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a rail=\r\ning on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding of=\r\nf the hill at night but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control,=\r\n similarly a beard can help a person with decent control over the mind to r=\r\netain control in some tricky situations.\n\nTrimming beard is ok.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n\nIf one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of=\r\n hours) everyday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,\n \nwhile follo=\r\nwing the simple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the same=\r\n direction, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one key =\r\nthing and sitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes clo=\r\nsed is the other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost ze=\r\nro if the body is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is a=\r\n chance that mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is still=\r\n for even a moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to be=\r\ning still, it will become still more often and for longer times. Then vario=\r\nus kinds of samadhis become possible.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Free =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri\n Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that mak=\r\ne a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n--- On Wed, 1/20/10, =\r\nNagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yah=\r\noo. com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Repost:Manishji&#39; s savitur gayatri sad=\r\nhana procedure\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Wednesday, January =\r\n20, 2010, 8:40 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great mail and very inspiring. =\r\nHowever, I have one question on Sri Manishji&#39;s advise on how to carry out t=\r\nhe sadhana.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; again experience the=\r\n Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correct=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npersonality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; Deit=\r\ny(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity =\r\ncommanding a\n&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or =\r\nbe it that\n&gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucia=\r\nl. Ugra\n&gt;\n &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so se=\r\nlf\n&gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n continues.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very little=C3=82 according to me =\r\nwhich is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and dei=\r\nty is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinna=\r\nmasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have V=\r\nijnana). After the death\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of=\r\n the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate =\r\nrealm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the=\r\n full bearing of karma onto the heads\n&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people =\r\nmay realise this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath bu=\r\nrying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt;\n Shakti causing an earthquake). Some p=\r\neople may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action =\r\nand reaction.(Bit like you attack\n&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a r=\r\nesult of this from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetim=\r\nes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the univer=\r\nse and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, =\r\nbecause your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, i=\r\ne God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed =\r\nby a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can=\r\n be used, moreover=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be fr=\r\nee of identification with\n&gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which=\r\n are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the sam=\r\ne spirits\n which they have\n&gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoy=\r\nable experience.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few =\r\nlifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and=\r\n such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of=\r\n his previous\n&gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra=\r\n only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every man=\r\ntra are crucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; According to =\r\nme the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; suggest an easy=\r\n sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 100=\r\n0\n&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call this the=C3=82 Gayatri, but=\r\n the real\n&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; Same time =\r\nevery day.\n&gt; &gt; Same\n place.\n&gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; As =\r\nlittle movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your incl=\r\nination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs befo=\r\nre you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; Con=\r\ntinue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; See the di=\r\nfference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is=\r\n important is that life may be short, so do some\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist w=\r\nith that sadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; I hope this=\r\n clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nKind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a\n cl=\r\narification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET=\r\n now has a personality.

We tell him that he should go to so and so institution (e.g. =\r\nIIT, IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we know that going to IIT or getting 90% sc=\r\nore in exams is NOT the goal of education. The goal of education is to unde=\r\nrstand the subject well and have a good career. It is possible to get 90% s=\r\ncore without understanding well and it is possible to go to IIT and not und=\r\nerstand the subject well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, the goal of spiritual sadhana i=\r\ns to get better control over mind, overcome the internal enemies as much as=\r\n possible and become liberated. But, we tell people to do so and so\n ritual=\r\ns, follow so and so procedures/formulas , go to so and so temple etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Some formulas were created so that there is some structure to sadhana. Bu=\r\nt there is nothing absolute about those\n formulas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, if your guru=\r\ns told you the formula of n times japam, n/10 times homam, n/100 times tarp=\r\nana etc and you want to follow it, please do so. No harm in it. Some people=\r\n believe that such a procedure gives &quot;siddhi&quot; in a mantra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, =\r\nplease note that there are many people who did purascharanas using such for=\r\nmulas and did not really get any &quot;siddhi&quot; in the mantra. On the other hand,=\r\n there are people who did not stick to those formulas and yet found god thr=\r\nough the mantra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my opinion, you can do just japam with a mantra =\r\nwithout worrying about 1/10th count homam, 1/100th count tarpana etc. Or yo=\r\nu can also do a mantra entirely in homam without any japam or tarpana. Choo=\r\nse one practice and do it until your mind is so absorbed in it that your mi=\r\nnd is chanting that mantra sub-consciously when it is free (like some peopl=\r\ne hum catchy songs when they are free).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regar=\r\nding the astrological formulas for evaluating the impact of a mantra, I wou=\r\nld like disown those concepts originally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath and share=\r\nd by me in my astrology classes. There are many technicalities, but many ma=\r\nny corruptions in the way knowledge is preserved. Most rules and technicali=\r\nties of mantra shashtra apply to people who do prayogas to get specific mat=\r\nerial results (and naturally those rules have been intentionally corrupted =\r\nby Nature in preparation of deepening Kali).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottomline is that a ma=\r\nntra done for spiritual progress works based on your mental visualization o=\r\nf the mantra and its deity and the latent forces of conditioning in your mi=\r\nnd. All the house calculations based on the numbers of letters and number o=\r\nf words are irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mantra like Gayatri mantra can be =\r\ndone by anyone without worrying about technicalities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding addi=\r\nng &quot;Om&quot;\n or &quot;Om Bhur bhuvas suvah&quot; or Om bhuh om bhuvah om suvah om mahah..=\r\n&quot; etc, there are many standard approaches. I suggest using what you were ta=\r\nught by your gurus and not worrying too much about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utpal asked about count vs time.

In my humble opinion, it is fine or even better to set a t=\r\nime limit (e.g. one hour, two hours etc) and do japam for that time irrespe=\r\nctive of the count.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films tha=\r\nt\n make a\n difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; J=\r\nyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;br&gt;------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;i&gt;&lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b=\r\n&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;=\r\nFrom: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Re: Repost:Manishji&#39; s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;Date: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 11:47 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1620719101&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygr=\r\np-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cells=\r\npacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-family: inherit; font-style: inhe=\r\nrit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-=\r\nsize-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Narasimha=\r\ngaru, &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thank you for such a nice explanation. =\r\nEven with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see significant progress in=\r\n terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam in the past. D=\r\nid not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in future I will practis=\r\ne with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was one a lakh purascharana=\r\n (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months and then I did a homam =\r\nto complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have called abo=\r\nut 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did chant the=\r\n mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji instructed us=\r\n to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa for marjan=\r\nam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brahmins (so =\r\nbasically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finish the rit=\r\nual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big japams must be done. C=\r\nan you shed more light on\n this? &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Also, Gayatr=\r\ni mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if the =\r\nvyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah&n=\r\nbsp;). How should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th hous=\r\ne, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explanation=\r\n? Sorry for digressing into astrology !

Then =\r\npossibly give a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like that=\r\n, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, if needs no break,=\r\n one can do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) m=\r\nay be difficult for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;For success in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint fr=\r\nom sex and control of anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of=\r\n shakti (purifying energy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one =\r\nloses some shakti.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every factor contributes a little to success. Bea=\r\nrd is useful. The tradition of growing beard exists in many religions and i=\r\nt is not without a reason. We discussed this sometime back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one i=\r\ns living a lifestyle where one avoids\n contact with any tempting situations=\r\n altogether (e.g. living in a remote monastery), beard may or may not add m=\r\nuch value. But, if one is living a lifestyle where one comes in contact wit=\r\nh tempting situations regularly (e.g. living in the modern world with a fam=\r\nily and job and a TV), beard can be very useful. As I said earlier when we =\r\ndiscussed this, beard is not the complete solution but a small part of the =\r\nsolution. Just as a railing on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly mo=\r\nving car from sliding off the hill at night but be unable to stop a fast mo=\r\nving car out of control, similarly a beard can help a person with decent co=\r\nntrol over the mind to retain control in some tricky situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tri=\r\nmming beard is ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one indeed does 1000 tim=\r\nes Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) everyday for one year whil=\r\ne maintaining brahmacharya,\n &lt;br&gt;while following the simple rules of same p=\r\nlace, same time everyday and facing the same direction, one will certainly =\r\nmake good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sitting still with an=\r\n erect back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the other thing. The pro=\r\nbability of mind becoming still is almost zero if the body is not still. If=\r\n the body can be kept very still, there is a chance that mind will also bec=\r\nome still for a moment. If the mind is still for even a moment, it will cau=\r\nse great bliss. As mind gets more used to being still, it will become still=\r\n more often and for longer times. Then various kinds of samadhis become pos=\r\nsible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software=\r\n, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manual=\r\ns for short Homam and Pitri\n Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituali=\r\nty: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writing=\r\ns: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;br&gt;------------ -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Wed=\r\n, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;i&gt;&lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nblockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;From: Nagraj =\r\nKota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Repost:Man=\r\nishji&#39; s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com&lt;br&gt;Date: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 8:40 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1=\r\n423440994&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;table border=\r\n=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nfamily: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;&quot; valign=\r\n=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;This is a great mail and very inspiring.

So, should =\r\nwe do 3000 times japam in a day for 100 days or do 1000 times every day for=\r\n&nbsp;300 days? He also says &#39;Grow a beard&#39;. Now, in a professional corpora=\r\nte life, that could be a difficult thing. How about trimming it?.... just t=\r\no be tolerable to other people.

How can i&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in=\r\n the sadhak or the deity commanding a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen(=\r\n be it what appears to be good or be it that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; which appears to =\r\nbe bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; devatas ma=\r\nke the person care almost for nothing himself, so self&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; identif=\r\nication is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; cont=\r\ninues.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very little=C3=82 according to=\r\n me which is black magic.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your S=\r\nhakti and deity is a higher shakti&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, =\r\nMahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; will be that of G=\r\nod himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of the=\r\n body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; beings.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full be=\r\naring of karma onto the heads&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people=\r\n may realise this to their detriment(&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandh=\r\nar Nath burying the city of Patan with his&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Shakti causing an =\r\nearthquake). Some people may even equate this with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic=\r\n. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\na normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few =\r\nkarmas&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because you=\r\nr attack is not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie =\r\nGod or the universe).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti po=\r\nssesed by a small Pisacha,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little =\r\nShakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; then their minds and =\r\nintellects will not be free of identification with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the body an=\r\nd so their actions are those which are generally termed as&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; bla=\r\nck magic. These people usually join the same spirits\n which they have&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, the=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such=\r\n a sadhak&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(becaus=\r\ne of his previous&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; effort).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; On the other hand some=\r\nbody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; feel that the=\r\n 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ach=\r\neive in this lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the puddin=\r\ng is in the eating, so let me&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call this the=C3=82 Gayatri, bu=\r\nt the real&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Same time every day.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same\n place.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same m=\r\naterials.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same direction.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; As little movement as o=\r\nne can.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just t=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Do no=\r\nt eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nbefore you start.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole=\r\n procedure 3 times.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality bef=\r\nore and after.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life=\r\n may be short, so do some&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadha=\r\nna for as long as is physically&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; possible.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope =\r\nthis clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; manish&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; You may post this on the list as a\n clarification from me if you feel&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td=\r\n&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a personali=\r\nty.
