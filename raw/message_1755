Today was the third day of homam and i t=\r\nhought it went better than the first two days. i liked the sound of crackli=\r\nng fire while meditating on the mantra.\n\ni want to ask a few questions. som=\r\nehow, i feel more comfortable meditating on Mahamrityunjaya mantra than pro=\r\nnouncing the mantra aloud. is it ok do do so without producing sound (vaikh=\r\nri?)? \n\ntoday i felt that i should do the homam every day. is is ok if i do=\r\n this in the evening when i come back from work...say 7-7.30 p.m.?\n\nFor som=\r\ne reason, real or imagined, i am drawn to fire but am also afraid of it. pe=\r\nople who have seen my horoscope have told me that i should be wary of fire =\r\nprobably because i have rahu and mars in 8th house in Saggi - aspected by S=\r\nun (and also Jupiter and Merc). Seven months ago my mother-in-law got burnt=\r\n while doing Puja and passed away.This incident took place right in front o=\r\nf me. \n\ni have not been a believer of rituals...or a personal deity. So one=\r\n of my problems was who should i meditate to while performing homam. Then o=\r\nn this very forum there was a discussion on mahamrityunjaya mantra and i th=\r\nought this should be right for me. i also realise that Triyambake could be =\r\nan ugra form of shiva.\n\nsometime back i had visited Thiruvanamallai and did=\r\n girivalam...Am curious about the &quot;fire&quot; in / near Chennai that has been me=\r\nntioned in your introductory write-up on homam.\n\nThankyou!\n\nbest wishes and=\r\n regards\n\n\n"}}
