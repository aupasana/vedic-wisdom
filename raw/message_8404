Feeling and hea=\r\nrt is more important than counting and numbers.\n\nBut how does feeling come?=\r\n Though japa! That is the paradox. Sivananda says, even if it is mechanical=\r\n sometimes, keep doing it. The mind will be purified and one day, feeling w=\r\nill come, devotion will arise.\n\nSome of my favourite quotations on the powe=\r\nr of japa:\n\nSwami Sivananda\n&quot;Religion Means &#39;To Do.&#39; It is only the one two=\r\n little acts that you actually do, that constitute religion and spiritualit=\r\ny. To rise early and take the name of the Lord for ten minutes is what real=\r\n dharma is.&quot;\nMore from him on japa \n\nhttp://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teaching=\r\ns/japayoga.htm\n\nSwami Chidananda (ace disciple of Swami Sivananda)\n&quot;One&#39;s d=\r\nay should start first with purifying, with cleaning, sweeping, making clean=\r\n! Cleanse, cleanse - by uttering God&#39;s Name, by thinking of God. The Name o=\r\nf God is verily God Himself. Supreme Divinity is present here. Name and God=\r\n are not two. They are one and the same. Name is God!&quot;\n\nAnandamayi Ma\n&quot;List=\r\nen! Do not let your time pass idly. Either keep a rosary with you and do ja=\r\npa; or if this does not suit you, at least go on repeating the Name of the =\r\nLord regularly and without interruption like the ticking of a clock. There =\r\nare no rules or restrictions in this. Invoke Him by the Name that appeals t=\r\no you most, for as much time as you can--the longer the better. Even if you=\r\n get tired or lose interest, administer the Name to yourself like a medicin=\r\ne that has to be taken. In this way you will at some auspicious moment disc=\r\nover the rosary of the mind, and then you will continually hear within your=\r\nself the praises of the great Master, the Lord of Creation, like the never =\r\nceasing music of the boundless ocean; You will hear the land and the sea, t=\r\nhe air and the heavens reverberate with the song of His glory. This is call=\r\ned the all--pervading Presence of His Name.&quot;\n\nPriyank, thanks very much for=\r\n the message. Warren Buffet...cool! I will try and do homam more often- I r=\r\neally enjoy it. Will schedule one for tomorrow evening after work if possib=\r\nle. Good start to the Navaratri (had never heard about this Navaratri befor=\r\ne). \n\nRakesh ji, thanks for the message. You are quite right. Even breathin=\r\ng for God...that would be a great state to be in...no idea when I&#39;m going t=\r\no get there. Anyway peserverence is key. \n\nI think that nobody but God can =\r\nget us to do Sadhana. I believe that God walked every step of the way on th=\r\ne path for the saints... nay, actually DID the sadhana for them ultimately.=\r\n I know we have to &quot;make an effort&quot; and meet God halfway, but ultimately it=\r\n is She and He who get us to make the effort. That&#39;s why I said &quot;Damn you D=\r\nurga&quot;....because You made some people make that supreme effort....You alone=\r\n were their Sadhana Shakti....and what about the rest of Your wretched chil=\r\ndren? What sort of partial mother are you hmm? You did it for Mira, Rabia, =\r\nPapa Ramdas, but what about all of us eh? What sort of game is this? Anyway=\r\n, it&#39;s Her game, that&#39;s the bottom line... what can we do except play along=\r\n (we have to believe it&#39;s ultimately for our own good).\n\nOk chaps, going to=\r\n do some japa now. Less talk and more action hey!\n\nBest wishes, and happy N=\r\navaratri (let&#39;s get in to high gear as Priyank ji says),\n\nAparna \n\n\n\n\n\n--- =\r\nIn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Hey Aparna, \n&gt; \n&gt; After i sent that link mails i got 2 kick-in-face mail t=\r\nhat were very apt. writing this to you is kind of reaffirming that to mysel=\r\nf. i also over intellectualize so opportunity to answer myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Forget=\r\n all the calculation, theories, all literature. \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any manual g=\r\nood enough to teach love and surrender ? Just develop a intense longing lov=\r\ne for one form and feel the pangs of longing, develop the intensity so that=\r\n the longing consume you.  the name will repeat itself easily u wont have t=\r\no worry. Forget the counts god can count. \n&gt; \n&gt; Do a homam, 15 min a day, t=\r\nhat a open heart surgery. the panchopachr puja of offering 5 elements (isnt=\r\n that tantra) is as powerful as biggest tantra sadhana if done with full lo=\r\nve/surrender.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your link of ramkrishan about surrendering all emotions =\r\nwas bang on target. not because it was a great article in itself but becaus=\r\ne you are doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Intellectualize becomes a hurdle which heart is no=\r\nt able to cross. \n&gt; \n&gt; You said you got diksha for a mantra from a monk in =\r\nshivananda tradition. do you know what that means - Thats like warren buffe=\r\nt giving you an addon debit card to his bank balance.\n&gt; \n&gt; and as for purus=\r\ncharan/count and activating a mantra many people are able to activate at 1/=\r\n10 counts, many not able to at even 10x counts, and many are able to activa=\r\nte seemingly wrong words &quot;hat para (get lost)&quot; as their mantra.  ????\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nthanks for letting me answer &quot;myself&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadha=\r\nna with whatever intention, they will achieve that.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_1080@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This business of repeating God Name, that Nobody ji mentioned...=\r\nit ain&#39;t no joke ...doing it I mean! I tried today, and boy, it was hard...=\r\nfailed mostly, to be honest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But every sage Ramakrishna, Anandamay=\r\ni Ma, Ammachi, Sivananda, Chaitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, every one of=\r\n them was obsessed with this Name business. That means, there must be somet=\r\nhing to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I really want to take up Nobody ji&#39;s suggestion and get =\r\nobsessed with the Name. I firmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick) a fe=\r\nw times, and the Name helped me (have had 2-3 black outs when I was unwell,=\r\n long story, but basically, I was conscious during these black outs, and it=\r\n felt like I was dying...and it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts exce=\r\npt the Name &quot;Keshava please help me&quot; or &quot;Narayana&quot;). These episodes scared =\r\nthe bejesus out of me, and each time I came out of them, I felt &quot;I MUST DO =\r\nMORE JAPA&quot; it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;ll save me. All else is of no use when =\r\nI&#39;m in deep sh*t (pardon my language), the Name alone is reliable.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n What I&#39;m trying to say, is I want to devise some practical ways to get ser=\r\nious about this sadhana. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a=\r\n big fan of japa, and especially of Purascharana (repeating mantra as many =\r\nlakhs as there are syllables in the mantra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so=\r\n one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetitions). He went on to say that 14 crore =\r\nof japa with feeling would result in Darshan of God in physical form, face =\r\nto face. That would be great! Really wanted to do it...but when I did the m=\r\naths, I worked out that, at the rate of 12 hours japa a day, every single d=\r\nay from now on, it would take me till age 83 to finish this. :( \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nut hey, I decided to make a start anyway, and began my my first Purascharan=\r\na of the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in January this year, I am doing a meas=\r\nley 11 rounds a day, with my mind wandering most of the time (hard core peo=\r\nple do hundreds of rounds with proper concentration daily). I&#39;m a slow chan=\r\nter, and need to say the mantra loudly or in a barely audible whisper. My m=\r\nental chanting is gradually improving but very difficult to do for more tha=\r\nn 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonna take me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. =\r\nThen my plan is to take a 3 month break (and do 7 rounds a day), and then s=\r\ntart another Purascharana. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, two things help me get my 11 r=\r\nounds of japa done every day when I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thought I&#39;d mention=\r\n it, if anybody&#39;s interested, just in case it&#39;s helpful. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One is T=\r\nelephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend I&#39;m on the phone. Wh=\r\nile doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and count the japa on my finge=\r\nrs. I get a couple of rounds done during my working day this way (I check c=\r\narefully to make sure nobody&#39;s listening). Also while stuck in traffic (whi=\r\nle the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pieces on, and pretend I=\r\n&#39;m chatting to a friend on the phone and do a couple of rounds. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe other thing that I find useful (now please excuse the phrase), is &quot;Toile=\r\nt japa&quot;. When I need to escape to do a round or two of japa at work, I excu=\r\nse myself for a few minutes and lock myself up in a toilet cubicle. I then =\r\nvery very quietly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving=\r\n, no sound audible, in case anybody hears). I do about 2 sessions of this a=\r\n day. This allows me to complete my 11 rounds a day, on days when my workin=\r\ng hours are long. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know this sounds bonkers, but I thought I&#39;d m=\r\nention this for anyone else whose work life interferes with their japa. At =\r\nleast, it provides a solution to doing a bit of japa at work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If a=\r\nnybody else has any thoughts/suggestions, on how to repeat God&#39; Name consta=\r\nntly, kindly share. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
