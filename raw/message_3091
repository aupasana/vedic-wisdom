As you can w=\r\nell understand from his poetry, his realization was quite different from tr=\r\naditional Islamic learning. Bulle Shah was quite disliked by muslims of his=\r\n time. He was a pacifist and a true saint.\n=C2=A0\nMost people consider Sufi=\r\nsm or Sufiana=C2=A0to be a branch of Islam. My personal view is different. =\r\nIn most of the poetry I have read of famous Sufi sants like Jal=C4=81l ad-D=\r\n=C4=ABn Mu=E1=B8=A5ammad Balkh=C4=AB Rumi convince me that their personal r=\r\nealization was quite different from Islamic doctrins. As such the roots of =\r\nthe Sufi philosphy like in pre Islamic Persian and India. The mystics of th=\r\nese areas, specially Persia, after it was over run by Islam, in order to pr=\r\notect their philosophy garbed it with Islamic terminologies and names. Othe=\r\nrwise they would have faced sure shot slaughter. That was a means of self p=\r\nreservation which in turn, over years, helped a lot of muslims in treading =\r\na more sublime path - IMHO -=C2=A0than that which comes from the Ahadiths a=\r\nnd the Koran proper.\n=C2=A0\nFor example Rumi talks a about something simila=\r\nr to=C2=A0reincarnation in some of his poems while the following one does t=\r\nalk about communion with God:\n=C2=A0\nI searched for God among the Christian=\r\ns and on the Cross and therein I found Him not.\nI went into the ancient tem=\r\nples of idolatry; no trace of Him was there.\nI entered the mountain cave of=\r\n Hira and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found not.\nWith set purpose=\r\n I fared to the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habit=\r\nation.\nThen I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young;=\r\n God was not there even.\nTurning to philosophy I inquired about him from ib=\r\nn Sina but found Him not within his range.\nI fared then to the scene of the=\r\n Prophet&#39;s experience of a great divine manifestation only a &quot;two bow-lengt=\r\nhs&#39; distance from him&quot; but God was not there even in that exalted court.\nFi=\r\nnally, I looked into my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nCommunion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. =\r\nThe creator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is K=\r\nufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my in=\r\nterpretation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Isl=\r\namic garb. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThe person who changed the life of Rumi was also =\r\nanother Sufi called=C2=A0 Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular l=\r\negend which says Shams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead. One d=\r\nay the mullas caught up with him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went t=\r\no a dead body and said, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happe=\r\nned. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my=\r\n name, wake up!&quot; and the dead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him =\r\nfor doing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah=\r\n as per true Islam - and executed him.\n=C2=A0\nSame was with case with Mansu=\r\nr-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means=\r\n I am the Truth. This statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional =\r\nIslam. \n=C2=A0\nAuliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaa=\r\nlis in India. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lo=\r\nrd Shiva for a son before Shivaji was born.\n=C2=A0\nGenerally, except for th=\r\ne famous=C2=A0Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufi=\r\ns saint. \n=C2=A0\nThough Sufis always showed a different more subjective int=\r\nerpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never fooled=\r\n. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do not=\r\n blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths with tell you i=\r\nn no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God comm=\r\nunion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my views of what ails =\r\nIslam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, traditional and =\r\nauthentic version of Islam is to be followed.\n=C2=A0\nBTW, Sufi ideas are qu=\r\nite famous in modern day cities where we find the fashionably spiritual hig=\r\nher middle class.
