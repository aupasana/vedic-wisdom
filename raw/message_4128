Would the mantra be written in the Veda without the intended Sandhi applied?\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha, on your website your rendering is in agreement with what I thought was the true mantra. Are the Sandhi rules to be applied between all words in Sanskrit or are there exceptions?\n&gt; \n&gt; I sincerely hope this is not too off topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Andri Lindbergs\n\n\n"}}
