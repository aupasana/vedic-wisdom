The famous author of a commentary on the Gita and of the Advaita-Si=\r\nddhi, Swami Madhusudana Saraswati, had direct Darsan of Lord Krishna throug=\r\nh Japa of the Mantra of Lord Krishna. The reputed Swami Vidyaranya, the aut=\r\nhor of the Panchadasi had direct Darsan of Mother Gayatri through Japa of G=\r\nayatri Mantra.\n\nAt the present moment many educated persons and college-stu=\r\ndents have lost faith in the power of Mantra, owing to the morbid influence=\r\n of the study of science. They have entirely given up Japa. It is highly de=\r\nplorable indeed. When the blood is warm they become hot-headed, proud and a=\r\ntheistic. Their brains and minds need a thorough overhauling and drastic fl=\r\nushing.\n\nLife is short. Time is fleeting. The world is full of miseries. Cu=\r\nt the knot of Avidya, and drink the Nirvanic Bliss. That day on which you d=\r\no not perform any Japa is simply wasted. Those who simply eat, drink and sl=\r\neep and do not practise any Japa are horizontal beings only.\n\nA Mantra, in =\r\nthe Hindu religion, has a Rishi who gave it to the world; a metre which gov=\r\nerns the inflection of the voice; and a Devata or a supernatural being, hig=\r\nher or lower, as its informing power. The Bija, seed, is a significant word=\r\n, or series of words, which gives it a special power. Sometimes this word i=\r\ns a sound which harmonises with the key-note of the individual using it and=\r\n varies it with individuals; sometimes this word expresses the essence of t=\r\nhe Mantra, and the result of the Mantra is the flower springing from this s=\r\need. The Sakti is the energy of the form of the Mantra, i.e., the vibration=\r\n-forms set up by its sounds. These carry the man to the Devata that is wors=\r\nhipped. The Kilaka, the pillar, is that which supports and makes strong the=\r\n Mantra, or the pin which fastens the Mantra together; this is the ceasing =\r\nof sorrow, by the freeing of oneself from imperfections.\n\nDo not bother you=\r\nrself about Mantra, Para and Pasyanti, etc. Do Japa of your Ishta Mantra me=\r\nntally with its meaning and right Bhava. You will realise the spiritual ben=\r\nefits. Why do you waste your time in counting the pebbles on the bank? Take=\r\n a dip immediately in the Ganges and enjoy the bath. Become wise.\n\nAll Mant=\r\nras have equal potency or power. It is incorrect to say that Om Namo Naraya=\r\nnaya is superior to Om Namah Sivaya or Radhesyam or Sri Ram, and so on. You=\r\n can attain God-realisation by doing Japa of any Mantra. Valmiki attained G=\r\nod-consciousness by repealing even Mara-Mara. Some people think that Om or =\r\nSoham is superior to Om Namo Narayanaya, or vice versa. This also is wrong.=\r\n The state gained by doing Japa of Om or Soham can be attained by doing Jap=\r\na of Sri Ram or Radhesyam also.\n\nYou should not doubt the teachings of the =\r\nscriptures. Flickering faith will lead to downfall. A man of weak will, who=\r\n has no faith in Japa, cannot expect to have progress in the spiritual path=\r\n. If he says, &quot;I am practicing `who am I&#39; enquiry&quot;=97this is all wild imagi=\r\nnation. Few are fit for &quot;who am I&quot; enquiry.\n\nYou must have the Bhava that A=\r\ntman, Isvara, Devata, Mantra are one. With this Bhava you will have to repe=\r\nat your Guru Mantra or Ishta Mantra. Then alone you will have Mantra Siddhi=\r\n or God-realisation quickly.\n\nThe Japa of a Mantra can bring to the practit=\r\nioner realisation of his highest goal though he may not possess knowledge o=\r\nf the meaning of the Mantra. Such a mechanical Japa may take a little more =\r\ntime in realisation than when it is practiced with a knowledge of the meani=\r\nng. There is an indescribable power or Achintya Sakti in the Mantras. If yo=\r\nu repeat the Mantra with concentration on its meaning, you will attain God-=\r\nconsciousness quickly.\n\nForm a strong habit of repeating the Name of the Lo=\r\nrd. Then only it will be easy for you to remember Him at the time of death.=\r\n\n\nTo define God is to deny God. You can give the definition of a finite obj=\r\nect. How can you define limitless or the Infinite Being who is the source a=\r\nnd ultimate cause for everything? If you define God you are limiting the li=\r\nmitless one, you are confining Him with concepts of mind. God is beyond the=\r\n reach of the gross mind, but He can be realised through Japa and meditatio=\r\nn with a pure, subtle and one-pointed mind.\n\n\nJapa is the repetition of any=\r\n mantra or name of the Lord.In this iron age Japa is the easiest and surest=\r\n way for God-realisation.\n\nRepeat 200 malas of Japa daily. Mala or rosary i=\r\ns a whip to goad the mind towards God. Wear a mala on your neck. It is the =\r\nmost precious jewel or ornament as it reminds you of God.\n\nPractice of Japa=\r\n removes the impurities of the mind, destroys sins and brings the devotee f=\r\nace to face with God. Japa must become habitual. Be regular in your Japa.\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
