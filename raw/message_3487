[p. 63]\n\nThe Lord dwells in the temple of the human body. He knows our innermost\nthoughts. If there is anything wrong in image worship, does He not know that\nall worship is meant for Him? He will be pleased to accept it knowing that\nit is for Him. Why should you worry yourself about things which are beyond\nyour reach? Try to realize God and love Him.

After\nmarriage they put away those dolls. Similarly, one needs images and symbols\nso long as God is not realized in His true form. It is God Himself who has\nprovided these various forms of worship. [p. 64]\n\nThe Master of the universe has done all this to suit different men in\ndifferent stages of spiritual growth and knowledge.
