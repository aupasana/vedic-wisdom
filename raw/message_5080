Sort of like mo=\r\nving on from mother to the father ( Mahakala -Devourer of time ) .\n\nEven Ra=\r\nmakrishna had to move beyond the image of the Goddess to receive the final =\r\nsamadhi from Totapuri . \n\nIn one of the 3 books remember that Vimalananda m=\r\nentions that even Nirvikalpa samadhi is not the end , there are further rea=\r\nlms of consciousness through which one ascends to become a rishi , avadhuta=\r\n ,siddha .\n\nThat is how probably the NavNaths or Rishis seem to weave playf=\r\nully between the realms.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Can someone kindly=C2=A0explain what kind of samadhi does the following sp=\r\niritual \n&gt; experience denote, (quoted from Vimalanada&#39;s statement in the Ag=\r\nhora book)?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All these swamis talk about samadhi as the highest goal, =\r\nbut I think they are \n&gt; fools.

Mo=\r\nreover, it is tough to capture \n&gt; some of these ideas in words, as words co=\r\nnvey slightly different meaning to \n&gt; different people, based on their life=\r\n experiences and predispositions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, there is no formula that ensure=\r\ns self-realization in a certain amount of \n&gt; time and it comes to one throu=\r\ngh the grace of God. However, grace of God does \n&gt; not come to just about a=\r\nnyone - it comes to one who is *ready* to receive it. \n&gt; One becomes ready =\r\nto receive it, through the effort put in this life and all \n&gt; previous live=\r\ns, to overcome weaknesses and conditioning. So effort and sadhana \n&gt; are no=\r\nt useless. The effort we are talking about here is not effort to acquire \n&gt;=\r\n something, but effort to give up something.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though it is not incorrec=\r\nt, the view that things are given only by God&#39;s grace \n&gt; can, when misunder=\r\nstood, promote inaction. God&#39;s grace does not come to a lazy \n&gt; person doin=\r\ng nothing and waiting for God&#39;s grace. God&#39;s grace does not work \n&gt; arbitra=\r\nrily. God&#39;s grace comes to one who has perfect surrender to God. Perfect \n&gt;=\r\n surrender does not come automatically. Though effort and sadhana do not \n&gt;=\r\n guarantee perfect surrender in a certain amount of time, they do bring it =\r\n\n&gt; eventually.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; whatever one does it is based on past karm=\r\nas only\n&gt; \n&gt; Fruits of past karmas decide one&#39;s current situation and const=\r\nrain one&#39;s current \n&gt; karmas (actions). But they do not completely decide o=\r\nne&#39;s current karmas. One&#39;s \n&gt; current karma is in one&#39;s hands (within the c=\r\nonstraints).\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, one can ask: Does one have a free will that ac=\r\nts or does an \n&gt; all-pervading shakti act through one? I am quoting a small=\r\n portion from \n&gt; vedic-wisdom message 5009 \n&gt; (http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom/message/5009) below:\n&gt; \n&gt; All pervading shakti works through=\r\n all of us and expresses through all of our \n&gt; desires, actions and knowled=\r\nge. But then, some universal rules of action and \n&gt; reaction govern how thi=\r\ns works. Under the push of one&#39;s own previous karmas, one \n&gt; is placed in s=\r\nituations that are conducive to certain desires, actions and \n&gt; awareness. =\r\nThe current karmas in those situations may further modify the \n&gt; momentum o=\r\nf the push (reaction) from previous actions. Though one&#39;s current \n&gt; desire=\r\ns, actions and awareness are actually the work of the all pervading \n&gt; shak=\r\nti, they are also one&#39;s work in a way. It depends on how we look at it and =\r\n\n&gt; how we abstract it. Though Ganges water in a bucket, Ganges water in a s=\r\nmall \n&gt; cup, Ganges water in a cup in hot weather and Ganges water in a cup=\r\n in freezing \n&gt; weather are all Ganges water, they are different too. One i=\r\ns more, one is less, \n&gt; one is warm and one is icy. Similarly, the work of =\r\nall pervading shakti is\n&gt; different when expressed through different vessel=\r\ns (people) in different \n&gt; situations.\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as one actually feels i=\r\nnternally (despite what one may say or pretend \n&gt; externally) that one&#39;s de=\r\nsires, actions and knowledge are one&#39;s own, one is \n&gt; performing karmas and=\r\n is bound to receive their kaarmik reactions. Only when the\n&gt; realization t=\r\nhat it is all the work of the all pervading shakti becomes full and \n&gt; comp=\r\nletely internalized, does one become free from the cycle of actions and \n&gt; =\r\nreactions. Until then, all pervading shakti acts through one to give approp=\r\nriate \n&gt; reactions to actions one thinks one is performing.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n In astrological terms, horoscope is the sum total of previous karmas, whos=\r\ne \n&gt; fruits one will have to face. They show the circumstances faced by one=\r\n. They do \n&gt; not and cannot determine what actions one engages in, though c=\r\nertain actions are \n&gt; more likely in certain circumstances.\n&gt; \n&gt; Destiny is=\r\n the sum total of the reactions to the actions committed by one&#39;s free \n&gt; w=\r\nill. Today&#39;s actions of free will become destiny tomorrow (i.e. on a future=\r\n \n&gt; date or in a future life).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Fr=\r\nee Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- hramalingam@... wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Samadi state i=\r\ns not like getting a degree by hardwork It comes to certain \n&gt; &gt;people by t=\r\nhe Grace of GOD Till GOD or Soul decides to reveal the Samadi state \n&gt; &gt;wha=\r\ntever one does it is based on past karmas only\n&gt; &gt; Ramanapatham\n&gt; &gt; Sent fr=\r\nom my BlackBerry=C2=AE on Reliance Mobile, India&#39;s No. 1 Network.

However, we \n&gt; &gt;cannot compare ourselves with spec=\r\nial beings and we should follow rules and \n&gt; &gt;austerities laid out in tradi=\r\ntion. Tendulkar may score a century with a terrible \n&gt; &gt;backache, but we sh=\r\nould not walk out to bat with a backache and should try to be \n&gt; &gt;healthy. =\r\nAfter all, we may not be able to score runs well even when in perfect \n&gt; &gt;h=\r\nealth!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, it must be realized that externa=\r\nl rules are only meant as a \n&gt; &gt;*catalyst* in enabling internal transformat=\r\nion. The goal of all sadhana - \n&gt; &gt;meditation, japam, homam, bhajan, servic=\r\ne to others etc - is internal \n&gt; &gt;transformation. If the internal attitude =\r\nis not getting refined, sadhana is yet \n&gt; &gt;to work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n If a room has a window outside of which there is heavy wind that is consta=\r\nntly \n&gt; &gt;blowing a lot of dirt into the room, sweeping the room with a broo=\r\nm does not \n&gt; &gt;eliminate dirt. First close the window or stop the wind. Sim=\r\nilarly, praanaayaama \n&gt; &gt;is not enough to purify the nadis and give mental =\r\npurity, if mind (room) is \n&gt; &gt;attached to the objects perceived by senses (=\r\nwindow).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one reads scriptures and teachings of s=\r\naints, contemplates on them, \n&gt; &gt;constantly analyzes inner motives behind v=\r\narious actions by oneself and tries to \n&gt; &gt;change one&#39;s own thinking slowly=\r\n, this process of contemplation and \n&gt; &gt;introspection will augment one&#39;s ex=\r\nternal sadhana (such as meditation, japam, \n&gt; &gt;homam, bhajan, service etc) =\r\nand purifies one faster.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, it is useless =\r\nto think in terms of Kundalini, awakening Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;and raising Kundali=\r\nni. Such thoughts are almost guaranteed to either block \n&gt; &gt;Kundalini from =\r\nrising or from reaching the highest it can.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini shakti is es=\r\nsentially a symbol of one&#39;s own self-awareness. Though \n&gt; &gt;one is the infin=\r\nite Self (Purusha), one is &quot;aware&quot; of a limited object in the \n&gt; &gt;field of =\r\nduality (Shakti) springing in Self as &quot;self&quot;. That is why Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;sha=\r\nkti is worshipped as a form of the divine Mother (Shakti). This \n&gt; &gt;self-aw=\r\nareness is normally &quot;sleeping&quot;, i.e. one assumes that one is so and so \n&gt; &gt;=\r\nperson and so and so body without questioning &quot;who am I&quot;. That is why Kunda=\r\nlini \n&gt; &gt;is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (bhuloka or physical=\r\n realm). As \n&gt; &gt;Kundalini awakens and rises to other chakras (other lokas o=\r\nr realms of \n&gt; &gt;awareness), one&#39;s understanding of who one is gets refined.=\r\n When Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;reaches sahasrara, one is aware of true Self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIf one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundalini shakti at so and so poi=\r\nnt \n&gt; &gt;in this body. It should now rise to so and so point in this body&quot;, i=\r\nt will focus \n&gt; &gt;and limit one&#39;s self-awareness to the *physical body* and =\r\nhence one&#39;s Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;will remain in moolaadhaara! For Kundalini to tru=\r\nly rise, one needs to \n&gt; &gt;completely forget about the physical body and sto=\r\np thinking in terms of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, *very few* people actually =\r\nexperience Kundalini in higher chakras, \n&gt; &gt;though many talk about it. Kund=\r\nalini is in Moolaadhaara chakra or atmost \n&gt; &gt;Swadhishthana chakra in most =\r\nyogis, even advanced and awakened ones. When praana \n&gt; &gt;vaayu flows in some=\r\n higher chakras, that too can result in a powerful \n&gt; &gt;experience. Some may=\r\n mistaken it for Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you want a good scor=\r\ne in the examination, study well. Stop thinking too much \n&gt; &gt;about (and ant=\r\nicipating) the examination and focus on the subject instead. \n&gt; &gt;Study, stu=\r\ndy, study. Similarly, forget about kundalini, forget about chakras, \n&gt; &gt;for=\r\nget about the body even. Do sadhana, do sadhana and do sadhana. Read \n&gt; &gt;sc=\r\nriptures and teachings of great saints. Instead of looking externally and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;judging others, observe your own actions and thoughts, analyze what is d=\r\nriving \n&gt; &gt;them and consciously try to eliminate wrong motives that stem fr=\r\nom false ego, \n&gt; &gt;adharma and arishadvarga (lust, anger, greed, delusion, w=\r\nantonness, jealosy), \n&gt; &gt;i.e. put to use the knowledge of scriptures and th=\r\ne teachings of saints. Oneday, \n&gt; &gt;Kundalini will rise automatically.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Fr=\r\nee Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that mak=\r\ne a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;r=\r\najarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;For instance, withou=\r\nt a vegetarian diet, asana siddhi is impossible.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nothi=\r\nng is impossible.
