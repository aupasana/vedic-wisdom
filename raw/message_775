Supressing desire cannot be termed as a brahm=\r\nacharya..right?\n\nThe connection between&#39;Desire & Supression&#39; needs to be un=\r\nderstood \nproperly, once and for ever so as to understand Control & \nAnnihi=\r\nlation/overcome/rising above\n\nLet us take a practical case of day to day li=\r\nfe of a common person. \nTake an Individual &#39;Z&#39; has a desire for copulation =\r\nwith his wife. He \n*Satisfies* his desire one day and becomes very satsfied=\r\n with it. \nnow THAT perticular desire seems to be gone. few days passes on =\r\nand \nmr. Z finds that the same Desire has Risen again, he again satsfies \nt=\r\nhe same with the same action. these cycle keeps going on & on for \nmany yea=\r\nrs. Mr. Z feels like most in the world that this desire to \nhave sexual rel=\r\nationship is &#39;Natural&#39;.\n\nNow let&#39;s analysie the above case. Though mr.Z sat=\r\nsfies the want of \ncopulation, it comes back again & again. it means that t=\r\nhe desire \nhas never been satsfied even by giving it FOOD Again & again.\n**=\r\n*\nOur spiritual giants equvivocally say that The Energy which is lost \nduri=\r\nng copulation is the BEST Energy available in a person which if \nrestrained=\r\n, controlled and preserved, can easly become OJAS and can \nhelp immensly in=\r\n the path of Spiritual journey.\n***\nconsider that our Mr. Z some how got to=\r\n read the above paragraph and \nstarted seriously thinking about it. He tell=\r\ns himself that he would \nrefrain from intercourse for 3 months. The earlier=\r\n frequency was 2/3 \ndays, now he suddenly finds that desire has completely =\r\novertaken \nhim. after 15 days, he finds that Desire has gone in to his ever=\r\ny \npour and every thought and he gives up and succumbs to that gigantic \nfo=\r\nrce of Kaam Vaasana. This may be called suppression initially \nwhich failed=\r\n the effort. The person again analyses what went wrong \nand again tries to =\r\ndo the same and again fails. he keeps on trying \nand keeps on failing. duri=\r\nng this battles, he is also exploring and \ngathering knowledge of experienc=\r\ned people and knowledge from \nspiritual books. he understands that if he ne=\r\neds to win the Final \nWAR with this Very Formidable enemy, he needs to do l=\r\not of things \nsimultaneously and he then resorts to the help from many quar=\r\nters. \nHe starts taking cold water bath, starts reading spiritual books, \ns=\r\ntops reading film magazine, stops watching Films and TV Shows, \nReduces eat=\r\ning Onion and garlic, starts doing Yoga Aasan, Meditation \nand so on and so=\r\n forth. taking the aids thus he keeps on batteling \nwith the *Natural Desir=\r\ne* and still keeps on loosing. but the good \nnews is that his days of batte=\r\nling before loosing has increased. \nstarted from 10 days, he has now reache=\r\nd the struggeling capacity of \n90 days. (WE ARE ASSUMING HERE THAT HIS WIFE=\r\n IS FULLY COOPERATIVE OF \nHIS THEATRICS). He is still unhappy about his loo=\r\nsing, although he \nis able to keep-up the Physical brahmacharya for 3 month=\r\ns. some how \nhe realises that God&#39;s grace is the most important thing espec=\r\nially \nfor this perticular matter and he now starts Praying to his \nfavouri=\r\nte Deity every day. he cries and cries and requests the God \nto save him fr=\r\nom this loss. he keeps on trying every thing possible, \nkeeps on praying si=\r\nncerely and severly, keeps on doing various \nspiritual sadhanas but still k=\r\neeps on loosing at as well. over a \nperiod of some 8/10 years, the desired =\r\nchange is visible. he has \nconquered his desire. Now Sexual Desire which wa=\r\ns his *Natural* for \nhim has been replaced by Brahmacharya.\n\n&#39;Supression&#39; w=\r\nhen combined with Thoughtful Suspension, equipped with \nevery possible prep=\r\naration and will power to try untiringly again & \nagain finally results in =\r\nto annihilation.\n\n***\n&gt; 2. To control desire is also not brahmacharya?\n\nIf =\r\na person who has gained perfect self control but indulges in to \nthe act of=\r\n copulation only because to satisfy the desire of spouse \nor to have childr=\r\nen, in my opinion, still maintains Brahmacharya.\nactually brahmacharya is a=\r\n Nature, It can not be done but it Dawns.\n\n***\n\nin the same case, if the wi=\r\nfe of Mr.Z is demanding then Z would have \nfight the one more big battle of=\r\n either convincing Wife by \nexplainging her, slowly moulding her nature and=\r\n at the same time \nsurrendering to the Lord. i mean praying lord to change =\r\nher wife&#39;s \nnature so that she also starts thinking in the same line. as Na=\r\nlini \nBahen has said, accepting everything as Mother&#39;s wishes. Brahmachrya =\r\n\nor No Brahmacharya.\n \n***\nfriends, please forgive me. i think it was too m=\r\nuch...but still i \ncouldn&#39;t write many things going across my mind.\n\nyours,=\r\n\n\nutpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajesh rajgor \n&lt;rajesh_rajgor=\r\n2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have read the contents of utpal.. t=\r\nhat had raised few questions \nin to my mind.. i would be happy if utpal can=\r\n answer me..\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.

Someone \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; else may have to first overcome his lust even to =\r\nhave a vision \n&gt; \n&gt; of \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the deity. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is good for goose =\r\nis not good for gander.

Several of \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; disciples also struggled with it initially and overcame lust \n&gt; \n&gt; with=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; his \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and n=\r\not at all \n&gt; \n&gt; easy \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; to kill \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; completely.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go out of \nthe \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; mind. Set a \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some per=\r\niod like \nthat \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t =\r\nworry if thoughts come.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and=\r\n it does not help in \novercoming \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the basic \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem. Don&#39;t=\r\n be over-burdened by it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHO=\r\nRA was the important thing is \nnot\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove t=\r\nhem from the root\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the=\r\n desire come back later. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, if one \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling des=\r\nires, they never end!!  This is the nature \n&gt; \n&gt; of \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; desire. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other than \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nelf) or \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter h=\r\now \nmuch \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; one gets.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root=\r\n often requires suppressing the \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; desire \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporarily. But t=\r\nhe thing to remember from the Aghora book is \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; that just \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; su=\r\nppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; desires, b=\r\nut do \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; remember that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; working on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i ke=\r\nep trying for brahamcharya is \nif\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long t=\r\nime probasbly i can also do \nit , \n&gt; \n&gt; if\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at lea=\r\nst in 10-12 years\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That is the right spirit!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya \nis \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; one thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and=\r\n not become \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; attached to \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to =\r\none&#39;s actions and possessions \n&gt; \n&gt; and \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; developing a sense of sur=\r\nrender is the most fundamental thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are several =\r\nthings in spiritual progress. They all come \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; together! One \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n person may develop detachment to actions and possessions and \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; brahm=\r\nacharya \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One person may achieve \nbrah=\r\nmacharya \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; first and \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; detachment may become easy as a result=\r\n and come later. Various \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; signs of \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual progress come=\r\n almost together, but the exact order \ncan \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; change from \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pe=\r\nrson to person.
