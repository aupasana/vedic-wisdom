But first I want to recommend a couple of books:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (1) &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is undoubtedly one of the best works\n&gt; available to a spiritually inclined person with interest in vedanta.\n&gt; It is a practical book with many stories (unlike most dry vedanta\n&gt; books) and teaches profound lessons through stories.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Interestingly, I am typing this on the eve of Sree Rama Navami (by\n&gt; the way, happy Sree Rama Navami to all of you!). When Maharshi\n&gt; Vishwamitra came to request Dasaratha to send Lord Rama with him to\n&gt; protect his yajna from demons, Dasaratha was hesitant and Lord\n&gt; Ramachandra was confused. At the request of Maharshi Vishwamitra and\n&gt; others, Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Ramachandra the essence of\n&gt; the knowledge of Self, in front of other maharshis, kings and gods.\n&gt; These teachings were captured by Maharshi Valmiki as the book &quot;Yoga\n&gt; Vaasishtham&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This work helped even maharshis like Bharadwaja to obtain Brahma\n&gt; jnana. When Valmiki explained Vasishtha&#39;s teachings to Bharadwaja,\n&gt; he became realized.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is a truly inspired English translation by Swami\n&gt; Venkatesananda, a disciple of Swami Sivananda of Hrishikesh (Divine\n&gt; Life Society). Swami Sivananda is considered by some to be a re-\n&gt; incarnation of Maharshi Vasishtha.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Yoga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This is the best book I have read in my life and I can say this is\n&gt; the book that influenced me the most and changed my thinking.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (2) Bhagavad Gita is a marvelous compendium on practical\n&gt; spirituality. It covers various paths like jnana yoga, raja yoga,\n&gt; bhakti yoga, karma yoga, sannyasa yoga etc. While there are many\n&gt; commentaries and translations, I prefer the treatment of Sant\n&gt; Jnaneshwar. He is a rare Krishna bhakta who is also associated with\n&gt; the path of aghora and nathas! While most Krishna bhaktas follow\n&gt; dwaita and vivishtaadwaita, Jnaneshwar&#39;s treatment is purely\n&gt; adwaitic.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In Yoga Vasishtham, Vasishtha tells Rama that Vishnu would appear\n&gt; as Krishna in a later yuga and teach the essence of Veda to Arjuna.\n&gt; Vasishtha goes to great lengths on what Krishna teaches. Some modern\n&gt; commentaries on Bhagavad Gita deviate from the adwaitic principles\n&gt; of vedanta and interpret some teachings of Krishna in a way that\n&gt; contradicts Vasishtha&#39;s take. Sant Jnaneshwar&#39;s interpretation is\n&gt; consistent with Vasishtha&#39;s and also consistent with upanishads and\n&gt; vedanta.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-\n&gt; Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But What a real spiritualism is still yet to defined....\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Self-realized person is one who has realized that all is Brahman\n&gt; and not bound by any limited ego, even though actions continue to\n&gt; spring from a previously existing ego (that continues to wind down\n&gt; like a fan after electricity is turned off).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Spiritual person is one who is making *some progress* towards\n&gt; becoming a self-realized person at a point in future.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Unfrotunately, scriptures can describe a self-realized person and\n&gt; how he thinks, but they cannot give any fool-proof steps which, when\n&gt; followed by one, can ensure self-realization.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just thinking &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and understanding it\n&gt; *intellctually* is not sufficient. Let me drive my point home using\n&gt; an analogy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Suppose someone goes to a movie and becomes so involved in the\n&gt; movie that he behaves as through something is really happening on\n&gt; the screen. For example, suppose there is a scene where the heroine\n&gt; is in a dark room and villain is about to stab her in the back from\n&gt; behind her. Suppose there is tense music. One may be shuddering with\n&gt; expectation. One may jump with shock and tension.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There may be one person who completely realizes that this is just\n&gt; an illusion and nothing is actually happening and watches it without\n&gt; any emotional involvement whatsoever. He is anlogous to a realized\n&gt; person. Suppose someone is so involved and shouts with happiness\n&gt; when something good happens in the movie and shudders when something\n&gt; terrible happens in the movie. He is analogous to a person deeply\n&gt; stuck in maya. Really speaking, this life we live is quite similar\n&gt; to a big movie, except that it is interactive. Thus, my analogy is\n&gt; quite appropriate.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now, one smart person may very well know that this movie thing is\n&gt; not really happening and hence controlling emotions mostly. But an\n&gt; odd scene may make him shudder too! Such a person is analogous to\n&gt; one who intellectually understands and appreciates the essence of\n&gt; Veda (that all is Brahman and the objects we see are all an\n&gt; illusion) and yet does not fully comprehend it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If one fully realizes, then nothing should make one happy or sad\n&gt; internally. One may act externally as though one is happy or sad,\n&gt; but the heart should be stable always and not excited or depressed\n&gt; by *anything*. If all is Brahman, why should anything exicte you\n&gt; depress you? In our analogy, such a person is like one watching the\n&gt; movie with zero involvement, realizing at all times that it is only\n&gt; imaginary and not happening for real and not being shaken even once.\n&gt; One who has only an intellectual understanding and not a complete\n&gt; understanding may some times be affected by the illusion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If someone praises you, does it excite you? If someone humiliates,\n&gt; does it upset you? If something seems nice, do you want to have it?\n&gt; If something seems disgusting, do you want to go away?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As long as there is attachment and self-identification with a body\n&gt; or a name or some other limited object, some ego remains and causes\n&gt; all of the above. It results in happiness on some events and sadness\n&gt; on some events. Self-realization cannot come without overcoming ego\n&gt; *fully*. It never comes from an intellectual understanding of the\n&gt; dictum &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. It comes from experiencing it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; How can one go from a limited ego to zero ego? There is no single\n&gt; path. As I said already, scriptures only describe how a realized\n&gt; person thinks, but they cannot give a fool-proof path to realization.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, some scriptures do outline some paths for reference.\n&gt; While they are not fool-proof and do not guarantee realization, they\n&gt; can be helpful.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One person may sit down in seclusion in a forest or in Himalayas\n&gt; or a remote cave and keep eating enough to just survive and actively\n&gt; contemplate all the time &quot;Who am I? Am I this body? Who am I? What\n&gt; are all these objects I perceive? What is all this?&quot; and eventually\n&gt; realize Self. This is jnana yoga.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One person may pray to a specific deity and slowly force oneself\n&gt; to see the entire universe as another form of that deity and see\n&gt; that deity in everything. One may eventually realize Self through\n&gt; that deity. This is bhakti yoga.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One person may consider work and service as god and spend all of\n&gt; one&#39;s time serving people without prejudices, without any self-pride\n&gt; and without any selfish motives. One may try to see god in all\n&gt; people and all service and may eventually realize Self. This is\n&gt; karma yoga.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One person may use forceful methods of raja yoga, control the\n&gt; body, senses and mind through yogic practices, forcefully raise self-\n&gt; awareness (Kundalini shakti) to higher realms of consciousness. They\n&gt; too may eventually realize Self.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In each of these four broad paths, there are many sub-paths. But\n&gt; please realize that no path guarantees self-realization. They help,\n&gt; but do not guarantee anything. And the only method of spiritual\n&gt; progress, IMHO, is how much ego has been overcome.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Most people stick to one method. There are exceptions like\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa who tried each path and succeeded. In fact,\n&gt; I believe the logo of Ramakrishna mutt employs symbols of each of\n&gt; these paths in it! While each saint is great and one cannot compare\n&gt; them, Ramakrishna was somebody else. His lila (play) cannot fully be\n&gt; understood by most people even today, after such a long time. His\n&gt; lila may in fact continue to play out long after he left the body.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I just want to share my personal view on the link between the\n&gt; abobe paths and Jyotish. This is not from any classic and based on\n&gt; my own intuition.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The path of karma yoga is seen from the element of earth. The path\n&gt; of bhakti yoga is seen from the element of water. The path of jnaana\n&gt; yoga is seen from the element of fire. The path of raja yoga is seen\n&gt; from the element of air. Of course, ether is in all. Ether or space\n&gt; is the basis of all yoga.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tarun&quot; &lt;tarun.virgo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a very good mail from your side.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you covered all points,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; including the Karma which you mentioned as Arjuna and Krishna&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; example and Raja Janak\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rest sanyas things which you mentioned with examples of Trilinga\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa ,Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda)\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; few others.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Spiritualism of Rajnikant.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But What a real spiritualism is still yet to defined....\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; being a sadhu tatva is spiritualism ?? doing karma is\n&gt; spiritualism ??\n&gt;&gt; &gt; giving teachings is spiritualism ? doing Social service is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritualism ?? guiding others is spiritualism.?? being honest\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritualism ?? or being a warrior and killing because of duties\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritualism ?? or taking sanyas is spiritualism ?? or sitting\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; temple and worshipping / doing yajna /doing yoga etc...etc...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; unlimited things.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or not helping people and letting them face the god&#39;s decision\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritualism.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as per you ..a self realised person who finally loses ego ( any\n&gt;&gt; &gt; planet specific ) is lost that time a person is spiritual ?? but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what does he do finally .....again long list as above. ...\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you have read Geeta and all other puranas , if you can share few\n&gt;&gt; &gt; things from your vast knowledge , it would be great for those\n&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; &gt; donot understands the meaning of spiritualism.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But do you agree to me that there are many people who has made\n&gt; it as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; moeny earning module in western countries..\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ////\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt make one to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; certify any\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persons doings as good and spiritual.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody can &quot;certify&quot; anybody.

Rao&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i will say if the person is spiritual ...go and do tapasya\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Himalay..why sitting in pleasure world and earning money\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying all world pleasures.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sitting in pleasure world and earning money is NOT synonymous\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to &quot;enjoying all world pleasures&quot;. One may be sitting in\n&gt; pleasure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; world, earning money and engaging externally in various\n&gt; activities,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; but the mind may be established in peace and bliss.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A realized person is NOT identified by the actions he/she\n&gt; engages\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in. Just as an electric fan continues to turn for a few minutes\n&gt; even\n&gt;&gt; &gt; after the electricity is turned off, a realized person who is\n&gt; still\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in a body continues to engage in actions based on the previous\n&gt; flow.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; After King Janaka realized Self, he continued as the king of\n&gt; Mithila\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and did all royal duties. After Krishna made Arjuna realize\n&gt; Self,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Arjuna fought a war and killed his gurus, brothers, grandfather\n&gt; etc.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One who has not yet realized Self will distinguish between\n&gt; various\n&gt;&gt; &gt; objects of this dual world and view some as good and some as\n&gt; bad.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He/she will try to stay away from so-called bad actions. On the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other hand, a realized person sees all people, objects and\n&gt; actions\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of this universe as the same Self and sees no reason to either\n&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attracted to or repelled from anything. His/her actions and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; inactions are thus not based on the principles of attraction and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; repulsion. They are based on the previous flow.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Renouncing wife, children, job, money etc is an attempt to\n&gt; find\n&gt;&gt; &gt; true mental renunciation. Renouncing external objects can\n&gt; promote\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mental renunciation, but not guarantee it. On the other hand,\n&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can remain in the midst of the material world and all the\n&gt; external\n&gt;&gt; &gt; objects and yet have a perfectly stable, peaceful and blissful\n&gt; mind\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that is not attracted to or repelled from any of the objects one\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; surrounded by. For all you know, a big film star like\n&gt; Rajinikanth,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; who makes millions of dollars per movie, surrounded by glamour,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; money and adulation, may be more detached at the mental level\n&gt; than\n&gt;&gt; &gt; many yogis in Himalayas. It is probably true in the case of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rajinikanth.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When one stays away from objects that may attract one, it is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; relatively easy to overcome attraction temporarily. Whether one\n&gt; can\n&gt;&gt; &gt; retain that renunciation when one comes in contact with the\n&gt; objects\n&gt;&gt; &gt; again or not is a questionmark. On the other hand, to be in\n&gt; contact\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with the objects that may attract one and yet maintain mental\n&gt;&gt; &gt; detachment and mental renunciation is tougher. It is the true\n&gt; test.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is not out of place to mention a small story.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Trilinga Swami lived for about 300 years and did unbelievable\n&gt;&gt; &gt; austerities in Kashi. When Ramakrishna Paramahamsa met him in\n&gt; Kashi,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he remarked to his sishyas that Trilinga Swami was Shiva Himself\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a fully realized being. Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with him on that pilgrimage and he made a point to force\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narendranath to go to Kashi later to have a darshan of Trilinga\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Swami!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Lahiri Mahashaya was the guru of Yukteshwar Maharaj, who was\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; guru of Paramahamsa Yogananda. Lahiri Mahashaya was a\n&gt; householder\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and had a high-paying job. Yet he realized Self. Trilnga Swami\n&gt; spoke\n&gt;&gt; &gt; little, but he once spoke a few words in Lahiri Mahashaya&#39;s\n&gt; praise.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He said, &quot;The state of mind I achieved by renouncing everything,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Lahiri achieved it while being a householder, being in the\n&gt; middle of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; everything. I bow to him.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *         *         *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt make one to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; certify any\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persons doings as good and spiritual.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody can &quot;certify&quot; anybody. However, those who know some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; astrology can give their views on charts that are shared and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; discussed publicly. If some people see those views as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a &quot;certificates&quot;, it is their perception.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *         *         *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Self-realization can be consistently defined. However,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spirituality is tough to define. It will mean different things\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; different people.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The goal of all spiritual journeys is to realize Self, at some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; time or the other. However, most spiritual journeys of this age\n&gt; do\n&gt;&gt; &gt; NOT end in Self-realization.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is limited ego that binds one to a limited existence like a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; body and stops one from realizing the all-pervading true Self.\n&gt; While\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a self-realized person&#39;s ego is completely killed, it is\n&gt; possible to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; make partial progress. There are many people, who overcome ego\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; various extents and realize to various degrees that body is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; temporary and it is not the true self. One can do so by\n&gt; following\n&gt;&gt; &gt; many spiritual paths, like the path of knowledge, the path of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; devotion, the path of pranayama, the path of hatha yoga, the\n&gt; path of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; work and service etc. One who overcomes ego to some extent,\n&gt; using\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any path, is making some spiritual progress. When the ego is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; completely subdued, one realizes the true Self. This realization\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the same irrespective of the path followed. However,\n&gt; intermediate\n&gt;&gt; &gt; steps look and feel different based on the path.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Enough of my 2 cents for tonight...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Dear Prashant ji,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt make one to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; certify any\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persons doings as good and spiritual.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are many factors which one over looks,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and in true sense ....what is the real spiritualism.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i will say if the person is spiritual ...go and do tapasya\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Himalay..why sitting in pleasure world and earning money\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying all world pleasures.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tarun\n\n\n"}}
