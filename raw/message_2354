Balasubramanian,\n\nOne more reason for this is the fact that t=\r\nhe deities whom we invoke are ethereal beings and eat with their nose (smel=\r\nl). They don&#39;t eat with the mouth as we do, and they have a powerful sense =\r\nof smell and can detect the menses, which irritates them causing them to go=\r\n, which obviously defeats the purpose of inviting/invoking them! This is al=\r\nso the reason why we were told not to smell the prasad before offering, as =\r\nthis would be akin to soiling it.\n\n\nHowever, it is not clear why menses (ap=\r\nart from the toxicity of it you just mentioned) is treated differently as o=\r\npposed to someone who lets say travelled long distance and is sweaty and sm=\r\nelly. \n\nThanks\nNarayan\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, G Balasubrama=\r\nnian &lt;gbsub@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Rao,\n&gt; Thanks for providing this info.
