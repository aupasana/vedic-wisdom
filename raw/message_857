I will leave the questions they have \nalready replied too. As Ravi said, the amount of materials you need depends \non how big a fire you maintain. You will learn and fine-tune with \nexperience.\n\nThere may be a tradition in some parts of India to offer a drop of ghee in \nwater after offering it in fire. But it is not necessary. When doing Chandi \nhomam, some people invoke the Mother in an idol and offer water to the idol \nwith each mantra along with offering ghee in fire. Again, it is not \nnecessary.\n\nManaging ahutis and reading is difficult, but one can master it with \npractice. It is really advisable for you to do both reading and offering \nahutis yourself.\n\nWooden spoon is perfectly alright.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; &lt;khosladheeraj@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, January 02, 2009 1:31 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] some queries on homam\n\n\n&gt; Namaskar Narsimhaji and others,\n&gt;\n&gt;                              I want to do homam for chandi devi.I\n&gt; had arranged a copper tray in square shape.Almost 1 feet by 1 feet.\n&gt; So is it good measurement or not ? I also bought havan samagri, dry\n&gt; coconuts etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;                    Actually i want to start with short cut method\n&gt; so please advice me that ,how much ghee,havan samagri, dry coconut\n&gt; etc are used in one havana, so that i will plan these items\n&gt; accordingly.I have arranged 2 kg of havan samagri, 1 kg dry coconuts\n&gt; etc..So how to divide this in ratio as per single day process.How\n&gt; much ghee in grams per havana.ALthough i am reading your pdf notes\n&gt; on homam again and again but doing practical things r difficult and\n&gt; need much more focus and methodology.\n&gt;\n&gt;               Although  by God grace and your encouragement to\n&gt; people for doing homams, even i myself get transformed towards\n&gt; homam ,so thanks for that. But i need your step by step guidance as\n&gt; everything is  not included in your notes( although its best notes\n&gt; on homam). Its my weakness actually.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;               In normal homams by priests in India ,they do swaha\n&gt; with ghee in fire aswell in water.So tell me, I mean after they pour\n&gt; ghee through spoon in agni ,they immediately pour one drop of ghee\n&gt; in water too. So is it correct way or not ?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;               If single person is doing a homam then how to manage\n&gt; ahutis of ghee and samagri both and of course mantra mala or notes u\n&gt; provided ? Bcz in India, normally full group or family do homams and\n&gt; priest only says mantras.So i think two people r must for homam.\n&gt;\n&gt;               I have spoon made of wood ,Is it ok or i have to buy\n&gt; of copper metal ?\n&gt;\n&gt;                I am still unmarried so can i do with my mother this\n&gt; chandi homam ?\n&gt;\n&gt;       Please provide me some beautiful answers of these queries.And\n&gt; dont mind if my queries prove to be very simple and illogical.But i\n&gt; have to start from basics .So just cooperate with me as i love the\n&gt; work with perfection.In next mail i will ask some queries on mantras\n&gt; in order to understand properly.\n&gt;\n&gt; U r really spreading vedic wisdom in true practical sense. I salute\n&gt; to u.\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks and full respect to u Sir,\n&gt; dheeraj khosla,\n&gt; Delhi\n\n\n"}}
