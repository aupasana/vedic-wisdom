If you \nself-identify with anything, you have an ego. Ego is not there when and only \nwhen there is no self-identification of any kind, i.e. when one is immersed \nin Brahman without any distinction like &quot;this is I, this is other&quot;.\n\nBut, in order to exist in a body and function in this world, one needs to \nkeep alive atleast a very limited amount of self-identification.\n\nHowever, in most people, this self-identification is not &quot;a very limited&quot; \namount, but really huge. We self-identify with a body, name and identity \nquite heavily. The goal is to reduce it and keep it under check, so that it \nis ready to completely melt away oneday.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe only useful purpose of allowing ego (self-identification) to exist is to \nallow one to identify with a body, name etc and use them to do god&#39;s work. \nHow does one know what god&#39;s work one is supposed to do? One knows it \nthrough one&#39;s intuition, one&#39;s logical thinkiing and external input like the \nwords of a guru or other learned men.\n\nHow you decide your dharma - what you are supposed to do in this world - is \npersonal and upto you. But, once you decide that, all your actions should be \ncentered around that. The level of self-identification should be barely \nsufficient for discharging one&#39;s dharma. Any self-identification above that \nlevel is unneeded and counter-productive. It gets one entangled in \nunnecessary web of karmas.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSuppose I decide that my dharma is to spead homam in the world. Then I \nshould use my body, my name, my image, my thoughts and my actions to do what \nis needed for spreading homam in the world. Suppose somebody dismisses homam \nand speaks very deridingly about homam and me. I may argue or ignore. If my \njudgment is that arguing with him and removing the doubts of people is \nbetter to advance my dharma and spread homam, I should argue. If my judgment \nis that ignoring is better to advance my dharma, I should ignore him. If my \nself-identification with the name and its fame is too strong and it was \noffended by his deriding comments on me and I get back to him just for that \nreason, I am doing something silly and unneeded. Instead, I should look at \nwhat actions will help me advance my dharma better.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen Swami Vivekananda lived in US for sometime after his celebrated speech \nat the parliament of religions in Chicago, he received some good coverage in \nUS newspapers. Some jealous Indian neo-religious leaders conducted a \ncampaign of writing letters to the parliament of religions declaring that \nSwami Vivekananda was a fake and that he did not represent Hinduism.\n\nSwamiji was a detached soul who did not care what people thought of him. His \nself-identification with the body, name and image in the world were there \nonly to finish his mission of spreading sanatana dharma and vedanta in the \nworld. After all, once he finished *his* dharma, he did not look back and \ngave up body.\n\nStill, he did not ignore the taunts and negative letter campaign. He took it \nseriously. If his detractors were taken seriously, it could have derailed \nhis mission. He needed thousands of important people from across the world \nto be influenced by him and start vedanta societies in various cities (and \nco-operation from parliament of religions and positive media coverage \ncontributed to it). That was *his* dharma as judged by him. So he used his \nbody, name and image to engage in actions that fought with his detractors, \nshut them down and advanced his dharma. He requested Ramakrishna&#39;s other \ndisciples in Calcutta to hold a public meeting and send news clips. Swami \nAbhedananda went from Dakshineshwar to Calcutta, stayed there for a few \ndays, invited all spiritual leaders, royals and famous personalities to a \npublic meeting, held a public meeting. He ensured that the grand public \nmeeting was attended by many famous people and passed a formal resolution \nacknowledging Swami Vivekananda&#39;s contributions to Hinduism. News clips from \nIndian news papers were promptly mailed to the parliament of religions \nleaders. All doubts about Vivekananda&#39;s authenticity were laid to rest.\n\nIf Vivekananda did this out of personal egotism and to feel good about \nhimself, he would be binding himself in more entanglements. But, he was \ndoing it to advance his chosen dharma, which was far bigger than feeling \ngood about himself. So it did not really bind him.\n\n*        *        *\n\nAs you said, suppose your superior insults you or is unfair to you. The \nfirst instinct of a person would be to be hurt or sad or angry or mad. But, \nthat is the sign of a overly strong self-identification with a body, name \nand image. What&#39;s the big deal if someone calls me names? You, the \nimperishable one, are trapped in this perishable identity (body, name, \nimage) *temporarily* just to fulfil some dharma. Identifying with this \nidentity just enough to fulfil your dharma is required. But why identify \nmore than needed and become angry or sad or mad that someone thinks badly \nabout this temporary identity? It is actually quite foolish.\n\nYou should think only in terms of your dharma. What is the dharma you are \nworking for? What things help it and what things pull it back?\n\nSuppose you decide that one of your dharmas is to take care of your family \n(because there are still unpaid karmik debts). Suppose an unfair comment of \na superior has a chance of impacting your next performance review, your \nsalary or even your job itself, and, as a result, a chance of blocking your \ndharma. Then, the question is what action will advance your dharma better. \nWill you serve your dharma better by ignoring and remaining calm or by \narguing back? Do whatever helps your chosen dharma more.\n\nBut, thinking &quot;he is wrong. He is unfair to *me*&quot; and reacting based on it \nuseless, though that is what most people do. As I said above, do not pay too \nmuch attention to a temporary entity called your identity (body, name and \nimage). You are not that. You are something else using &#39;that&#39; to fulfil some \ndharma. Decide what your dharma is and base your actions in tricky \nsituations on their impact on your dharma.\n\nHope that clarifies a little bit.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, January 19, 2009 11:52 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Difference between Self Respect & Ego?\n\n&gt; Rao Garu !\n&gt; Namaste !\n&gt;\n&gt; Few days back a person asked me sincerely one question.\n&gt; &quot;What is a difference between Self respect & Egoistic attitude in day\n&gt; to day life?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I thought it to be a very pertinent and complex question. that may be\n&gt; the concern of many aspirants. only a advanced soul can try to answer\n&gt; this with some conviction.\n&gt;\n&gt; I could have given her a detailed theoritical explanation but thats\n&gt; of no use unless things are clear.\n&gt;\n&gt; Say for example, somebody Insults/Ignores/Neglects one person. How\n&gt; he/she needs to react?\n&gt;\n&gt; If a superior send a caustic email to subordinate which is\n&gt; unjustified. should he/she keep quite or answer in same language\n&gt; without any fear?\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, one can choose to react differently but as you&#39;ve\n&gt; mentioned earlier that shouldn&#39;t bore any grudge. I suppopse, such\n&gt; detachment may come only after lot of Saadhana and after good amount\n&gt; of purifications. but what to do till that actual wisdom rises?\n&gt;\n&gt; as usual i ended mixingup !!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n\n\n"}}
