Both have same grammatical forms (e.g.\n&gt; Mahalakshmyai/Gayatryai, Mahalakshmim/Gayatrim etc) and it should be quite\n&gt; easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Technically, Gayatri is the chhandas (metre) and the deity of Savitru\n&gt; Gayatri mantra is Savita. So the latter approach makes more sense. For \n&gt; that\n&gt; approach, use Hanuman homam as the template and replace hanumaan, \n&gt; hanumataH,\n&gt; hanumantam, hanumat, hanumate and hanumaddhoma with savitaa, savituH,\n&gt; savitaaram, savitR^i, savitre and savitR^i gaayatrI homa respectively\n&gt; (ITrans notation). Replace &quot;om ham hanumate namaH&quot; with simply &quot;om savitre\n&gt; namaH&quot;. For beeja, shakti and keelaka in invocation, use &quot;om bhuuH&quot;, &quot;om\n&gt; bhuvaH&quot; and &quot;om suvaH&quot;. For anga nyaasam and kara nyaasam also, use the \n&gt; same\n&gt; three repeated.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I did daily Savitru Gayatri Homam for several months before settling\n&gt; down with Chandi homam finally, I used the latter approach. I actually\n&gt; invoked &quot;saavitrI sameta savitaa&quot; in fire (i.e. savitaa with his shakti,\n&gt; i.e. saavitrii), but that is not necessary. One can call Lakshmi and\n&gt; Narayana together or just call Narayana. Not much difference really! In \n&gt; any\n&gt; case, if you want to do the same thing I did, you can add &quot;saavitrI \n&gt; sameta&quot;\n&gt; before all of the above keywords.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most important thing is to pronounce the main Gayatri mantra accurately \n&gt; and\n&gt; slowly. My gut feeling is that this homam will suit you. Good luck!\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 20, 2009 5:15 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] How to a homam using the Gayatri mantra\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I assume it is possible to do the above, but I simply wanted to be sure.\n&gt;&gt; Do you also have a manual for the procedure, or is it possible to simply\n&gt;&gt; substitute the main mantra with the Gayatri mantra?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sundeep\n\n\n"}}
