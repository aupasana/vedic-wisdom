Now it happened so that Mr. VS=\r\n could not repay it due to reasons only known to him. Mr. VS gives many exc=\r\nuses and many dates but fails and ultimately does not pay back. Mr. FL is u=\r\nnder great pressure due to that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mr. FL can have many options to r=\r\neact in the situations:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1] Thinking constantly and repenting for t=\r\nhe act He can-\n&gt; &gt; Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under =\r\nstress, resort to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal=\r\n and external activities concerning that issue.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In this case, He s=\r\ntrongly identifies with the Money, act of Giving then expecting it back, Re=\r\npenting etc...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OR\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden ch=\r\nance to resort to the implementation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practic=\r\ne) and thinks that it was a Rina which needed to be paid back and practical=\r\nly starts training the mind with that knowledge. He follows up for the mone=\r\ny but with the attitude of detachment. Although he shows to his family and =\r\nfriends that he is extremely concerned and it was foolish act etc... But in=\r\n his mind he thinks that it was a rina from some past life which was fulfil=\r\nled. He thinks that they were Money of Mother and she will take care. If th=\r\ney needed to come back, she will do it or if they were to be paid to nullif=\r\ny some past rinas then they will not come back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With the Second Ap=\r\nproach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and will be able to break=\r\n free from this particular chain.

This comes from millions of janmas and samskaras. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My spiritual father &quot;Vimalananda&quot; used to say=C3=82=C2=A0in a =\r\nslightly different context that he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I applied it to this as well and it works quite well.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Two things=C3=82=C2=A0are going to be=C3=82=C2=A0useful, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Conti=\r\nnue your mantra during the act and it will act as a continuation of your sa=\r\ndhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not be di=\r\nsheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the=C3=82=C2=A0thing in y=\r\nour mind which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a nake=\r\nd female(or male as=C3=82=C2=A0may be the case)=C3=82=C2=A0body is like a l=\r\nandscape picture just like any other picture made by Her of nature(like Nia=\r\ngara falls, or Angkor Wat, you need not be disturbed by it, you can certain=\r\nly=C3=82=C2=A0feel that the picture=C3=82=C2=A0is very beautiful=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0but you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samasta Sakala jagats=\r\nu, tyaikiya.... ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once this stage is reached then the mind ceases t=\r\no think of sex all the while.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes you may still encounter it, but tha=\r\nt is another story.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Thu, Feb 25, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of =\r\nLord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=82=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does not see anythi=\r\nng as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations =\r\nof god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (go=\r\nd) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while =\r\ncarrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama=\r\n is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself=\r\n that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is rea=\r\nl. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate tru=\r\nth only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great t=\r\nhing we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell o=\r\nurselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are tempo=\r\nrary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary =\r\nillusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get i=\r\nt, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems bea=\r\nutiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions.=\r\n Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or angry=\r\n, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary=\r\n illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illu=\r\nsions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam s=\r\natya hai&quot; always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord=\r\n (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, goo=\r\nd and bad etc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries =\r\nto find and focus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vedan=\r\nta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pu=\r\nrsues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and=\r\n the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he ca=\r\nn eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0But, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. Perc=\r\neiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent ma=\r\nnifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eat=\r\ning feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwell=\r\ning on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A s=\r\nuccessful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on =\r\nthe fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and will not fee=\r\nl any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating=\r\n Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the same not=\r\nions really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mea=\r\nn &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may mere=\r\nly be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his=\r\n mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;,=\r\n &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver fr=\r\nom the focus on the permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a veda=\r\nntin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth and trying to abso=\r\nrb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himself=\r\n in an extreme situation where failure results in a very bad dual experienc=\r\ne. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend dualit=\r\ny! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self an=\r\nd I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fall=\r\nout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If=\r\n the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or othe=\r\nr food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absor=\r\nb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus,=\r\n the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience may act as an =\r\nincentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, difficul=\r\nt tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an=\r\n incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take ano=\r\nther simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam =\r\nand homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwellin=\r\ng on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is ca=\r\nusing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A regular =\r\nperson will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thou=\r\nghts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, su=\r\nch thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for=\r\n 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not =\r\nreturn to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination some mi=\r\nnds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an=\r\n extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from the=\r\n mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (one =\r\npure and the other impure), he may combine them into one without such disti=\r\nnctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner si=\r\ntting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this may =\r\ntitillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made im=\r\npure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several months/yea=\r\nrs. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is =\r\ndoing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The association =\r\nin his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pict=\r\nures physically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke =\r\nthoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly ris=\r\ne in the head may not lead to denser\n&gt; &gt;  and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; denser thoughts relatin=\r\ng to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to=\r\n meditation. After spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked =\r\nintimately, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intima=\r\ncy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness for s=\r\nex may be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditio=\r\nning based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora =\r\nsometimes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging in certa=\r\nin practices that undermine those structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Howe=\r\nver, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that the =\r\nperson keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex e=\r\nverytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytim=\r\ne he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start wi=\r\nth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on an=\r\nd sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push t=\r\nhe problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a r=\r\nisky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Like Manish said in a mail earlie=\r\nr, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way t=\r\no understand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a h=\r\nigh stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many=\r\n may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for i=\r\nt based on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding bring=\r\ns.=C3=82=C2=A0Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *=\r\nmay* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tene=\r\nts of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accel=\r\nerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very=\r\n unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good =\r\nanalogy for various spiritual paths and explains the basic reality.

My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspirin=\r\ng. On the other hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all=\r\n and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their first a=\r\nttempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours no=\r\nw. THAT is awe-inspiring.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Integrating various sadhanas is a pe=\r\nrsonal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good ide=\r\na to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead =\r\nof splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, =\r\nit is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten=\r\n places, if one wants to find water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One possibility is to do =\r\na homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras=\r\n one is attached to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vid=\r\nya. However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symbl=\r\nic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, t=\r\noo, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lalit=\r\na means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother wh=\r\no teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is st=\r\nern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness).=\r\n Both are valid paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---=\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jy=\r\notish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms=\r\n.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, nagraj@sbcglobal. net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: nagraj@sbcglobal. net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subje=\r\nct: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 11:51 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dea=\r\nr Sri Narasimharao garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am very much in awe after I learnt =\r\nthat you do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 =\r\nhours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that fea=\r\nt with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavanda=\r\nnam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minut=\r\nes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 m=\r\ninutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes d=\r\no special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in =\r\nall. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different =\r\nfrom Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is=\r\n to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all=\r\n about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician =\r\nalso and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar=\r\n recently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj Kota\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne INTERNET now has a personality.
