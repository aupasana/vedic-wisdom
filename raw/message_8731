Thought I will share it here.\n\n&quot;Progre=\r\nss has little to do with speed; but much to do with direction. So always co=\r\nncentrate on your direction, not on speed.&quot;\n\nFor any genuine spiritual seek=\r\ner, this is one of the sanest advices, ever. In the milieu of spirituality,=\r\n too many people get caught up in the less important - aka, visions, &#39;exper=\r\niences&#39;, tough-penances, complex rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while f=\r\norgetting the goal of real spirituality, that is transformation of mind/emo=\r\ntions/body resulting in greater surrender to the Divine, greater equanimity=\r\n to life situations, an abiding calm and peace, genuine humility, lessening=\r\n of lower emotions like lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious a=\r\nttachments, such that eventually every action of the individual is like a c=\r\nonsecration (sacrifice, yagjya) to the Divine. A life so transformed and so=\r\n away from our average superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment=\r\n on its own. God is not the finish line of a bicycle race. It is the progre=\r\nssive unfolding of a transformation process.\n\nComplex rituals and speedy sa=\r\ndhanas and experiences et al are ok, provided one does not lose sight of th=\r\ne fundamentals. THEN these can be useful. Otherwise one ends up running in =\r\ncircles and going nowhere. An experience-chaser is not necessary a spiritua=\r\nl entity. I had to learn this basic truth the hard-way.\n\n\n\n"}}
