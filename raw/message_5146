I heard =\r\nfrom one of the pundits that since Gayatri Mantra is considered the greates=\r\nt of all mantras, one who has initiation in Gayatri Mantra (which is given =\r\nas part of upanayanam) need not have any other initiation.=C2=A0You could g=\r\nive your valuable opinion on the same. \n=C2=A0\nRegards,\n=C2=A0\nNagraj =C2=\r\n=A0\n\n--- On Tue, 10/26/10, Dr Satya Prakash &lt;backtocosmicroots@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Dr Satya Prakash &lt;backtocosmicroots@...&gt;\nSubject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Re: Translations, Initiation, Vedic vs Tantrik\nTo: vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Tuesday, October 26, 2010, 10:07 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\nNamaste friends,\n\nEssentially I agree with Narasimha garu in most matter=\r\ns in this discussion. The only major point where I disagree is whether one =\r\ncan do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion =\r\non translation of mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be som=\r\ne unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:\n\n1. There are various sacred chant=\r\ns embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking such sac=\r\nred chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. =\r\nSome stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras. The Samhita p=\r\nortion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.\n\n2. Undoubtedly mantras =\r\nand stotras have to be chanted in the original. Reading a translation is no=\r\nt even comparable to chanting the original chant. So far it is fine.\n\n3. Wh=\r\nilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes=\r\n a distinction between them.\n\n4. As per the traditional view one doesn&#39;t ne=\r\ned to be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same w=\r\nith most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras o=\r\nf Mahavidyas etc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras fro=\r\nm the Veda Samhita are not the same as these other mantras that need initia=\r\ntion, which are generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever y=\r\nou call these mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integral pa=\r\nrts of larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as =\r\nin the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.\n\n5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivas=\r\nahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they fall under st=\r\notra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditionally =\r\nviewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a larger status=\r\n as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without initiation=\r\n is not recommended especially when the reader combines the navarna or shod=\r\nashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.\n\n6. I know from perso=\r\nnal interaction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri =\r\nparamparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and=\r\n Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras=\r\n which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of b=\r\noth these traditions hold that one needs to be initiated to chant the Navar=\r\nna as well as shodashakshari mantras.\n\n7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi=\r\n Mahatmyam is a great text that has an independent status by itself as part=\r\n of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as =\r\nan Advaitic text in the spirit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Nav=\r\nakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds=\r\n that one needs to be initiated to chant it. However if one wishes to benef=\r\nit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , re=\r\nading the sacred myth in the vernacular has been recommended in my write-up=\r\n, as chanting the original along with the navakshari amounts to practicing =\r\nthe sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommended to be initiated =\r\nand go through the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.\n\n8. Arguab=\r\nly if an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskr=\r\nit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inh=\r\nerent problem in our times. The problem with attempting to do a parayana of=\r\n Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers =\r\ninadvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as th=\r\ne Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.\n\n9. I you carefu=\r\nlly peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere d=\r\no I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I attempted t=\r\no write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the power o=\r\nf the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know th=\r\ne essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting it=\r\n. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a translation! \n\n=\r\n10. For those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation,=\r\n there is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain level =\r\nof samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it. =\r\nOtherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please ke=\r\nep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana.=\r\n As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the sadh=\r\nana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself will re=\r\nduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on their own accord=\r\n in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess. \n\nHope t=\r\nhe above pointers help in clearing any confusion. \n\nRegards,\nSatya Prakash =\r\n\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, h ramalingam &lt;hramalingam@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; I want to share one anecdote happened in=\r\n front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri\n&gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal\n=\r\n&gt; When Swamigal was staying in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One day all =\r\nthe\n&gt; learned persons male and female alike\n&gt; requested Swamigal to transla=\r\nte Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in kannada language\n&gt; so that they can chant kno=\r\nwing the meaning fully.\n&gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was m=\r\nade early in the morning.\n&gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc were =\r\nover as usual Postman came to\n&gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mu=\r\ntt Swamigal. Swamigal was\n&gt; seriously looking at the cover\n&gt; in front of th=\r\ne learned members and was looking at one line written as PIN\n&gt; Code and fol=\r\nlowed by six numbers. Then he asked the learned members to\n&gt; explain the me=\r\naning of PIN Code and no one could tell that. But everyone\n&gt; understood the=\r\n significance of that number. Then swamigal asked his crew\n&gt; member to pick=\r\n up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his library and read\n&gt; the meaning =\r\nas POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that even the meaning\n&gt; of PINCod=\r\ne was not known to the group and still it serves the purpose and\n&gt; people a=\r\nre using it in day to day work. Similarly not knowing the meaning of\n&gt; Vish=\r\nnu Saharanamam will not take away the benefits of chanting the stothsram\n&gt; =\r\nwas he told the group. Hope the above incidence bring some clue to our\n&gt; di=\r\nscussion forum\n&gt; RamanaPatham\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Oct 26, 2010 at 9:10 PM, N=\r\narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Girish,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nam not at all against knowing the meaning, so that one can immerse\n&gt; &gt; ones=\r\nelf in what one is chanting. That is definitely the ideal situation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; If that is not possible, what I am saying is that reading something\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nomposed by an elevated being even without understanding the meaning is very=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; useful. Suppose someone does not understand what Ganapathi Atharvaseer=\r\nsham\n&gt; &gt; means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; everything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. One c=\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, it is =\r\nmore\n&gt; &gt; likely because one does not have the correct attitude and surrende=\r\nr and\n&gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the specific meaning of Ganapa=\r\nthi\n&gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the meaning and chanting may a=\r\nlso\n&gt; &gt; experience nothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realized soul ha=\r\nve meanings at many layers and\n&gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one superficial =\r\nlayer. Some important layers are\n&gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most importan=\r\nt layers of meaning are never\n&gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but only exper=\r\nienced internally.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning or not, chant the m=\r\nantra with a calm and\n&gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Man=\r\ny people keep a target\n&gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it mechanically =\r\nwith a sense of duty. If it\n&gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and =\r\nsurrender to the deity, it can do\n&gt; &gt; something. The key to success with a =\r\nmantra is calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands of t=\r\nhoughts and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; one of those thousand activi=\r\nties, nothing will happen. If most thoughts\n&gt; &gt; subside and mind is essenti=\r\nally reverberating with a mantra, that is when\n&gt; &gt; one experiences a mantra=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical vib=\r\nration is\n&gt; &gt; accompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, the t=\r\nhoughts and\n&gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some=\r\n mantras composed\n&gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentially b=\r\neings with very stable\n&gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such that the physi=\r\ncal vibration of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; can eventually cause the corresponding imag=\r\nery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; &gt; when other mental activity subsides. Thus=\r\n, after repeating the mantra and\n&gt; &gt; calming the mind down, you can recreat=\r\ne a certain imagery and thought system\n&gt; &gt; in your mind. That can permanent=\r\nly alter the way your mind workd. But the\n&gt; &gt; key is to attain a reasonably=\r\n stable, focused and calm mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpre=\r\ntation of BhagavadGita and Sant\n&gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a po=\r\nwer of their own, as they were\n&gt; &gt; realized souls. In comparison, for examp=\r\nlle, Satyadevaashtakam composed by\n&gt; &gt; me, though in metrical Sanskrit, wil=\r\nl not have a similar power.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish So=\r\nftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual=\r\n manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- Girish Shahapurkar &lt;geniusgirish@...&lt;=\r\ngeniusgirish%40yahoo.co.in&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Would it not =\r\nbe of immense help to the ordinary person whose knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; Sanskrit i=\r\ns limited not only to &quot;understand&quot; what he says but also take more\n&gt; &gt; inte=\r\nrest, enjoyment, and truly get immersed in what he is reciting/ reading?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I think this is the reason for the great saints like Sant Dnyaneshwar t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; compose the Bhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I agree with you =\r\nthat the sacred stotras should be recited in\n&gt; &gt; sanskrit...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Humbly,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Girish Shahapurkar\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 26/10/10, Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@...&lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR R=\r\nao &lt;pvr@... &lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Translations=\r\n, Initiation, Vedic vs Tantrik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 26 October, 2010, 2:53 AM\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will give my 2 cents on a few po=\r\nints.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I once wanted to translate Devi Saptash=\r\nati into my mother tongue Telugu\n&gt; &gt; in poetic form, so that Telugu people =\r\nwho find Saptashati too complicated to\n&gt; &gt; read or feel uncomfortable becau=\r\nse they do not know the meaning, can read\n&gt; &gt; the Telugu version instead. W=\r\nhen I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me.\n&gt; &gt; He asked me, &quot;who do you=\r\n think you are?&quot; He said that it could be considered\n&gt; &gt; later, but firmly =\r\ntold me to drop the idea for then.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that=\r\n the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting\n&gt; &gt; mantras and p=\r\nrayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they\n&gt; &gt; mean. Th=\r\ney are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are\n&gt; &gt; store=\r\nhouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n in the past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An intellectual understanding may hel=\r\np facilitate the right mood, right\n&gt; &gt; frame of mind and right imagery. But=\r\n, even without it, a mantra that was\n&gt; &gt; used by great sadhakas, yogis and =\r\nrishis holds power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the words of a rishi t=\r\nhat one cannot intellectually understand\n&gt; &gt; can be more effective for spir=\r\nitual progress, than the words of a normal\n&gt; &gt; person that one can intellec=\r\ntually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest\n&gt; &gt; not worrying about whet=\r\nher one understands or not and reading Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; mantras coming from gre=\r\nat rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman ma=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the=\r\n ball\n&gt; &gt; from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the l=\r\nine of the\n&gt; &gt; ball, how to play it with a straight bat, when to play front=\r\n foot and when\n&gt; &gt; to play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily mak=\r\ne one a good\n&gt; &gt; batsman. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player=\r\n. Of course, some\n&gt; &gt; basic understanding of principles is needed. But, abo=\r\nve that, practice is\n&gt; &gt; more important than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in spiri=\r\ntuality\n&gt; &gt; also, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all pat=\r\nhs is\n&gt; &gt; very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions that we ar=\r\ne doing\n&gt; &gt; things and realize that the divine acts through all of us. The =\r\ndivine acts\n&gt; &gt; through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives co=\r\nrresponding\n&gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes t=\r\nhe notions of &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike =\r\nthat&quot; etc. Though this\n&gt; &gt; is the essence of all scriptures and one knows i=\r\nt, one may be deluded again\n&gt; &gt; and again. There is no magic formula to int=\r\nernalize this understanding fully\n&gt; &gt; and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am d=\r\noing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if one practice=\r\ns a mantra that one does not intellectually\n&gt; &gt; understand, that is ok. As =\r\nlong as the basic essence of scriptures is at the\n&gt; &gt; back of one&#39;s mind, o=\r\nne is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; own thoughts and=\r\n instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; &gt; will yield =\r\nresults.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is why =\r\nI keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read\n&gt; &gt; scriptures and=\r\n other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically\n&gt; &gt; or virtua=\r\nlly, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create\n&gt; &gt; a th=\r\neoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding o=\r\nf what is\n&gt; &gt; what and what we want, is like a blind person running around =\r\na mountain,\n&gt; &gt; instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having a=\r\nn excellent\n&gt; &gt; theoretical understanfing, is like a person who knows that =\r\nhe needs to climb\n&gt; &gt; the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle inste=\r\nad of climbing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Re=\r\ngarding the statement that initiation is important in tantric path but\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nnot in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whethe=\r\nr Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a\n&gt; &gt; contin=\r\nuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s at=\r\ntitude and\n&gt; &gt; what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results =\r\nneeds to be\n&gt; &gt; careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of kar=\r\nmas to affect a\n&gt; &gt; particular result is not easy. It requires supervision =\r\nof a good guru and\n&gt; &gt; not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one =\r\nis NOT looking for\n&gt; &gt; specific material results and is looking for spiritu=\r\nal progress, the\n&gt; &gt; constraints are fewer and options more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some may sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path is for b=\r\negetting\n&gt; &gt; specific material results and Vedic path is for self-realizati=\r\non. That is\n&gt; &gt; incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant Manyu=\r\n sooktam for\n&gt; &gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevity, an=\r\nd so on.\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substance i=\r\nn an elaborate\n&gt; &gt; ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and=\r\n to remove the\n&gt; &gt; mental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are looki=\r\nng for a specific material result,\n&gt; &gt; you need clear guidance and supervis=\r\nion, which not many are capable of\n&gt; &gt; giving today! Instead, if you want s=\r\npiritual progress and an increase of\n&gt; &gt; your surrender, you can just keep =\r\ndoing sadhana without initiation or\n&gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep company of scri=\r\nptures and other like-minded people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After all, if =\r\nyou want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise\n&gt; &gt; directions and s=\r\nome supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; &gt; can keep wal=\r\nking towards north. Of course, having supervision helps there\n&gt; &gt; too, but =\r\nyou can do without it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writin=\r\ngs,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri T=\r\narpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.o=\r\nrg&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_patha=\r\nk@... &lt;vedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Satya Pr=\r\nakash Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initia=\r\nte to read in English or any\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other regional language is because unders=\r\ntanding the meaning and &gt;constant\n&gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one=\r\n repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a\n&gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its understa=\r\nndable.

Since\n&gt; &gt; the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away=\r\n from internet forums due to\n&gt; &gt; various reasons. It has been nearly a year=\r\n since I interacted on an internet\n&gt; &gt; forum. However after Narasimha garu =\r\nforwarded a copy of the original post\n&gt; &gt; with my write up to my inbox, I v=\r\nisited this forum and quickly browsed\n&gt; &gt; through some posts. I am happy to=\r\n note that the general atmosphere here is\n&gt; &gt; far better and more sincere t=\r\nhan a lot of other forums. Having quickly\n&gt; &gt; browsed through this particul=\r\nar thread, I thought that I might reply to\n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question rega=\r\nrding the necessity\n&gt; &gt; of initiation. I will address it after summarizing =\r\nthe big picture that\n&gt; &gt; needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE=\r\n question and the MANY\n&gt; &gt; answers possible. Firstly is the question a gene=\r\nral or specific one?\n&gt; &gt; Generally speaking if the question is whether init=\r\niation is an absolute\n&gt; &gt; requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* a=\r\nnswer is- NO. However if\n&gt; &gt; the question is about the necessity of being i=\r\nnitiated for mantra sadhana as\n&gt; &gt; enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer i=\r\ns =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna=\r\n&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the\n&gt; &gt; necessity for multiple approac=\r\nhes and multiple paths. Thus arises the\n&gt; &gt; inevitability of multiple persp=\r\nectives. In the pan-Indian context there are\n&gt; &gt; many paths for sadhana. Bu=\r\nt in the current context of this question I will\n&gt; &gt; restrict myself to onl=\r\ny the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga=\r\n (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Ac=\r\ntion- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great\n&gt; &gt; abs=\r\ntract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truth=\r\ns at\n&gt; &gt; an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant meth=\r\nods/\n&gt; &gt; techniques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For =\r\nthose who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly\n&gt; &gt; speakin=\r\ng even the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly\n&gt; &gt; benef=\r\nit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n(self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular\n&gt; &gt; se=\r\nlf-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practices\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for external practice=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-=\r\ncoaching by consistent\n&gt; &gt; practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-at=\r\ntachment). Hindu schools of\n&gt; &gt; Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidha=\r\nna&#39; (orienting oneself towards\n&gt; &gt; the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha an=\r\nd Jina schools of Yogamarga\n&gt; &gt; emphasise only the first two as they subscr=\r\nibe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Lo=\r\nve/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of\n&gt; &gt; Iswara&#39;s will throu=\r\ngh total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the\n&gt; &gt; emphasis in Karm=\r\na marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt; &gt; Engaging in act=\r\nions without attachment to the results is the mainstay of\n&gt; &gt; Karma marga o=\r\nf the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the =\r\nTantric path of mantra sadhana where\n&gt; &gt; alone the inevitable necessity of =\r\ninitiation and thereby the necessity of a\n&gt; &gt; Guru arises. Mantra sadhana i=\r\nnvolves the practicalization of certain occult\n&gt; &gt; truths via the energetic=\r\ns of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It\n&gt; &gt; presupposes certain danger=\r\ns inherent to any lab experiment and thereby\n&gt; &gt; certain regulations and sa=\r\nfe practices. It should be remembered that except\n&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga most pat=\r\nhs invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti\n&gt; &gt; predominantly in=\r\nvokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old\n&gt; &gt; `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Amon=\r\ng the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs\n&gt; &gt; the fire of the =\r\nintellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of\n&gt; &gt; austerity, a=\r\nnd yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of =\r\nVak through\n&gt; &gt; the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs h=\r\nighly powerful\n&gt; &gt; techniques that bring results more quickly it lays great=\r\n emphasis on\n&gt; &gt; adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about q=\r\nualification.\n&gt; &gt; Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without a=\r\nny supervision?\n&gt; &gt; Does the supervisor need experience and training or not=\r\n? Like any other lab\n&gt; &gt; experiment proper training and experience are part=\r\n of the procedure apart\n&gt; &gt; from certain safety measures, in the Tantric la=\r\nb experiment too. However the\n&gt; &gt; lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the=\r\n experiment is awakening the Sakti\n&gt; &gt; within the individual consciousness =\r\n(also referred to as Kundalini Sakti).\n&gt; &gt; As this is not a topic for mere =\r\nintellectualisation, I will refrain from\n&gt; &gt; further discussion on the Kund=\r\nalini. Without going into other needless\n&gt; &gt; details here, I will just elab=\r\norate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise\n&gt; &gt; it=\r\n within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three major school=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; that are full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Ka=\r\nlikula,\n&gt; &gt; Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikul=\r\na whilst Sri\n&gt; &gt; Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture=\r\n more complete the\n&gt; &gt; Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tar=\r\nakula. To those who are\n&gt; &gt; familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw atte=\r\nntion to the the 21 forms of\n&gt; &gt; Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the A=\r\ndvaitic outlook as well as the\n&gt; &gt; Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhan=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Ag=\r\nni (not that Soma is not\n&gt; &gt; invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly i=\r\nnvokes Soma, at least at the\n&gt; &gt; major milestones in the internal spiritual=\r\n journey. The yantra, mantra,\n&gt; &gt; bija, devata, etc are all consistently of=\r\n a particular set of synchronistic\n&gt; &gt; frequencies for each of these three =\r\nlineages. Initiation is the full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; entry of the practitioner into=\r\n a particular spiritual lineage of that path\n&gt; &gt; (kula). The Guru parampara=\r\n can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA\n&gt; &gt; himself at the root from=\r\n where the trunk arises. Each branch and\n&gt; &gt; sub-branches and twigs spread =\r\nout progressively downward till the individual\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka. It is a beautif=\r\nul metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern\n&gt; &gt; metaphor that one c=\r\nan use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric\n&gt; &gt; advocate that =\r\ninitiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the\n&gt; &gt; conduit of =\r\nelectricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many\n&gt; &gt; beautiful\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way=\r\n up\n&gt; &gt; till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sou=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nndividual consciousness through an integrated approach that combines the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrated approaches\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seeming=\r\nly\n&gt; &gt; starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a full-fledged=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simultaneously =\r\na text\n&gt; &gt; on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of initiatio=\r\nn is\n&gt; &gt; relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employin=\r\ng the text\n&gt; &gt; as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a y=\r\nogasastra, the\n&gt; &gt; esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered e=\r\nxtensively in my\n&gt; &gt; write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Ad=\r\nvaitic path, Sri Sri\n&gt; &gt; Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful=\r\n reflections through its\n&gt; &gt; central message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Oneness. The crest je=\r\nwel, the crowning glory in the text is the\n&gt; &gt; Mahavakya wherein the Devi H=\r\nerself proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic\n&gt; &gt; fashion that She is one wi=\r\nthout a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in this\n&gt; &gt; universe. Who else is the=\r\nre besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other\n&gt; &gt; Mahavakyas of the Upa=\r\nnishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English or a=\r\nny\n&gt; &gt; other regional language is because understanding the meaning and con=\r\nstant\n&gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the text i=\r\nn a\n&gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup i=\r\ns to\n&gt; &gt; explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its =\r\nobvious\n&gt; &gt; status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally r=\r\negarded as\n&gt; &gt; Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. I=\r\nn that regard\n&gt; &gt; all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita =\r\nare equally\n&gt; &gt; possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chan=\r\ndi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; &gt; Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method wil=\r\nl straightaway\n&gt; &gt; identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In f=\r\nact even the worship\n&gt; &gt; of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based =\r\non and DERIVED from a one\n&gt; &gt; on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the=\r\n Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practitione=\r\nrs do the Homam as an integral part of Sri\n&gt; &gt; Sri Chandi sadhana in accord=\r\nance with the Vedic approach, there are those\n&gt; &gt; who adhere to the Tantric=\r\n approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra\n&gt; &gt; marga. It is this partic=\r\nular approach that needs initiation as per its own\n&gt; &gt; principles. Initiati=\r\non is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of\n&gt; &gt; Viveka and Vicha=\r\nra, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the\n&gt; &gt; Pauranic app=\r\nroach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise\n&gt; &gt; Homam too i=\r\ns not required if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; pract=\r\nice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these\n&gt; &gt; approach=\r\nes to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the\n&gt; &gt; living a=\r\nnd breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as\n&gt; &gt; practice=\r\nd originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally trace\n&gt; &gt; them=\r\nselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for those\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n paths, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; are all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, apt=\r\nitude\n&gt; &gt; etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to differe=\r\nnt\n&gt; &gt; practitioners. One may progress through a combination of any of thes=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated appr=\r\noach of\n&gt; &gt; KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture aga=\r\ninst which\n&gt; &gt; the answer to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of the met=\r\nhod and path,\n&gt; &gt; SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective methods fo=\r\nr all of us.\n&gt; &gt; Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed by refle=\r\nction on the\n&gt; &gt; truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in a lang=\r\nuage that one is\n&gt; &gt; fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRS=\r\nT AND BEST choice\n&gt; &gt; among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method =\r\n(though not as\n&gt; &gt; powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsang=\r\nha and satsangha\n&gt; &gt; alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spiri=\r\ntual life. Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of=\r\n serving, listening\n&gt; &gt; to and spending time in the company of sadhus and s=\r\nants in his younger days.\n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a=\r\n quantum leap in their\n&gt; &gt; spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangh=\r\na of Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of S=\r\natsangha nowadays, I\n&gt; &gt; will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there\n&gt; &gt; are=\r\n no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a\n&gt; &gt; qu=\r\nestion of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a\n&gt; &gt; hap=\r\npy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossi=\r\nping\n&gt; &gt; and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passi=\r\non, greed,\n&gt; &gt; and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good =\r\nSatsanga.&#39;...\n&gt; &gt; Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me=\r\n. I shall take you\n&gt; &gt; to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you =\r\nin the right path, guide\n&gt; &gt; you and elevate you to sublime heights. These =\r\n&quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are\n&gt; &gt; waiting to get hold of the right type of =\r\naspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Real seekers are few. If you bring=\r\n a charge, &quot;There are no good\n&gt; &gt; Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious =\r\ncharge, &quot;There are no real seekers\n&gt; &gt; after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportu=\r\nnity for\n&gt; &gt; Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this group =\r\ntoo is a\n&gt; &gt; potential Satsangha though not comparable to the actual compan=\r\ny of the great\n&gt; &gt; masters.

However, one without a rich =\r\nfather is still better off\n&gt; &gt; opening a bank account with a zero balance a=\r\nnd building it up slowly with\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not f=\r\ninding a guru can still do sadhana\n&gt; &gt; with famous mantras and build one&#39;s =\r\nown spiritual account. If you find a\n&gt; &gt; guru to initiate you (not as a for=\r\nmality, but truly initiate you), get\n&gt; &gt; initiated. Otherwise, just go ahea=\r\nd and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and r=\r\nituals are used for two purposes - (i) for\n&gt; &gt; getting specific material re=\r\nsults and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender\n&gt; &gt; and making spiritual pr=\r\nogress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that\n&gt; &gt; important. But, in =\r\nthe case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can\n&gt; &gt; prepare one sufficie=\r\nntly. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are very few people who\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; increasing surrender, getting whatever material results god wants to gi=\r\nve\n&gt; &gt; and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do rituals for beg=\r\netting\n&gt; &gt; *specific* material results (for oneself or others or society/un=\r\niverse in\n&gt; &gt; general), Nature will make arrangements for one to get correc=\r\nt knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; such rituals. But, as one starts, one should start with =\r\nthe attitude of\n&gt; &gt; (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I=\r\nf you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or\n&gt; &gt; any homam, d=\r\no it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but\n&gt; &gt; I do no=\r\nt know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any\n&gt; &gt; mat=\r\nerial results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is n=\r\not\n&gt; &gt; required. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but t=\r\nhere are\n&gt; &gt; fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may=\r\n be some\n&gt; &gt; hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a pers=\r\non is taking\n&gt; &gt; rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in gar=\r\nbage and trying to\n&gt; &gt; retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the pers=\r\non is gentle, one may do\n&gt; &gt; it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on=\r\n the floor will be minimal. If\n&gt; &gt; the person is aggressive, one may do it =\r\nfast and there may be more spillage\n&gt; &gt; of rotten fruits on the floor. But =\r\nthe good fruit stuck under the rotten\n&gt; &gt; fruits will be retrieved faster. =\r\nSimilarly, phala of your karmas is in a\n&gt; &gt; basket. The deity is trying to =\r\ntake bad fruits and throw them in garbage and\n&gt; &gt; give you a good fruit to =\r\neat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity\n&gt; &gt; like Ganapathi, Vishnu =\r\nor Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good\n&gt; &gt; fruit, but the spilla=\r\nge will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairava or Kali or=\r\n Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit\n&gt; &gt; comes out faster.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that thes=\r\ne fruits are not deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; creations, but fruits of your own actions. Wit=\r\nhout sadhana, you would&#39;ve had\n&gt; &gt; to eat each of those rotten fruits befor=\r\ne eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never=\r\ntheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten\n&gt; &gt; fruits is be=\r\ntter off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with\n&gt; &gt; gentle=\r\nr deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a\n&gt; &gt; gu=\r\nru before starting a practice. If you realize the above, you can start\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; that it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is trying to accel=\r\nerate\n&gt; &gt; good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a=\r\n lamp in their life and were\n&gt; &gt; ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam=\r\n now. Some people who took several\n&gt; &gt; hours to read Saptashati for the fir=\r\nst time just 2-3 years back are now\n&gt; &gt; doing Chandi homam with entire sapt=\r\nashati everyday. I know that some of them\n&gt; &gt; have transformed a lot and ha=\r\nve experienced some things too. Obviously, they\n&gt; &gt; have done sadhana with =\r\nfire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine\n&gt; &gt; Mother in some past li=\r\nves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignoran=\r\nce and rank materialism, if someone\n&gt; &gt; has even a faint idea that spiritua=\r\nl progress is important, is looking for\n&gt; &gt; god and is attracted to a speci=\r\nfic advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that\n&gt; &gt; person obviously has some =\r\ngood karmas and good vasanas. That person has done\n&gt; &gt; that sadhana in the =\r\npast. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what is wh=\r\nat, how\n&gt; &gt; things work, why one should do something, how to do it, what is=\r\n more\n&gt; &gt; important and what is less important, that is what initiation is =\r\nall about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; H.Ramalingam\n&gt; \n&gt; Ma=\r\nnaging Director\n&gt; \n&gt; Shri Ramana Heavy Engineering Private Limited\n&gt; \n&gt; No.=\r\n769, 59th Street, 10th Sector, K.K.nagar\n&gt; \n&gt; Chennai-600078\n&gt; \n&gt; Ph: Off-0=\r\n44-23662346\n&gt; \n&gt; Cell: +91-93847 41969\n&gt; \n&gt; +91-99620 31969\n&gt; \n&gt; +91-99406 =\r\n51969\n&gt; \n&gt; Email: hramalingam@...\n&gt; \n&gt; hramalingam@...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-834175597-1288168411=:99136\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Dr. Satya Prakash, &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I do see your points and do understand that Sankara peethams =\r\ndiscourage the practise of mahavidyas&nbsp;without the Initiation.

The only major point where =\r\nI disagree is whether one can do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. =\r\nThe rest of the confusion on translation of mantras needs some clarificatio=\r\nn as there seems to be some unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1=\r\n. There are various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agama=\r\ns etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, s=\r\ntotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahama=\r\nntras and mantras. The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as m=\r\nantras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. Undoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the=\r\n original. Reading a translation is not even comparable to chanting the ori=\r\nginal chant. So far it is fine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha=\r\n are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes a distinction between\n them.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. As per the traditional view one doesn&#39;t need to be initiated to ch=\r\nant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantra=\r\ns containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need in=\r\nitiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are n=\r\not the same as these other mantras that need initiation, which are generall=\r\ny referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras th=\r\ne actual idea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distin=\r\nct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidya=\r\ns such as Kali or Sri.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya=\r\n hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they fall under stotra category only=\r\n. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditionally viewed not MERELY =\r\nas stotras or parts of puranas. They have a larger status as integral parts=\r\n of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without initiation is\n not recommend=\r\ned especially when the reader combines the navarna or shodashi mantras too =\r\nas an integral part of the chanting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6. I know from personal interac=\r\ntion that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas =\r\nrecommend initiation for both the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya =\r\nalong with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are =\r\ntreated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these t=\r\nraditions hold that one needs to be initiated to chant the Navarna as well =\r\nas shodashakshari mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7. Recapping my earlier stance, Devi Maha=\r\ntmyam is a great text that has an independent status by itself as part of a=\r\n Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Ad=\r\nvaitic text in the spirit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navaksha=\r\nri is an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that=\r\n one needs to be initiated to chant it. However if one\n wishes to benefit f=\r\nrom the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , readin=\r\ng the sacred myth in the vernacular has been recommended in my write-up, as=\r\n chanting the original along with the navakshari amounts to practicing the =\r\nsadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommended to be initiated and =\r\ngo through the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8. Argu=\r\nably if an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sans=\r\nkrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an i=\r\nnherent problem in our times. The problem with attempting to do a parayana =\r\nof Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most reader=\r\ns inadvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as =\r\nthe Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;9. I yo=\r\nu carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, n=\r\nowhere do I put down the Navarna mantra even in\n writing. Neither have I at=\r\ntempted to write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have th=\r\ne power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended t=\r\no know the essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while ch=\r\nanting it. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a transl=\r\nation! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10. For those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path with=\r\nout initiation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a=\r\n certain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. W=\r\ne all have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiat=\r\nion). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do =\r\nsakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to j=\r\nust do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude=\r\n itself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on t=\r\nheir own accord in the natural flow.\n Leave the rest to the compassionate G=\r\noddess. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hope the above pointers help in clearing any confusion. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards,&lt;BR&gt;Satya Prakash &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, h ramalingam &lt;hramalingam@...&gt=\r\n; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste everybody&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I want to share one anec=\r\ndote happened in front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Chandrasek=\r\nara Bharathi Swamigal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When Swamigal was staying in a camp near Myso=\r\nre in Karnataka One day all the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; learned persons male and female ali=\r\nke&lt;BR&gt;&gt; requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in kanna=\r\nda language&lt;BR&gt;&gt; so that they can chant knowing the meaning fully.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was made early in the mornin=\r\ng.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Later in\n the day after the days pooja etc were over as usual Po=\r\nstman came to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamiga=\r\nl. Swamigal was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; seriously looking at the cover&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in front of =\r\nthe learned members and was looking at one line written as PIN&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Code=\r\n and followed by six numbers. Then he asked the learned members to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nexplain the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell that. But everyone&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; understood the significance of that number. Then swamigal asked his c=\r\nrew&lt;BR&gt;&gt; member to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his libra=\r\nry and read&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group t=\r\nhat even the meaning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of PINCode was not known to the group and stil=\r\nl it serves the purpose and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; people are using it in day to day work.=\r\n Similarly not knowing the meaning of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vishnu Saharanamam will not t=\r\nake away the benefits of chanting the stothsram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was he told the gro=\r\nup.

That is definitely the ideal situatio=\r\nn.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If that is not possible, what I am saying is t=\r\nhat reading something&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; composed by an elevated being even witho=\r\nut understanding the meaning is very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; useful. Suppose someone d=\r\noes not understand what Ganapathi Atharvaseersham&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; means, think=\r\ns in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; everyth=\r\ning and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. One can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; still benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything, it is\n mo=\r\nre&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; likely because one does not have the correct attitude and s=\r\nurrender and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the specific m=\r\neaning of Ganapathi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the m=\r\neaning and chanting may also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; experience nothing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many lay=\r\ners and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one superficial layer. Some im=\r\nportant layers are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most important lay=\r\ners of meaning are never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but only e=\r\nxperienced internally.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether you know the meani=\r\nng or not, chant the mantra with a calm and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; relaxed mind and w=\r\nith devotion and surrender. Many people keep a target&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; count an=\r\nd race through it or do it mechanically with a sense of duty. If it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and surrender to the\n deity, i=\r\nt can do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; something. The key to success with a mantra is calmne=\r\nss of the mind. If a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands of thoughts=\r\n and chanting of the mantra is just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one of those thousand acti=\r\nvities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; subside and mind=\r\n is essentially reverberating with a mantra, that is when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one =\r\nexperiences a mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are 4 levels of sabda=\r\n. When one says a mantra, physical vibration is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; accompanied in=\r\n other layers by the imagery in the mind, the thoughts and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ins=\r\ntincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some mantras composed&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentially beings with=\r\n very stable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such that the physic=\r\nal vibration of the mantra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can eventually cause the correspond=\r\ning imagery in the mind by resonance,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; when\n other mental activ=\r\nity subsides. Thus, after repeating the mantra and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; calming the=\r\n mind down, you can recreate a certain imagery and thought system&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; in your mind. That can permanently alter the way your mind workd. But t=\r\nhe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; key is to attain a reasonably stable, focused and calm mind=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpretation of Bh=\r\nagavadGita and Sant&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a power=\r\n of their own, as they were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; realized souls. In comparison, for=\r\n examplle, Satyadevaashtakam composed by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; me, though in metrica=\r\nl Sanskrit, will not have a similar power.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software=\r\n, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; rit=\r\nual manuals for short Homam and Pitri\n Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3D=\r\nnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://saraswatifil=\r\nms.org/&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- Girish Shahapurkar &l=\r\nt;geniusgirish@...&lt;geniusgirish%40yahoo.co.in&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Would it not be of immense =\r\nhelp to the ordinary person whose knowledge of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Sanskrit is li=\r\nmited not only to &quot;understand&quot; what he says but also take more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n interest, enjoyment, and truly get immersed in what he is reciting/ readin=\r\ng?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the reason for the great saints like S=\r\nant Dnyaneshwar to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; compose the Bhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But I agree with you that the sacred stotras should be rec=\r\nited in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sanskrit...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Humbly,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Girish Shahapurkar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 26/10/=\r\n10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr=\r\n@... &lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Translations, Initiation, Vedic vs Tantrik&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 26 October, 2010, 2:53 AM&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I will give my 2 cents on a few points.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I once wanted to trans=\r\nlate Devi Saptashati into my mother tongue Telugu&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in poetic fo=\r\nrm, so that Telugu people who find Saptashati too complicated to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; read or feel uncomfortable because they do not know the meaning, can rea=\r\nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the Telugu version instead.
