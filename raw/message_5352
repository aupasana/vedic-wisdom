But you are going to the other extreme when su=\r\nggesting that physical immortality is the highest ideal. Neither viewpoint =\r\nis correct.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIgnoring the views of a stereotypical p=\r\nsudo-vedantin of today, we can see that vedanta in fact does not say physic=\r\nal body is to be ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are not the physical=\r\n body and we are something else residing in a shell called the physical bod=\r\ny. What we truly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed, though physi=\r\ncal body may perish. But, if someone currently thinks that one is a physica=\r\nl body, one cannot simply ignore the physical body. One has to *use* the ph=\r\nysical body to eventually realize that one is not the physical body. A mere=\r\n intellectual statement of it is not tantamount to its realization.\n \n*    =\r\n    *        *\n \nIn Yoga Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasishtha clearly says that =\r\naction (karma) and knowledge (jnaana) are two wings with which the bird of =\r\nindividualized consciousness flies into the sky of self-realization. Physic=\r\nal body is not to be ignored, but to be used skillfully and carefully to pe=\r\nrform the *right actions* that can free one.\n \nAs I said earlier, one perfo=\r\nrming actions without correct knowledge (that god is the doer of all action=\r\ns!) is like a person who is walking around a mountain not realizing that th=\r\ne goal of walking is to reach the top. Such a person will keep walking fore=\r\nver and not reach the top. On the other hand, one having the correct knowle=\r\ndge but not performing actions is like someone who knows that reaching the =\r\ntop of the mountain is the goal and keeps staring at the top, without walki=\r\nng. Such a person will remain at the base of the mountain. Thus, jnaana and=\r\n karma alone are not able to free one and that is why Vasishtha compares th=\r\nem to two wings of a bird. The equilibrium caused by action and knowledge i=\r\ns what takes us towards liberation.\n \n*        *        *\n \nPhysical bodies=\r\n of some siddhas may indeed remain intact for a long time, like centuries o=\r\nr millennia. But, eventually, they too may give up physical body. Someone m=\r\nentioned Vallalar, but he gave up physical body, didn&#39;t he?\n \nActually, to =\r\na truly liberated siddha, this discussion of physical immortality will soun=\r\nd silly. Self is uncreated and indestructible, but its modifications such a=\r\ns physical forms can be born and be destroyed at will really. A siddha, as =\r\nlong as one does not merge in Brahman completely, can remain in an individu=\r\nalized *ethereal* body with a subtle ego, even after giving up a physical b=\r\nody. One can then create a physical body at will, then merge back in the et=\r\nhereal body after a few decades or centuries or millennia and so on. So, wh=\r\nat is the whole point of physical immortality?\n \nTrilinga Swami (aka Telang=\r\n Swami) of Kashi was a perfected Siddha. He was a guru-bhai of Vimalananda.=\r\n Ramakrishna Paramahamsa commented during a visit to Varanasi that Trilinga=\r\n Swami was Shiva himself. Bhairavi Brahmani who came to Dakshineshwar and t=\r\naught Tantra to Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Trilinga Swami. Later, a =\r\ngrateful Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swami a big container=\r\n full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his imprisonment by the Br=\r\nitish (for walking naked in Kashi), he was seen by some guards to be in his=\r\n cell and also walking on the prison compound wall at the same time. Even w=\r\nhen he finally decided to give up his body and his disciples put his body i=\r\nn a container and threw it into Ganges, he was seen after a few minutes to =\r\nwalk on the other side.\n \nTo a realized being with a high enough command ov=\r\ner duality, creation and destruction of physical body is not a big deal.\n \n=\r\nOne who thinks that a gold coin is special and needs to be preserved foreve=\r\nr will struggle to do so. One who realizes that a gold coin, a gold chain, =\r\na gold ring, a golden arrow etc are all basically the same (gold) can melt =\r\nthe coin and recreate it again. Preserving the coin forever is an irrelevan=\r\nt goal.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe key point is this. Trilinga Swami did n=\r\not get those abilities because he wanted them or did a sadhana for them spe=\r\ncifically.\n \nThe same non-dual Self fills us all. Whether X realizes non-du=\r\nal Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, the realization is the same. But, if o=\r\nne retains individual ego-consciousness and interacts with the field of dua=\r\nlity, different possibilities are there. One may engage in various actions =\r\nusing a physical body and at the end drop the ego-consciousness and merge i=\r\nn Brahman. Or, one may engage in various actions using a physical body, the=\r\nn give it up and tie the ego-consciousness to an ethereal body and remain i=\r\nn a higher realm for a long time. If so, one may re-enter a physical body f=\r\nrom time to time. But, all this is governed by one&#39;s caliber and evolution =\r\nin the field of duality. Though, all are the same at the non-dual level, di=\r\nfferent beings have different caliber in the field of duality. A rishi or V=\r\nishnu or a siddha or a natha may not be the same as somebody else.\n \n*     =\r\n   *        *\n \nI like Aurobindo, but I am afraid he lent himself vulnerabl=\r\ne to misinterpretation when it comes to divinization of matter. I say quite=\r\n emphatically that physical immortality as an ideal and as the end goal of =\r\none&#39;s sadhana is a dangerous idea.\n \nThe only worthy goal is to efface indi=\r\nvidual ego, realize Self and, if needed, engage with the world with a subtl=\r\ne ego and do whatever comes spontaneously. Once heavier conditioning is ove=\r\nrcome, Nature starts to show one the role one has to play. One should just =\r\nplay the role given to one well, instead of asking for this role or that ro=\r\nle.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyoti=\r\nsh Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarp=\r\nana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make =\r\na difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/JyotishWritings\n--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n \n---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; N=\r\namaskar,\n&gt; The aim of my mails is only to free the minds of the reader from=\r\n biases, caused by dominating propaganda of Vedantists - that is to see the=\r\n Physical body as something to be ignored for spiritual pursuit.

Sant Tukaram who was taken by Vishnu himself to Vaikuntha in his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*ph=\r\nysical* body to live there forever!) never talked about such a pursuit.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Even yuddhisthir went to heaven in his physical body, but that is diff=\r\nerent from\n&gt; &gt; divinizing the Physical body. Vishnu is one of the many deva=\r\ntas from which\n&gt; &gt; Physical consciousness finds its expression, another bei=\r\nng Agni, thus attaining\n&gt; &gt; divinity in body requires worshipping more than=\r\n one devata simultaneously.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Striving for physical immortality as =\r\na great ideal can create such an unhealthy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;fascination that is not ide=\r\nalized in any scriptures.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The divinizing of Physical body by Mahava=\r\ntar Babaji is a scripture in itself,\n&gt; &gt; and since such a thing is not bein=\r\ng idealized by any scripture, it only means\n&gt; &gt; that: &quot;Scriptures other tha=\r\nn Vedas contain partial truth&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They talk about the highest truth, =\r\nbut only Vedic method, of worshipping\n&gt; &gt; divinity in its numerous forms, i=\r\ns the most complete expression of truth for all\n&gt; &gt; the creatures in all th=\r\ne planes of existence. Such a worship would finally lead\n&gt; &gt; to divinizatio=\r\nn of Physical body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) As I said, Yoga Vaasishtham and other s=\r\ncriptures tell you to unidentify\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with the body to realize higher reali=\r\nties. They do talk about higher states\n&gt; &gt; &gt;beyond samdhi, but never tell y=\r\nou to think of the physical body as you attempt\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to realize.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ve=\r\ndic method, worshipping the devatas, allows for immortality, through Soma\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; devata.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) The ones in scriptures who actively pursued the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;divinization/immortalization of physical body did not succeed. For exa=\r\nmple, king\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Trishanku wanted to ascend to the immortal plane in his phy=\r\nsical body. His\n&gt; &gt; &gt;family guru Maharshi Vasishtha refused to help him. Ma=\r\nharshi Vishwamitra tried\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to help, but did not succeed!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OTOH, i=\r\nf one doesn&#39;t perform the yagna correctly, Indra doesn&#39;t allow the ascent\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; of mind, what to say of the body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All scriptures, whether it i=\r\ns Upanishads or Yoga Vaasishtham, say that you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;overcome your self-iden=\r\ntification with the perishable body and identify with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that which canno=\r\nt be destroyed. Then you are liberated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Divinizing the Physical bod=\r\ny itself will remove the sense of\n&gt; &gt; self-identification, Ahamkara, in any=\r\n limited sense bound to a Physical body of\n&gt; &gt; ones&#39; own possession or of t=\r\nhe loved ones. No one can attain liberation in\n&gt; &gt; Physical body, unless on=\r\ne divinizes it - Kriya and Jnana are not a substitute to\n&gt; &gt; Iccha shakti.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards,\n&gt; &gt; Aryama\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;s=\r\nilentadmirer_in&quot; &lt;silentadmirer_in@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Thanks for taking time to answer, because it opens up new things.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ch=\r\nange occurs in Physical, Astral and Causal being, with time, all the time.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Making it unchangeable, divine, only means, to realize that the Ahamka=\r\nra, caught\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in here and now of being is no more the governing force - a=\r\nnd niyati is probably\n&gt; &gt; &gt;an outcome of cosmic Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Signi=\r\nficance of realization at the Physical plane of existence is directly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\ndefined by the advantages that it has to offer over other planes of existen=\r\nce.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;This can be more easily done by drawing an analogy between the tim=\r\ne cycles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;planes of existence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yuga cycles from Satyuga=\r\n to KaliYuga and back to Satyuga.

They do talk about higher states\n&gt; &gt; &gt;beyond samdhi, but never tell you t=\r\no think of the physical body as you attempt\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to realize.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; (2) Saints/yogis who ascended to the immortal planes with their physical =\r\nbody\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(e.g. Sant Tukaram who was taken by Vishnu himself to Vaikuntha i=\r\nn his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*physical* body to live there forever!) never talked about such =\r\na pursuit. They\n&gt; &gt; &gt;only talked about surrender to the Divine. They did no=\r\nt actively try to divinize\n&gt; &gt; &gt;their physical being, but instead ignored i=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) The ones in scriptures who actively pursued the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;divinization/immortalization of physical body did not succeed. For example=\r\n, king\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Trishanku wanted to ascend to the immortal plane in his physica=\r\nl body. His\n&gt; &gt; &gt;family guru Maharshi Vasishtha refused to help him. Mahars=\r\nhi Vishwamitra tried\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to help, but did not succeed!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhat is best course of action for one sadhaka,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may not be the same=\r\n for all others!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I too keep emphasizing it from time t=\r\no time. But that applies to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;specifics. Some generic details are applic=\r\nable to all. Certain fundamental\n&gt; &gt; &gt;mistakes can be costly to any sadhaka=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once they are effaced, one flows with divine will and=\r\n is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A fair question. My answer=\r\n is no.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was assured by my guru that I can think of him or=\r\n the Mother and answer\n&gt; &gt; &gt;spiritual queries of people confidently and I w=\r\nill end up writing things that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;would be useful to people. That is why =\r\nI write, as an instrument enabled by my\n&gt; &gt; &gt;guru. I am not a realized yogi=\r\n myself.

As I =\r\nmentioned\n&gt; &gt; &gt;earlier, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa proposed to give some siddh=\r\nis to Vivekananda\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and the latter rejected them because they would not =\r\nhelp him in realizing god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Siddhis and other abilities that come witho=\r\nut a conscious pursuit can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;accepted with neither excitement nor reg=\r\nret, but they are not worth pursuing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;consciously.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see any reason, why an afterlife would bring me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n greater truth than where I am now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, this is not=\r\n an issue of afterlife.

I am am=\r\nongst the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;general populace of the world - to me, only the greatness pa=\r\nrt of the two\n&gt; &gt; &gt;characters have any meaning, not their faults and fallac=\r\nies, but I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;eulogize either of them neither demean them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not a philosopher. What I have tried to state so f=\r\nar, w.r.t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Success with Mantra&quot; topic, is that No matter how hard one =\r\ntries, Ravanas&#39; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ramas&#39; achievements in the field of &quot;duality&quot; canno=\r\nt be erased by any amount of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Highest shakti&quot; with or without Ego.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reason lies in what Aurobindo states as Sat-chid-a=\r\nnanda as the basis of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;all planes of existence including Physical plane=\r\n of existence. Argument of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Impermanence by Advaitins has not so far be=\r\nen able to erase the world of duality\n&gt; &gt; &gt;from existence. As per Aurobindo=\r\n, Ananda is the basis of sense-mind, Chit is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;basis of Physical con=\r\nsciousness, and Sat is the basis of existence of Physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt;plane, so le=\r\nts not argue that there is another reality which is better and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;happier=\r\n than this one, and that this world is a myth. If physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt;sense-exper=\r\nience is fleeting, it is because one has not progressed enough to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;real=\r\nize why the truth of being is expressed in such a way at this plane of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;existence ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience is not different =\r\nfrom Ananda, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Physical body not different from Chit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in the fiel=\r\nd of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-con=\r\ntrol and egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;hi=\r\nghest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This question =\r\nwas asked because you were trying to compare apples with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;oranges, by s=\r\naying that (egolessness) soul consciousness competes with ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt;consciou=\r\nsness, presuming that they act upon each other.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Truth of the matter is that Soul is not in competition with ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt;consc=\r\niousness ever, because God is never in competition with his creation !! If\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;a liberated soul wants to take part in an ego competition (Yada Yada h=\r\nee\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Dharmasya), it has to have an ego, however high, like that of an av=\r\natar. Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt;took the wheel of the chariot and tried to kill Bhishma,=\r\n not without an ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Other people may differ with me on this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I see inconsistencies in your views and a biased and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OTOH, I see a lot of consistency in this mail exchange than t=\r\nhe last\n&gt; &gt; &gt;time. It is understandable that my view wouldn&#39;t be consistent=\r\n in every\n&gt; &gt; &gt;mind-set, because at times, it is not possible to write ever=\r\ny little detail for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the sake of consistency.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; But the happiness one gets when one achieves something in the field &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;of duality is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The highe=\r\nst shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wh=\r\nich is permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aurobindo Ghosh has clearly s=\r\ntated:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;...If the immortal and infinite spirit =\r\nhas veiled itself in Matter and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is emerging, the development of a libe=\r\nrated Supramental being who shall impose\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in Mind, Life and Matter a hi=\r\ngher law than that of limitation and Division, is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the inevitable concl=\r\nusion from the nature of the cosmic existence. There is no\n&gt; &gt; &gt;reason why =\r\nsuch a being should not liberate and make Divine the physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt;existenc=\r\ne as well as the Mind and Life....&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, lets at=\r\ntempt to divinze Physical form, in accordance with highest\n&gt; &gt; &gt;ideal of Au=\r\nrobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji has done, because its basis is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Sat=\r\n-Chid-Ananada.

I see\n&gt; &gt; &gt;inconsistenci=\r\nes in your views and a biased and sympathetic attitutde towards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ravana=\r\n and his kin. Anyway, I will just make a couple of specific points on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nshakti, which is a subtle topic and not easy to understand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti is Memory.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If memory is extended the longest, the most fundamental and f=\r\nirst\n&gt; &gt; &gt;memory should say that one is Brahman. If one&#39;s memory extends th=\r\nat far, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;creates the highest Shakti! In other words, self-realizat=\r\nion brings the highest\n&gt; &gt; &gt;shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What =\r\ndoes the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great question!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any lower s=\r\nhakti is an ability to perform actions with objects in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;field of du=\r\nality. Why does one perform actions and manipulate the objects in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nfield of duality? Because one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the oth=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;But the happiness one gets when one achieves something in the fiel=\r\nd of duality\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The hig=\r\nhest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;which is pe=\r\nrmanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one is pursuing an individual=\r\n will, one may be swimming with or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;against the divine will. One will h=\r\nave some successes and some failures, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;pleasures and some pains. W=\r\nhen one&#39;s individual will has dropped off and one is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;flowing with the =\r\nrhythm of the divine will, one is in bliss no matter what one\n&gt; &gt; &gt;does. On=\r\ne *can* do anything, but one does only what divine rhythm wills done by\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;one!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only the fully detached Shiva can be=\r\nget Shakti in totality and demons\n&gt; &gt; &gt;like Ravana or Mahisha or Shumbha ca=\r\nn only get some trappings of Shakti but can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;never beget Shakti in tota=\r\nlity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A demon like Hiranyakashipu or Ravana=\r\n may kill or imprison a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;self-realized rishi. It may seem like the demo=\r\nn has more shakti. But the rishi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is in bliss whether he is alive or be=\r\ning killed, whether he is at his hermitage\n&gt; &gt; &gt;or in prison. The happiness=\r\n demons got from their successes were short-lived and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;ended later. But=\r\n the rishi was in constant bliss. So the rishi&#39;s shakti was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;superior.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why then fight like mortals, taking help =\r\nfrom mortal allies ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, just order Rudra to finish =\r\nthe life of all ones&#39; enemies\n&gt; &gt; ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is=\r\n the thing with shakti. Shakti is the ability to do things in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the fiel=\r\nd of duality. Just as you do not give important work to irresponsible\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\npeople, any level of shakti never goes to people who do not know how to han=\r\ndle\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that level of shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, if a ri=\r\nshi wanted, he could&#39;ve summoned Rudra to finish off\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ravana or Hiranya=\r\nkashipu. But, a rishi is in bliss no matter what and does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;break di=\r\nvine rhythm. If Sita, Rama and Hanuman have to come to earth and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;estab=\r\nlish certain lessons for future and take care of Ravana, a rishi will let\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;that happen and not do anything hasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBest regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself=\r\n&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http:=\r\n//SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_=\r\nin &lt;silentadmirer_in@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Rama defeated and killed Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Killing Ravana was not a great deed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ravana had done th=\r\nat 10 times himself, beheading his own head, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the shakti of his sad=\r\nhana was such that he got a new head every time to continue\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the sadhan=\r\na. On a deeper level, it is Rudra that finally effects the death of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ph=\r\nysical consciousness, so even that part is not in the hands of a mortal\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;Physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you still put Rav=\r\nana above Rama in shakti, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question your understanding=\r\n of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti is Memor=\r\ny. Hanumaan realized his shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt;only after he was reminded of it. Karn=\r\na, in the final battle, forgot his Shastra\n&gt; &gt; &gt;vidya because of the curse =\r\nof his Guru. Generalizing, Shakti is the ability to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;remember the serie=\r\ns of actions to be done to effect a cause lawfully,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;irrespective of th=\r\ne doer. Thus, Hanumaan had perfect memory by birth, and not by\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the ass=\r\nociation with Rama. Ravana didn&#39;t have perfect memory, else he would have\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;attempted to kill Vibhishana sooner than later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The use of shakti against avatar, binding the physical body of=\r\n both\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ram and Lakshman, by a mortal (Meghnaad) was a great deed, becau=\r\nse even the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;motherly love of Yashoda couldn&#39;t bind Krishna avatar by a=\r\n rope. Meghnaad was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;son of Ravana. If it were not for Hanumaan, and Ga=\r\nruda using divine powers, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;result would have been different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite all, without Vibhishana revealing the=\r\n secrets, it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;impossible to kill Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even a high level of understanding of the field of duality and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;even &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objec=\r\nts in the field of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with pe=\r\nrfect self-control and egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; latter represen=\r\nts the highest shakti and Lord Rama had it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ?

It is a continuum.=\r\n As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt;becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purer and increases self-control=\r\n, one may get some results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thus, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person still=\r\n afflicted by undesirable conditioning may acquire\n&gt; &gt; &gt;enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purity to get some results. But, people like Ravana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hiranya=\r\nkashipu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc fell in the end!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nat I called &quot;purity&quot; can also be called &quot;self-control&quot;. Both\n&gt; &gt; &gt;are not\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender of sla=\r\nves is not the surrender I am talking about\n&gt; &gt; &gt;when I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; talk about surrender to god. The instinct of self-preservation\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another aspect of ego. A person with ego and pride may=\r\n suppress\n&gt; &gt; &gt;pride\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and self-importance out of no ch=\r\noice, for self-preservation. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt;one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later gets a=\r\n chance to exert one&#39;s pride without sacrificing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self=\r\n-preservation, one may still do so. This is conditional\n&gt; &gt; &gt;surrender.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of god also, surrendering to god when one&#39;s =\r\nlife is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;a mess\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and one is helpless may still be =\r\nconditional surrender. But,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;when the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender i=\r\ns unconditional and one sees god as the controller\n&gt; &gt; &gt;of all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without any conditions attached, irrespective of whether life\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;is good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or bad, one becomes purer and purer and one=\r\n&#39;s self-control\n&gt; &gt; &gt;become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better and better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A powerless person may also become angry. But, as you said,=\r\n his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;anger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is powerless to do much harm. As one&#39;=\r\ns self-control increases,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendency to beco=\r\nme angry comes down. That increases one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;power. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; person who has a perfect self-control like Shiva is infinitely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; powerful. From where we are to there, there is a continuum.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;Higher the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-control and purity, higher the pow=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards, Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
