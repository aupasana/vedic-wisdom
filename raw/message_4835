Because of curiosity I=\r\n read Shri Narayan kavacham today. I was amazed to read that In the verses =\r\nwe request Narayana&#39;s incarnations to protect us from enemies. And these en=\r\nemies include both our external enemies and our internal enemies like anger=\r\n, ignorance, laziness, lust etc.\n\nSir I am curious that can this kavacham b=\r\ne used by a sadhaka seeking spiritual upliftment for overcoming his interna=\r\nl enemies?\n\n\nCan it be used to accelerate one&#39;s travel on spiritual path? \n=\r\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;=\r\npvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Fire in homam is a symbol of Sun on =\r\nearth.

Some times I have to attend emergencies i=\r\nn early morning. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I used to perform Homam during winters regularly=\r\n in early morning. but after summers started we usually get high incidence =\r\nof Emergencies in early morning due to harvesting season, then paddy sowing=\r\n season and now a days it is time to pour insecticides and pesticides in fi=\r\nelds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Due to all these reasons I had to quit my routine of doing h=\r\nomam in early morning. And sometimes it also cause disturbance in my Japam =\r\nschedule. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I seriously want to resume my routine of Homam. And as =\r\nShri Krishna Homam is done in morning I am hesitant to do it in evening wit=\r\nh a fear of doing a wrong deed. \n&gt; &gt;  In winters I will be able to do the h=\r\nomam in early morning as Emergency turnout it very less at that time. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; But Till then can I do the Krishna Homam in night? As written in your =\r\nbook &quot;Vedic Wisdom&quot; Maha Ganpati Homam can be done at night. So should I sw=\r\nitch to Ganapati homam to be performed at night?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Personally, I wan=\r\nt to stick to Shri Krishna homam as I feel myself attached to Him. But Doin=\r\ng Maha Ganapati Homam will also have same importance for me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope =\r\nto find a suitable answer\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; &gt; Atul\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
