There are patha-bedhas\n&gt; even in veda. Or, for now\n&gt; are you only saying that the pratishakya-s are all corrupted.\n&gt;\n&gt; (b) on what basis is correct pronounciation being re-inferred. I guess\n&gt; the pratishakya is out, and\n&gt; we are back to the panini-shiksha-sutras & such. But even here, how\n&gt; does one interpret the\n&gt; simplest sutras like &quot;uccairudAttaH&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; (c) current rig-veda pronounciation is generally &quot;better&quot; from\n&gt; sanskrit viewpoint compared to other\n&gt; shakhas. But, in the most prized shrouta karmas, it is the\n&gt; sama-gana-vikriti that is given much\n&gt; importance, even though most of its mantras are nothing but rig-veda\n&gt; mantras. What is your view\n&gt; when it comes to pronounciation of sama-veda? Because from a sanskrit\n&gt; point of view, it is rather\n&gt; &quot;interesting&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; (d) chandas-shastra in veda does not seem to be so simple. There are\n&gt; plenty of instances of mantras\n&gt; which are said to be in one meter . . . which don&#39;t seem to be in that\n&gt; meter at all. Some learned scholars\n&gt; are of the opinion that there are several differrent chandas all of\n&gt; which go by one name, particularly in veda.\n&gt; Secondly, some opine that the definition of laghu & guru are actually\n&gt; different, and letters being alpa-prAna /\n&gt; mahA-prAna etc also factor into the counting of letters.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is your view of traditional chandas-shAstra. The reason I ask is\n&gt; before we claim that traditional pronounciation\n&gt; is flawed in some cases (using chandas as the reason), one has to be\n&gt; very confident in their understanding of\n&gt; chandas shastra.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In fact, we have a lot of people who can\n&gt;&gt; memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually \n&gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot;\n&gt;&gt; a mantra.\n&gt;\n&gt; And efforts towards this goal are laudable.\n&gt;\n&gt; dhanyo.asmi,\n&gt;\n&gt;        ajit\n&gt;\n&gt; jayatu jayatu samskRitam. jayatu jayatu manukulam.\n\n\n"}}
