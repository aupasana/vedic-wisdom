The role of ishta devata \nis to give moksha. Moksha is the state of non-distinction between objects of \nuniverse. &quot;Supreme cosmic being&quot; (known by various names) is the observer of \nall with non-distinction and the gate to moksha. Several deities play \nspecific roles in the universe at the lower level and become one with \nsupreme cosmic being at a higher level. Accordingly, one may start praying \nto a specific form of a deity with a specific role in the universe, later \nrealize a higher form of the deity and then become liberated through that \nhigher form.\n\nFor this reason, some (especially some gurus at Sri Jagannath Centre) even \nsay that only Vishnu&#39;s incarnations can be ishta devatas giving moksha and \nother deities cannot be. This is partly logical, but based on a \nmisconception. Vishnu here refers to sarva vyaapakeswara (all-pervading \nlord). If one realizes an all-pervading form of Ganesha or Surya or Lakshmi \nor Kaali or Shiva or Subrahmanya, then too that form qualifies as ishta \ndevata who enables moksha (liberation). For example, Ganapathi Atharva \nSeersham describes a supreme cosmic being form of Ganapathi, from whom \nBrahma, Vishnu and Shiva come. Suryopanishat describes a supreme cosmic \nbeing form of Surya, from whom Brahma, Vishn and Shiva come. And so on.\n\nOne may start with the worship of Ganesha who removes obstacles and finally \nrealize a form of Ganesha that is beyond gunas and from whom Brahma, Vishnu, \nShiva, Surya, Agni, Vaayu etc are born. One may start with the worship of \nLakshmi who gives prosperity and money and finally realize a form of Lakshmi \nwho drives the thoughts and actions of all beings. One may start with the \nworship of Saraswati who gives knowledge and finally realize a form of \nSaraswati who is the root of all creation.\n\nThus, one starts worshipping one&#39;s ishta devata and slowly evolves to \nworshipping a higher all-pervading form of that deity, who may sometimes \nseem like a different deity to a casual observer. This is the natural \nprocess of evolution.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSaptashati rahasya associated with saptashati (Chandipath) describes the \nprocess of creation. It says that first there was Mahalakshmi with three \ngunas. She divided herself into 3 parts - Mahakali with tamas (ichchhaa \nsakti - the force behind desire), Mahalakshmi with sattwa (jnaana sakti - \nthe force behind knowledge) and Mahasaraswati (kriyaa sakti - the force \nbehind action) with rajas. The 3 parts of Chandipath are devoted to the \nthree.\n\nThus, trigunatmika Mahalakshmi is the root energy driving the \ndesires/thoughts, knowledge/perception and actions of all beings in this \nuniverse.\n\nIn fact, chapter 11 towards the end of Chandipath prays to Devi (divine \nMother) after all her exploits and addresses Her in the prayer as \n&quot;Naaraayani&quot; (energy of Narayana). If one views Naaraayana as supreme cosmic \nbeing from whom Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva came, trigunatmika Mahalakshami (or \nNarayani) is his energy.\n\nThus, the Divine Mother of Chandipath is not really different from \nMahalakshmi I have been worshipping for many years. I originally started out \nworshipping Lakshmi with 4 hands who sita on a lotus and gives money. I \nlater realized that a higher form of the same deity is the energy of \nNarayana (supreme cosmic being) and She is responsible for the birth, \nsustenance and destruction of all beings including Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhichever deity you are attached to and worship as your ishta devata, please \ntry to imagine that deity as the all-pervading supreme cosmic being from \nwhom the entire creation evolves.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, January 15, 2009 11:44 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Question on Istha devata to Narasimhaji\n\n&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt;\n&gt; I was reading up on the old mail about how your started doign Chandi\n&gt; Homa. You mentioned that you always considered Ma Lakshmi as you\n&gt; Istha Devata.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now what I was wondering about it that, is it possible that for a\n&gt; person to get closer to his/her Istha, he/she may have to under go\n&gt; serious sadhana of some other deity?\n&gt;\n&gt; Like in your case you have done so many homas for Ma Chandi, so does\n&gt; it mean Ma Chandi is your Istha devata?\n&gt;\n&gt; Or does it mean Ma Lakshmi wanted you to do these sadhanas so that\n&gt; you can progress faster, maybe you had done a lot of sadhana for Ma\n&gt; Chandi in previous lives?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kindly tell us your views on this.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
