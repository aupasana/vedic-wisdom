It was written in Tamil and only recently\nretriev=\r\ned from the Ashram&#39;s archives and published in the 1996 Tamil\nsouvenir comm=\r\nemorating the 100th anniversary of Sri Bhagavan&#39;s Advent at\nArunachala. Pra=\r\nkash Adiseshan of Ann Arbor, Michigan has translated it to\nEnglish, condens=\r\ned it and sent it to us for publication.\n\nA youngster was pursuing study in=\r\n the scientific discipline in college.\n\nHe would attend lectures in science=\r\n given by eminent scientists such as Sir\nC. V. Raman. He was convinced that=\r\n a career in scientific research would\nprovide fulfilment in his life. On t=\r\nhe eve of graduation with a Bachelor of\nScience degree, he wanted to visit =\r\na few places before returning to his\nhometown. He happened to think of Tiru=\r\nvannamalai, a town where his father\nused to frequently visit Sri Ramanasram=\r\nam. Having never seen a Sage in\nperson, an urge to visit the Sage&#39;s Ashram =\r\narose in him. After arriving in\nTiruvannamalai and entering the Ashram, he =\r\nobtained the Maharshi&#39;s darshan.\nThis Sage he saw did not appear like the o=\r\nne he had seen in the movies. The\nSage was wearing koupinam and appeared to=\r\n be an ordinary person. The\nyoungster bowed down before the Sage and sat in=\r\n the hall in front of him.\nMaharshi was seated and remained silent. There w=\r\nere many people present in\nthe hall, but the hall was quiet.\n\nSome time pas=\r\nsed in this manner. After a while, the youngster was unable to\ncontinue sit=\r\nting in a quiet manner. He did not know what to speak to the\nMaharshi. Fort=\r\nunately, there were a few books near Maharshi. He picked up\none of them and=\r\n began to read. It was an English translation of Ulladu\nNarpadu with explan=\r\nations.\n\nIn that book, concepts such as &quot;Being is One,&quot; &quot;The world is unrea=\r\nl,&quot; were\nenunciated. But the youngster could not understand them. At that t=\r\nime, his\nknowledge was confined to science. He could not help feeling confu=\r\nsed in the\nfollowing line of thoughts: &quot;Why should God create me? Where was=\r\n I? Where\nwill I be? Why should I remain here? Is all that I see false? I d=\r\no know the\npresence of objects using my five senses. Don&#39;t I see the Mahars=\r\nhi sitting\nin front of me?&quot; He could not read the book anymore. He fell int=\r\no a\ncontemplative mood. Just at that time, the Maharshi addressed the young=\r\nster\nthus: &quot;What is the doubt?&quot; The youngster raised his head and said, &quot;Th=\r\nere is\na human figure on the sofa. There is one on the floor. Upon looking =\r\nwith my\neyes, I perceive these two very clearly. But you say that in Realit=\r\ny there\nis only One. How can that be true?&quot; Maharshi smiled and kept quiet =\r\nfor a\nlittle while.\n\nAfter the passing of a few minutes, he replied to the =\r\nyoungster&#39;s question\nand said, &quot;You must be used to performing experiments =\r\nin your laboratory.\nLet us say that you are examining an object. The amount=\r\n of detail you see\ndepends on the quality of the instrument you use to exam=\r\nine the object; the\nmore detail your instrument shows, the more you know ab=\r\nout the object. Even\nin the presence of such a fine instrument, if your eye=\r\nsight is poor you will\nknow very little about the object. If your eyesight =\r\nis good and if the brain\nis not normal, the object&#39;s true nature is not kno=\r\nwn to you. Similarly, if\nyour brain is fine but if your mind does not pay a=\r\nttention to what you are\nobserving, the less you will know about the object=\r\n.\n\nIn summary, the amount you know about an object is dependent on an entit=\r\ny\ncalled mind. What is mind? It is thoughts. All the thoughts spring up fro=\r\nm a\nsingle thought. This single thought forms the source of all the other\nt=\r\nhoughts comprising the mind. This thought is the I-am-this-body thought.\nWi=\r\nthout such a thought, the other thoughts that identify various external\nobj=\r\nects and cause the body to be identified separately from the external\nobjec=\r\nts cannot occur. In deep sleep, devoid of I-am-the-body thought, this\nalien=\r\nation of external objects does not happen; further, there are no other\nthou=\r\nghts in that state. Upon waking up, the first thought to occur is the\nI-am-=\r\nthis-body thought. There are two components in this thought. One\ncomponent =\r\nis body and the other component is I. The body is of transient\nnature; it i=\r\ns subject to change and it depends on external factors for its\nexistence, s=\r\nuch as food. But the nature of &#39;I&#39; is opposite from that of the\nbody. What =\r\nexists in truth should be existing always. The body does not\nexist all the =\r\ntime, so that is not the truth. The &#39;I&#39; exists in all states\nincluding waki=\r\nng, dream sleep and deep sleep. Hence &#39;I&#39; is the truth; body\nis untrue.\n\nBo=\r\nth of these combined cannot exist as one entity that is true. How will\nnigh=\r\nt and day, light and darkness coexist? When there is light, there is no\ndar=\r\nkness; when there is darkness, there is no light. Similarly, there is no\nen=\r\ntity that has as its basis the coexistence of &#39;I&#39; and body. So the\nI-am-the=\r\n-body thought has no basis in truth. If we examine the world with\nthis untr=\r\nue thought as the basis, how could we learn the Truth?&quot;.\n\nAt that moment, h=\r\ne felt that the foundation of his knowledge being shaken up\nand his convict=\r\nion in scientific pursuit providing the ultimate fulfilment\nsuddenly disapp=\r\neared. Further, the Maharshi said that one can realize the\ntruth about the =\r\nworld after knowing the Truth about oneself. He spoke about\nSelf-Enquiry as=\r\n the means to knowing Oneself.\n\nThe upadesa the youngster received changed =\r\nhis mental attitude and,\nsubsequently, his daily activities. The youngster =\r\npursued life in the same\nenvironment he had before. But he looked for life&#39;=\r\ns fulfilment in the\nspiritual path, blessed by the Maharshi. He took up gra=\r\nduate studies and\nfurther undertook a career in teaching. However, he had n=\r\no desire to achieve\nfame anymore. He felt that the Grace of Maharshi allowe=\r\nd him to lead a\nharmonious life.\n\nThe Light that shines as Maharshi is the =\r\nsource of all and in all beings and\nis Iswara Himself. Let us pray in our h=\r\nearts to the Maharshi and live\njoyously.\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org=\r\n/newsletters/1998/?pg=3Djan-feb\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd10694e4ad9104811bc0fd\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;An anonymous author, a scientis=\r\nt, sent the following article to Sri Ramanasramam on April 14, 1946.&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0It was written in Tamil and only recently retrieved from the Ashram&#=\r\n39;s archives and published in the 1996 Tamil souvenir commemorating the 10=\r\n0th anniversary of Sri Bhagavan&#39;s Advent at Arunachala.
