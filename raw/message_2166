In =\r\nBoston time (EDT), the eclipse is from 7:58 pm on 2009 July 21 to 12:18 am =\r\non 2009 July 22. In India time (IST), it is from 5:28 am to 9:48 am on 2009=\r\n July 22.

Especially the sola=\r\nr eclipse of July 22 occurs when Sun is in the 6th degree of Cancer, which =\r\nis Sun&#39;s Mrityu Bhaga (death inflicting degree) in Cancer. When the eclipse=\r\n starts in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ketu and ascendant are in the same rasi an=\r\nd navamsa. Hence, this can be a problematic eclipse.\n\n\nEclipse time is a ve=\r\nry favorable time for spiritual sadhana, though temple rituals are halted d=\r\nuring eclipses. There is a reason for it.\n\n\nSun and Moon are the eyes of Pa=\r\nrama Purusha (the supreme cosmic being). Microcosmically, individual soul (=\r\nSun) and individual mind (Moon) are the eyes through which we see the dual =\r\nworld around us. If individual soul and individual mind stop seeing, one no=\r\n longer experiences any objects in the field of duality. The objectificatio=\r\nn within Brahman ceases and one is established in Brahman, i.e. non-dual ni=\r\nrvikalpa samadhi. In other words, one realizes Self.\n\n\nTo fulfil one&#39;s dhar=\r\nma as an individual in the field of duality, one needs to be awake to the d=\r\nuality. One needs the individualized consciousness represented by Sun and M=\r\noon. Hence eclipse time when Sun or Moon is blocked is unfavorable for dhar=\r\nmik activities. Temples and temple rituals, which are performed for collect=\r\nive dharma of society, are understandably halted. However, it is a great ti=\r\nme for spiritual sadhana for self-realization. This applies to homam as wel=\r\nl. If one performs homam for material benefits, one should stop during an e=\r\nclipse. However, if one performs homam for spiritual progress and self-real=\r\nization, a homam performed during an eclipse is much more powerful than at =\r\nother times. One can perform homam to any deity during an eclipse, though h=\r\nomam to an ugra devata may work better.\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00EC_01CA0996.58866EB0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;It was during a series of 3 eclipses like this th=\r\nat \nKrishna Bhagavan taught Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna.
