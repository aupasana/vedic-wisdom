Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namast=\r\ne Himanshu Mohan ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kavacha means &quot;protective shield&quot;. If one recites=\r\n a specific \nkavacha regularly, a protective shield of energy that is capab=\r\nle of \npreventing certain energy influences is formed around the subtle bod=\r\ny \nof the person.\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Ramakrishna garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; Both are fine. Anahat=\r\na chakra in the heart area is the centre of \nvaayu tattva in one&#39;s body. Va=\r\nayu (wind) is expansive in nature and \nfills anything it has access to. It =\r\ncan be restricted to a balloon or \nfill even a room. Once there is an openi=\r\nng, it gets into the area and \nfills it. The process of creation is also li=\r\nke that. It is expansive \nby nature and fills every part of Brahman it has =\r\naccess to.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, ajna chakra is beyond the five elements =\r\n\n(mooladhara-visuddhi show five elements). It is the source of all \nelement=\r\ns.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, both chakras are suitable for imagining ishta devata. If you=\r\n \nare primarily a dwaita siddhanta follower (clear duality), one may \nsugge=\r\nst imagining the ishta devata at anahata chakra. All the \nelements and dual=\r\nity continue to exist and the ishta devata is seen \nas the master of all cr=\r\neation. If you are primarily a visishtadwaita \n(special non-duality) or awa=\r\nita (non-duality) follower, one may \nsuggest imagining ishta devata at ajna=\r\n chakra. All the elements and \nduality are withdrawn and ishta devata is th=\r\ne only thing that exists \nin the universe. There is nothing else.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bott=\r\nomline is that both are acceptable, but one is conducive to a \ndwaitic expe=\r\nrience and one is conducive to a visishtadwaitic \nexperience. You pick one =\r\nbased on your samskaras and vasanas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapath=\r\ni Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:/=\r\n/vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Ramakrishna \n&gt;   To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, April 26, 2008 9:51 PM\n&gt;   =\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Issues to be discussed\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Dear PVR=\r\n garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Namaste.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Can you also please c=\r\nlarify on where one should imagine the \nIsta devata during meditation ?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Some people say that it is at the heart but some others say=\r\n \nit should be in between the eye brows.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n       Ramakrishna\n&gt; \n&gt;         --- On Sat, 4/26/08, m.himanshu &lt;himanshu_m=\r\nohan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;           From: m.himanshu &lt;himanshu_mohan@...&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n          Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Issues to be discussed\n&gt;           To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;           Date: Saturday, April 26, 2008, 1:50=\r\n PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;           Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;           Pranam.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Ca=\r\nn we discuss some mantra issues here?
