Even so call=\r\ned Vedic Sadhanas are often done for material gains. Recall how most of the=\r\n Sanskrit stotras of various deities contain a phalastuti (the expected res=\r\nults), is that not material gain? Doing a Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health=\r\n benefits, isn&#39;t that a material gain? It is not the path, but the attitude=\r\n of the sadhaka which determines for what he/she is performing a certain sa=\r\ndhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tools also a=\r\ncquire siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come as a byproduct of the=\r\n path. The problem is not with siddhis per se, it is with misusing them or =\r\ncommercializing them or hanging on to them. Any sadhaka who can gain a sidd=\r\nhi, can also let go of that siddhi whenever he/she wants. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Speaking=\r\n of Karma, everything has a karma of it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it stands today, =\r\nis roughly divided into two major geographic and philosophical demarcations=\r\n. The style practiced in South India - mostly Dakshina Margi - and that pra=\r\ncticed in Bengal and adjacent areas - mostly Vama Margi. In my personal opi=\r\nnion, the adherents of the path in both cases, generally speaking, have bee=\r\nn trapped in two delusions born out of collateral byproducts of their respe=\r\nctive paths. The first step of Shakti sadhana is generating shakti. Second =\r\nstep is holding the shakti. Third step is channeling the shakti. In view of=\r\n this, one school of Tantra that is prevalent today has tied itself up in t=\r\noo much of technicalities, such that on an average they forget to capture s=\r\nhakti (here shakti means energy, not Shakti the supreme Goddess). WHile the=\r\n other school is able to generate and hold shakti much better, only to comm=\r\nercialize the same and/or misuse it (generally speaking,\n&gt;  expcetions are =\r\nthere too). End result, both eventually do not end up producing enough genu=\r\nine Tantrik saints.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of=\r\n karmic liabilities one might be getting into ?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; A fair exchange is n=\r\never a robbery, as Vimalananda says. Theoretically, when the *right person*=\r\n performs many of the things mentioned in that blog, (and some of the stuff=\r\n there is not exactly accurately portrayed), he/she will know how to balanc=\r\ne the karmic impact well. In the hands of an immature individual, it can le=\r\nad to disaster. Further, the so called division between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; =\r\nand &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sharp and clear as it is made out there. Each i=\r\nnfluences the other and is very much intermingled.=C2=A0 Every sadhana in V=\r\nama Margi Tantra has a firm spiritual basis. Performed correctly, with the =\r\nright attitude, and by the right individual, it leads to very high spiritua=\r\nl states.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Bazeecha-e-atf=\r\nal hain duniya mere aage.\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah=\r\n mere aage.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: priyank_priya=\r\nnk &lt;aks_day@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 12 Ju=\r\nne 2012 10:14 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;mat=\r\nerial sadhana&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Hello all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I have been following so=\r\nme tantra groups and in tantra there seems to be 3 attitudes. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. ISht=\r\na sadhana - complete surrender\n&gt; 2. Siddhi sadhana - for gaining specific s=\r\niddhi (part bhog part moksha)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Material sadhana - related to bhog pa=\r\nrt of life. you do this specifically for the result you want. here there ar=\r\ne sadhanas right from kuber sadhanas to apsara/urvashi to making pact with =\r\nlot of entities (from ghosts to whatnot).\n&gt; \n&gt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; a=\r\nnd &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabilities one might be getting into ?\n&gt; \n&gt; relat=\r\ned reading\n&gt; http://aghorpir.blogspot.in/2012/05/classical-and-folk-tantra.=\r\nhtml\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; priyank\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
