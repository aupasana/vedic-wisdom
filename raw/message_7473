Saturn will bend you, not break you.\n\nThe Western scholars defined Life as full of thorns ( &quot;Life is not a bed of roses&quot;). The Eastern intellectuals defined it as a Vaitharani river, a macabre river whose flow is deathward. You will feel that they were right in defining life in such dolorous terms\n\nElarata Saturn occurs in Three Phases\n\nPhase I - Dwadasa Saturn - This is when Saturn is in the 12th - Is dangerous but not as severe as Janma Saturn\n\nPhase II - Janma Saturn - This is when Saturn is in the Lunar Asc ( This is severe )\n\nPhase III - Dwitheeya Saturn - When Saturn is in the Second - The evil is lessened considerably but the Dosha persists. \n\nOn the positive side, you have to understand that the suffering which you undergo are merely wages and that Initiation is a process of intensive culture and accelerated evolution. Many lessons will be learnt during this phase. It is said that the wise recognise Negativity as an inevitable clearing process and maintain equanimity. \n\nYou can chant the following sloka to ward off the negative radiation of Elarata Saturn.\n\n\n\n\nDwadashashtma Janmadi\nDwitheeyardheshu Rasishu\nYe Ye Sangathan Doshah\nSarve Nasynathu Vai Prabho\n\nAstro Therapy For Saturn\n\nFasting on Saturdays\nWorshipping the Tutelary Deity (Kula Devata) on Saturdays\nWearing Blue Sapphire on a Shukla Paksha Saturday\nLighting an ellunthiri at Lord Ayyappa temple on Saturdays\nWearing a Sastha Yantra\nWearing a Saturn Astral Talisman /Reciting the Mantra of Saturn\non Saturdays \n\nReading the Holy Book ( Devi Mahatmyam ) on Saturdays & performing a Saturn Havan are some of the remedial measures recommended\n\nSastha Yantra is said to be Ideal in warding off the malevolent rays of radical Saturn. \n\n\nFasting - Not only spiritually but medically recommended \nNaturopathy averrs that Fasting is the best Medicine ( Lankhanam Paramoushadham ).

( Kurvanthi Pranasandeham Sthanabramsam Dhanakshayam \n).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your mind becomes a melting pot of mental turmoil. Saturn creates \nwilderness in the psyche, making you desperate at times. You may not get even \nproper rest. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Problems surface like a ten-headed Hydra. Once you try to \nsolve one problem, another takes its place.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mental peace and happiness \nmake a strategic retreat. Saturn will bend you, not break you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The \nWestern scholars defined Life as full of thorns ( &quot;Life is not a bed of roses&quot;). \nThe Eastern intellectuals defined it as a Vaitharani river, a macabre river \nwhose flow is deathward. You will feel that they were right in defining life in \nsuch dolorous terms&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P align=justify&gt;Elarata Saturn occurs in Three Phases&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Phase I - Dwadasa \nSaturn - This is when Saturn is in the 12th - Is dangerous but not as severe as \nJanma Saturn&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Phase II - Janma Saturn - This is when Saturn is in the \nLunar Asc ( This is severe )&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Phase III - Dwitheeya Saturn - When Saturn \nis in the Second - The evil is lessened considerably but the Dosha persists. \n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On the positive side, you have to understand that the suffering which \nyou undergo are merely wages and that Initiation is a process of intensive \nculture and accelerated evolution. Many lessons will be learnt during this \nphase. It is said that the wise recognise Negativity as an inevitable clearing \nprocess and maintain equanimity. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You can chant the following sloka to \nward off the negative radiation of Elarata \nSaturn.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dwadashashtma Janmadi&lt;BR&gt;Dwitheeyardheshu \nRasishu&lt;BR&gt;Ye Ye Sangathan Doshah&lt;BR&gt;Sarve Nasynathu Vai Prabho&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Astro \nTherapy For Saturn&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fasting on Saturdays&lt;BR&gt;Worshipping the Tutelary Deity \n(Kula Devata) on Saturdays&lt;BR&gt;Wearing Blue Sapphire on a Shukla Paksha \nSaturday&lt;BR&gt;Lighting an ellunthiri at Lord Ayyappa temple on \nSaturdays&lt;BR&gt;Wearing a Sastha Yantra&lt;BR&gt;Wearing a Saturn Astral Talisman \n/Reciting the Mantra of Saturn&lt;BR&gt;on Saturdays &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reading the Holy Book ( \nDevi Mahatmyam ) on Saturdays &amp; performing a Saturn Havan are some of the \nremedial measures recommended&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sastha Yantra is said to be Ideal in \nwarding off the malevolent rays of radical Saturn. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fasting - Not \nonly spiritually but medically recommended &lt;BR&gt;Naturopathy averrs that Fasting \nis the best Medicine ( Lankhanam Paramoushadham ). According to Ayurveda, the \nAnnarasa in the body, during fasting, is converted into the Seven Gross Dhathus \n( the seven tissue-elements). One of the Fivefold Worship in Naturopathy is \nAkashopasana, which is fasting. We overeat everyday with the result the \ndigestive system has no rest. During fasting, the digestive system gets absolute \nrest. Overeating has been identified by Naturopathy as the main cause of \ndisease. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vara Puja&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vara Puja is said to be the most effective \nremedy in Vedic Astrology.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On the day of the problem causing planet that \nplanet is to be propitiated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Saturn is the problem causer&lt;BR&gt;Saturday \nis the day where the Deity of Saturn - ( Lord Ayyappa )&lt;BR&gt;The Yantra of Saturn \n- ( Shaneeswara Yantra )&lt;BR&gt;Tthe Mantra of Saturn - ( Om Hreem Sanaischarai \nNamah),&lt;BR&gt;The Holy Book of Saturn - ( Devi Mahatmyam) &amp;&lt;BR&gt;The Gemstone of \nSaturn - ( Blue Sapphire)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;are to be propitiated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Saturn Mantra \n&lt;BR&gt;Om Shanaishcharayai Namah &lt;BR&gt;Saturn Stotra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Neelanjana \nSamabhasam&lt;BR&gt;Raviputram Yamagrajam&lt;BR&gt;Chaya Marthanda Sambhootham&lt;BR&gt;Tham \nNamami Sanaiswaram&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;O Son of the Sun and the Imparter of Patience and \nPerseverance. I&lt;BR&gt;bow down to Thee !&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Saturn Gayatri&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Om \nKakadwajaya Vidmahe Khadga Hastaya Deemahi.&lt;BR&gt;Thanno Manda \nPrachodayath.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Maha Mrithyunjaya Mantra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This mantra is heavily used \nto ward off Saturn&#39;s attacks and is heavily used during the malevolent Elarata \nSaturnine phase.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Om Thrayambakam Yajamahe Sugandhim \nPushtivardhanam&lt;BR&gt;Oorvarukamiva Bandhanan Mruthyor Muksheeyu Mamrithath \n&lt;BR&gt;Saturn Peeda Hara Sthothra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Soorya Putro Deergha \nDeho&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vishalaksha Siva Priyah&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mandachara Prasannatma&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Peedam \nHarathu Me Shanih&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chanting it 108 times is said to reduce Saturnine \nmaleficence. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chanting Mantras needs the utmost purity of Body, Mind and \nSoul. This is difficult to achieve during the Dark Age ( Kali Yuga ).Hence \nwearing of the appropriate Yantra is recommended as we cannot keep up the purity \nof Body, Mind &amp; Self. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Yantra is a silver or gold plate \nwherein the Mantra is inscribed and given after 10 days Puja by learned Brahmin \nscholars, who impart it with the necessary Pranic ( Positive ) Energy. \n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wearing a Blue Sapphire is another remedy. Listening to Navagraha Shanti \nMantras cassette, particularly the mantras of Saturn is another astrotherapeutic \nmeasure. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sometimes, even Yantra may not be enough. If the affliction is \nsevere, one has to go beyond Mantra and Yantra and go in for Havans. \nMahamrityunjaya Havan and Saneeswara Havans are the 2 major Havans which are \nperformed to offest the maleficence of Elarata Saturn. It has to be done with \ndiligence, by bona fide Tantriks who have dedicated their life to Tantra and \nspirituality. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P class=articletext align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Article by G Kumar, astrologer, writer &amp; programmer of&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A \nhref=&quot;http://www.eastrovedica.com&quot;&gt;www.eastrovedica.com&lt;/A&gt;.
