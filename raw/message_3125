But it is ok. Atleast, you are engaging your I-sense =\r\nto work for the benefit of the world rather than self-gratification. When d=\r\no a homam or archana, you are trying to please a deity (personification of =\r\na particular good quality in all the people of the world). When you do soci=\r\nal service, you are helping needy people. And so on.\n \nWhile doing various =\r\nkinds of sadhana, one tries to take the focus of mind from the limited self=\r\n (body, name, status, image etc) and expand it to a larger entity (e.g. a d=\r\neity, a community, a society, a country, universe etc). One tries to focus =\r\nthe mind on others and not think much about oneself. This helps one overcom=\r\ne mind&#39;s natural tendency to focus on limited self and gratification of tha=\r\nt limited self.\n \nWhile doing that, however, thoughts may arise &quot;I am doing=\r\n this good and important work&quot;. Such thoughts bring the focus of mind back =\r\nto the limited self (body, name, status, image etc). By telling oneself tha=\r\nt the Lord is doing it though one and that one is merely an instrument, i.e=\r\n. by cultivating the spirit of &quot;Sarvam Sri Krishnaarpanamastu&quot;, one tries t=\r\no overcome that tendency towards self-gratification and/or self-glorificati=\r\non.\n \nAfter repeated practice, such thinking becomes common sense to one an=\r\nd one&#39;s mind gets focused on doing what one sees as one&#39;s dharma, without a=\r\nny sense of pride or self-gratification or self-glorification.\n \n*        *=\r\n        *\n \nIf a priest doing an archana for you takes your name and naksha=\r\ntra in the sankalpam before the pooja, there is nothing to be worried. In y=\r\nour mind, try to think as above.\n \nSome priests go much further and say all=\r\n kinds of highly specific things in sankalpa. For example, I have seen prie=\r\nsts say &quot;to give dharma, artha, kaama, moksha, well-being, strength, boldne=\r\nss, success, fearless, longevity, health, wealth etc to so and so person, t=\r\no remove all past, present and future sins and all past, present and future=\r\n problems related to all planets, shadowy planets, sub-planets in rasi, nav=\r\namsa, drekkana, trimsamsa etc charts at birth, in dasas and in transits, an=\r\nd to give results as though all planets are placed in the 11th house and no=\r\nt in the actual house of placement&quot; etc etc. Some priests spend 5-10 minute=\r\ns mentioning so many specific desires in sankalpam. When you find a priest =\r\nsaying things like that, I suggest just taking it easy and not getting eith=\r\ner excited or disturbed. Just think in your mind &quot;I am doing this ritual as=\r\n a humble offering to you. Please receive it kindly and give whatever you s=\r\nee as appropriate&quot; and try to focus the mind on the deity. What&#39;s in your h=\r\neart is far more important than anything else.\n \n*        *        *\n \nCult=\r\nivating the sense that whatever good work you are doing is being done by th=\r\ne Lord *through you* and whatever results (including very bad ones) are giv=\r\nen to you are fruits granted by the Lord to your karmas which you should ac=\r\ncept without regrets, is an important activity that should go on outside of=\r\n the ritual time.\n \nFor example, when one&#39;s wife or husband (or someone clo=\r\nse) yells at one or abuses one, fairly or unfairly, one has a choice. One c=\r\nan either become upset and angry and remain in that mood for a few hours wo=\r\nndering why the other person is so unfair/wrong, or one can just accept it =\r\nas the fruits given by the Lord for one&#39;s previous actions and focus the mi=\r\nnd on what good actions can be performed *now*. Similarly, when people prai=\r\nse one, one has a choice. One can either become excited and gloat in the pr=\r\naises or one can think that the Lord used one as an instrument in getting t=\r\nhat work done and focus the mind on what good actions can be performed *now=\r\n*.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam\nSpirituality writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish wr=\r\nitings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nFree Jyotish lessons =\r\n(MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n \n---- &lt;deleted&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\ndeleted&gt;, you had replied that we must  \n&gt; always offer all our actions and=\r\n the fruits of all our actions to  \n&gt; Krishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is relatively stra=\r\night forward at the end of a homam.
