For the sake of my own peace I can do\njapa. I w=\r\nill have my own benefit. What will come from doing Hom?\n\nThe fragrance will=\r\n rise up, high in the sky. It will mix with the\natmosphere.And mixing, ther=\r\ne will be water, and that water will become\nrain. From that all beings will=\r\n become holy, consecrated. There will be\ngood food.

Give it dry wood, it will burn\nit.\n\nHo=\r\nm is the Jathara Agni, the fire in the belly. Here in the stomach the\ntrue =\r\nHom is burning.\n\nThe Hom fire makes a breeze, a beautiful fragrance goes up=\r\n. It&#39;s like\nwhen you burn incense before the gods.\n\nMaybe you cannot do the=\r\n Hom fire so you light incense, that is also Hom.\nYou light a lamp or candl=\r\ne, that is also Hom.&quot;\n&quot;It is for the sake of the whole world&#39;s welfare some=\r\n Hom must be done.\nSince I have come to America, so for the sake of America=\r\n&#39;s peace I say\nto God &quot;Om! Swaha!&quot; and offer these things. In our India, Ho=\r\nm is\nimportant.&quot;\n\nLighting a candle is also Hom. Arati is also Hom. Underst=\r\nand? If I don&#39;t\ndo Hom I won&#39;t be fit to receive God. One must do Jogya.\n\nB=\r\nut not all rishis do it. I am not reproaching them, They don&#39;t want to\nwast=\r\ne time collecting wood and other things. Instead of that they eat\nand sleep=\r\n and take the Lord&#39;s name.

In its fragrance ther=\r\ne is great\nLife.\nEveryone in the world is sitting to do Hom. To get the gre=\r\nat Nirvana.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nBaba on love...\n\n&quot;Love is the main thing. You can do japa=\r\n, chant mantras,or do worship,\nbut if you do not have love then all these t=\r\nhings are worthless. I ask\nSatchidananda Guru to give you peace.\n\nI pray to=\r\n my Guru that in the same way that I have received blessing\nfrom him, so al=\r\nl of you shall have the power of Guru in you, and that\nall the darkness of =\r\nignorance will be removed, and that your hearts will\nbecome pure, and that =\r\nyou will see that inner being.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nBaba on the guru...\n\n&quot;By true Satsang =\r\nthe mind is purified and the intelligence is clear\nabout the inner being. I=\r\nf intelligence is clear, then Divyagyan or God&#39;s\ntrue self is revealed. By =\r\nDivyaguan we can have darshan of God, who is\nwithin us all. But remember th=\r\nat even though I keep saying that I am the\none who is saying all this, it i=\r\ns an illusion.\n\nIf you want to have some coconut, first you have to remove =\r\nthe husk,\nthen break through the hard shell to find the coconut. This illus=\r\nion of\nself has been with us for a long time, so it is hard to break. But w=\r\ne\nall have to try very hard to do this. When the ego is removed, then in\nit=\r\ns place we will have devotion. Devotion means complete love. This\ndevotion =\r\nis what we are looking for.\n\nGuru is the one who removes the darkness of ig=\r\nnorance and the dirt of\nillusion that we have accumulated over the years. B=\r\nut following the path\nof a Guru is very hard. It takes absolute faith. If o=\r\nne believes with\nabsolute faith that a piece of wood is the Guru then it wi=\r\nll certainly\nbecome the Guru. One cannot buy this faith with money or get i=\r\nt by\nreading books. Pride in the self is what brings people down.&quot;\n&quot;This gu=\r\nru of my life, this heart, this body is the temple of guru. So\nwhat is left=\r\n then, who am I? If always I remember guru, think about\nguru, and completel=\r\ny have faith in guru&#39;s words, then certainly we will\nsee God. Seeing guru a=\r\nnd seeing God is the same.&quot;\n\n&quot;This word of ours, &quot;guru&quot;, it means from deep=\r\n darkness by giving light,\nthe one who lightens the darkness inside me, he =\r\nis &quot;guru.&quot; Again the\nmeaning of the word guru is: after falling in a dark w=\r\nell, to save one\nfrom that deep dark well, the one who saves is guru.
