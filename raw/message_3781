The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa onc=\r\ne one *fully* understands and appreciates it.\n \nChandipath consists of symb=\r\nolic stories of wars that the divine Mother fought, which explain how one c=\r\nan fight and overcome various weaknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa.=\r\n Reciting these stories on a regular basis will promote the fighting spirit=\r\n within one that fights these weaknesses.\n \nThere is nothing wrong in under=\r\nstanding Maayaa and trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. One aspec=\r\nt of the Mother creates Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you experien=\r\nce good and bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you understa=\r\nnd Maayaa to overcome it. One aspect of the Mother makes you fight and over=\r\ncome it. When one realizes Self at the end, irrespective of the path taken,=\r\n one finally sees that all these are aspects of a Single Mother who is also=\r\n essentially true Self.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Also, I have started to r=\r\nead the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert\n&gt; Svobodha. For now I have very m=\r\nixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; Perhaps I need to read more! \n \nAghora seri=\r\nes books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It i=\r\ns normal to have mixed feelings.\n \nGhora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not =\r\nterrible&quot;. One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true Aghora (aghori)=\r\n does not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as imperma=\r\nnent manifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on w=\r\nhat is permanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god=\r\n.\n \nWhen someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while car=\r\nrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is=\r\n true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself th=\r\nat life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. =\r\nBut the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth =\r\nonly when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thin=\r\ng we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ours=\r\nelves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporar=\r\ny illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary ill=\r\nusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, =\r\ncan&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beauti=\r\nful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions. On=\r\nly the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;? When s=\r\nomeone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t w=\r\ne tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary illusion=\r\ns. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n=\r\n \nA true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind rejec=\r\nts all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them =\r\nby classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about=\r\n them with attraction/aversion) and tries to find and focus on what is perm=\r\nanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n \n*        *        *\n \nVedanta says &quot;a=\r\nll is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it p=\r\nractically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only =\r\npermanent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he can eat frui=\r\nt but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten. But, please r=\r\nemember that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the foo=\r\nd being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (f=\r\neces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust=\r\n serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant=\r\n manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may b=\r\ne eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is ea=\r\nting &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust.=\r\n He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating Self.\n \nOf course, a =\r\nvedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eati=\r\nng food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevert=\r\nheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in o=\r\nne&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestat=\r\nions of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly sa=\r\nlty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).\n \nThus,=\r\n a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth and trying =\r\nto absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putting =\r\nhimself in an extreme situation where failure results in a very bad dual ex=\r\nperience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend=\r\n duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am =\r\nSelf and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, t=\r\nhe fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not too =\r\nbad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu =\r\nor other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails t=\r\no absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting=\r\n. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience may act=\r\n as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n \nHowever, difficult tasks cannot n=\r\necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive. Not =\r\neveryone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n \n*        *        *\n \nTake anot=\r\nher simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam a=\r\nnd homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling=\r\n on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is cau=\r\nsing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n \nA regular person will try to enfor=\r\nce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a =\r\nformula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still co=\r\nme and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no g=\r\nuarantee that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after=\r\n that. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?\n \n=\r\nAn aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and=\r\n remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as tw=\r\no different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them=\r\n into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora si=\r\nts naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam.=\r\n In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think that =\r\nhis sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like=\r\n that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He ma=\r\ny no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel t=\r\nitillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may be br=\r\noken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke=\r\n thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts rela=\r\nted to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser and denser=\r\n thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may now take=\r\n the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in meditation whi=\r\nle sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for na=\r\nkedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination a=\r\nnd weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n \nMind has a lot of conditioning b=\r\nased on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora someti=\r\nmes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging in certain pra=\r\nctices that undermine those structures.\n \nHowever, is this a fool-proof met=\r\nhod? Not really. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in t=\r\nhe practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditati=\r\non (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if =\r\none was not serious/sincere/ready to start with.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBo=\r\nttomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets u=\r\np a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push the probl=\r\nems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky str=\r\nategy is not applicable to all.\n \n*        *        *\n \nLike Manish said in=\r\n a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a p=\r\nractical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by =\r\nsetting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable fo=\r\nr all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel at=\r\ntraction for it based on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an under=\r\nstanding brings. Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though i=\r\nt *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic t=\r\nenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to ac=\r\ncelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure v=\r\nery unpleasant.\n \nBTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various =\r\nspiritual paths and explains the basic reality. It may be interesting to re=\r\nad in the context of aghora.\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/m=\r\nessage/361\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons=\r\n, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pit=\r\nri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films tha=\r\nt make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Nagraj Kota \n =\r\n To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, February 18, 2010 11:5=\r\n8 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n\n        =\r\nDear Narasimhagaru,\n\n        Thank you for your reply. \n\n        I understa=\r\nnd that Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of the Universal Mother. =\r\nBut what I am trying to understand is that how to worship both forms simult=\r\naneously. For instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (=\r\none of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyam=\r\na Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna=\r\n Krithis mention great details about all the nine avaranas and different fo=\r\nrms of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana. In the Dhyana Kr=\r\nithi of those, in the very first line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalat=\r\nike, ChanDike&#39;. That line tells me that even through Sri Vidya one can wors=\r\nhip Chandi Ma, in that form. \n\n        So my question was in that perspecti=\r\nve. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self =\r\nis surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. \n\n     =\r\n   I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading=\r\n it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during =\r\nnavaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the sapt=\r\nashati! Have to see how mother will help me achieve my target. \n\n        Al=\r\nso, I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. =\r\nFor now I have very mixed feelings on the subject. Perhaps I need to read m=\r\nore! \n\n        Nagraj\n\n        --- On Fri, 2/12/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@=\r\ncharter.net&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n =\r\n         Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n          T=\r\no: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Friday, February 12, 2010, =\r\n11:31 PM\n\n\n            \n          Namaste,\n\n          Sanskrit is almost li=\r\nke a mother tongue to me. My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hard=\r\nly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, there are some people who do not kn=\r\now Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficult=\r\ny in their first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes=\r\n them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.\n\n          Integrating various =\r\nsadhanas is a personal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, =\r\nit is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent o=\r\nn them, instead of splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig =\r\none metre in ten places, if one wants to find water.\n\n          One possibi=\r\nlity is to do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with v=\r\narious mantras one is attached to.\n\n          I am not that knowledgeable a=\r\nbout Sri Vidya. However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakr=\r\na is a symblic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. It=\r\ns purpose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.\n\n     =\r\n     Lalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a=\r\n mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother=\r\n who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the st=\r\nrictness).

The variety we perceive \nis an illusion&quot;. =\r\nAn aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both \nimpermenant =\r\nillusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he \nquest=\r\nions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces=\r\n \nis eaten.&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;But, please remember th=\r\nat eating \nfeces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being c=\r\nonsumed and not \nperceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fr=\r\nuit etc), is the main \npoint. For example, eating feces with disgust serves=\r\n no purpose, for such a \nperson&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manif=\r\nestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) \nwhile eating it. A successful Aghora may be eat=\r\ning feces, but the mind will not \nbe dwelling on the fact that he is eating=\r\n &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and \nwill not feel any kind of disgust. He=\r\n will be thinking that he is Self and he is \neating Self.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial si=\r\nze=3D2&gt;Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions \nreally. He chants v=\r\nedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am \nSelf and I am c=\r\nonsuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a \nritual and not=\r\n be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may \ndwell on th=\r\ne impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly \ncooked bri=\r\nnjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on \nthe=\r\n permanent (Self).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Thus, a vedantin and an aghora a=\r\nre telling \nthemselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into =\r\nevery thought and \nimpulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme sit=\r\nuation where failure \nresults in a very bad dual experience. That can in fa=\r\nct work as an incentive in \nforcing one to transcend duality! In the case o=\r\nf a person who chants a Vedic \nverse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consumin=\r\ng Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and \nnicely made food, the fallout from faili=\r\nng to absorb the mind in Self while \neating is not too bad. If the mind dwe=\r\nlls on the nice (or even not-so-nice) \ntaste of a laddu or other food, what=\r\n is the big deal? On the other hand, if the \nmind fails to absorb in Self a=\r\nnd dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so \ndisgusting. Thus, the fact =\r\nthat failure results in a very bad dual experience \nmay act as an incentive=\r\n in succeeding quickly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, difficult tasks ca=\r\nnnot necessarily be \naccomplished by everyone merely because of an incentiv=\r\ne.

Suppose someone is doing a lot of sa=\r\ndhana, \nlike japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose on=\r\ne&#39;s mind is \ndwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sa=\r\ndhana and that is \ncausing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the m=\r\nind away from \nsexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming su=\r\nch thoughts. After \nall, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Eve=\r\nn if one keeps celibacy \nfor 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fasci=\r\nnation in the mind does not \nreturn to bite one after that. But, how to ove=\r\nrcome the fascination some minds \nmay have for sex?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cau=\r\nse and \nremove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and se=\r\nx as two \ndifferent activities (one pure and the other impure), he may comb=\r\nine them into \none without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an =\r\naghora sits naked \nwith his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does =\r\nhis japam. In the \nbeginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may =\r\nthink that his sadhana \nis being made impure. But, suppose he persists to d=\r\no japam like that for several \nmonths/years. Eventually, mind may be reprog=\r\nrammed. He may no longer feel that \nhe is doing something impure. He may no=\r\n longer feel titillation. The association \nin his mind between nakedness an=\r\nd sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures \nphysically or mentally may=\r\n no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts \nof meditation. Any sm=\r\nall thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head \nmay not lead to=\r\n denser and denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in \nsadhana, bu=\r\nt they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so \nmuch ti=\r\nme in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and \nthrill=\r\n mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the \n=\r\nperson&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences =\r\nand the thoughts \nwe are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down s=\r\nome of these structures \nby engaging in certain practices that undermine th=\r\nose structures.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;However, is this a fool-proof =\r\nmethod? Not really. It is also possible that \nthe person keeps on engaging =\r\nin the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex \neverytime he sits for med=\r\nitation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he \nsees naked partner=\r\n), if one was not serious/sincere/ready to start with.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses he=\r\nad \non and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person m=\r\nay push \nthe problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes=\r\n. Such a risky \nstrategy is not applicable to all.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Like Manish said in a mail ear=\r\nlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what \nis Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical w=\r\nay to understand and absorb Vedanta in \none&#39;s thought process, by setting u=\r\np a high stakes war plan. However, it is \ncertainly not suitable for all an=\r\nd many may feel aversion. More dangerously, \nsome people may feel attractio=\r\nn for it based on a wrong understanding and the \nthrill such an understandi=\r\nng brings.&nbsp;Aghora stands for neither thrills nor \nperversion, though i=\r\nt *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or \nperversion. The basic =\r\ntenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but \nAghora tries to =\r\naccelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by \nmaking failur=\r\ne very unpleasant.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;BTW, the following mail giv=\r\nes a good analogy for various spiritual paths \nand explains the basic reali=\r\nty.

My \n          performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-ins=\r\npiring. On \n          the other hand, there are some people who do not know=\r\n Sanskrit at all \n          and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great =\r\ndifficulty in their \n          first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam e=\r\nveryday and it takes them \n          1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Integrating various \n          sadhanas is a personal problem that n=\r\needs a personal solution. In \n          general, it is a good idea to pick =\r\none or two sadhanas and maximize \n          the time spent on them, instead=\r\n of splitting the time between ten \n          things. As Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres \n          in one place rather th=\r\nan dig one metre in ten places, if one wants to \n          find water.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;One possibility is to do a homam and then meditate \n          at the end=\r\n after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached \n          to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from \n          th=\r\ne little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic \n          repres=\r\nentation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, \n         =\r\n too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize \n          Self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Lalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. \n          If yo=\r\nu have a mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If \n        =\r\n  you have a mother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast \n         =\r\n (provided you can face the strictness). Both are valid \n          paths.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- \n          -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, \n          F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual \n        =\r\n  manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a \n          difference: =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A \n          href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n          wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyot=\r\nishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo=\r\n.com/ group/JyotishWri \n          tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- \n          --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On Fri, 2/5/10, =\r\n&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnagraj=\r\n%40sbcglobal.net&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow \n          ymai=\r\nlto=3D&quot;mailto:nagraj%40sbcglobal.net&quot;&gt;nagraj@sbcglobal. net&lt;/A&gt; \n          =\r\n&lt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dna=\r\ngraj_um%40yahoo.com&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow \n          y=\r\nmailto=3D&quot;mailto:nagraj_um%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; \n     =\r\n     wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.c=\r\nom/mc/compose?to=3Dnagraj%40sbcglobal.net&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow \n          ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:nagraj%40sbcglobal.net&quot;&gt;nagraj@sbc=\r\nglobal. net&lt;/A&gt; \n          &lt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.y=\r\nahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnagraj_um%40yahoo.com&quot; \n          target=3D_blank =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow \n          ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:nagraj_um%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;nagraj_u=\r\nm@yahoo. \n          com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam and=\r\n Sri \n          Vidya&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yah=\r\noo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n          target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow \n          ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ \n          yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Date: Friday, Febr=\r\nuary 5, 2010, 11:51 \n          PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;I am very much in awe \n          after I learnt that you do chandi homam e=\r\nveryday. You also wrote that \n          it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 ho=\r\nurs to do your chandi homam. How \n          can you accomplish that feat wi=\r\nth 700 ahutis in such a short time? \n          Also, in my case, I do sandh=\r\nyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 \n          minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam =\r\n108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra \n          Abhishekam with pachakshari=\r\n, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) \n          totalling to about 35 - 40 =\r\nminutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do \n          special rituals severa=\r\nl times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours \n          in all. How to i=\r\nntegrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana \n          different fr=\r\nom Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri \n          Vidya and =\r\nhow it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what \n          the De=\r\nvi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri \n          =\r\nVidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna \n       =\r\n   krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nagraj \n       =\r\n   Kota&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/P=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_001_0429_01CAB5A7.E283E120--\r\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0428_01CAB5A7.E283E120\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;nc3=5741398&quot;\r\nContent-Location: http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=19029015/grpspId=1705075991/msgId=3750/stime=1266515231/nc1=4507179/nc2=3848583/nc3=5741398\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0428_01CAB5A7.E283E120--\r\n\n"}}
