In fact, even if the original expert recorded it mechanically and without much devotion, you will still get good punya from it if you listen to it with focus and devotion.\n \nThe purpose of mantra is to control the mind and its thoughts and tap some spiritual energy that the mind has access to but does not get because of its various pre-occupations. If you hear something with focus, it still helps in controlling the mind, tapping some spiritual energy. It is still beneficial.\n \nHowever, as you become comfortable with it, try to chant it yourself at some stage. That is a little better.\n \n(2) Yes. As you hear, a part of your mind is repeating that sound while you do the actions. It will still be beneficial. In fact, I know that some people who are now doing homam quite well started out in that manner!\n \n(3) You will benefit mainly. But various people who enabled you will also get some small portions of it. But most of the benefit for this specific action is yours.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \n&gt; Hello PVR gaaru: \n&gt; \n&gt; I have couple of dumb questions; please don&#39;t laugh get a chance can \n&gt; you please clarify the same for me, hope I&#39;m not misusing the group \n&gt; with my silly questions: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1.\tWill there be any effect of playing Audio Mantras read/rendered \n&gt; by experts? (as layman like me, who do not know how to pronounce the \n&gt; Sanskrit mantras correctly, is it OK to take help of the CD&#39;s or Audio \n&gt; MP3 mantras available?). \n&gt; 2.\tYou have provided Audio and Video of Ganapathi Homam, will \n&gt; there be the same effect if one plays and mimic (imitating the actions \n&gt; without any self voice and your original voice in place)? \n&gt; 3.\tIf the answers to the above is `Yes&#39;, who will get benefitted \n&gt; (I mean will I get benefited or the originators who rendered the \n&gt; mantras or performed Homam?) \n\n\n"}}
