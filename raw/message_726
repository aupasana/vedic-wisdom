Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Nar=\r\nayan has already answered aptly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is ideal if the fire does not go =\r\noff in the middle. But, if it \ndoes, don&#39;t worry. Re-ignite it as Narayan s=\r\naid, pray to Agni in the \nmind and continue.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose a servant is ask=\r\ned by his master to carry a vessel of milk \nto a place without spilling it =\r\non the way. Suppose a little milk is \nspilled on the way. What should he do=\r\n? Should he abandon the project \nor atleast carry the remaining milk to the=\r\n destination?\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; As Narayan said, fire going a=\r\nway can signal the bhutagni being weak.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, one is better off ignori=\r\nng those things and not thinking too \nmuch about the significance.\n&gt;  \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I recommend doing homam without worrying about how =\r\nwell or badly it \nwent and what results it brought. Let me give an analogy.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as a \nservan=\r\nt. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all the \nsadhana you do a=\r\nnd your other activities are your way to serve your \nmaster.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A rich l=\r\nandlord may be very wealthy and have many big checks \neveryday to cash and =\r\nalso many big checks everyday to mail others. \nYet, he may need a servant t=\r\no physically carry papers to the bank and \ndo the needful. Similarly, god i=\r\ns capable of doing anything in this \nworld and yet god needs human beings w=\r\nho execute god&#39;s agenda in this \nworld. That is why various gods (including=\r\n Vishnu himself) and \nvarious rishis keep coming back to earth every now an=\r\nd then. The \nsupreme god of this world operates through various physical pe=\r\nrsons \npresent on earth.\n&gt;  \n&gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, pur=\r\nify ourselves and try \nto help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as =\r\na servant carries \nmaster&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to promote ego \nan=\r\nd we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million dollar \ncheck t=\r\no the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \ncarrying a $100 che=\r\nck to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely \ndoing their master&#39;s work a=\r\nnd do not own anything. Both are just \n*instruments* used by the master to =\r\ncarry out his agenda. Similarly, \none who does what are considered great de=\r\neds in this world and one \nwho does what are considered meagre deeds in thi=\r\ns world are both \nservants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this =\r\nworld. \nNeither really owns anything. One may consider oneself superior to =\r\n\nthe other because his/her deeds are considered superior by the world, \nbut=\r\n he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers \nhimself/herself supe=\r\nrior to another servant carrying something less \nvaluable.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If this at=\r\ntitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one&#39;s \nattitude, thinking=\r\n and instincts, one is safe no matter what \nsituations his previous karmas =\r\nplace one in. One can remain happy and \nblissful in pleasure and pain, in p=\r\nraise and criticism and in light \nand darkness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Have the same attitud=\r\ne towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job \nyou are doing for god. You =\r\ndo the best you can. But you own nothing. \nYou are doing it for god.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nBest regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tar=\r\npana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   Fro=\r\nm: rajarshi nandy \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday=\r\n, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha=\r\n Ganapati Homam\n&gt; \n&gt;         Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; \n&gt;         Reading your res=\r\nponse another question came into my mind. \nYou said:\n&gt; \n&gt;          It is no=\r\nt good if fire is extinguished by rain in the \nmiddle of a homam.\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n    Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or \nthe fact th=\r\nat the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; \n&gt;         I mean actyually i feel w=\r\nhen someone starts doing homa \nregularly, there can be instances when the h=\r\noma agni gets \nextinguished while the homa is still on..happened with me co=\r\nuple of \ntimes... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one memb=\r\ner \nin this list had suggested to me,  i relight the fire and keep \ncontinu=\r\ning with the homa.\n&gt; \n&gt;         -Regards\n&gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n      \n&gt;         The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt;         --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n           From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt;           Subject: Re: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com\n&gt;           Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@...&gt;\n&gt;        =\r\n   Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;           Namaste Phan=\r\ni,\n&gt; \n&gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n=\r\nfloors) ? Can a homam\n&gt;           &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, wi=\r\nth sand base be \nused instead of a\n&gt;           &gt; copper one?\n&gt; \n&gt;          =\r\n Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is \nactually better =\r\nthan doing it in closed space. But realize that a \nrain can cause problems.=\r\n Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire \nif it rains while you are doi=\r\nng homam. It is not good if fire is \nextinguished by rain in the middle of =\r\na homam.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks an=\r\nd sand \nat the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &gt; 2)W=\r\nhile performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \nshould one repeat the\n=\r\n&gt;           &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; \n&gt;           One can=\r\n repeat mentally while listening attentively (not \ncasually). Actually, eve=\r\nn listening to mantras with all the attention \nfocused is as powerful as sa=\r\nying mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thin=\r\nking of \nsome mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to =\r\nit \nwith focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra \nm=\r\nay do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the \nmantra. T=\r\nhe word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can \nsay a mantra o=\r\nr listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \ncontrol over the mind an=\r\nd keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt;           However, there is =\r\na difference between meditation and \nhomam. Mantra is submitted in the inte=\r\nrnal fire in meditation and it \nis submitted in the external fire as well i=\r\nn a homam. So making some \nexternal sound (even if feeble) is a good idea a=\r\ns opposed to silent \nchanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n           &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \nconditions/=\r\nniyamas that\n&gt;           &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain =\r\nfood?\n&gt; \n&gt;           Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony)=\r\n \nhas been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n       One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \nguru. Whatever=\r\n rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \nstrictly. At the minimum, o=\r\nne should eat only vegetarian food on the \nday of homam and take a bath bef=\r\nore homam. Another rule I will \nrecommend is to avoid eating any solid food=\r\n 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; \n&gt;           By the way, if one without a sacred t=\r\nhread wants to do \nhomam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take respo=\r\nnsibility and \nallow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my gur=\r\nu as guru \nand perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in=\r\n the \nprocess until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity \nt=\r\nhrough homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no \nsacred thr=\r\nead, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter \nafter a while, wh=\r\nen the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The \ngoal of upanayanam and o=\r\nther mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up \nand make the person cross th=\r\ne threshhold of purity.\n&gt; \n&gt;           As long as one desires no specific m=\r\naterial benefits (and \nready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam =\r\nfor spiritual \nprogress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffer=\r\ning for \nme.\n&gt; \n&gt;           &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any da=\r\ny would be \nfine?\n&gt; \n&gt;           For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Cha=\r\nturthi morning. \nBut any day is fine really.\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n      Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \ntrip.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n           When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \ntraveled=\r\n together to several places (on a specific project). We ended \nup doing hom=\r\nam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). \nBefore the trip, m=\r\ny guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As \nmonsoons come only in June=\r\n/July in India, I did not take it \nseriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-M=\r\nay.. We proceeded to the \nrooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to d=\r\no a homam. Manish \ntold me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this=\r\n city after \nour homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt;           To my surpr=\r\nise, it did rain as soon as our homas \nfinished. After we offered poornaahu=\r\nti, it suddenly started raining \nwith really big drops. Luckily, there was =\r\na small towel/blanket on \nthe rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on =\r\ntop of the two small \nhoma kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held t=\r\nhe cloth cover \non the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went o=\r\nff and \nthen packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later=\r\n \nthat day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days \nin=\r\n New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered \nthe north=\r\n, east and west of India. It rained in every place we went \nto, as we finis=\r\nhed our task in that place and prepared to move on.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt;           Narasimha\n&gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -----\n---- -\n&gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst \nrologer.org/ homam\n&gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst \nrologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;           Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \nwisdom\n&gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro. \nhome..comcast. net\n&gt;           Free Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \nrologer.org\n&gt;           Sri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \nnath..org\n&gt;           ------------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n---- -\n&gt; \n&gt;           ---- P=\r\nhanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt;           &gt; Namasthe,=\r\n\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam =\r\ndaily, and \nhave few questions\n&gt;           &gt; regarding it.\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\nfloors)=\r\n ?
