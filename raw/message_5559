He later served the Asrama=\r\nm\nas a Member of the Board of Trustees.\n\nThe following article written by h=\r\nim entitled, =E2=80=98Bhagavan the Way=E2=80=99 appeared\nin the April, 1977=\r\n issue of The Mountain Path.\n\nIt was only in 1940 that I came to Arunachala=\r\n. Actually I ran away from my\nhouse just eight days before my marriage was =\r\nto take place.\n\nAs there were enough sadhus to serve the Maharshi and I did=\r\n not want to be\nrejected,I refrained from approaching the Sarvadhikari, Nir=\r\nanjanananda\nSwami.I went to Palakothu where I befriended Somasundara Swami.=\r\n I\nvolunteered to sit and watch the dry fruits, nuts and other things expos=\r\ned\nto sunlight. I did it with a plan. I knew Bhagavan was coming to Palakot=\r\nhu\nevery afternoon. I spread the fruits very near where Bhagavan was passin=\r\ng\nby. I was thrilled to see Him notice my sitting there.\n\nThanks to my utte=\r\nr dedication to this task, I was introduced to the\nSarvadhikari, with the u=\r\nseful recommendatory words that I was a sincere man\ndevoid of family ties a=\r\nnd perfectly dedicated to whatever work might be\nentrusted to me. This was =\r\nput to test by him by assigning to me varied types\nof work, which included =\r\nsupervising the construction of the present hospital\nbuilding, purchase of =\r\nbulls and cows, rice, dal, fire wood, etc. Whatever\nthe job, I used to repo=\r\nrt everything to Bhagavan before undertaking it and\nafter completing it.\n\nB=\r\nhagavan particularly bestowed his special grace on those who undertook\nserv=\r\nice of the Asramam. Not only on me, but on Ramaswami Pillai, who was\nthen g=\r\noing on cycle to town many times daily on Asramam work. Bhagavan used\nto te=\r\nll him what had taken place during his absence.\n\nPleased with my work, the =\r\nSarvadhikari posted me in the Hall to attend on\nBhagavan. It so happened th=\r\nat the chief attendant, so to say, Madhava\nSwami,had then left the Asramam.=\r\n This responsible duty, for which I had been\nlonging all the time, devolved=\r\n on me by His grace.\n\nEverything I did was done with care and dedication. F=\r\nor instance, I used to\ndevote considerable time to wash the only two pieces=\r\n of cloth Bhagavan had\n(loin cloth and a small towel),rinsing them many tim=\r\nes in water, changing\nthe water every time. I wanted the clothes to be spot=\r\nlessly clean.\n\nMassaging His feet was another duty I welcomed. How fortunat=\r\ne I was! I did\nsee, touch, talk and live with Him.\n\nOnce I was sleeping in =\r\nfront of His Hall on bare ground. Bhagavan noticed it\nand asked me that nig=\r\nht: =E2=80=9CWhy do you sleep on the floor?=E2=80=9D His sympathetic\nwords =\r\nwere elixir to me. True, I had not thought of clothes or comforts. Yet,\nthe=\r\n very next morning,Krishnaswami, another attendant, of his own accord\nbough=\r\nt for me a long yellow bed sheet, though he had not heard of Bhagavan=E2=80=\r\n=99s\nenquiry the previous night.\n\nThough I had been rendering personal serv=\r\nice to Bhagavan I often felt I had\nnot done enough. So I used to take a bro=\r\nom and sweep the whole path up the\nHill, where Bhagavan walked twice daily.=\r\n\n\nTo illustrate Bhagavan=E2=80=99s sense of humour, I relate one incident: =\r\nOnce there\nwas a snake below my pillow; and as usual I went and reported it=\r\n to Bhagavan\nimmediately. Bhagavan laughingly remarked: =E2=80=9COh, it is =\r\nquite all right. What\nelse can make a better bed for you?=E2=80=9D (Vaikunt=\r\navasar is one of the Names of\nLord Vishnu, whose bed is the\nhuge snake, Adi=\r\nsesha).\n\nSource:\nhttp://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/pdf/Saranagathi_eNewslett=\r\ner_August_2010.pdf\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =\r\n=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00163631041597ca530498c6f3f3\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Vaikuntavasar was an old attendant of Bhagavan.
