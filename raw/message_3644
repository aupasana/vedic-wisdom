He says (an=\r\nd Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (Bindin=\r\ng to one) when one self-identifies with it.\nAlthough, it may seem easy to u=\r\nnderstand intellectually, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve.=\r\n Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement to answer our queries.=\r\n\n\nImportant information about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterd=\r\nay is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a single day passed i=\r\nn his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departu=\r\nre from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occ=\r\nasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because as you pointed out (an=\r\nd I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts cro=\r\nssing our minds. Further, please also note an important thing. The Aghori u=\r\nsed to say very frequently to all his audience to do what he says and not t=\r\nry to do what he does.\n\nNow whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answ=\r\ner the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, th=\r\nese are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothi=\r\nng). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sain=\r\nbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget tha=\r\nt they are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual rea=\r\nlization. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe. The=\r\nir individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In sh=\r\nort they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant =\r\nto our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke ciga=\r\nr or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing=\r\n. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every action of =\r\ntheirs because as I said, they know complete background behind their each a=\r\nction and\n moreover their self identification is missing from the action an=\r\nd hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special pur=\r\npose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.\nRamakrishna used to fr=\r\nequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from others.=\r\n He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume anyth=\r\ning and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anythi=\r\nng without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food inta=\r\nke is extremely important.\nIf Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west,=\r\n it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is not possible for majority o=\r\nf us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. He might be =\r\nremoving `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can=\r\n be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their =\r\nhabits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also possibl=\r\ne at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with th=\r\ne `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have shower=\r\ned his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s po=\r\nssible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inco=\r\nnsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Natu=\r\nre know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA =\r\nwhile he was still in India and did not even planned to go to USA. When the=\r\n boy, after some\n years actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami=\r\n immediately told him to stay away from water and when he requested swami t=\r\no accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that =\r\nhe is not his guru and his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cu=\r\np as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and aft=\r\ner 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which =\r\nliterally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n\nSwami V=\r\nivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.\n\nSo moral of my whole wr=\r\nitings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the =\r\nunconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, G=\r\najanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify=\r\n our completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n\n=\r\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth=\r\n &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Great coinci=\r\ndence of thoughts!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on No=\r\nn-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eating is=\r\n not advisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on=\r\n Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he =\r\nsurvived many days on just eating meat when he was living in USA also relis=\r\nhed it.

Human beings cry a lot a=\r\nt funerals of their own kind but they have absolutely no thought for the su=\r\nfferings of the animals they slaughter. They never hesitate to kill and eat=\r\n. Just think, first they kill the chicken. Often they will cut its throat a=\r\nnd let it bleed to death, which is a most painful way to die. Then it will =\r\nbe cleaned, cooked and eaten, and if it happens to be tough everyone will c=\r\nurse it for not satisfying their palates. How many humans would give beauti=\r\nful tender lean meat if they were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and served=\r\n?\n&gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget that animal mothers too love their chil=\r\ndren. Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes through when her chicks ar=\r\ne slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of motherliness, do =\r\nthey consider how much she suffers when she sees the slaughter of her belov=\r\ned calf whom she has grown in her own body and nourished with her milk, who=\r\nm she loves more than her own life?\n&gt; Do these so called humans ever think =\r\nof the terrible pain they cause to mother cow? Could they endure their own =\r\nchildren being murdered before their own eyes?\n&gt; How is Ma to teach such do=\r\nnkeys? They are not humans, whose intellect is subtle enough to self-identi=\r\nfy with another being of a different species and experience its personal jo=\r\nys and sorrows. Ma has no alternative but to make them suffer, allowing the=\r\n animals they have tortured to torture them in return. Fair&#39;s fair, after a=\r\nll. If I cut your throat in this birth you have every right to cut mine in =\r\nthe next or some succeeding birth.

That is why you find =\r\na meat-eater reborn either as a predator or prey or as both in succession. =\r\nHuman beings cry a lot at funerals of their own kind but they have absolute=\r\nly no thought for the sufferings of the animals they slaughter. They never =\r\nhesitate to kill and\n eat. Just think, first they kill the chicken. Often t=\r\nhey will cut its throat and let it bleed to death, which is a most painful =\r\nway to die. Then it will be cleaned, cooked and eaten, and if it happens to=\r\n be tough everyone will curse it for not satisfying their palates. How many=\r\n humans would give beautiful tender lean meat if they were slaughtered, dre=\r\nssed, prepared and served?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget that ani=\r\nmal mothers too love their children. Do they ever think of the agony a hen =\r\ngoes through when her chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the =\r\nembodiment of motherliness, do they consider how much she suffers when she =\r\nsees the slaughter of her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own body a=\r\nnd nourished with her milk, whom she loves more than her own life?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nDo these so called humans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to mot=\r\nher cow? Could they endure their own children being murdered before their o=\r\nwn\n eyes?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; How is Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not humans, who=\r\nse intellect is subtle enough to self-identify with another being of a diff=\r\nerent species and experience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alter=\r\nnative but to make them suffer, allowing the animals they have tortured to =\r\ntorture them in return. Fair&#39;s fair, after all. If I cut your throat in thi=\r\ns birth you have every right to cut mine in the next or some succeeding bir=\r\nth. Experience is the best teacher and a fool will learn from no other.&quot;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-679359055-1265379348=:62998--\r\n\n"}}
