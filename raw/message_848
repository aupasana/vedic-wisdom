But =\r\ni need your step by step guidance \nas \n&gt; everything is  not included in you=\r\nr notes( although its best notes \n&gt; on homam). Its my weakness actually.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;                In normal homams by priests in India ,they do swaha \n&gt;=\r\n with ghee in fire aswell in water.So tell me, I mean after they \npour \n&gt; g=\r\nhee through spoon in agni ,they immediately pour one drop of ghee \n&gt; in wat=\r\ner too. So is it correct way or not ?\n&gt; \n&gt;                \n&gt;               =\r\n If single person is doing a homam then how to \nmanage \n&gt; ahutis of ghee an=\r\nd samagri both and of course mantra mala or notes \nu \n&gt; provided ? Bcz in I=\r\nndia, normally full group or family do homams \nand \n&gt; priest only says mant=\r\nras.So i think two people r must for homam.\n&gt; \n&gt;                I have spoo=\r\nn made of wood ,Is it ok or i have to \nbuy \n&gt; of copper metal ?\n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n          I am still unmarried so can i do with my mother \nthis \n&gt; chandi h=\r\nomam ?\n&gt; \n&gt;              \n&gt;        Please provide me some beautiful answers=\r\n of these \nqueries.And \n&gt; dont mind if my queries prove to be very simple a=\r\nnd illogical.But \ni \n&gt; have to start from basics .So just cooperate with me=\r\n as i love the \n&gt; work with perfection.In next mail i will ask some queries=\r\n on \nmantras \n&gt; in order to understand properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; U r really spreading =\r\nvedic wisdom in true practical sense. I \nsalute \n&gt; to u.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks and fu=\r\nll respect to u Sir,\n&gt; dheeraj khosla,\n&gt; Delhi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
