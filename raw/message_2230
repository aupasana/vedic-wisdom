wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Dear Friends,\n&gt; At the time of Poorna Ahuti,  a  full coconut(poor=\r\nna phalam)  is required to be offered by chanting  the  Vedic Mantra&quot; Poorn=\r\namadah  Poornamidam  Poornaat  Poornamudatchyate   Poornasya   Poornamaadaa=\r\nya  Poornamevaasishyate&quot;.  Simply because half coconut burns faster than fu=\r\nll coconut, in my humble opinion we can not substtute a full coconut with a=\r\n broken half of coconut in Poorna Ahuti. Already our purohits are using cam=\r\nphor for lighting Agni.  This is not the prescribed method of generating fi=\r\nre for Homam( Havan).Some of them are also blowing fire with  a gush of win=\r\nd from their mouth for  the purpose of creating flame  instead of  using ha=\r\nnd fan or  by blowing through a cylindrcal pipe or blowing through Dharba g=\r\nrass. My appeal to learned people is let us not devite from the procedures =\r\nand dos and donts handed over to us by Rishis.\n&gt; G.Balasubramanian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@.=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 5, 2009 3:=\r\n43:12 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Purnaahuti of Coconut Half - a quick sug=\r\ngetion !\n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; wish you all a happy Raksha Bandh=\r\nan - Naliyeri (Coconut) Purnima ! and also the Eclipse which round the orne=\r\nr.\n&gt; \n&gt; quickly wish to point out that if a Coconut half used as Purnaahuti=\r\n (Final offering symbolic of ego) is placed like a CAP (white portion remai=\r\nns inside and not visible), it burns *very* brilliantly and the burning is =\r\n*COMPLETE*. i am doing this for a week and observed that not only the purna=\r\nahuti ofering, it helps in complete burning of everything in the Havan Kund=\r\na.\n&gt; \n&gt; jst thought of sharing with you all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
