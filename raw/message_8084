However I was disappoint becaus=\r\ne their procedure was so big that it would take about 3 hours for the homam=\r\n, and many more materials also. Of course, they learnt it from &#39;guru-kulam&#39;=\r\n and it was their own tradition. They are not a modern researcher like you =\r\n[Narasimha Ji] who could compare many traditions, research on them, and eve=\r\nn come up with a shorter version. They had no idea that a shorter version i=\r\ns possible, or something can be left out. As an example, they suggested a m=\r\nantadory japam of 10x times before I do an &#39;x&#39; times offering in homam, and=\r\n many more formalities.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I knew in Bangladesh I would never have so=\r\n much materials needed, and I would not be able to perform a 3 hour homam r=\r\negularly, so it was of no use. \n&gt; \n&gt; Much later when I was reading your man=\r\nual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nnyway Ji...\n&gt; \n&gt; Everything was almost as per recommendation, except I used=\r\n a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I couldn&#39;t manage a wooden spoon e=\r\nven after a lot of effort. May be I have to order it... but I will have to =\r\nwork much hard to find a craft-man who can make a spoon with wood.\n&gt; \n&gt; I b=\r\nurnt the fire with mango-wood and jute-sticks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Purnahuti with ghee onl=\r\ny.\n&gt; \n&gt; That WAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an idea h=\r\now fast the woods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I kne=\r\nw that with a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire will not survive =\r\nlong to allow me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning out f=\r\nast.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I could not meditate.\n&gt; \n&gt; My first Q. - 1) Would you have any=\r\n suggestion how can I make the fire last long so that it burns for at least=\r\n 10 mins allowing me mediate? I noted even if I had put much wood, they wou=\r\nld still burn out fast...\n&gt; \n&gt; Offering full / half coconut seems to be the=\r\n only thing that would keep the fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me medita=\r\nte.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and drying them for l=\r\nast 3-4 days, I can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can use=\r\n them as suggested in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a =\r\n&quot;FULL&quot; coconut so much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am=\r\n drying sliced coconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few=\r\n days, will not it be rotten or something? Any procedure? I am asking this =\r\nbecause here no one has any idea about that, because no one even thinks of =\r\nhaving &quot;burnable&quot; full coconuts. That is why.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mantras work very strong=\r\n for me. But I feel not strong enough for big spiritual or material effects=\r\n. I have had very strong experiences with homam before while performing wit=\r\nh others. Even a few times I *arranged* homams for others and I always dire=\r\nctly felt a strong effect working on me also.\n&gt; \n&gt; Today with the homam, th=\r\ne effect was not that strong. I know why, because it was a super-short homa=\r\nm, with many mantras left. Also, I should honestly admit that when I imagin=\r\ned Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva in the fire, the imagination was not 10=\r\n0% strong. Because, I was worried and nervous about making mistake, so I co=\r\nuld not 100% focus on their presence. Which I should. I guess it will impro=\r\nve with time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am going to add mantras from the main homam soon, comm=\r\non mantras which are needed in all homams like Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni=\r\n Deva prayer etc. Also I guess Avahana-related Sanskrit mantras are very im=\r\nportant.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way I did 108 offerings with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra a=\r\nnd then 21 offerings with the smallest Shani mantra again.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am thankf=\r\nul to the ultimate divinity that at least I didn&#39;t have any negative experi=\r\nence after the homam. I was pretty nervous about the possibility. Because l=\r\nong back in 2002-2003 when I started mantras, almost everyday I faced negat=\r\nive energies for the imperfection of pronunciation and procedures. Sometime=\r\ns the negatives were so strong. But I didn&#39;t give up and tried to understan=\r\nd the correct ways because since I saw the power in it, I had to find what&#39;=\r\ns the right way to get the pure blessings, avoiding mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an ex=\r\nample, you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to stay in an empty stomach while doin=\r\ng homam. I find this 100% true from my mantra japam experience. Though no w=\r\nebsite or almost no one instructed me to stay empty stomached in japam, I f=\r\nound that mantras work very strong with empty stomach. Also, I always got s=\r\ntrong negative effects when I did japam after my dinner. Thus, I learned th=\r\nis from my own experience but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong =\r\npractices I did]! Now days, I can&#39;t eat anything after my lunch... because =\r\nI do mantras in the evening. At times it becomes very difficult not to eat =\r\nsomething as I sometimes hang out with friends etc. at afternoon or early e=\r\nvening. But I have no choice.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is the thing I appreciate about you=\r\n [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very important] things always mentio=\r\nned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Same thing about your instruction of minimum movement of the body=\r\n, I find it very correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway Ji I guess I am stretching my mail ve=\r\nry long...\n&gt; \n&gt; my 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani as an exp=\r\nression of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer other Gods&#39; m=\r\nantras in fire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way, or at least a homa=\r\nm for 6-7 grahas?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order such as=\r\n Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Is there any exceptional instructi=\r\non while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?\n&gt; \n&gt; Wanted=\r\n to mention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and other d=\r\neities but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these additio=\r\nnal questions about graha-homams.\n&gt; \n&gt; Appreciate your time to answer me.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Thanking you again,\n&gt; Tanvir\n&gt;\n\n\n \r\n--565295806-864570397-1332901092=:53647\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste Biswa ji,&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;All I meant was it is hard =\r\nto perform hindu rituals in muslim dominated countries and &lt;/span&gt;how god m=\r\nakes/helps his devotees do homams even in muslim land&lt;span&gt;, that&#39;s all, th=\r\nere&#39;s no talk of discrimination here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;With due respect may I request you to not draw harsh con=\r\nclusions without clarification.

The shell came out easily and the who=\r\nle coconut stayed intact. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I think once the sh=\r\nell comes out put the whole coconut in oven again, that way the water will =\r\ndry out and you will get a dry coconut.=C3=82&nbsp; You can shake the cocon=\r\nut to see if there is water inside or not and accordingly experiment. &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hope this works...good luck with your homams. Its =\r\namazing how god makes his devotees do homams even in muslim land. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Priya&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n  From: king_tanvir &lt;lord_rex@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; y=\r\nmailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 25, 2012 6:05 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] First homam experience&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Namaste Narasimha Ji and other members&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have perform=\r\ned a super-short Shani Homam this evening. I thank you for guiding me so de=\r\ntailed... without your manual it would never be possible.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Interesting point to note, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed=\r\n with a Brahmin family for about 10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit w=\r\nas to learn doing homam! However I was disappoint because their procedure w=\r\nas so big that it would take about 3 hours for the homam, and many more mat=\r\nerials also. Of course, they learnt it from &#39;guru-kulam&#39; and it was their o=\r\nwn tradition. They are not a modern researcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who =\r\ncould compare many traditions, research on them, and even come up with a sh=\r\norter version. They had no idea that a shorter version is possible, or some=\r\nthing can be left out. As an example, they suggested a mantadory japam of 1=\r\n0x times before I do an &#39;x&#39; times offering in homam, and many more formalit=\r\nies.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So, I knew in Bangladesh I would never have so much=\r\n materials needed, and I would not be able to perform a 3 hour homam regula=\r\nrly, so it was of no use. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Much later when I was reading=\r\n your manual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :=\r\n-)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Anyway Ji...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Everything was almost=\r\n as per recommendation, except I used a melamine spoon to offer ghee, becau=\r\nse I couldn&#39;t manage a wooden spoon even after a lot of effort. May be I ha=\r\nve to order it... but I will have to work much hard to find a craft-man who=\r\n can make a spoon with wood.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I burnt the fire with mango=\r\n-wood and jute-sticks.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Purnahuti with ghee only.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; That WAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an id=\r\nea how fast the woods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I=\r\n knew that with a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire will not surv=\r\nive long to allow me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning o=\r\nut fast.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So I could not meditate.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; My =\r\nfirst Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can I make the fire last lo=\r\nng so that it burns for at least 10 mins allowing me mediate? I noted even =\r\nif I had put much wood, they would still burn out fast...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Offering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing that would keep t=\r\nhe fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Anothe=\r\nr Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I=\r\n can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can use them as sugges=\r\nted in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut =\r\nso much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced =\r\ncoconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not=\r\n it be rotten or something? Any procedure? I am asking this because here no=\r\n one has any idea about that, because no one even thinks of having &quot;burnabl=\r\ne&quot; full coconuts. That is why.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Mantras work very strong =\r\nfor me. But I feel not strong enough for big spiritual or material effects.=\r\n I have had very strong experiences with homam before while performing with=\r\n others. Even a few times I *arranged* homams for others and I always direc=\r\ntly felt a strong effect working on me also.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Today with =\r\nthe homam, the effect was not that strong. I know why, because it was a sup=\r\ner-short homam, with many mantras left. Also, I should honestly admit that =\r\nwhen I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva in the fire, the imaginati=\r\non was not 100% strong. Because, I was worried and nervous about making mis=\r\ntake, so I could not 100% focus on their presence. Which I should. I guess =\r\nit will improve with time.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am going to add mantras fro=\r\nm the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed in all homams like A=\r\nnugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I guess Avahana-related S=\r\nanskrit mantras are very important.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; By the way I did 108=\r\n offerings with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with the smal=\r\nlest Shani mantra again.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am thankful to the ultimate d=\r\nivinity that at least I didn&#39;t have any negative experience after the homam=\r\n. I was pretty nervous about the possibility. Because long back in 2002-200=\r\n3 when I started mantras, almost everyday I faced negative energies for the=\r\n imperfection of pronunciation and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were=\r\n so strong. But I didn&#39;t give up and tried to understand the correct ways b=\r\necause since I saw the power in it, I had to find what&#39;s the right way to g=\r\net the pure blessings, avoiding mistakes.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As an example,=\r\n you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to stay in an empty stomach while doing homa=\r\nm. I find this 100% true from my mantra japam experience. Though no website=\r\n or almost no one instructed me to stay empty stomached in japam, I found t=\r\nhat mantras work very strong with empty stomach. Also, I always got strong =\r\nnegative effects when I did japam after my dinner. Thus, I learned this fro=\r\nm my own experience but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong practi=\r\nces I did]! Now days, I can&#39;t eat anything after my lunch... because I do m=\r\nantras in the evening. At times it becomes very difficult not to eat someth=\r\ning as I sometimes hang out with friends etc. at afternoon or early evening=\r\n. But I have no choice.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; That is the thing I appreciate a=\r\nbout you [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very important] things alway=\r\ns mentioned.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Same thing about your instruction of minimu=\r\nm movement of the body, I find it very correct.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Anyway J=\r\ni I guess I am stretching my mail very long...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; my 3rd Q.=\r\n - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani as an expression of the ultimate c=\r\nosmic power or divinity, I can offer other Gods&#39; mantras in fire too. Can I=\r\n do a Navagraha homam this way, or at least a homam for 6-7 grahas?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order such as Surya, Cha=\r\nndra, Kuja and so on?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 5) Is there any exceptional instru=\r\nction while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Wanted to mention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha La=\r\nkshmi and other deities but manuals for those deities are already there, he=\r\nnce these additional questions about graha-homams.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Appre=\r\nciate your time to answer me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thanking you again,&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Tanvir&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--565295806-864570397-1332901092=:53647--\r\n\n"}}
