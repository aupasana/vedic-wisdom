Maharaj, you spoke to us of the\nprac=\r\ntice of  Puja  (worship),meditation,  continence and study of the\nScripture=\r\ns.\n                                          What does Puja mean?\n\nTHE SWAM=\r\nI                Puja means both external and mental worship. In\nexternal w=\r\norship certain accessories  such as  flowers,incense\n                      =\r\n                    and water are necessary.  It is\ndifficult to get these =\r\nthings always. So mental worship is more\nconvenient for you.\n              =\r\n                            After worshipping the Ishtam \n(Chosen Ideal) me=\r\nntally with Padya(water for washing the feet) , flowers\nand incense        =\r\n                                       which are\noffered in external worshi=\r\np, practise  meditation  and  mental Japam. In\npurely mental  Japam the\nMan=\r\ntram  (name of  the Deity)  is to be repeated without moving the\nlips.    B=\r\nut in ordinary Japam one has to utter the\n                                 =\r\n         Mantram and there is therefore\nmovement of the  lips.\n            =\r\n                              In meditation you should think\nof the form of=\r\n  your Ishtam as effulgent. Imagine that everything is \nshining through    =\r\n                                      its  lustre.\nThink of this  effulgenc=\r\ne as non-material  and possessed with\nintelligence.  This kind of  meditati=\r\non will\nlater on develop  into meditation on the formless and infinite aspe=\r\nct of\nGod. In the beginning the aspirant has to take\nhelp of  imagination l=\r\nater on, when  he develops his  spiritual  sense,\nhe will  feel  the presen=\r\nce of the Divine. Next\nwhen when he gets the highest spiritual vision,  he =\r\nwill  come face to \nface with Truth.  He is then transported\ninto a differe=\r\nnt realm altogether  of which this  world of matter\nappears to be a mere sh=\r\nadow and, as such, something\n                                          unre=\r\nal. The mind is  then lost \nin Savikalpa Samadhi (superconscious vision wit=\r\nh thought).  Next comes\nNirvikalpa                                         =\r\n\nSamadhi(superconscious  vision without thought). There is  then the\nrealis=\r\nation of that which is beyond thought\n                                     =\r\n     and speech. In this state there\nis nothing to be seen;  nothing to be =\r\nheard. Everything is lost in the\nInfinite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n        -\n      sh=\r\nining through\n\n            as                                      intelli-=\r\n\n  gence                                        wirt&#92;,\n\n\n  gence.\n\n        =\r\n                                                                  \n)&gt;\n\n\n  d=\r\nevelop\n\n            of God.                              the               =\r\n has\n  aspect                              beginning              aspirant\n=\r\n\n           when he\n                    help        imagination;\n\n         =\r\n       his\n                                    pre-\n\n  sence  of  the      =\r\n   Divine.
