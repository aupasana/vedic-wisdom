Swami S=\r\nivananda has written \nan  entire book on this subject, &quot;How to get Vairagya=\r\n&quot;!\n\nhttp://www.dlshq.org/download/vairagya.htm\n\nA couple of quotes from the=\r\n book:\n\nWhat vairagya is not: \n\n &quot;Vairagya does not mean abandoning social =\r\nduties and responsibilities of life. \nIt does   not mean detachment from th=\r\ne world. It does not mean a life in the \nsolitary caves of the   Himalayas =\r\nor in the crematorium. It does not mean living \non Nim-leaves, cow&#39;s urine =\r\nand   dung. It does not mean wearing of matted-hair \nand a Kamandal made of=\r\n fence-gourd or   coconut shell in the band. It does not \nmean shaving of h=\r\nead and throwing of clothes. &quot;\n\nWhat vairagya is:\n\n&quot;Vairagya is mental deta=\r\nchment from all connections with the world. That is all. \nA man   may live =\r\nin the world and discharge all the duties of his order and \nstage of life w=\r\nith   perfect detachment. He may be a householder. What if? He \nmay live wi=\r\nth family and   children. But at the same time he may have perfect \nmental =\r\ndetachment. He can do his   spiritual Sadhana. That man who has perfect \nme=\r\nntal detachment while remaining in the world   is a hero indeed. He is much=\r\n \nbetter than a Sadhu living in the Himalayan caves because the   former ha=\r\ns to \nface the innumerable temptations of life every moment.&quot;\n\nI  hope you =\r\nfind the book helpful in your pursuit of vairagya. If you do,  and \nwant a =\r\ndaily dose of Swami Sivananda&#39;s teachings!, I would suggest  you join the \n=\r\nYahoo group\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/sivanandadaily/\n\nThe  files sect=\r\nion of the group has a lot of his teachings in pdf format  (some \nof them o=\r\nut of print and/or not freely available on the internet). The  &quot;Sadhana \nTo=\r\nols&quot; folder has practical instructions that I am sure you will find quite \n=\r\nuseful!\n\nsincerely,\nChandraprakash\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFro=\r\nm: anoop sehgal &lt;anoopsehgal@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSe=\r\nnt: Tue, June 21, 2011 1:36:48 PM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Action, a=\r\ntman and maya (RE: Sannyas by Swami \nSivananda Part 37)\n\n  \nDear respected =\r\nsirs,\n\nReal sanyasa is a condition of the mind.

The atman is ent=\r\nirely opposed to action\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, note one fact. Long after becomi=\r\nng a sannyasin, Swami \n&gt; Sivananda travelled the world, wrote books, gave l=\r\nectures and founded \n&gt; Divine Life Society, among other &quot;actions&quot;! :-)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If he established DLS with the expectation that i=\r\nt becomes a success or \n&gt; 10,000 people join it or some such thing, then it=\r\n would become an \n&gt; ignorant action, i.e. action with attachment. If he did=\r\n the action \n&gt; completely ready for any outcome and without a sense of owne=\r\nrship, and \n&gt; as an instrument of the divine will, then it is neither &quot;worl=\r\ndly&quot; nor \n&gt; binding nor ignorant. The problem is not &quot;actions&quot;, but actions=\r\n with \n&gt; attachment and a sense of ownership, i.e. actions driven by the wi=\r\nll and \n&gt; agenda of a limited ego.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actions should not be spoken ill of=\r\n like this. Detached action is a \n&gt; *sacred duty* of every being. Gods and =\r\nrishis came back again and again \n&gt; to earth to engage in detached action.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If &quot;the atman is entirely opposed to action&quot;,=\r\n then why is atman (Self) \n&gt; even allowing action? Why doesn&#39;t it simply ha=\r\nlt everything? Or, is all \n&gt; the action happening outside of atman? Is ther=\r\ne anything outside of \n&gt; atman at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some buddhist philosophies coin=\r\ned the term anatman (non-Self) to \n&gt; describe transient things. But, in Ved=\r\nic philosophy, there is no \n&gt; anatman. All that is is atman (Self). Ocean i=\r\ns permanent and still, but \n&gt; ripples that arise in it are transient and mo=\r\nving. But ripples are part \n&gt; of ocean only and you do not start labeling r=\r\nipples as &quot;non-ocean&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atman or Purusha or Shiva is the potential ener=\r\ngy of this cosmos, while \n&gt; Maya or Prakriti or Shakti is the kinetic energ=\r\ny of this cosmos. Shiva \n&gt; and Shakti are seen as different entities by som=\r\ne people, but rishis \n&gt; have declared their oneness. Potential energy becom=\r\nes kinetic energy and \n&gt; vice versa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atman is the still ocean and Maya=\r\n is the force (kinetic) that gives rise \n&gt; to moving ripples on the surface=\r\n. A ripple that exerts itself to move in \n&gt; a particular way keeps collidin=\r\ng with the force and keeps moving hither \n&gt; and tither in a chaotic way for=\r\n a very long time. A ripple that does not \n&gt; exert itself and moves smoothl=\r\ny as dictated by the force will eventually \n&gt; grind to a halt and cease to =\r\nexist as a ripple on the surface. It then \n&gt; becomes part of the still ocea=\r\nn. If a ripple exerts itself to become \n&gt; still, it may even take longer to=\r\n become still. What prolongs a ripple \n&gt; is not movement but resisting the =\r\ndirection given by the force and \n&gt; exerting to move in a particular way (o=\r\nr even exerting to become still). \n&gt; A ripple that surrenders to the force =\r\nwill ride the course and die down \n&gt; faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Contemplate the imagery I=\r\n presented above regarding Atman and Maya, \n&gt; ignorant/egoistic action and =\r\ndetached action! It is very apt.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; In not-so-di=\r\nstant past, sannyasins remained in ashrams and isolated \n&gt; themselves from =\r\nsociety and did their sadhana. Swami Vivekananda started \n&gt; a new trend.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; A sannyasin renounces expectation of things from people stuck in \n&gt; tran=\r\nsient material world and does not depend on anyone. But he may still \n&gt; *gi=\r\nve* basic material things to those hapless people stuck in transient \n&gt; mat=\r\nerial world! For example, Swami Vivekananda and his brother monks \n&gt; went t=\r\no places struck by plague, floods, droughts, cyclones etc and \n&gt; served peo=\r\nple. They provided food, medicines etc (instead of lecturing \n&gt; that body i=\r\ns a transient illusion and one should stop worrying about its \n&gt; welfare!) =\r\nand also did construction work. They ignored the welfare of \n&gt; their own bo=\r\ndies, put themselves at risk and overcame maya personally. \n&gt; But they serv=\r\ned those still stuck in maya without looking down upon them \n&gt; or their nee=\r\nds or maya that trapped them! Those who wanted food got \n&gt; food, those who =\r\nwanted medicines got medicines and those who wanted \n&gt; books got books. Ren=\r\nunciation means you do not expect anything from \n&gt; anyone and accept whatev=\r\ner comes to you naturally. It does not \n&gt; necessarily mean rejecting or ign=\r\noring others. Overcoming maya does not \n&gt; require belittling maya or belitt=\r\nling those still stuck in maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; The trend started by Swami Vivekananda=\r\n was continued by Swami Sivananda. \n&gt; For that reason, it is a bit weird to=\r\n see him talking so ill of action! \n&gt; He was obviously trying to inspire a =\r\nspecific group of people for a \n&gt; specific body of work. These words are ne=\r\nither universal nor do they \n&gt; reflect his tremendous wisdom I have seen el=\r\nsewhere!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; All this intellectual discussion may=\r\n be satisfying to some, but the \n&gt; quote from Swami Brahmanananda in the ot=\r\nher mail is very apt: &quot;You have \n&gt; been only hearing of all these spiritual=\r\n things. Now realise them. You \n&gt; have done enough study and reasoning. Now=\r\n do some spiritual practice. \n&gt; First take up that aspect of God which appe=\r\nals to you most. Follow your \n&gt; own path of Sadhana. When you realise God t=\r\nhrough it, you will feel the \n&gt; joy of realising Him also in other aspects =\r\nand through other paths.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; According to Ramakrishna, Swami Brahmananda =\r\nwas a gopala who accompanied \n&gt; Lord Krishna in a previous life. His words =\r\nare simple, pragmatic and \n&gt; powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want this forum to facilitate=\r\n exchange of Vedic knowledge (and I will \n&gt; also be contributing, though in=\r\n spurts). But I want more that this forum \n&gt; should inspire people to do sa=\r\ndhana and find God. In the end, that is \n&gt; what matters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFi=\r\nlms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =\r\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;       =\r\n                Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Jun 20, 2011 at 2:31 PM, Krishnendu wr=\r\note:\n&gt; \n&gt;      Some may say: =C3=A2From. this it follows that it is not nec=\r\nessary for \n&gt; a knower even to serve his preceptor or to perform tapas.=C3=\r\n=A2 \n&gt; Householders who are afraid of begging for bread and are afraid of \n=\r\n&gt; ridicule argue like this through their sharp intelligence. You cannot \n&gt; =\r\nsay that even begging for bread is a binding rule on a sannyasin. That \n&gt; i=\r\ns not a desire and the sannyasin is virtually a mendicant without rules \n&gt; =\r\nbinding him. He is not liable to any kind of command. Even one who does \n&gt; =\r\nnot know Brahman but who is desirous of emancipation should enter into \n&gt; t=\r\nhe order of a sannyasin. The sruti says: =C3=A2Let one live in the order \n&gt;=\r\n of sannyasa which is a means to the knowledge of Brahman.=C3=A2 \n&gt; Brahmac=\r\nharya may help one to attain knowledge but it is not the case \n&gt; with a hou=\r\nseholder. When a means is not properly followed it can never \n&gt; accomplish =\r\nany object. The heavenly bliss of the karma-kandin is only a \n&gt; form of wor=\r\nldly enjoyment. Heaven is only another world. If one \n&gt; professes to have k=\r\nnowledge he cannot do actions, for actions are \n&gt; worldly. The atman is ent=\r\nirely opposed to action and hence it cannot be \n&gt; an auxiliary to the knowl=\r\nedge of it. The sruti says: =C3=A2When to him \n&gt; everything has become the =\r\nSelf, who should see what and through what \n&gt; should one see?=C3=A2 etc. Th=\r\nis nullifies the meaning of actions in one who \n&gt; has knowledge.\n&gt;\n\n\n \r\n--0-2121644821-1308697751=:38466\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;fon=\r\nt-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nNamaste Anoop,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Interesting\n you ask this question=\r\n about vairagya!

The at=\r\nman is entirely opposed to action&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; First of all, note one=\r\n fact. Long after becoming a sannyasin, Swami &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sivananda travelled=\r\n the world, wrote books, gave lectures and founded &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Divine Life So=\r\nciety, among other &quot;actions&quot;! :-)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If he established DLS with the expectation that it becomes=\r\n a success or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 10,000 people join it or some such thing, then it w=\r\nould become an &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ignorant action, i.e. action with attachment. If h=\r\ne did the action &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; completely ready for any outcome and without a s=\r\nense of ownership, and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as an instrument of the divine will, then =\r\nit is neither &quot;worldly&quot; nor &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; binding nor ignorant. The problem is =\r\nnot &quot;actions&quot;, but actions with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; attachment and a sense of ownersh=\r\nip, i.e. actions driven by the will and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; agenda of a limited ego.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Actions should not be spoken ill of like this. Detached =\r\naction is a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *sacred duty* of every being. Gods and rishis came ba=\r\nck again and again &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to earth to engage in detached action.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If &quot;the atman is entirel=\r\ny opposed to action&quot;, then why is atman (Self) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; even allowing acti=\r\non? Why doesn&#39;t it simply halt everything? Or, is all &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the action =\r\nhappening outside of atman? Is there anything outside of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; atman at=\r\n all?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Some buddhist philosophies coined the term anatman=\r\n (non-Self) to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; describe transient things. But, in Vedic philosoph=\r\ny, there is no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; anatman. All that is is atman (Self). Ocean is per=\r\nmanent and still, but &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ripples that arise in it are transient and =\r\nmoving. But ripples are part &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of ocean only and you do not start l=\r\nabeling ripples as &quot;non-ocean&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Atman or Purusha or Shiv=\r\na is the potential energy of this cosmos, while &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Maya or Prakriti =\r\nor Shakti is the kinetic energy of this cosmos. Shiva &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and Shakti =\r\nare seen as different entities by some people, but rishis &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have de=\r\nclared their oneness. Potential energy becomes kinetic energy and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n vice versa.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Atman is the still ocean and Maya is the fo=\r\nrce (kinetic) that gives rise &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to moving ripples on the surface. A=\r\n ripple that exerts itself to move in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a particular way keeps coll=\r\niding with the force and keeps moving hither &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and tither in a chao=\r\ntic way for a very long time. A ripple that does not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; exert itself=\r\n and moves smoothly as dictated by the force will eventually &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; grin=\r\nd to a halt and cease to exist as a ripple on the surface. It then &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; becomes part of the still ocean. If a ripple exerts itself to become &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; still, it may even take longer to become still. What prolongs a rippl=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is not movement but resisting the direction given by the force =\r\nand &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; exerting to move in a particular way (or even exerting to bec=\r\nome still). &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A ripple that surrenders to the force will ride the c=\r\nourse and die down &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; faster.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Contemplate the ima=\r\ngery I presented above regarding Atman and Maya, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ignorant/egoisti=\r\nc action and detached action! It is very apt.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *=\r\n        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In not-so-distant past, sannyasins remained in=\r\n ashrams and isolated &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; themselves from society and did their sadha=\r\nna. Swami Vivekananda started &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a new trend.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A s=\r\nannyasin renounces expectation of things from people stuck in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tra=\r\nnsient material world and does not depend on anyone. But he may still &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; *give* basic material things to those hapless people stuck in transien=\r\nt &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; material world! For example, Swami Vivekananda and his brother =\r\nmonks &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; went to places struck by plague, floods, droughts, cyclones=\r\n etc and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; served people. They provided food, medicines etc (instea=\r\nd of lecturing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that body is a transient illusion and one should s=\r\ntop worrying about its &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; welfare!) and also did construction work. =\r\nThey ignored the welfare of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; their own bodies, put themselves at r=\r\nisk and overcame maya personally. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But they served those still stu=\r\nck in maya without looking down upon them &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; or their needs or maya =\r\nthat trapped them! Those who wanted food got &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; food, those who want=\r\ned medicines got medicines and those who wanted &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; books got books. =\r\nRenunciation means you do not expect anything from &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; anyone and acc=\r\nept whatever comes to you naturally. It does not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; necessarily mean=\r\n rejecting or ignoring others. Overcoming maya does not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; require b=\r\nelittling maya or belittling those still stuck in maya.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThe trend started by Swami Vivekananda was continued by Swami Sivananda. &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; For that reason, it is a bit weird to see him talking so ill of act=\r\nion! &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He was obviously trying to inspire a specific group of peopl=\r\ne for a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; specific body of work. These words are neither universal =\r\nnor do they &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; reflect his tremendous wisdom I have seen elsewhere!&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; All this intellec=\r\ntual discussion may be satisfying to some, but the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; quote from Swa=\r\nmi Brahmanananda in the other mail is very apt: &quot;You have &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; been on=\r\nly hearing of all these spiritual things. Now realise them. You &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; h=\r\nave done enough study and reasoning. Now do some spiritual practice. &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; First take up that aspect of God which appeals to you most. Follow your=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; own path of Sadhana. When you realise God through it, you will f=\r\neel the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; joy of realising Him also in other aspects and through ot=\r\nher paths.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; According to Ramakrishna, Swami Brahmananda =\r\nwas a gopala who accompanied &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord Krishna in a previous life. His=\r\n words are simple, pragmatic and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; powerful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I w=\r\nant this forum to facilitate exchange of Vedic knowledge (and I will &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; also be contributing, though in spurts).
