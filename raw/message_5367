On the other side the Vegetarians=\r\n can get that from \n&gt; &gt; Yoghurt, Cheese and such foods. And such many point=\r\ns can be discussed from both \n&gt; &gt; the sides.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Few of the Argumen=\r\nts of Vegetarians and vegans is that of &quot;Formation of \n&gt; &gt; Teeth&quot;, &quot;Formati=\r\non of Intestines&quot; etc=E2=80=A6 They say that Human teeth formation and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n digestive systems are not suitable for diet from the source of Animals. Th=\r\ney \n&gt; &gt; site the examples of a Hoarse, cow, Elephant, Goat, buffalo and com=\r\npare that \n&gt; &gt; with Humans. Which I found not proved when I see people arou=\r\nnd me. Majority of \n&gt; &gt; the population today and earlier are meat eaters an=\r\nd there does not seem any \n&gt; &gt; noticeable physical difference which suggest=\r\n any difficulties for them. It is \n&gt; &gt; also noticed that because of High pr=\r\notein contents, they are well built. Same \n&gt; &gt; way Physical strength, stami=\r\nna, recovery from Illness and such were never issues \n&gt; &gt; with generations =\r\nof people in India and else where who never used meat and sea \n&gt; &gt; food in =\r\ntheir diet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So science will not be able to give definitive answer =\r\nfor some one to decide \n&gt; &gt; between 2 strict options, unless science proves=\r\n without a doubt, that a certain \n&gt; &gt; disease or a Physical ailment or a me=\r\nntal abnormality is only because of *eating \n&gt; &gt; meat* or *NOT eating meat*=\r\n and that should also clearly visible in practical \n&gt; &gt; cases which affect =\r\nlarge section of masses. Till that time, so called science, \n&gt; &gt; will mainl=\r\ny be used as a tool to debate on this issue of vegetarianism and \n&gt; &gt; Non-v=\r\negetarianism because we do see that Diabetic ailment, Cardiac patients, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Blood pressure problems and such many commonly seen diseases are found in=\r\n all \n&gt; &gt; sections of society irrespective of meat eaters or vegetarians. B=\r\noth sections \n&gt; &gt; are living their lives for Generations and generations.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding Holistic approach, ethics, Low of Karma etc=E2=80=A6\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 1) One of My very close doctor friend who is a pediatric surgeon (M.Ch=\r\n. in \n&gt; &gt; Pediatrics) and a strict vegetarian who also obviously contains a=\r\n vast knowledge \n&gt; &gt; of medical science gave me a certain interesting fact.=\r\n During his studies, their \n&gt; &gt; batch was once taken to a place called Deon=\r\nar in Mumbai, (where there is one of \n&gt; &gt; the biggest Slaughter houses of I=\r\nndia. Daily around 4000 various animals are \n&gt; &gt; slaughtered to meet the ne=\r\ned of Maharashtra and to some extent India and 60% is \n&gt; &gt; exported mainly =\r\nto Arab countries). 4 or 5 females from their batch could not \n&gt; &gt; stand th=\r\ne process of slaughtering and they fell unconscious. Almost everybody \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nincluding himself was shocked and disgusted to see the slaughterhouse and l=\r\neft \n&gt; &gt; the place with heavy hearts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) There are meat eaters who=\r\n are well advanced in spiritual path and there are \n&gt; &gt; vegetarians who are=\r\n utterly selfish and deep down in materialism hence I refrain \n&gt; &gt; to talk =\r\non that line. Only I wish to say one thing that ethics, spirituality and \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; such terms should not be used selectively as per our own conveniences. S=\r\nomething \n&gt; &gt; which is unethical will remain unethical. To me, Killing anim=\r\nals, while better \n&gt; &gt; alternate sources are available, to satiate hunger a=\r\nnd far worst, to tickle the \n&gt; &gt; palate, is Unethical and simply unethical,=\r\n be it or Earth or on Mars, be it \n&gt; &gt; Kaliyuga or Satyuga.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Sol=\r\nution is not to look if a Famous Saint or Philosopher or any body, famous \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; or otherwise, approves meat eating or disproves it or suggests middle a=\r\npproach, \n&gt; &gt; it does not make any difference. If Vimalananda emphatically =\r\nsuggest not to eat \n&gt; &gt; meat or otherwise (Vimalananda was very clear for m=\r\neat eating though), does not \n&gt; &gt; make any difference. Law of Karma might b=\r\ne infinitely complex and might need \n&gt; &gt; deepest of understanding but that =\r\ndoes not suggest any thing. Who knows if next \n&gt; &gt; birth is there or not? H=\r\nowever what really suggestive and decisively suggestive \n&gt; &gt; should be our =\r\nown Instincts, our own thinking, our own rationale, our own heart. \n&gt; &gt; Why=\r\n depend upon any body coming and telling us about if we should eat meat or =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; should not. Why not follow our own conscious and rationale. I do not k=\r\nnow if I \n&gt; &gt; kill a Goat and eat meat of the same, in the next life or liv=\r\nes, I will be \n&gt; &gt; killed by the same Goat and I have to go through the sam=\r\ne pain. Hardly anybody \n&gt; &gt; knows that but when it comes to the present, I =\r\nknow for sure that the meat I am \n&gt; &gt; eating has been of an animal that has=\r\n been butchered mercilessly. That much is \n&gt; &gt; known without a doubt and th=\r\nat should make me think. If *avoidable*, I must not \n&gt; &gt; eat that. It is th=\r\nat simple. Do not need further approval of anybody and no \n&gt; &gt; amount of ar=\r\nguments from Science or culture or religions or whatever should \n&gt; &gt; stand =\r\nfor me. Do I need to even look at those? NO.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic=\r\n_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Atul Ji and List members,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;I am not advocating Non-veg food. I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;just highlighting the facts=\r\n. I am a strict vegetarian too. We &gt;should \n&gt; &gt; &gt;understand that we may be =\r\nright but we should realize that &gt;it does not \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;necessarily mean other=\r\n person is not right.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My views are there on this subject in ar=\r\nchives. I wanted to stay away but still \n&gt; &gt; &gt;inspired to write at least on=\r\ne message on the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Using Arguments based on science, BV=\r\n, so many of researches and plenty of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;informations available on the I=\r\nnternet, One will never be able to come to a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;definitive conclusions.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) I never argue with people (even when I was aggressive and p=\r\nassionate about \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the Idea of vegetarian food) with the above basis.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Whatever said and done, people will continue eating meat, eggs, Fish, O=\r\nther \n&gt; &gt; &gt;seafood and probably Human flash as well. I have, with experienc=\r\ne, understood \n&gt; &gt; &gt;that there is no point in arguing with people giving va=\r\nrious Data. Each side \n&gt; &gt; &gt;will have their own arguments, own sets of Data=\r\n and own Counter Ideas to prove \n&gt; &gt; &gt;their point.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Instead =\r\nI appeal their conscious! I tell people around me, whenever the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Topic=\r\n comes up, only one simple thing - &quot;I dont want to kill for filling up my \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Stomach&quot; and I say it from my heart. I tell people that Put a knife ed=\r\nge on your \n&gt; &gt; &gt;own Throat or Cut a finger only a little, feel the pain an=\r\nd now realize the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Plight of a butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or=\r\n a buffalo or a...., \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Suffocate yourself by closing Nose & Mouth and s=\r\nee after only a few seconds, how \n&gt; &gt; &gt;you pent for the Air and Now realize=\r\n the &quot;Chhatpataahat&quot; of a fish forced out of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And =\r\nall these, because one wish to fill the stomach or satisfy cravings of a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;habitual palate or both. Even vegetarians have their cravings of spice =\r\nand other \n&gt; &gt; &gt;food stuff but the very vital difference is that such cravi=\r\nng does not need \n&gt; &gt; &gt;killing!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) Just to give a result, One =\r\nof colleagues, who is a Srilankan, has left \n&gt; &gt; &gt;eating meat since 6 Month=\r\ns now and surely, one of the reasons for his leaving \n&gt; &gt; &gt;meat is because =\r\nI told my views him a few times when such discussions came up \n&gt; &gt; &gt;and I e=\r\nven told him that you are a Buddhist, the religion of Non-Injury and see \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;what has happened to that very Idea. Hats-off to him for he really seem=\r\ns to have \n&gt; &gt; &gt;thought about it and dared to change his swabhava which is =\r\nso very difficult.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just to clarify, I do not hesitate to express my v=\r\niews even to Muslims and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;others and at least, this idea is appreciate=\r\nd by them even if grudgingly. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hard core meat eaters are also take=\r\nn a back with this idea. All though they know \n&gt; &gt; &gt;from their hearts of he=\r\narts, it comes as a shock even to them when somebody \n&gt; &gt; &gt;boldly brings th=\r\nat up. Most of us are like a cat that drinks the milk with \n&gt; &gt; &gt;closed eye=\r\ns. The Idea would have gone in their mind and that is enough. One day \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;probably it will germinate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5) Finally, The point is not to s=\r\nay that this side is good and that side is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;bad. It&#39;ll be a foolish an=\r\nd unpalatable conclusion. It is to just appeal the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;inside human of ea=\r\nch individual, It is to appeal the rational Intelligence of an \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Indivi=\r\ndual, It is to appeal the heart of a person and if that is not suffice to \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;our ultra-hardened heart then a final reminder of &quot;Law of Cause and ef=\r\nfect -The \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Law of Karma&quot; at least to those of us who believe in Nature=\r\ns unfailing \n&gt; &gt; &gt;governance. And that is the final Idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best=\r\n Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.

For an athlete, Egg=\r\ns are important part of his training. and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;for a person seeking spirit=\r\nuality one should stick to vegetarian food unless he \n&gt; &gt; &gt;is able to rise =\r\nabove the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ji abo=\r\nut this point.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In some diseases Non veg sources play an ve=\r\nry important role (Although not a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;necessasity) like in Albumin defici=\r\nency two eggs per day can save a person from \n&gt; &gt; &gt;costly (3000Rs per Inj) =\r\nAlbumin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do \n&gt; &gt; &gt;wonders. Ayurved=\r\na also recommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Depen=\r\ndence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI agree with the link provided in this discussions. Books and articles by \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Peta members are far more convincing for switching to Veg sources. I c=\r\nan also \n&gt; &gt; &gt;provide tens of links and book reference which oppose their v=\r\niew. Honestly, I do \n&gt; &gt; &gt;not believe each and every information on net and=\r\n not every book written about \n&gt; &gt; &gt;nutirtion, just like astrology. Let us =\r\nleave this debate aside and look at other \n&gt; &gt; &gt;aspect of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; By &#39;Practically impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply f=\r\nactor. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) a=\r\nbout 45% people \n&gt; &gt; &gt;are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins a=\r\nre supplied by Non veg \n&gt; &gt; &gt;sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof pr=\r\noteins are Legumes (including gram \n&gt; &gt; &gt;soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about =\r\nRs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (include almonds \n&gt; &gt; &gt;cashew etc - Costs needn=\r\n&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Milk being 30-40 Rs per \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Kg), Grains (che=\r\napest sources but not a very complete source), \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In l=\r\nast two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose by \n&gt; &gt; &gt;4=\r\n0-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a complete =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk,=\r\n 50-70 gms \n&gt; &gt; &gt;of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per pe=\r\nrson, along with \n&gt; &gt; &gt;grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum qu=\r\nantities. Different sources \n&gt; &gt; &gt;may quote different quantities). There is=\r\n average family size of 5 and average \n&gt; &gt; &gt;family income is 200 Rs per day=\r\n! And nutrition is not the only thing needed in \n&gt; &gt; &gt;our life!!! Lot of ot=\r\nher expenditures are there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even at current prices, 60% pop=\r\nulation can not afford balanced diet. If \n&gt; &gt; &gt;additional 40% is included i=\r\nn demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% \n&gt; &gt; &gt;and I need not t=\r\no explain what will happen at that time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, I am not adv=\r\nocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;even for mi=\r\nlk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not prod=\r\nuce it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;yourself)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I think and believe that pra=\r\nctically it is impossible to shift all the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;population to veg sources =\r\nespecially when the agriculture land is decreasing day \n&gt; &gt; &gt;by day because=\r\n of many reasons)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Bioavailability or BV of different so=\r\nurces\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is always a questionable point. because again sec=\r\ntions supporting \n&gt; &gt; &gt;vegetarian diet will highlight the results which sup=\r\nport veg food and vice \n&gt; &gt; &gt;versa. There are lot of halfbaked researches. =\r\nbut if we think scientifically we \n&gt; &gt; &gt;will find that for different source=\r\ns different sources are better. For example \n&gt; &gt; &gt;calcium animal sources ar=\r\ne best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Vit C veg sourc=\r\nes are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also \n&gt; &gt; &gt;supp=\r\nort this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the diet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As fa=\r\nr as BV is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so do=\r\nes the deep fried \n&gt; &gt; &gt;vegetarian food, although less but in daily habit i=\r\nt will not let you escape \n&gt; &gt; &gt;from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that =\r\nif more energy is used in digesting \n&gt; &gt; &gt;food, less energy is available fo=\r\nr brain. it is a scietific fact that after \n&gt; &gt; &gt;food, significant blood su=\r\npply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy \n&gt; &gt; &gt;food, tea, coffe=\r\ne, coke and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what we eat! \n&gt; &gt; &gt;This is=\r\n true. So one should eat what one want to become.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But stil=\r\nl at last, I want to mention that I am not advocating Non-veg food. I \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We should \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;understand that we may be right but we should realise that it does not =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;necessarily mean other person is not right.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please p=\r\noint out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree that some \n&gt; &gt; &gt;value=\r\ns i mentioned here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. But they are \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;approximate and not too much off the line.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Regard=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atul\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I disgree wi=\r\nth two points you mentioned. Let me clarify. (I am only dealing \n&gt; &gt; &gt;with =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the science part of these discussions, as I had already ma=\r\nintained right at \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National=\r\n Public Radio) \n&gt; &gt; &gt;several \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; months back. They conducted a=\r\nn experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas \n&gt; &gt; &gt;was \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fe=\r\nd with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets=\r\n. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt;ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; If=C3=82=C2=A0you have any references for this, in terms of whether =\r\nthey published \n&gt; &gt; &gt;any \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paper on the same, I am intereste=\r\nd to know and analyse that in details. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;am \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open to =\r\nlearning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine \n&gt; &gt; &gt;evidenc=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat=\r\n takes up more energy. Gorillas fed \n&gt; &gt; &gt;with \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fr=\r\nuits may have diverted more energy towards the development of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;brain. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to hum=\r\nan beings or \n&gt; &gt; &gt;not,=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; balanced =\r\nvegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;development.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nut=\r\nrition=C3=82=C2=A0is concerned, because \n&gt; &gt; &gt;human \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stomac=\r\nh structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal \n&gt; &gt; &gt;pro=\r\nducts \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products=\r\n. In my other mail, I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;have \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; qoted from a couple of re=\r\nsearch papers and books on clinical nutrition and \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dietetics=\r\n, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C3=82=C2=A0take a few days =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;since I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to get them from people who deal with t=\r\nhese topics professionally, but \n&gt; &gt; &gt;time \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is not a proble=\r\nm.=C3=82=C2=A0All the papers are=C3=82=C2=A0from the most accepted and repu=\r\nted \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientific=C3=82=C2=A0journals.

Which=\r\n is why I said, it is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;myth \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that=C3=82=C2=A0vegeteria=\r\nn=C3=82=C2=A0foods are=C3=82=C2=A0easier to digest, if digestibility is the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;criteria. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further=\r\n, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any \n&gt; &gt; &gt;m=\r\nore \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals =\r\nhave their own vaasanas and their \n&gt; &gt; &gt;needs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If an anima=\r\nl can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An an=\r\nimal has a specific physical=C3=82=C2=A0structure and needs to maintain the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;same. But \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind =\r\nof meals. I have seen people \n&gt; &gt; &gt;feeding \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vegeterian diet=\r\ns to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole \n&gt; &gt; &gt;body \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structure is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food f=\r\nor the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;sake of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; survival, but will become internally =\r\nweak and susceptable to disease and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who takes the ka=\r\nrma for the disease and weakness that may \n&gt; &gt; &gt;result \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fro=\r\nm an unnatural diet to an animal? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but th=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt;chances \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers=\r\n die of cancer, but smoking makes \n&gt; &gt; &gt;one \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; susceptible to=\r\n cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my personal \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; opinion is that an animal if kept at home, it should taken care of in the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;best \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way possible, providing it with whatever maybe=\r\n needed, including the right \n&gt; &gt; &gt;diet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _______________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A question for you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sc=\r\nientists studying evolution and human body structures have concluded that \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;meat \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been p=\r\nrevelant since at least 4 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; million years. That, without a diet wh=\r\nich was omnivorous, the structure of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; human stoma=\r\nch (lack of a developed=C3=82=C2=A0caecum),=C3=82=C2=A0and the threefold in=\r\ncrease \n&gt; &gt; &gt;in=C3=82=C2=A0brain \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; size (from archeological =\r\nevidences)=C3=82=C2=A0could never have been what it is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;today. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has been a=C3=82=C2=A0natural pro=\r\ncess, so ingrained \n&gt; &gt; &gt;that it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has changed the very stru=\r\ncture of the human body. This cannot be done \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciously, but on=\r\nly by the work of natural forces.

A few quick co=\r\nmments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) We are we we eat. Production of various ch=\r\nemicals in our body and their \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interactions, are controlled=\r\n by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;profound \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; im=\r\npact on us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Much has been written on the material =\r\nbenefits from vegetarianism. But \n&gt; &gt; &gt;that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is not all. Th=\r\nere are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eating t=\r\nhe flesh or body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with \n&gt; &gt; &gt;the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical body entails a karma. Self-identification of pla=\r\nnts with their \n&gt; &gt; &gt;physical \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body is much subtler and the=\r\n karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;much \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsmaller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Especially these days, very cruel methods are=\r\n used for meat production by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corporations and animals are treate=\r\nd very cruelly. Part of the karma for \n&gt; &gt; &gt;their \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sufferin=\r\ng goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) I h=\r\neard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) \n&gt; &gt; &gt;sev=\r\neral \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; months back.

The \n&gt; &gt; &gt;ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Their theory was =\r\nthat digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed \n&gt; &gt; &gt;with \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the develo=\r\npment of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;brain. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the sam=\r\ne thing applies to human beings or not, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; balanced v=\r\negetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;development.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or slee=\r\npy and cannot focus \n&gt; &gt; &gt;well \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on work that requires alert=\r\nness and skill. That is because the digestive \n&gt; &gt; &gt;process \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;much \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agni available for other activities such as dig=\r\nestion of intellectual ideas \n&gt; &gt; &gt;that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happens in the min=\r\nd. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences \n&gt; &gt; &gt;also \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requires agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation o=\r\nr homam \n&gt; &gt; &gt;after \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are =\r\nnormally advised to do sadhana before \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, de=\r\nep fried \n&gt; &gt; &gt;food \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy foods that stimul=\r\nate digestive agni etc) are consumed \n&gt; &gt; &gt;more \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frequently=\r\n, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less \n&gt; &gt; &gt;agn=\r\ni \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual id=\r\neas and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;experiences. If \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one eats saattwik food that =\r\nis very easy to digest (simple grains, simple \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lentils and simple=\r\n vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;fruits), \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is availabl=\r\ne for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experien=\r\nces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. B=\r\nut huge stacks of dry \n&gt; &gt; &gt;grass may \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be burnt by just one=\r\n spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be \n&gt; &gt; &gt;enough \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with exc=\r\nellent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of inter=\r\nnal fire may be \n&gt; &gt; &gt;needed \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a person with poor vaasana=\r\ns and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;all \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; de=\r\npends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;digesting \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress.=\r\n Another person may eat \n&gt; &gt; &gt;saattwik \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; food, maximize the =\r\nagni available for spiritual transformation and yet \n&gt; &gt; &gt;struggle \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for on=\r\ne is to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;ignore \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian.=\r\n All other things being equal, that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maximizes the agni available=\r\n for spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s questio=\r\nn: Animals have their own vaasanas and their \n&gt; &gt; &gt;needs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIf an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (8) On=\r\ne should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume \n&gt; &gt; &gt;enoug=\r\nh \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma in the material \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world using physical body and make spi=\r\nritual progress. Eating too much food \n&gt; &gt; &gt;is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not good fo=\r\nr spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of overeating most of the=\r\n time and fasting on specific days, it is \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better to eat lim=\r\nited amount always. Regular practices are more important \n&gt; &gt; &gt;for \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transformation and success, than occasional practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or con=\r\nsidering \n&gt; &gt; &gt;food \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape =\r\nthe karma involved. It depends on how \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply ingrained tha=\r\nt thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one \n&gt; &gt; &gt;internally \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing=\r\n (e.g. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Softw=\r\nare, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; rit=\r\nual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.=\r\norg \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
