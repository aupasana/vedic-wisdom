I wish this brave doctor luck....it is not easy to talk o=\r\nf these subjects before fellow scientists, doctors and lay people due to th=\r\ne scorn and ridicule that is poured upon one. Not to mention doubts about o=\r\nne&#39;s sanity and commitment to science.\n\nThere is no divorce between science=\r\n and religion. As Sivananda said &quot;they are twins&quot;....both seek the truth. \n=\r\n\nThe marvels of the universe unravelled by science, ranging from the incred=\r\nible design of the human body and the beauty in nature, the precision of th=\r\ne laws of nature....with each new scientific discovery, one is filled with =\r\nawe at the sheer intelligence in nature, and for the creator. \n\nI attended =\r\na teaching session on spinal cord injuries at my workplace yesterday. We re=\r\nvised the anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord. Once again, as I alway=\r\ns am when I study the human body, I was wonderstruck by the sheer intellige=\r\nnce of design. Every ligament, every bone....arranged perfectly to protect =\r\nand preserve this delicate vital structure called the spinal cord. The huma=\r\nn body is filled with examples for incredible design, and so is the whole o=\r\nf nature.\n\nIf the creation is so intelligent and beautiful, one cannot help=\r\n but ask....what must the creator be like? Who made all this stuff? And why=\r\n? These questions can only be answered by the creator himself.\n\nAnd here en=\r\nds the realm of the intellect and modern science, and here begins the realm=\r\n of spirituality and religion. The search for the creator.\n\n\nOm Prakrityai =\r\nNamaha.\n\nAparna\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Jyotisa Shisya &lt;ac=\r\nhyutagaddi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; A neurosurgeon&#39;s experience of Heaven while in C=\r\noma...somehow I am reminded\n&gt; about Rajarishi&#39;s statement in the Varanasi a=\r\nnecdotes &quot;If you have to cut\n&gt; your head off to get a Guru, you have got it=\r\n cheap!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/10/07/proof-of-=\r\nheaven-a-doctor-s-experience-with-the-afterlife.html\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
