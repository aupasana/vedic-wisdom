However, you are free to address =\r\nme as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n\nI just came ac=\r\nross Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a tim=\r\nes repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-id=\r\nentifies with it.\nAlthough, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, =\r\nthe state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an ext=\r\nremely important statement to answer our queries.\n\nImportant information ab=\r\nout Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big ti=\r\nme smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t =\r\ndo smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical body. He =\r\nused to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally ate meat. I gave=\r\n this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is=\r\n an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, =\r\nplease also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently=\r\n to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.\n\nNo=\r\nw whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked=\r\n. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unr=\r\nealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example =\r\ncases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such ack=\r\nnowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized so=\r\nuls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower =\r\nof everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfe=\r\nctly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they =\r\nare doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of discussion=\r\n, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or kille=\r\nd animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a =\r\nspecific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, =\r\nthey know complete background behind their each action and\n moreover their =\r\nself identification is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature =\r\noperates through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them =\r\nin any cause-effect chain.\nRamakrishna used to frequently say to all his di=\r\nsciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritua=\r\nl fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A food=\r\n restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritu=\r\nally troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.=\r\n\nIf Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some su=\r\nbtle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to comprehend unless =\r\nexplained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the =\r\nsincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as on=\r\ne of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and =\r\nsuch other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he=\r\n is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he a=\r\nte. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on=\r\n the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no =\r\napparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not=\r\n know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Viveka=\r\nnanda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in Indi=\r\na and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some\n years ac=\r\ntually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to s=\r\ntay away from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his discip=\r\nle, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his=\r\n guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man late=\r\nr became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actual=\r\nly given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what s=\r\nwami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n\nSwami Vivekananda was all knowing=\r\n and most of us are NOT.\n\nSo moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise=\r\n as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits of S=\r\nwami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Sam=\r\narth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self ident=\r\nified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n It is clear from the below passage meat eating is not advisable for anyone=\r\n.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa A=\r\nthma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days on jus=\r\nt eating meat when he was living in USA also relished it.

How many humans would give beautiful tender lean meat if t=\r\nhey were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and served?\n&gt; Meat-eaters convenien=\r\ntly forget that animal mothers too love their children. Do they ever think =\r\nof the agony a hen goes through when her chicks are slain in front of her e=\r\nyes? or a cow, the embodiment of motherliness, do they consider how much sh=\r\ne suffers when she sees the slaughter of her beloved calf whom she has grow=\r\nn in her own body and nourished with her milk, whom she loves more than her=\r\n own life?\n&gt; Do these so called humans ever think of the terrible pain they=\r\n cause to mother cow? Could they endure their own children being murdered b=\r\nefore their own eyes?\n&gt; How is Ma to teach such donkeys?

However, you are free to address me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily=\r\n accept it hence forth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I just came across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on=\r\n Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is onl=\r\ny generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.&lt;BR&gt;Although,=\r\n it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times=\r\n difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement =\r\nto answer our queries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Important information about Vimalananda which=\r\n I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there w=\r\nas not a single day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on =\r\nthe final day of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew=\r\n Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally\n ate meat. I gave this information, b=\r\necause as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coin=\r\ncidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an =\r\nimportant thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience=\r\n to do what he says and not try to do what he does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now whatever I w=\r\nrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put i=\r\nn my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person=\r\n and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami=\r\n Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spir=\r\nitual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achiev=\r\ned very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything =\r\nor many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and compl=\r\netely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. The=\r\ny are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;.\n Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say=\r\n that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, th=\r\ney actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a specific purp=\r\nose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, they know com=\r\nplete background behind their each action and moreover their self identific=\r\nation is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature operates throu=\r\ngh them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them in any cause-e=\r\nffect chain.&lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples tha=\r\nt Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burn=\r\ning within him which can consume anything and everything. A food restrictio=\r\nn does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubl=\r\ned but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.&lt;BR&gt;If Vive=\r\nkananda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle pur=\r\npose which is not\n possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explain=\r\ned by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere=\r\n seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of th=\r\nem and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such ot=\r\nher undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nul=\r\nlifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It =\r\nis also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the an=\r\nimal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparen=\r\nt reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. =\r\nOnly Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda s=\r\naved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and d=\r\nid not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years actually m=\r\net Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away=\r\n from water\n and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swa=\r\nmi, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his guru w=\r\nill come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later becam=\r\ne disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually give=\r\nn a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vi=\r\nvekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Swami Vivekananda was all knowing =\r\nand most of us are NOT.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s u=\r\nnwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits=\r\n of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swam=\r\ni Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self =\r\nidentified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Regards,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/com=\r\npose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@\n yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal Ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82&nbsp;I was about to ask this=\r\n question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82&nbsp; It is clear from the below p=\r\nassage meat eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telug=\r\nu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating meat when he=\r\n was living in USA also relished it.

That is why you find a meat-eater reborn=\r\n either as a predator or prey or as both in succession. Human beings cry a =\r\nlot at funerals of their own kind but they have absolutely no thought for t=\r\nhe sufferings of the animals they slaughter. They never hesitate to kill an=\r\nd eat. Just think, first they kill the chicken. Often they will cut its thr=\r\noat and let it bleed to death, which\n is a most painful way to die. Then it=\r\n will be cleaned, cooked and eaten, and if it happens to be tough everyone =\r\nwill curse it for not satisfying their palates. How many humans would give =\r\nbeautiful tender lean meat if they were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and =\r\nserved?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget that animal mothers too lov=\r\ne their children. Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes through when h=\r\ner chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of mothe=\r\nrliness, do they consider how much she suffers when she sees the slaughter =\r\nof her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own body and nourished with h=\r\ner milk, whom she loves more than her own life?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do these so called =\r\nhumans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to mother cow? Could they=\r\n endure their own children being murdered before their own eyes?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ho=\r\nw is Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not humans, whose intellect is subt=\r\nle enough to self-identify\n with another being of a different species and e=\r\nxperience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternative but to make =\r\nthem suffer, allowing the animals they have tortured to torture them in ret=\r\nurn. Fair&#39;s fair, after all. If I cut your throat in this birth you have ev=\r\nery right to cut mine in the next or some succeeding birth.
