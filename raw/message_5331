Human bo=\r\ndy is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like \n&gt; people do not e=\r\nat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vegetables as well. \n&gt; Cooking=\r\n is a later addition to human society. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you were to clear your m=\r\nind of all preconcieved ideas and look at REAL \n&gt; research in the most unbi=\r\nased way possible, and accessed scientific papers in \n&gt; clinical nutrition =\r\nand dietetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find \n&gt; ample evidenc=\r\ne that humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an \n&gt; omniv=\r\norous diet:-\n&gt; \n&gt; a) Human ancestral diets changed substantially approximat=\r\nely four to five \n&gt; million years ago with major climatic changes creating =\r\nopen grassland \n&gt; environments. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain=\r\n balanced by a smaller, simpler \n&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C2=A0 requiring=\r\n=C2=A0foods based around meat protein and fat. For \n&gt; example since the tim=\r\ne of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million \n&gt; years ago, br=\r\nain size has increased threefold - chemical requirement for \n&gt; long-chain p=\r\nolyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a \n&gt; corresponding =\r\nincrease in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with a \n&gt; diet =\r\nthat is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman terms, our brain \n&gt; w=\r\nould not have reached the size and mass as it is today, had it not been for=\r\n \n&gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; c) The gut mor=\r\nphology of the human body as it stand todays is ideally \n&gt; equidistant from=\r\n that of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because \n&gt; humans are de=\r\nsigned to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum and \n&gt; rumen, u=\r\nnlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve plant \n&gt; cellu=\r\nlose into usable energy, which is why, a=C2=A0major part of the leafy veget=\r\nable \n&gt; based diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the other hand, the s=\r\ntomach lining \n&gt; of humans do not contain=C2=A0 the kind of strong acids wh=\r\nich is present in a typical \n&gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as =\r\nset by Nature through=C2=A0 the natural \n&gt; process of evolution is supposed=\r\n to be omnivorous. It may further interest you \n&gt; to know that the teeth st=\r\nructure of humans is actually identical to, guess what, \n&gt; rats who also ar=\r\ne omnivores.\n&gt; \n&gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved and mistaken ideas th=\r\nat=C2=A0research into \n&gt; clinical nutrition very clearly indicates that abs=\r\norption ability of the human \n&gt; body for=C2=A0w.r.t different foods=C2=A0is=\r\n highest (not vegetables or fruits) for fish, \n&gt; and lowest for red meat an=\r\nd carrots. Infact the later is considered negative \n&gt; calorie food, since i=\r\nt requires the body to waste more calories in absorving it \n&gt; than the amou=\r\nnt it gains from them. But fish is the easiet to digest. You can \n&gt; look up=\r\n actual BV (biological value)=C2=A0charts for more details.\n&gt; \n&gt; All this i=\r\ns science. Real science.

I have not studied biology \n&gt; &gt;or chem=\r\nistry. So from layman&#39;s point of view, i have understood from what others \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;are telling \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;1) meat especially clogs the arteries and sexual=\r\n reproduction in men is \n&gt; &gt;dependent on movement of blood. So not only hea=\r\nrt that is affected in non veg \n&gt; &gt;eaters but also sexual reproduction syst=\r\nem. this is surprising since non veg \n&gt; &gt;foods are supposed to make men mor=\r\ne rajasic and active. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;2) for the last 10 years at least the che=\r\nmicals are being used increasingly to \n&gt; &gt;make the animals more heavier and=\r\n tasty after cooking. accordingly even fish, \n&gt; &gt;prawns, chickens, goats, b=\r\nuffalo are all being fed with food that would make \n&gt; &gt;them grow faster and=\r\n to make their flesh tastier.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;3) people all over the world are ignor=\r\ning such facts to their own peril.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I am a born vegetarian and i do n=\r\not know the facts about non veg foods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can someone explain the facts=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks to everyone,\n&gt; &gt;Rajmohan \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
