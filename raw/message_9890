My family and I had a trip visiting Manila Philippines, everything was going on fine until last night when we got attacked by some unknown gunmen. All our money,phones and credit cards was stolen away including some valuable items, It was a terrible experience but the good thing is they didn&#39;t hurt anyone or made away with our passports.\n\nWe have reported the incident to the local authorities and the consulate but their response was too casual, we were ask to come back in 2weeks time for investigations to be made proper,But the truth is we can&#39;t wait till then as we have just got our return flight booked and is leaving in few hours from now but presently having problems sorting out our bills here and also getting a cab down to the airport, Right now we&#39;re financially strapped due to the unexpected robbery attack, Wondering if you can help us with a quick loan to sort our bills and get back home. All we need is ($1,650.00 USD) or anything you can afford, I promise to refund you in full as soon as I return hopefully tomorrow or next. write back now to let me know what you can do.\n\nThanks,\nMurukambat \n\r\n---1714046436-328874391-1383580163=:23581\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:18pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hello,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am sorry for reaching you rather too late due to the situation of things right now.
