No matter what path or approach you=\r\n take the end result or the truth has to be the same. It cannot be two diff=\r\nerent thing for two different people and in that case it is not the Truth. =\r\nThe path one adopts may be of hindu persuasion or some other religious pers=\r\nuasion the end result has to be the same. Not only the end result one has t=\r\no come to a point where one has an insight or a perception that finishes th=\r\ne ego or self directed activity.=C2=A0\n\nKarma is a natural result of the fr=\r\needom that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning without freed=\r\nom to act. I do mistakes and create imbalance only when I have freedom to a=\r\nct and as such I have pay it back and restore balance in Nature. To have th=\r\ne freedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect sense to =\r\nme.=C2=A0\n\nNow due to karmic overload it may become very hard for large num=\r\nbers of people to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if Nature allows one=\r\n to be free of this attachment without a payback. Now there is a train of t=\r\nhought which says that one can look into the whole nature of this attachmen=\r\nt at one shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one thing after anot=\r\nher look at this whole thing to the root , have a perception and get out of=\r\n it. In a sense our ancestors were intelligent that they devised some way t=\r\no clear this Karma but it seems like for large numbers of people these will=\r\n become crutches rather than help to get out of the karmic cycle and lead a=\r\nn existence where one is free to act. If my previous karma is influencing m=\r\ny action then I am not free.=C2=A0\n\nIs it possible for someone to look into=\r\n this whole process of attachment and have an insight and be free of it rig=\r\nht now....\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Narasimha P.V.R.

These paths get one started in the walk towards the same end p=\r\noint - Self-realization.\n\n=C2=A0\n&gt; To be free is to be awakened.\n=C2=A0\nNot=\r\n exactly. Awakening is just a step towards freedom. Freedom comes in the en=\r\nd after walking a path for enough time after awakening.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakene=\r\nd sadhaka practicing jnana yoga reads books and talks eloquently about how =\r\neverything is god, but looks at different people, objects and experiences w=\r\nith a different attitude. He becomes happy (if not externally, atleast inte=\r\nrnally) when people praise him and becomes upset when people criticize him,=\r\n and so on. An awakened sadhaka practicing jnana yoga starts to honestly co=\r\nntemplate one&#39;s actions, words, thoughts (and even instincts finally) and s=\r\nlowly weeds out conditioning that makes one look at different transient thi=\r\nngs differently. As his equanimity increases, still there will be episodes =\r\nof getting carried away. As he employs contemplation and self-correction mo=\r\nre and more, such episodes will become less and less frequent and one will =\r\nbecome liberated in the end.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakened sadhaka practicing karma =\r\nyoga passionately engages in dharmik actions for the benefit of others. He =\r\ngets elated and feels proud when good results come and becomes upset when b=\r\nad results come. An awakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga starts to have d=\r\netachment to results. When something happens which makes him elated, proud,=\r\n ashamed or upset, he will not think much about it, take it as god&#39;s prasad=\r\n and think about what is the right action for him right now. As his detachm=\r\nent increases, still there will be episodes of getting carried away. As one=\r\n becomes more and more detached (to results of actions), such episodes will=\r\n become less and less frequent and one will become liberated in the end.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga goes through yama, niyama=\r\n, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana etc. His psychic life force may even arise an=\r\nd ascend. He may have various experiences and may feel proud or become atta=\r\nched to them. An awakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga will not not lose se=\r\nlf-control in the face of anything and will keep the focus on samadhi. He w=\r\nill not be distracted by anything that comes on the way and keep perfecting=\r\n concentration and self-control so that samadhi (deep concentration on the =\r\nunconditioned Self) comes. In the beginning, one may be in samadhi state no=\r\nw and then. As practice is perfected, one can be in it all the time and bec=\r\nome liberated.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga is devote=\r\nd to god and worships him/her as much as one can, but will project his ego,=\r\n conditioning and desires onto his worship and hence onto the god he worshi=\r\nps. For example, he may think &quot;I worship the highest god while that person =\r\nworships a lower god. I am better&quot; or &quot;I am worshipping god everyday. I wil=\r\nl get so and so result&quot; or &quot;I worship god more than that person. I am bette=\r\nr&quot;. An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga has little expectation, pride=\r\n etc. Worship becomes not about him but about god! He worships god and marv=\r\nels at the power that holds this cosmos together - the power that runs thin=\r\ngs infinitismally smaller than a boson and infinitely larger than a galaxy.=\r\n He will look at himself as a fully insignificant particle in front a supre=\r\nme power. His desires, likes, dislikes, conditioning and agendas start to s=\r\neem too insignificant in front of contemplating about that supreme power. E=\r\nven as that\n devotional spirit increases, there will be episodes when one b=\r\necomes self-centered in one&#39;s worship. But with practice, one loses oneself=\r\n completely and surrenders completely to the supreme power and become liber=\r\nated in the end.\n=C2=A0\nIn each path, one may walk the path without making =\r\nany significant progress for a long time. As one starts to imbibe the inher=\r\nent qualities of the path, some internal transformation will kick in. Yet, =\r\nthe force of prior conditioning, coming from many lives, is too strong to o=\r\nvercome. One keeps walking..\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrol=\r\nogy & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: Prasad Pavitram &lt;vimal99200=\r\n0@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, August 24, 2013 10:04 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Re: which path to choose?-a dialog\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Narasimha=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I agree with =\r\nyour explanation of all four different types of yoga and also bhakti yoga b=\r\neing the safest of all kinds. Dont you think all these yogas are NOT an end=\r\n in itself but to prepare the mind for awakening?? The purpose behind all t=\r\nhis should be to free oneself from karmic bindings and be free of the =C2=\r\n=A0bondage. That has to be the core purpose of any type of yoga. To be free=\r\n is to be awakened.=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;No matter what path you follow ultimately th=\r\nere should be a perception where one sees the thought for what it is and th=\r\nere is a cleansing of the action. And there will be no karma when you are N=\r\nOT bound to the action. Now does these four types of yogas prepare one for =\r\nthis perception or at least create more probability or mental states where =\r\nsuch a thing is possible. I am not sure.=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your movie analogy is b=\r\nrilliant because currently life is a movie which we take for real. With res=\r\npect to our mental state where we are attached to our thoughts it is of cou=\r\nrse real.How does this perceptual leap comes about ...and is it a matter of=\r\n time?? I am not sure if it is a matter of time or practice. It is an error=\r\n in perception where we identify with our thoughts and act out. Does these =\r\nyogas help see this and come out of this error?? Can all karma be ended in =\r\nan instant with the help of a perception and how that can be brought about.=\r\n..are I think are the most fundamental questions. Right now humanity is cre=\r\nating more karma while trying to liberate extricate itself out of it....the=\r\n whole thing is moving in a circular way.=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Just put my line of th=\r\nought out there...i may not be right. =C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_______________________=\r\n_________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

It is=\r\n very much\n&gt;&gt; possible and in fact is a measure of self realized people.\n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche by combining multiple paths. =\r\nThey are not meant to be mutually exclusive.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vive=\r\nkananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this div=\r\ninity\n within by controlling\n nature: external and internal. Do this either=\r\n by work or worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or=\r\n all of these - and be free.&quot;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Here are my 2 cents.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Jnana =\r\nyoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on wo=\r\nrk and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. B=\r\nhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick wh=\r\natever is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom, =\r\ndetached action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually=\r\n exclusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, others will a=\r\nutomatically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or=\r\n oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Forget ab=\r\nout horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I=\r\n strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna=\r\n advised\n against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic lif=\r\ne force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadi=\r\ns. In this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amou=\r\nnts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my vie=\r\nw, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one o=\r\nf the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas=\r\n from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourag=\r\ne even him to practice it.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a=\r\n distinct danger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. Peop=\r\nle of this age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to de=\r\nlude that &quot;all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;=\r\nt matter. It&#39;s all a delusion anyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate c=\r\nonditioning that reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind\n o=\r\nf like declaring wisely in a movie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;=\r\n, but flinching in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Withou=\r\nt absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problemati=\r\nc too. A long path of constant contemplation and self-correction can be red=\r\nuced to a quick delusional jump to the end.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;IMHo, for most people =\r\nin this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.\n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;--------\n&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resour=\r\nces: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n&gt;--------\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;--- In sohamsa@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Ms. Maja,\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Namaste\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Now different type of 4 yogas based on ayana/kendra:\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana yoga- lagna and its trines\n&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha ayana - =\r\nKarma yoga -\n 10th bhava and its trines\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th bh=\r\nava and its trines\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and its trin=\r\nes\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you can check it, I=\r\n assure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of them.

Let me try to put al=\r\nl this into a perspective here.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(=\r\n0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, time=\r\ns, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family:\n=\r\n &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent=\r\n; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now my understanding is that all these four di=\r\nfferent path lead to the same point or the end result and that is self real=\r\nization. No matter what path or approach you take the end result or the tru=\r\nth has to be the same. It cannot be two different thing for two different p=\r\neople and in that case it is not the Truth. The path one adopts may be of h=\r\nindu persuasion or some other religious persuasion the end result has to be=\r\n the same. Not only the end result one has to come to a point where one has=\r\n an insight or a perception that finishes the ego or self directed activity=\r\n.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; fon=\r\nt-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: tr=\r\nansparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:=\r\n rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new\n york&#39;=\r\n, times, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Karma i=\r\ns a natural result of the freedom that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma =\r\nhas no meaning without freedom to act. I do mistakes and create imbalance o=\r\nnly when I have freedom to act and as such I have pay it back and restore b=\r\nalance in Nature. To have the freedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It=\r\n all makes perfect sense to me.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0=\r\n); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, seri=\r\nf; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;=\r\nnew york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;=\r\n&quot;&gt;Now due to karmic overload it may become very hard for large numbers of p=\r\neople to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if Nature allows one to be fr=\r\nee of this attachment without a payback. Now there is a train of\n thought w=\r\nhich says that one can look into the whole nature of this attachment at one=\r\n shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one thing after another look=\r\n at this whole thing to the root , have a perception and get out of it. In =\r\na sense our ancestors were intelligent that they devised some way to clear =\r\nthis Karma but it seems like for large numbers of people these will become =\r\ncrutches rather than help to get out of the karmic cycle and lead an existe=\r\nnce where one is free to act. If my previous karma is influencing my action=\r\n then I am not free.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-siz=\r\ne: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; backgrou=\r\nnd-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: =\r\nrgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, =\r\ntimes, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Is it pos=\r\nsible for someone to look into this whole process of\n attachment and have a=\r\nn insight and be free of it right now....&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12=\r\npt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, seri=\r\nf; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; f=\r\nace=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasi=\r\nmha P.V.R.

For example, he may think &quot;I worship the h=\r\nighest god while that person worships a lower god. I am better&quot; or &quot;I am wo=\r\nrshipping god everyday. I will get so and so result&quot; or &quot;I worship god more=\r\n than that person. I am better&quot;. An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga =\r\nhas little expectation, pride etc. Worship becomes not about him but about =\r\ngod! He worships god and marvels at the power that holds this cosmos togeth=\r\ner - the power that runs things infinitismally smaller than a boson and inf=\r\ninitely larger than a galaxy. He will look at himself as a fully insignific=\r\nant\n particle in\n front a supreme power. His desires, likes, dislikes, cond=\r\nitioning and agendas start to seem too insignificant in front of contemplat=\r\ning about that supreme power. Even as that devotional spirit increases, the=\r\nre will be episodes when one becomes self-centered in one&#39;s worship. But wi=\r\nth practice, one loses oneself completely and surrenders completely to the =\r\nsupreme power and become liberated in the end.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In each path, o=\r\nne may walk the path without making any significant progress for a long tim=\r\ne. As one starts to imbibe the inherent qualities of the path, some interna=\r\nl transformation will kick in. Yet, the force of prior conditioning, coming=\r\n from many lives, is too strong to overcome.

Right now humanity is creating more karma while trying to libe=\r\nrate extricate itself out of it....the whole thing is moving in a circular =\r\nway.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div\n style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px;=\r\n font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color=\r\n: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;co=\r\nlor: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new yo=\r\nrk&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;Just put my line of thought out there...i may not be right. &nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new y=\r\nork&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times ne=\r\nw roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;h=\r\nr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha P.V.R.

I=\r\nt is very much&lt;br&gt;&gt; possible and in fact is a measure of self realized p=\r\neople.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche by combining mult=\r\niple paths. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll =\r\nquote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes a comment =\r\non the 4 paths:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is =\r\nto manifest this divinity\n within by controlling\n nature: external and inte=\r\nrnal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or philosophy -=\r\n by one, or more, or all of these - and be free.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Here are my =\r\n2 cents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom.=\r\n Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self=\r\n-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender=\r\n to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop tha=\r\nt quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender to =\r\nthe Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities develops =\r\nnicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a realized p=\r\nerson (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these qualities fully b=\r\nlossomed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatra=\r\nmsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 9=\r\n9% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n against it. Controlling body and =\r\nmind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requires stric=\r\nt yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and f=\r\nood, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be da=\r\nngerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught i=\r\nn &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He di=\r\nscouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to V=\r\nivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jna=\r\nna yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the de=\r\nlusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/s=\r\nmart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahman. I am Brahman=\r\n. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delusion anyway&quot; w=\r\nithout fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in =\r\nconsciousness every instant. Kind\n of like declaring wisely in a movie that=\r\n &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in every scary scene, c=\r\nrying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earne=\r\nstness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant contempl=\r\nation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the =\r\nend.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma =\r\nyoga are the most suitable and safest.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasi=\r\nmha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofoll=\r\now&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear Ms. =\r\nMaja,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Now different type of 4 yog=\r\nas based on ayana/kendra:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana yo=\r\nga- lagna and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha ayana - Karma yoga -\n 10th bha=\r\nva and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th bhava and its tr=\r\nines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you can c=\r\nheck it, I assure&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of them.
