This is the rational \nexpl=\r\naination - we need to attribute a reason for our current being and a logica=\r\nl explaination is many lives.\n\nSome thoughts that occur randomly in my mind=\r\n on this:\n* How come the number of human beings keeps on increasing? Is it =\r\nthat the animals are doing more and more good to be reborn as humans \n* How=\r\n come all politicians and power holders are so bad - e.g: Has Deve Gowda do=\r\nne something extremely great to have such a good life - he is PM, his unedu=\r\ncated son is CM\n* Are the number of souls in the world finite or infinite?\n=\r\n\nComing to rajesh&#39;s problem - I think he is solely responsible for the mess=\r\n he has landed in - it was his choice and he must stand by it - this is the=\r\n logical thing that seems right in the Indian context.\nIf it were US or wes=\r\ntern world - he could have walked out\n\nSo either decision is correct/wrong =\r\nin context\n\nbut to attribute it to telling that if he says &#39;no&#39; he might ha=\r\nve to have a bad next life and so on - karmic debt etc may not be the right=\r\n reason - as past lives are themselves debatable\n\n\nThanks\nVamsi\n\n\n\n--- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

However, one&#39;s dharma towar=\r\nds various \n&gt; people and objects can pull one in different directions. One =\r\nhas to balance \n&gt; one&#39;s dharma towards various people and objects and make =\r\nthe right decision. \n&gt; Any action taken now with a self-identification with=\r\n the action (i.e. mind \n&gt; thinking &quot;I am doing it&quot;) becomes a karma for fut=\r\nure and will give its \n&gt; fruits (good or bad) in future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though we are=\r\n not the body, we temporarily live in a body for a few decades. \n&gt; This bod=\r\ny is like a house we live in and its sense organs (eyes, ears etc) \n&gt; are l=\r\nike windows in the house. When we live in a house, we have the \n&gt; responsib=\r\nility to take care of it and keep the house and its surroundings \n&gt; nice. S=\r\nimilarly, we have some duty to make the body happy. Give it food, \n&gt; water =\r\netc, nourish it well, take good care of it, make sure it is healthy, \n&gt; mak=\r\ne sure its pleasures are taken care of and make sure it is gratified.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHowever, we also have duties to other people, like parents, elders, \n&gt; rela=\r\ntives, friends etc. In addition, there may be persons with strong debts \n&gt; =\r\nwith us who come into our life later. We have duties towards them. Moreover=\r\n, \n&gt; we have some duties towards the society we live in, the country we liv=\r\ne in \n&gt; and the entire universe.\n&gt; \n&gt; These various duties can pull one in =\r\ndifferent directions. One has to \n&gt; balance them all and do the best possib=\r\nle action. Arjuna&#39;s duty towards his \n&gt; guru Drona was to respect him and o=\r\nbey him. But his duty to his brother (and \n&gt; also to the universe) required=\r\n him to kill his guru who was on Duryodhana&#39;s \n&gt; side.\n&gt; \n&gt; Usually, one&#39;s =\r\nduty towards one&#39;s own body and its gratification is a very \n&gt; small part o=\r\nf one&#39;s dharma and one&#39;s duty towards others should receive a \n&gt; higher pri=\r\nority. The larger the number of people impacted, the higher the \n&gt; weightag=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one&#39;s only motivation for doing something that would hurt many p=\r\neople is \n&gt; self-gratification, one is on a shaky basis. With such self-cen=\r\ntered \n&gt; actions, one is likely to create far more new karmas than the old =\r\nkarmas one \n&gt; is getting rid of. Of course, if not hurting others now leads=\r\n to something \n&gt; else later that will hurt all those people even more, then=\r\n that is worse. A \n&gt; lot depends on one&#39;s self-control. Choosing the lesser=\r\n evil is a difficult \n&gt; exercise when one of the evils is not visible yet..=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nobody can make the right decision for you. You are responsible for =\r\nyour \n&gt; actions and will face the reactions to those actions later. For exa=\r\nmple, if \n&gt; you have a debt to this girl and escape it now by calling off t=\r\nhe marriage \n&gt; for looks, you will have to pay it back later with interest.=\r\n For example, \n&gt; you may be born with terrible looks and many may reject yo=\r\nu. Or the girl may \n&gt; be born with more undesirable qualities and yet you m=\r\nay have to marry her. \n&gt; So many possibilities are there and one cannot kno=\r\nw for sure what is in \n&gt; store.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whatever you decide, good luck to that=\r\n girl, to your elders and also to you!\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, this forum is for spiritua=\r\nl discussions and matters related to \n&gt; spiritual sadhana.
