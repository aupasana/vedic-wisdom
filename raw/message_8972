The perpetual vio=\r\nlence that has been instigated by Marxist movements, totalitarian Communist=\r\n dictatorships, bloody guerrilla wars, and terrorist bloodshed has been res=\r\nponsible for more deaths and suffering during the twentieth century than an=\r\ny other rival ideology of that era. Marxism has led to the destruction of c=\r\nultures, the dehumanization and misery of large segments of the global popu=\r\nlation, and the degeneration of the human spirit. Marxism is an atheistic a=\r\nnd materialistic philosophy that views human beings as purely mechanistic, =\r\ncharacterless and utilitarian automatons. For Marxists, human persons are t=\r\no be reduced, both philosophically and in practice, to nothing more than so=\r\nulless and bland laborers, whose existence only has meaning in direct propo=\r\nrtion to their degree of utility by, and enslavement to, the state.  \n\nKarl=\r\n Marx (1818-1883) was a German citizen of Jewish descent who in his youth h=\r\nad been interested in the views of the German idealist philosopher and theo=\r\nlogian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831). Though Hegel&#39;s philosophi=\r\ncal system was theistic, and most of his followers at that time were themse=\r\nlves primarily religious individuals, Marx&#39;s introduction to Hegel&#39;s though=\r\nt was via the Young Hegelians, a group dedicated to misusing Hegel&#39;s philos=\r\nophical methods to undermine and eradicate religious thought itself, rather=\r\n than uphold it. The two main leaders of the Young Hegelians were Ludwig Fe=\r\nuerbach (1804-1872) and Bruno Bauer (1809-1882).\n\nKarl Marx had initially (=\r\npre-1844) subscribed to the Feuerbachian program of the critique of religio=\r\nn. While he continued to employ the notion of a philosophical anthropology =\r\n- the attempt to discern the human meaning behind every experience - he wen=\r\nt further than Ludwig Feuerbach with his attempt to perform a critique of p=\r\nolitical economy. In the following section, we will briefly examine what le=\r\nd Marx to attempt such a critique, and talk about the ways in which politic=\r\nal economy is thoroughly resistant to such a Marxist critique.  \n\nFueurbach=\r\n and the Young Hegelians felt that the very apex of both the philosophical =\r\nand the theological enterprises had been achieved by Hegelianism and German=\r\n Lutheranism, respectively. Thus, in their monumentally insular view, the e=\r\nnd of the philosophic enterprise had suddenly commenced in their lifetime.[=\r\n1]  Now, the only project left was the creation of a philosophical anthropo=\r\nlogy - an attempt to show that all philosophical ideas were dependent upon =\r\nwhat is essentially human in the purely biologically behavioral sense. Once=\r\n a general account of humanity would be attained, so their belief went, the=\r\nn such an account could be applied to all things. The primary tool of this =\r\nproject was the use of the process of criticism, which would purportedly re=\r\nveal the conditions for the very possibility of any object under observatio=\r\nn.  \n\nThe Young Hegelians, including Feuerbach and Marx, had applied this p=\r\nrocess of critique to the nature of the theology of the so-called Right Heg=\r\nelians, who were primarily Lutheran theologians loyal to Hegel&#39;s theistic p=\r\nhilosophical underpinnings. Feuerbach, specifically, felt that religion was=\r\n merely an unreal projection of essential, alienated humanity. Furthermore,=\r\n for Feuerbach, God was no more than the construction of human beings, and =\r\nactually represented the conceptual personification of what were in actuali=\r\nty very human traits. By critiquing God and religion, Feuerbach thought, a =\r\ngreater knowledge of human beings could be attained. Marx would later ferve=\r\nntly agree with this general premise.  \n\nWhile Feuerbach felt that there wa=\r\ns at least a trans-historical human essence, however, Marx felt that such a=\r\nn idea was too much of a concession to the &quot;metaphysical&quot;, and that man&#39;s e=\r\nssence was only ever revealed under real world, materialist conditions. Hum=\r\nan beings, for Marx, are in essence, primordially, producers and makers. Wo=\r\nrk, for Marx, was both the raison d&#39;=EAtre and essential attributive nature=\r\n of the human person. Therefore, on Marx&#39;s account, self-actualization cons=\r\nisted in nothing more than having the freedom to perform meaningful work. P=\r\nroduction, for Marx, was labor that is transformative towards creating a ce=\r\nrtain outcome, a praxis. Political economy was a body of theories formulate=\r\nd by the classical economists (such as Adam Smith) that sees human beings a=\r\ns essentially productive animals. Therefore, political economy - the realm =\r\nof production and exchange - now became the central object of any Marxist c=\r\nritique. \n\nThe French Revolution supposedly succeeded in creating political=\r\n emancipation, so Marx insisted, but state equality displaced inequality in=\r\nto the social sphere. In the social sphere, human beings were subject to an=\r\n overwhelming sense of alienation. The proletariat (the working class) was =\r\nseparated from what they essentially are - biologically-determined producer=\r\ns unleashed to create, as an expression of their own essence. Political eco=\r\nnomy was thus seen as nothing more than the projection of our collective hu=\r\nman praxis.  Instead of political economy serving human purposes, however, =\r\nMarx felt that humanity was presently serving the needs of political econom=\r\ny. But the present political economy is nothing more than our own creation.=\r\n Now a human revolution was needed. In order to begin this purportedly eman=\r\ncipatory process, Marx felt that the economic system of his time needed to =\r\nbe translated into a philosophical anthropology.\n\nMarx&#39;s attempt to transla=\r\nte the critical program to political economy proved immediately problematic=\r\n for three reasons. 1) While God is immaterial, economies are very material=\r\n; 2) It was impossible at Marx&#39;s juncture in history to imagine a world wit=\r\nhout alienated labor; 3) Marx used Adam Smith as his primary economic theor=\r\nist, though many of Smith&#39;s ideas no longer applied. \n\nThus, while Marx mad=\r\ne the attempt to translate Fueurbach&#39;s failed critique of religion into a c=\r\nritique of political economy, such an application was itself a complete fai=\r\nlure, to say the least.  \n\n\nThe Failures of Marxism\n\n&quot;We are ruthless and a=\r\nsk no quarter from you. When our turn comes we shall not disguise our terro=\r\nrism.&quot;[2] - Karl Marx\n\nThe failures of Marxism are legion and have been wel=\r\nl documented for many decades by a wide variety of scholars, researchers, t=\r\nhinkers, economists and political scientists. Marxism eliminates all incent=\r\nive for people to engage in any form of labor, whether intellectual, artist=\r\nic or physical. By eliminating wages directly reflective of the value of in=\r\ndividual instances of labor, people living under Marxist regimes are forced=\r\n to work for a rationed amount of food and basic resources. Without a fair =\r\nwage to work for, people naturally lose the motivation to work at all, thus=\r\n leading to economic stagnation and a sense of hopelessness. We have seen s=\r\nuch instances of economic failure in every Communist nation in history, and=\r\n we are now beginning to see such economic breakdown occur in Europe and Am=\r\nerica as a direct result of the incremental introduction of crypto-Marxist =\r\neconomic policies.\n\nA nation under the bondage of Marxism is destined to fa=\r\nilure because such a state provides its people with no reason to strive for=\r\n anything higher than being a personless atom in the social mass. With no d=\r\nistinctions, diversity, hierarchy, or classes to order the varying social s=\r\ntrata of society in a sane and reasonable manner, a doctor will be paid the=\r\n same wage as garbage collector, and a factory laborer has no hopes of ever=\r\n earning a better life even if he acquired a Ph.D. All people are paid equa=\r\nlly for work that requires unequal levels of skill, talent, education and p=\r\nersonal natural propensity, so the person who aspires to be a doctor has no=\r\n motivation to go to school for so many years of hard work only to be paid =\r\nthe same amount as someone who has not gone to school at all.\n\nMarxism is p=\r\nredicated upon the idea of radical egalitarianism. Consequently, Marxists s=\r\ntrive to utterly eliminate any sense of ethnic and national diversity, prid=\r\ne or celebration. The policy of eliminating a people&#39;s natural and inherent=\r\n sense of distinct cultural identity is designed to deprive people of any i=\r\ndentity-sourced empowerment to dissent against the totalitarian, atheistic =\r\ngovernment. It is precisely for this reason that we must hold on to our eth=\r\nnic and cultural identity at all costs, expressing a healthy pride in who w=\r\ne are, and in the ethnic heritage that made us who we are. Marxists, both t=\r\nhose who have already gained power and those who seek to force their way to=\r\n power in non-Marxist societies, promote and force ethnic amalgamation at t=\r\nhe direct expense of ethnic diversity, often in the very name of ethnic div=\r\nersity. We must never allow any government to eliminate the rich and beauti=\r\nful diversity of the many cultures, languages, ethnicities, races and uniqu=\r\ne peoples that make our world the fascinating and meaningful place it is.\n\n=\r\nMarxism enforces its own beliefs and forcefully prevents all free speech th=\r\nat departs from their own belief system. Marxism is based upon fanaticism, =\r\nhatred, doctrinaire closed-mindedness, dogmatic slogans, and blind faith in=\r\n unsound historical, social and economic theories. Those found dissenting a=\r\ngainst the Marxist system are taken from their families and put into re-edu=\r\ncation centers or Gulags for merciless and systematic brainwashing. Those w=\r\nho continue to dissent are often summarily executed, with the family expect=\r\ned to pay for the bullets. The nightmarish Marxist model of the state repre=\r\nsents the very opposite model that is presented by Dharma. \n\n\nComparison of=\r\n Marxism with Sanatana Dharma\n(Please compare both lists side by side)\n\nMAR=\r\nXISM:  \t\t\t\n\nMaterialism.\t\n\t\t\t\nBiological Determinism.\n\t\t\t\nExternal environm=\r\nent creates human essence. \t\n\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNurture trumps Nature.\t\n\t\t\nAthei=\r\nsm. \t\t\t\n\t\nRadical egalitarianism. \t\n\t\t\nGlobalization. \t\t\n\t\t\nClass, gender, =\r\nrace and social conflict. \t\n\t\t\nMulticulturalism. \t\n\t\t\t\nEthnic disintegratio=\r\nn. \t\n\t\t\nEradication of gender differences.\t\n\t \t\t\nDestruction of Tradition. =\r\n\t\n\t\t\nCulture reflects the lowest common denominator. \n\t\t\t\n&quot;Socialist realis=\r\nt&quot; art.\n\nDestruction of the family structure.\t\n\nExploitation of Nature, and=\r\n degradation of the environment.\t\t\n\nRelativist ethics (the ends justify the=\r\n means).\t\t\n\t\t\nLack of civil freedoms. \t\n\t\t\nPersonhood subsumed in the amorp=\r\nhous\tmasses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\nDemocratic centralism. \n\t\t\t\nOmnisexuality. \t\t\n\t\t\nAborti=\r\non on demand.\t\n\t\t\nAll means of production controlled by the state. \t\n\n\n\t\t\nD=\r\nHARMA (NATURAL LAW):\n\nSpirituality.\n\nVitalism.\n\nHuman beings create their e=\r\nxternal environment, which in turn can have an effect upon the natural deve=\r\nlopment of the person.\n\nWill trumps both Nature and Nurture.\n\nTheism.\n\nQual=\r\nitative Hierarchy.\n\nTribalism/Nationalism.\n\nClass, gender, and social harmo=\r\nny and cooperation.\n\nEthnic Plurality.\n\nEthnic integrity.\n\nCelebration of g=\r\nender distinctions. \t\t\n\nCelebrating Tradition.\n\nCulture reflects the highes=\r\nt ideals.\n\nAesthetics inspired by ideal forms, transcendent insight, eterna=\r\nl archetypes, and inspiration from Nature.\n\nUpholding the traditional famil=\r\ny. \t\t\n\t\nPreservation and reverence for Nature.\n\t\t\nFirm non-relativist ethic=\r\ns.\n\nHuman values based upon transcendent truth.\n\nInherent freedom of the hu=\r\nman person.\n\nHuman personality never subsumed in the amorphous masses.\n\nLea=\r\ndership principle.\n\nHeterosexuality.\n\nRespect for innocent life.\n\nAll means=\r\n of production controlled by free and creative human persons and families.\n=\r\n\n\nMarxist philosophy, and the Communist movement in general, is without dou=\r\nbt the most destructive ideology humanity has ever been subjected to. Marxi=\r\nsm represents the exact antithesis of Natural Law, of religion, of positive=\r\n culture, of any form of national ideal, and of healthy tradition. Marxism =\r\nis the polar opposite of life itself. It is the embodiment of the final, qu=\r\nintessential stage of the 4000-year-old failed Abrahamic experiment.\n\nCommu=\r\nnism has been responsible for the death, murder, torture and pain of more h=\r\numan beings than any ideology in world history (with, arguably, the possibl=\r\ne exception of Islam). In China, the former USSR, and the former Communist =\r\nnations of Eastern Europe, it has led to environmental degradation that is =\r\nunprecedented. Marxism is a culture-destroyer. Far from being &quot;progressive&quot;=\r\n and leading societies toward greater advancement, Marxism has led the nati=\r\nons under its rule back to the dark ages. In each and every significant way=\r\n, Marxism is the very exact opposite of everything that Dharma and Natural =\r\nLaw has ever stood for. This explains why for the last 150 years of history=\r\n, communists have been one of the very greatest enemies of Vedic civilizati=\r\non, and have tried to destroy us every chance they get. Marxism is our natu=\r\nral enemy. Every follower of Dharma must oppose Marxist materialism with ev=\r\nery breath we have.\n\nEndnotes:\n\n[1].
