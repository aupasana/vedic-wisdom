Parabrahman takes the 6 forms of higher deities like athi parash=\r\nakti, narayana, shiva, ganapathi, etc as taught by Shankara. Below these we=\r\n have the trinity representing the trigunas, Brahma-Vishnu-Rudra, who take =\r\ncare of the triple task of creation, sustenance and destruction. Below them=\r\n we have the Gods beginning with Indra and the remaining 33 main devas refe=\r\nrenced in the vedas. \n\nPlease advise and correct us if our understanding re=\r\ngarding this is proper.\n\nOur further questions which we need some light fro=\r\nm everyone else is:\n1) Where do other beings and demigods like Gandharva, Y=\r\naksha, Kinnaras, Apsaras, feature in the scheme of things in this hierarchy=\r\n. Other than those 4 I mentioned are there other types of beings?\n\n2) Where=\r\n do Rishis and Manushya feature in the scheme of things in the same hierarc=\r\nhy?\n\n3) How about Pishaachas, and other beings? \n\nPlease offer any informat=\r\nion you can on this for us.\n\nPranams,\nAnoop.\n\n\n"}}
