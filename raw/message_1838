I hope you are able to perform it regularly.=\r\n\n\n1. I would suggest you to perform the homam first and then perform the Ga=\r\nyatri. However, I do not have any scriptures to back it. Please talk to you=\r\nr local priest, he may be able to provide vaidiki reasons for it.\n\n2. You c=\r\nan do it just like the procedure given for Chandi Homam, just replace the p=\r\nrocedure for Chandi to that of Lakshmi. The details are given in the Chandi=\r\n Homam manual.\n\n3. In my opinion any kind of material other than wood or co=\r\npra would not be suitable for homam. Moreover, wood tends to produce more s=\r\nmoke, and especially if you live in an apartment, this may not really be fe=\r\nasible. Copra, in my personal experience is an excellent material.\n\nHope th=\r\nis helps.\nNarayan\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shankar789&quot; &lt;shank=\r\nar789@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am all set to start doing hom=\r\nam/ agnihotra on 22nd May 2009, Friday morning hours 6.15 am. I have got al=\r\nmost everything ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have few queries:\n&gt; (1) Have I to perform pra=\r\nthas sandhyavandanam(morning)  before starting the homam? Or can I do sandh=\r\nyavandanam after homam?\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) How can I combine Maha Ganapathi Homam and=\r\n Maha Lakshmi Homam in the same go? \n&gt; \n&gt; (3) For starting fire, apart from=\r\n camphor can I use &#39;duraflame&#39; fire log. It appears that this wood is made =\r\nof natural wood and also wax, specifically made for fire. It is reported th=\r\nat it is better than normal wood. \n&gt; \n&gt; I would be thankful if any one can =\r\nplease advise me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; Shankar\n&gt; Detroit, USA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
