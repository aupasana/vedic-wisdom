So many conscious, \nsub-conscious and super-conscious th=\r\noughts are always running in the mind \nand they stop the mind from becoming=\r\n absolutely still. When mind lets \neverything go and becomes still, then th=\r\ne deity can fill the mind. That \nbliss is indescribable and far higher than=\r\n any normal happiness one may have \nexperienced. That is what one is chasin=\r\ng when one meditates.\n\nWhen mind is getting withdrawn a little from body an=\r\nd some of the conscious \nthoughts, it is possible that some sub-conscious t=\r\nhoughts lying beneath the \nsurface come to the fore. It is not that you are=\r\n attracting anything. It is \njust a thought or impression or memory stored =\r\nin the sub-conscious mind. As \nmind&#39;s awareness of body and other things it=\r\n is normally conscious of \ndecreases, it may become more aware of some sub-=\r\nconscious thoughts. If you \nnegotiate those and learn to ignore those, then=\r\n mind&#39;s awareness of some \nsuper-conscious thoughts may increase. As you re=\r\nfuse to be distracted by all \nthese and try to focus the mind on the mantra=\r\n and mantra alone, eventually \nmind will reach a state of stillness. There =\r\nis no thumbrule to success, \nexcept trying.\n\nAs meditation after homam is m=\r\nore effective, it is possible to make progress \nfaster. However, one still =\r\nneeds to work hard and long to achieve perfection \nin focus. Even great sai=\r\nnts and yogis took many years. Just keep trying.\n\nNext time such a thing ha=\r\nppens, do not think much about it and be \ndistracted. Keep the mind focused=\r\n on the mantra. Nothing is to be feared and \nnothing is to be despised. All=\r\n that is there is the deity you are praying \nto. The deity fills the entire=\r\n universe. If you see or hear or perceive \nsomething other than the deity (=\r\ne.g. &quot;my body&quot;, a ghost trailor), it is \nbecause of mind&#39;s faulty perceptio=\r\nn.
