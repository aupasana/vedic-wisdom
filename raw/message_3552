I also share the same reasoning as you m=\r\nentioned. Exactly same!\nI too have heard that `Growing beard&#39; and long hair=\r\ns stores some amount of Spiritual energy generated from the spiritual pract=\r\nices. I do not know if it is accurate or not but I&#39;ll tell you about my per=\r\nsonal experience of Growing Beard.\n\nNarasimha suggested me to grow beard mo=\r\nre than a year back. I could not gather the courage for almost one year to =\r\ndo so (In that sense I can be blamed as the one who does not or could not o=\r\nbey Guru&#39;s instructions to the fullest). The reasons were obvious-\nAttachme=\r\nnt to the `Physical as well as psychological personality&#39; as perceived the =\r\nsociety and Fear and shame.\n What people will think? How they will react? H=\r\now colleagues will take it in profession, etc... My beard is in patches. It=\r\n does not grow full so it does not look that nice when I do not shave for s=\r\nay 3/4 days and moreover there are Gray hairs as well now. So all in all, i=\r\n could not think of growing beard and once I tried for few days, colleagues=\r\n (Ladies) in office as well as at home discouraged it.\n\nNow I guess i&#39;ve ov=\r\nercome (partially) that `Fear, shame and Attachment syndrome&#39; and am growin=\r\ng beard since last couple of months. People look at me with wonder/question=\r\ns and some ask reasons as well but everything is settled. Fear is gone. So =\r\nI can vouch safe that in cases like me, growing beard really helps in overc=\r\noming that attachment and fear part. One is not bother about ones look and =\r\nreaction of people around. One is only bother about ones spiritual progress=\r\n to the maximum possible extent.\n\nAgain, a RED signal in growing beard as w=\r\nell. One may look good in beard and that might trap one again and deadly sp=\r\nrout of attachment can come again with changed object which is now `beard&#39;.=\r\n I remember Swami Sivananda&#39;s cautioning advice in the same regards which w=\r\nas posted sometime back by Krishnendu, if I am correct.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtp=\r\nal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Jyotisa Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste & pranaams,\n&gt; \n&gt; With reference to the =\r\nlines written by you:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...Beard is useful. The tradition of growing be=\r\nard exists in many religions\n&gt; and it is not without a reason...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I wo=\r\nuld like to state my understanding on this issue: Ego has many forms and\n&gt; =\r\none such form is in the attachment to the body. Combing our hair, shaving,\n=\r\n&gt; grooming etc are habits formed by us to make us &quot;presentable&quot; to society.=\r\n\n&gt; Growing a beard helps to make us indifferent to our grooming needs and f=\r\nocus\n&gt; the mind solely on the sadhana. One who is in the highest state of m=\r\nind will\n&gt; not bother about the appearance and even roam about carefree lik=\r\ne an\n&gt; avadhuta. I have also read elsewhere that the beard helps to trap th=\r\ne shakti\n&gt; accumulated as a result of the sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please correct my u=\r\nnderstanding if I am wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Hari\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jan 21, 2=\r\n010 at 9:04 AM, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr108@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What he wrote was to do Savitri Gayatri mantra 1000 times ever=\r\nyday in one\n&gt; &gt; sitting and do like that for 100 days at a stretch without =\r\nbreak. Then\n&gt; &gt; possibly give a break for a few days and do for another 100=\r\n days. Like that,\n&gt; &gt; do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of cours=\r\ne, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in a row too. But,\n&gt; &gt; keeping br=\r\nahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult for some people and hence\n&gt; &gt; the =\r\nsuggestion of the break.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For success in any sadhana, brahmacharya i=\r\ns very important. Restraint from\n&gt; &gt; sex and control of anger and short-tem=\r\nper will help one avoid leakage of\n&gt; &gt; shakti (purifying energy). Everytime=\r\n one experiences lust, anger etc, one\n&gt; &gt; loses some shakti.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Every =\r\nfactor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. The\n&gt; &gt; tradition =\r\nof growing beard exists in many religions and it is not without a\n&gt; &gt; reaso=\r\nn. We discussed this sometime back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one is living a lifestyle wh=\r\nere one avoids contact with any tempting\n&gt; &gt; situations altogether (e.g. li=\r\nving in a remote monastery), beard may or may\n&gt; &gt; not add much value. But, =\r\nif one is living a lifestyle where one comes in\n&gt; &gt; contact with tempting s=\r\nituations regularly (e.g. living in the modern world\n&gt; &gt; with a family and =\r\njob and a TV), beard can be very useful. As I said earlier\n&gt; &gt; when we disc=\r\nussed this, beard is not the complete solution but a small part\n&gt; &gt; of the =\r\nsolution. Just as a railing on the side of a hill road may stop a\n&gt; &gt; slowl=\r\ny moving car from sliding off the hill at night but be unable to stop a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n fast moving car out of control, similarly a beard can help a person with\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; decent control over the mind to retain control in some tricky situations=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Trimming beard is ok.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one =\r\nindeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours)\n&gt; &gt; ev=\r\neryday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,\n&gt; &gt; while following the=\r\n simple rules of same place, same time everyday and\n&gt; &gt; facing the same dir=\r\nection, one will certainly make good progress.\n&gt; &gt; Brahmacharya is one key =\r\nthing and sitting still with an erect back, neck and\n&gt; &gt; head with the eyes=\r\n closed is the other thing. The probability of mind\n&gt; &gt; becoming still is a=\r\nlmost zero if the body is not still. If the body can be\n&gt; &gt; kept very still=\r\n, there is a chance that mind will also become still for a\n&gt; &gt; moment. If t=\r\nhe mind is still for even a moment, it will cause great bliss.\n&gt; &gt; As mind =\r\ngets more used to being still, it will become still more often and\n&gt; &gt; for =\r\nlonger times. Then various kinds of samadhis become possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyot=\r\nish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri=\r\n Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;      Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;      Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;   Jyotish writings: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Ko=\r\nta &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Su=\r\nbject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Repost:Manishji&#39;s savitur gayatri sadhana\n&gt; &gt; pro=\r\ncedure\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, January 20=\r\n, 2010, 8:40 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is a great mail and very inspiring.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That then =\r\nis the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the sad=\r\nhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personality sits=\r\n there then the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commandi=\r\nng a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be i=\r\nt that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucia=\r\nl. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so=\r\n self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolut=\r\nion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very little=C2 accordi=\r\nng to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your S=\r\nhakti and deity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaK=\r\nali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself=\r\n( Provided you have Vijnana). After the\n&gt; &gt; death\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such=\r\n a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally a N=\r\nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the he=\r\nads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detr=\r\niment(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan wi=\r\nth his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate t=\r\nhis with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit l=\r\nike you\n&gt; &gt; attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of th=\r\nis from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes late=\r\nr. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe =\r\nand has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you,=\r\n because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identificati=\r\non, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti =\r\npossesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Sha=\r\nkti which can be used, moreover=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects =\r\nwill not be free of identification with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their actio=\r\nns are those which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These peopl=\r\ne usually join the same spirits which they have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been using after de=\r\nath, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is wo=\r\nrshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he =\r\nor she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a=\r\n few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may no=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to me the proof of th=\r\ne pudding is in the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nreititions of the Savitri(some=C2 call this the=C2 Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same time ever=\r\ny day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi =\r\nas is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and=\r\n the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whol=\r\ne procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before =\r\nand after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may be s=\r\nhort, so do\n&gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as =\r\nlong as is physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some =\r\nof the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love a=\r\nnd Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a clarif=\r\nication from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; &gt; The INTERNET now has a personality.
