I just wanted to share some quick thoughts on \nthe orientation of Ganesha&#39;s trunk. Trunk turning to left is more common and \ntrunk turning to right is rare, as that website notes.\n\nWhen energy of self-awareness is entering the Pingala nadi (the right/solar \nchannel of knowledge and logic), one will feel as though one&#39;s body is \ntilted to one&#39;s left. When energy of self-awareness is entering the Ida nadi \n(the left/lunar channel of surrender and feeling), one will feel as though \none&#39;s body is tilted to one&#39;s right. These are things sadhakas can \npractically observe. My guess is that the orientation of Ganesha&#39;s trunk may \nhold clues to the way in which that form is experienced.\n\nFor example, the form of Baala (childlike) Ganapathi is experienced through \nthe left channel, i.e. pure love and devotion. It works through surrender, \nfeeling and an intuitive approach rather than with knowledge, logic and a \nsystematic approach. Same with Bhakti (devotion) Ganapathi. But, most forms \nwork through the right channel, i.e. knowledge, logic and a systematic \napproach.\n\nJust as Dakshina Kaali is preferred and people are afraid of Vaama Kaali, \nsimilarly Ganesha with trunk turning to left (i.e. working through dakshina) \nis preferred by people and people are afraid of Ganesha with trunk turning \nto right (i.e. working through vaama). Some people will even tell you to not \nkeep a Ganesha idol at home that has trunk turning to right!\n\nJust my 2 cents for tonight...\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, July 12, 2009 6:16 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] The Mystery of Ganesha\n\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; There is so much symbolism in mythology. it would be interesting to know \n&gt; more and more about Ganesha whom we all worship during homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; Found this interesting information that i would like to share:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/lg/lg_ch-05.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n\n\n"}}
