Please note two things here:\n \n(1) Varna as I said before is not to be decided solely based on birth. It is based on one&#39;s skills, aptitude and work. Family and environment in which one grows up influences one&#39;s value system, skills and aptitude, but does not necessarily determine it. You cannot apply today&#39;s rigid caste system where shudras and even chandalas call themselves as braahmanas and kshatriyas to the Purusha sookta hymn.\n \n(2) It is not that mouth and arms are auspicious parts and feet are inauspicious. Each part simply plays a different role. Mouth cannot support your weight and make you walk and foot cannot speak.\n \nSimilarly, braahmanas or those who pursue knowledge and wisdom share their wisdom with others and guide others and that is why they are compared to the mouth of god, which speaks. Kshatriyas use their power and protect others and that is why they are compared to the arms of god. Shudras do all the necessary hard work to keep the society running and that is why they are compared to feet. Nobody is more important or less important.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- gopal narayan &lt;gopalnarayan123@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; jai gurudev\n&gt;\n&gt; om shivgorakshbala\n&gt;\n&gt; man is not created by any god from mud/dirt and sent to earth.\n&gt;\n&gt; nor brahmin created from mouth of a god,nor kshatriya from any god shoulder\n&gt; nor any vaishya from any god leg nor any shudra from any god legs.\n&gt;\n&gt; man is evoled by mother nature the parbrahma parmatma adi shakti\n&gt; proof is in dna and genes.\n&gt;\n&gt; religion and caste barriers created by ignorant humans to divide humanity\n&gt; and create hate and destruction of humanity and mother earth.\n&gt;\n&gt; let us all unite to save humanity mother earth and live\n&gt; peacefully.\n&gt;\n&gt; let us believe in truth and not fall into falsehood of division hateful\n&gt; religion/casteism etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; om shakti\n&gt;\n&gt; gopal\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Jan 5, 2011 at 12:18 PM, sudhir junonikar &lt;sudhirjunonikar@...\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shri Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sashatang Namaskar!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you very much for delighting me, I am very much great full to have\n&gt; &gt; your reply to my query.\n&gt; &gt; Thank you once again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Sudhir\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Wed, 5/1/11, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: cast system\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;sudhir junonikar&quot; &lt;sudhirjunonikar@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, 5 January, 2011, 8:17 AM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the old days also, there was varna system but it was different. People\n&gt; &gt; belonged to different varnas based on their aptitude and served different\n&gt; &gt; purposes in society. It wasn&#39;t a rigid system, but a flexible and mobile\n&gt; &gt; system based on aptitude rather than birth. Of course, because a child may\n&gt; &gt; get exposed to what father does and may have a good chance of developing\n&gt; &gt; aptitude for such work, one would by default get father&#39;s varna at birth.\n&gt; &gt; But, as one grows up and one&#39;s vasanas (conditioning from past lives)\n&gt; &gt; develop, one may develop a different aptitude and may end up with a varna\n&gt; &gt; different from father&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For example, Vishwamitra was born as a kshatriya, but became a braahmana\n&gt; &gt; and became a brahmarshi later. Valmiki was born as a shoodra and lived by\n&gt; &gt; hunting birds. He became a braahmana and became a maharshi later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No matter where one is born and how one was brought up, anyone who is\n&gt; &gt; interested in knowledge and liberation and not interested in money or power\n&gt; &gt; over others, IS a braahmana. Even if one is born in an orthodox brahmin\n&gt; &gt; family, if one is deeply interested in money or power and authority over\n&gt; &gt; others, one is NOT a braahmana. In any case, one varna is not superior and\n&gt; &gt; another varna is not inferior. People of different varnas serve different\n&gt; &gt; purposes. It is as simple as that. What we see today - bias, mistrust,\n&gt; &gt; fights and killings in the name of caste - are an unfortunate consequence of\n&gt; &gt; deepening Kali.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I am saying is not accepted in mainstream society today because we are\n&gt; &gt; deeply into Kali yuga. But, when the Mother decides, social notions can\n&gt; &gt; change quickly. In fact, we are going through a phase of huge global\n&gt; &gt; transformation. Political, economoic, social and religious structures of the\n&gt; &gt; world will be redefined during the coming decades and will remain valid for\n&gt; &gt; many centuries.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BTW, when the divine Mother appeared before my guru in March 2006 and gave\n&gt; &gt; a command to spread a simple homam ritual in the world for the coming times,\n&gt; &gt; her clear directive was to not differentiate based on caste, creed, class\n&gt; &gt; and race. We encourage anybody who desires to worship any god in fire for\n&gt; &gt; spiritual progress to perform homam on a regular basis using the homam\n&gt; &gt; manuals at the homam website (see below).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also if a person born in low cast is that mean he will receive less grace\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; GOD & a pesron who belongs to high cast has abundance of it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rather than caste, environment in which one grows up does have a role (and\n&gt; &gt; caste does sometimes influence the family environment in India). One born in\n&gt; &gt; a family (brahmana or otherwise) that worships god everyday is exposed to\n&gt; &gt; that notion. One brought up in a family that cares a little about god or\n&gt; &gt; morality and pursues money or power or comforts ruthlessly is exposed that\n&gt; &gt; notion. So the religious/spiritual aspects of the environment in which one\n&gt; &gt; grows up do play a role. However, if one has strong vasanas, they will\n&gt; &gt; eventually take hold. One will meet people who make those vasanas flourish\n&gt; &gt; and those vasanas take control.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- sudhir junonikar &lt;sudhirjunonikar@...&lt;http://in.mc949.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=sudhirjunonikar%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste all gurujanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since childhood i am wandering to have answers to my question, they seems\n&gt; &gt; to be foolish to scholars like you but as lay man I am carrying it with me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Our society is discriminated in to various cast, does our veda support\n&gt; &gt; this cast system?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If we consider that doshas/papam is associated if we make such\n&gt; &gt; discrimination then why it is not taken in to account.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since thousand&#39;s of years people are treated badly even animals were\n&gt; &gt; treated well.
