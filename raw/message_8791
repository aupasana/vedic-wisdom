It can satiate your hunger, but you\n&gt; always know, that someth=\r\ning was missing. A sookha fulka is a little less\n&gt; joyous to eat than one w=\r\nith ghee. Don&#39;t use the word &#39;dosha&#39; it will\n&gt; drive people away. It is not=\r\n a dosha. Mr Agni likes the offering with\n&gt; ghee, he prefers it that way, b=\r\nut accepts it otherwise too. Not offering\n&gt; with ghee does not result in a =\r\n&#39;dosha&#39; in the traditional sense of the\n&gt; word. See, the person who said th=\r\nat it results in &#39;dosha&#39; might have a\n&gt; very different definition of this w=\r\nord, to the one that many will\n&gt; comprehend. For him/her, it might be regul=\r\nar usage for a simple &#39;fault&#39;,\n&gt; for somebody reading it might be &quot; OMFG, W=\r\nhat the hell have I done? I\n&gt; did a Dosha for so long!!&quot; Oh well, calm down=\r\n. Even if you committed a\n&gt; dosha, what the hell have you been doing when y=\r\nou are reading that\n&gt; &quot;anagyatam, yadagyatam, yagasya kriyte mithu....&quot; sec=\r\ntion. You are\n&gt; apologizing specifically to Mr Agni, aren&#39;t you? Thus you h=\r\nave already\n&gt; said sorry for this, so next time onwards, just put a little =\r\nghee to\n&gt; whatever you offer. it helps Mr Agni, to carry it forward or to a=\r\nccept\n&gt; it depending on the situation, and as you are hosting him it is you=\r\nr\n&gt; paramount duty to take care of him when he comes. He comes and actually=\r\n\n&gt; does a favor to you. Revere him, he tolerates our foolishness and\n&gt; igno=\r\nrance and does not burn our house/us down in anger  ( very capable\n&gt; of doi=\r\nng so ), thus help him out and treat him with honor. He is a\n&gt; living being=\r\n. being hot is his nature, I am not talking about Paris\n&gt; hilton waala &quot;hot=\r\n&quot; here. An offering with ghee, helps him out when\n&gt; compared to a dry one, =\r\nbut he still accepts the latter, but prefers the\n&gt; former.\n&gt; \n&gt;     * Regar=\r\nding the ratios and everything else ----\n&gt; A purusha-acharana is too comple=\r\nx and requires an extreme amount of\n&gt; discipline to complete. Concepts deta=\r\niling to mantra siddhi and all\n&gt; that, but walk on to these paths when the =\r\nbasics are there. The best\n&gt; part is , when the basics are complete, god wi=\r\nll automatically graduate\n&gt; you tot his level, it might take 10 days, or 10=\r\n years, or 10 months, who\n&gt; the hell knows apart from Mr god a.k.a the form=\r\n of your god you are\n&gt; worshiping? Anyone doing a simple homam, like many a=\r\nre, need not worry\n&gt; about the ratios AS OF NOW. If a stage comes later, th=\r\nat you become\n&gt; &quot;big&quot; enough to apply some rules to your penance, or maybe =\r\nyou are\n&gt; headed down some specific route, and you need to do it as per\n&gt; i=\r\nnstructions from your teacher( god )/ or aadesh from inside, do it. If\n&gt; yo=\r\nu are getting confused with 10 times then one, or 100 times then one\n&gt; or w=\r\nhat om and what tarpyami or what swaha..... chuck it. Just offer the\n&gt; mant=\r\nra in the fire, with utter sincerity and forget that you ever\n&gt; offered too=\r\n. If you are to be taken on a path that requires the ratios,\n&gt; you will be =\r\ntaken, no issues. Till then, keep offering the single\n&gt; repetition just lik=\r\ne, you are now. Unless and until, significant penance\n&gt; is done, theory abo=\r\nut ratios and how it all works, will go over our\n&gt; heads, and confuse even =\r\nfurther. It is useless to discuss it, will only\n&gt; give rise to more debates=\r\n and confusion galore. Spend time chanting\n&gt; instead.\n&gt; \n&gt;     * One more p=\r\nointer, since I think I read somewhere as to how we can\n&gt; improve our homam=\r\ns. Offer any thing to the fire with love, I sometimes\n&gt; notice, people thro=\r\nwing stuff in, or maybe due to the fear of getting\n&gt; burnt, pulling the han=\r\nd away extremely quickly. Remember you are feeding\n&gt; someone, and that some=\r\none is an extremely ALIVE being, the one who sits\n&gt; in front of you and mak=\r\nes you sweat. You ever notice how a mother feeds\n&gt; her child bites of food,=\r\n even though the fingers are always at risk of\n&gt; getting bitten and coming =\r\nback with a coat of gooey saliva? Thore se\n&gt; pyaar se, feed Mr Agni, he wil=\r\nl appreciate it. He always does. Maybe you\n&gt; can modify your hand movement =\r\nand integrate some grace in the way an\n&gt; offering is made, doesn&#39;t matter e=\r\nven if it is made from a distance. It\n&gt; can take some time getting used to,=\r\n practice makes perfect!\n&gt;     * A sub pointer in improving your homam is t=\r\nhe appreciation of the\n&gt; fact of the suffering of the offering! Bow down to=\r\n your golas , the tils\n&gt; , the mithai,  the ghee, &quot;spiritual progress tumha=\r\nari, jalegi humari&quot;\n&gt; seems to be the chant from whatever you are offering!=\r\n! LOL . Mind you,\n&gt; somebody is jumping straight in to Mr agni&#39;s mouth on y=\r\nour behest, the\n&gt; gola nariyaal you so gladly cut inside out, ouch the pain=\r\n!! Because\n&gt; those too are manifestations of the same divine and their sacr=\r\nifice is\n&gt; supreme, thus bow down and sincerely thank god for manifesting a=\r\nnd\n&gt; providing you the material to do this wonderful ritual.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ram Ram\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; -- Baccha Singh\n&gt; \n&gt; Now watch this and laugh your ass off.\n&gt; http://ww=\r\nw.youtube.com/watch?v=3DntQkgeko_i8\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Jay bhai,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Aaapne chopdi na thotha bahu vaanchya ane bahu dahi dahi vato kari ne\n&gt; p=\r\nravachan aapya.
