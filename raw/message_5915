I have no ill intent \nagainst the holistic science and rather ha=\r\nve great regards towards the &quot;actual \ntrue science&quot;. This thought provoking=\r\n (&quot;atleast per myself&quot;) mail is on the \ncurrent state of astrology and is n=\r\not intended to hurt anyone.\n\nAnd before I proceed further, I would love to =\r\nrewrite a few well known facts as \nunder: -\n\n- Best of astrologers have a s=\r\nuccess rate of less than 75% over their life time.\n- These days, a lot (if =\r\nnot most) of &quot;practicing&quot; astrologers have not even \nlearnt astrology from =\r\nauthentic sources.\n- There is lot of money laundering going on in the name =\r\nof astrological \nremedies.\n- All good astrologers believe that there are de=\r\nfinitely some missing parts of \nactual science and current knowledge is inc=\r\nomplete if not corrupt.\n- And there are several examples where, very &quot;respe=\r\ncted and learned&quot; astrologers \nof the day themselves have failed marriage&quot;s=\r\n&quot;, or problem with progenies or so \non.\n- If SSS Vs Drik debate is won by S=\r\nSS, that would pose serious questions on most \nof the predictions made in l=\r\nast so many years.\n\n\n- Unfortunately despite all this, predictions are give=\r\nn day-in and day-out by \n&quot;astrologers&quot; of the day.\n\nWith this background, I=\r\n would like to begin my article. The sole idea is that if \nwe known from we=\r\nll within that the science we are practicing can be incorrect, \nincomplete =\r\nor corrupt and our accuracy is not better than 50% (average of most \nastrol=\r\nogers and not the best ones) which is as good as simple probability; then \n=\r\nare we really doing the right thing. Few may argue that they do it for free=\r\n and \ntreat it as social service while for those who are charging will come=\r\n up with \ngreat success stories of their own. I dont want to get into any d=\r\nebate but just \nwant people to be honest to themselves and ask themselves. =\r\n\n\nI dont want to sound offensive but just want to bring in the realization.=\r\n A lot \nof people approach astrologers in very rough times of their lives. =\r\nAnd with \ncurrent state of astrology the prediction they get are somewhat e=\r\nxpected. The \nastrologer would &quot;somehow&quot; explain the current conditions eve=\r\nn if one is running \nthe best dasha of his life (per astrologer&#39;s own knowl=\r\nedge) and would even \nsuggest a remedy too. And after the remedy is done, t=\r\nhe help seeker is being \ncheated of his faith as well as money. \n\nA lot of =\r\npeople in India get married based on chart matching. And a thousand \nastrol=\r\nogers are available in every city for a task. And still a lot of marriages =\r\n\nfail badly. And then, &quot;they&quot; say that was destiny. I know of a friend who =\r\n\nvisited several astrologers for matching his chart with her fiancee. And \n=\r\neveryone was so convinced of a great alliance. And one year later, divorce =\r\nwas \nbeing discussed seriously. So, he approached more astrologers and all =\r\nof them \nfound something or other wrong with the charts and said this was d=\r\nue. He asked \nthem very honestly a very simple question, had I not told you=\r\n of the latest \ndevelopments, had you still figured out those problems. And=\r\n the honest ones did \nreally admit the truth.\n\nAll I want to bring out is t=\r\nhat firstly the knowledge is definitely not complete \nas of today and secon=\r\ndly that the &quot;majority&quot; that is practicing it today doesnt \nhave the requir=\r\ned qualities (ability, sincerity, &quot;purity&quot; etc) to do it. Please \nsee for y=\r\nourselves that actually how much good have you done to other&#39;s lives by \nyo=\r\nur holy practice. A tough question to answer is, &quot;Does astrology of today d=\r\noes \nany good to anyone&quot;? And ofcourse I mean the querist and not the astro=\r\nloger who \nis making a lot of money out of it. Even teaching astrology has =\r\nbecome such a \nprosperous business. Rather astrology is also catching up as=\r\n a fashion these \ndays.\n\nThe actual intent is not to criticize the astrolog=\r\ny or demoralize the truthful \nsouls practicing it with uttermost sincerity.=\r\n The intent is to provoke a few \npeople (or a lot) to realize the danger th=\r\ney possess to society with their \n&quot;impure&quot; knowledge. My humble request to =\r\nthose, who agree with me, stop \npracticing it unless you are sure of it. On=\r\ne may keep researching but predicting \nis a serious business IMHO.\n\nRegards=\r\n,\n\n\r\n--0-1039519138-1299917627=:55297\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, se=\r\nrif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Respected Fellow members,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;Before I proceed on this, let me put the disclaimer first.
