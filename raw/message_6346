Bring god, Reverence, devotion in every aspect of daily li=\r\nfe. \n2. Treat and see everything as god and actively develop the devotion f=\r\nor God, in form of that moment/thing/object/people. \n\n3. Maybe add a short =\r\nmantra &quot;narayan-narayan&quot; here and there in whole day when you come across t=\r\nhat devotional moment. This mantra will help tie the whole perspective to t=\r\nhe mantra itself. (Correct me if I am wrong)\n4. Develop perception, awarene=\r\nss =96 devotion, surrender will automatically come.\n\nOne more aspect that y=\r\nou mentioned before in other post, also mentioned in gospel of ramakrishan.=\r\n \n5. Ultimately one has to merge his sense of &quot;i-ness&quot; with god, but you do=\r\n need to keep your &quot;I-ness&quot; to function in this world. The best way to do t=\r\nhat is to see yourself as loving caretaker/servant of your lord. This way t=\r\nhis &quot;I-ness&quot; looses the ego and brings in devotion.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nYesterday I d=\r\nid read that proper method is to read NH-LH-NH, and I wasted good 3-4 hrs y=\r\nest deciding what should I do, I couldn&#39;t decide, got frustrated and I left=\r\n it there. \n((2 things did flash in my mind which I recall now \n1. If you w=\r\nant to read daily add the beej mantra (mukha, pada, etc) of LH at the end. =\r\n \n2. Read LH in English, understanding the meaning on Friday night, \nI thou=\r\nght what a silly thought to read NH in Sanskrit daily and LH in English on =\r\nFriday night))\n\nToday When I finished simple narayan homam with 108 &quot;on nam=\r\no narayanye&quot; there was a strong urge to pick and simply read it form NH vin=\r\niyog (not the LNH viniyog at starting) till shloka 27. After \nThis reading =\r\nin homam it somehow didn&#39;t even cross my mind till I saw your note that LH =\r\nis supposed to follow.\n\nNow that you brought it up, I felt like checking th=\r\ne viniyog part of each. I am surprised to see the difference in the name of=\r\n sages and devata\n\n1. Narayan Laxmi Hrudaya\nAsya Lakshmi Narayana Hrudaya s=\r\ntothra maha manthrasya,\nBharghavan rishi,\nAnushtup Chanda,\nLakshmi Narayano=\r\n devatha.\nNarayana preethyartham jape viniyoga\n\n2.

Let me know i=\r\nf you feel I should not read it separately.\n\n\n* * * \n\nI am kind of surprise=\r\nd and inspired that you did sadhana with LNH and got such intense results. =\r\nI have read all of your posts for last 3yrs in this group and I dont think =\r\nyou ever mentioned LNH or this result. \n\nIts inspiring and humbling to see =\r\nthe sadhana, attitude and results. My regards to the devi within you.\n\nNow =\r\nthat I have switched to simpler 108 &quot;on namo narayanaye&quot; homam, I am able t=\r\no connect to fire in a much bigger way. I can vouch for what you wrote \n\n&quot;W=\r\nhen one does homam with a prayer one has a deep connection to, when one is =\r\nable to identify with (or relate to) the prayer, when one brings feeling to=\r\n one&#39;s prayer, and when one is focused very well and has a good level of de=\r\nvotion, anything is possible with fire!&quot;\n\n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste P=\r\nriyank ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How does one directly generate immense love/devotion/surr=\r\nender? it \n&gt; &gt; will be\n&gt; &gt; nice if you can share your learning on this.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; If you love yourself, your body, your titles, your status, your honor, \n&gt;=\r\n your family, your nation etc, your ability to love god will be \n&gt; minimize=\r\nd. If you de-focus the mind from all these things and focus it \n&gt; on god, y=\r\nou can love god more. Please note than I am not talking about \n&gt; intentiona=\r\nlly ignoring or mistreating any of these. After all, they too \n&gt; are a smal=\r\nl aspect of god. But, stop the over-focus of the mind on these \n&gt; things. D=\r\no what needs to be done to sustain them, but do not focus the \n&gt; mind overl=\r\ny on them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whatever you see, think of and do, bring god into it. For e=\r\nxample, \n&gt; suppose you are taking bath. Think of water as an aspect of god.=\r\n Be \n&gt; thankful to it and pour it on yourself with reverence and a sense of=\r\n \n&gt; sacredness. Suppose you are eating food. Think of food as an aspect of =\r\n\n&gt; god. Be grateful to it and consume it with reverence and a sense of \n&gt; s=\r\nacredness. Suppose you are discussing something with a friend. Think of \n&gt; =\r\nthe friend as an aspect of god and deal with him with a sense of \n&gt; sacredn=\r\ness. Suppose you are writing a software program on the computer. \n&gt; Think o=\r\nf the computer and the work you do as an aspect of god and \n&gt; approach it w=\r\nith reverence and a sense of sacredness. This attitude can \n&gt; be extended t=\r\no every activity.\n&gt; \n&gt; When you do homam, think that god is indeed in the f=\r\nire. Be thankful to \n&gt; fire and to god. Whatever you offer and chant, do it=\r\n with feeling. If \n&gt; you start identifying god in every perception, thought=\r\n and action and \n&gt; bring awareness of god to every moment of your life, you=\r\n will realize \n&gt; the infinite nature of god and love, devotion and surrende=\r\nr will \n&gt; automatically come.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In this situa=\r\ntion i cant help questioning whether i am doing \n&gt; &gt; homam/puja/devotion\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; or he is getting it all done.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good thinking! He is getting it done i=\r\nn reality. But, if there is a \n&gt; sense of ownership inside you, then you ar=\r\ne doing it for all practical \n&gt; purposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ponder over this carefully: =\r\nGod is in everyone and does everything, but \n&gt; god gets things done through=\r\n a person, *in accordance with* the \n&gt; conditioning of that person. God mak=\r\nes each person experience good and \n&gt; bad things, *in accordance with* what=\r\n good and bad things he had earlier \n&gt; got done through that person. Our co=\r\nnditioning influences what we do and \n&gt; what we do influence what results w=\r\ne experience. As long as we take \n&gt; different experiences differently and p=\r\nrefer some experiences to some \n&gt; others (despite pretending outwardly that=\r\n we do not care), we do have \n&gt; some rawness (conditioning) left and need t=\r\no use free will to overcome \n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, Naray=\r\nana Hridayam is very very powerful. Ideally, you are supposed \n&gt; to chant L=\r\nakshmi Hridayam after Narayana Hridayam and not just chant \n&gt; Narayana Hrid=\r\nayam. Even if you repeat it many times, you are supposed to \n&gt; chant Lakshm=\r\ni Hridayam after Narayana Hridayam each time. This is what \n&gt; tradition dem=\r\nands. Basically, Narayana is the Supreme Cosmic Self and \n&gt; Lakshmi is the =\r\nmanifested world arising out of Self. You cannot ignore \n&gt; the latter and o=\r\nnly focus on the former.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Out of so many praye=\r\nrs I know, Narayana Hridayam-Lakshmi Hridayam is the \n&gt; one I feel the most=\r\n attraction to.\n&gt; \n&gt; I spent a Friday in 2010 navaratris chanting Narayana =\r\nHridayam and \n&gt; Lakshmi Hridayam for a whole day. I started long before sun=\r\nrise, \n&gt; finished my daily Chandi homam and then started a long homam with =\r\n\n&gt; Narayana Hridayam and Lakshmi Hridayam. I kept repeating them and did \n&gt;=\r\n homam till 2:30 pm or so (I did not count how many times I repeated \n&gt; the=\r\nm. It is better that way!). I had two fistfuls of food and then went \n&gt; bac=\r\nk. Instead of homam now, I spent the second half of the day chanting \n&gt; Nar=\r\nayana Hridayam and Lakshmi Hridayam. I continued till the night. \n&gt; (Spendi=\r\nng one whole day doing a specific mantra or prayer like this is a \n&gt; nice s=\r\nadhana and others may consider it.)\n&gt; \n&gt; It was very nice, especially when =\r\nI was doing homam. A very nice and \n&gt; intense state, where it feels like ev=\r\nery part of my body and mind is \n&gt; about to explode into an unlimited state=\r\n (it is tough to describe and \n&gt; find the right words), which I experienced=\r\n before only when in deep \n&gt; meditation with a still body, was experienced =\r\nfor the first time while I \n&gt; was moving and my eyes were wide open! In fac=\r\nt, that state lasted a long \n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; When one does homam with a prayer=\r\n one has a deep connection to, when one \n&gt; is able to identify with (or rel=\r\nate to) the prayer, when one brings \n&gt; feeling to one&#39;s prayer, and when on=\r\ne is focused very well and has a \n&gt; good level of devotion, anything is pos=\r\nsible with fire!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for s=\r\nhort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;   =\r\n    Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish w=\r\nritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                   =\r\n    Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
