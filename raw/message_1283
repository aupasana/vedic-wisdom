On the Ve=\r\ndic side, Rudra namakam and Gayatri \n&gt; mantra are very very powerful mantra=\r\ns and they are offered in \nhomam. \n&gt; On the Tantrik side, Pratyangira mantr=\r\na, Mahasudarsana mantra, \n&gt; Paashupata mantra etc=C2=A0are very very powerf=\r\nul astra mantras=C2=A0and \n&gt; they are offered in homam.

The \n&gt; experience given by a mantra a=\r\nnd the internal/external results \n&gt; brought by a mantra vary from mantra to=\r\n mantra. But, even with a \n&gt; very powerful mantra, one needs to be ready fo=\r\nr the mantra to \n&gt; actually work.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; When one is able to perfec=\r\ntly control the mind and *fill it* \nwith \n&gt; a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but =\r\nthe mantra reverberating in the \nmind \n&gt; constantly), then one experiences =\r\nthe mantra. This perfect \n&gt; absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra=\r\n then causes internal \n&gt; changes by the flow of energy internally in specif=\r\nic ways \n(specific \n&gt; to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external=\r\n changes in \nthe \n&gt; universe and corresponding karmic interactions between =\r\nvarious \n&gt; objects. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; There may be thousands of paths to clim=\r\nb a mountain. Each path \n&gt; takes one to a different spot atop the mountain.=\r\n The view one has \n&gt; from the top may be different accordingly. One view ma=\r\ny be more \n&gt; breathtaking and amazing than another. However, one taking a p=\r\nath \n&gt; leading to a breathtaking view and one taking a path leading to a \n&gt;=\r\n normal view both have to struggle on their paths and reach the top \n&gt; desp=\r\nite obstacles. Some paths may be slightly shorter, but none is \n&gt; too easy.=\r\n All paths are difficult to walk, but some result in a \nmore \n&gt; breathtakin=\r\ng view than the others.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, one chanting a &quot;powerful =\r\nmantra&quot; and a &quot;normal \nmantra&quot; \n&gt; will both have to put in effort and overc=\r\nome the weaknesses and \nget \n&gt; control over mind. The power of the powerful=\r\n mantra refers to a \nmore \n&gt; powerful experience after one succeeds with th=\r\ne mantra (more \n&gt; breathtaking scenery on reaching the mountain top). It is=\r\n not \n&gt; correct to think that things will happen automatically and easily \n=\r\n&gt; because one if chanting a powerful mantra 11 (or whatever) times.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Coming back to Rajarshi&#39;s question, =\r\nI do not recommend homam \nwith \n&gt; Kunjika stotra. Kunjika stotra is a coded=\r\n stotra containing \nseveral \n&gt; mantras in coded form. It is not what it may=\r\n seem to be. It is for \na \n&gt; reason that Shiva tells Parvati that this pray=\r\ner should be hidden \n&gt; like one&#39;s privates. It is weird that we are discuss=\r\ning such a \n&gt; secretive mantra on a public forum. It is a collection of pow=\r\nerful \n&gt; mantras for specific prayogas that would be considered \n&gt; raajasik=\r\n/taamasik unless a realized soul without attachment to the \n&gt; actions is ac=\r\nting them out as an instrument of the Divine.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I see no point=\r\n in wanting to do homam with it. If you are meant \nto \n&gt; do a homam with Ku=\r\nnjika stotra to stop the army of a country in \n&gt; their tracks or kill someo=\r\nne or delude someone etc and if you are \n&gt; detached enough to carry it off =\r\nsuccessfully, then you will be \ngiven \n&gt; an opportunity by nature to learn =\r\nit and do it. Otherwise, why \neven \n&gt; try?\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; My advice is to d=\r\nrop the idea of doing a homam with Kunjika \n&gt; stotra. Just stick to saptash=\r\nati (700 verses). If that is too long \n&gt; for you, try saptashloki (7 verses=\r\n) or just the 4th chapter or \njust \n&gt; the 11th chapter. Another option is t=\r\no do a homam with just the \n&gt; moola mantra (navaakshari) .\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nf one can pronounce the 8 verses of Devi sooktam well,=C2=A0a homam \n&gt; with=\r\n Devi sooktam is a great idea too.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; A few mails from the last couple of weeks are pending reply.
