I wil=\r\nl tolerate different views, as long as they are expressed in a scholarly fa=\r\nshion and in a calm tone. But, do consider not leaving. You can just ignore=\r\n the person whose writings you find offensive. It is fine if you want to ar=\r\ngue with him also. My only constraint is to engage in a scholarly way and a=\r\ns impersonally and coolly as possible (e.g. see Ajit Krishnan&#39;s mails).\n \n*=\r\n        *        *\n \nNamaste Ajit,\n \n&gt; Most people put divine avataras on a=\r\n pedestal so that they need not\n&gt; attempt to emulate them. Your logic on th=\r\ne other hand, seems to want\n&gt; to bring them down simply to condemn them, un=\r\nder the pretense of being\n&gt; even-handed. Unfortunately, your logic stinks o=\r\nf under-handedness.\n \nI have in fact not seen any &quot;logic&quot; - I have only see=\r\nn &quot;views&quot; of a strongly opinionated person.\n \nEven when Lord Krishna roamed=\r\n earth, there were people who took pleasure in condemning him. Then, what t=\r\no say of Shankara thousands of years after he left earth?\n \n&gt; Let us take h=\r\nim as an ordinary puruSha. Anyone who has read even a\n&gt; portion of his work=\r\ns will see a highly logical intellect. He is\n&gt; extremely consistent and tho=\r\nrough in his writings.\n \nYou are absolutely correct. He is the most prolifi=\r\nc and significant scholar and spiritual writer of Kali yuga so far, though =\r\nthere may be some who disagree with his philosophy. He commented on a cruci=\r\nal body of scriptures. He wrote many brilliantly composed prayers. He estab=\r\nlished mutts which are still giving rise to great scholars and/or yogis. Th=\r\nis is no ordinary man.\n \nIn fact, world badly needs somebody like him again=\r\n. Just as a pholosophy that emphasized renunciation and de-emphasized actio=\r\nn was about to take over the world at the time of Shankara, which Shankara =\r\nput brakes on, similarly I see that a pholosophy that emphasizes action and=\r\n de-emphasizes renunciation is taking over the world now. Religious people =\r\nsee &quot;enemies&quot; in other religions or other sects in the same religion, but I=\r\n see materialism as a serious enemy for all religions at this point in hist=\r\nory. Placed on a high pedestal by rational thinking and vogue intellectuali=\r\nsm, this materialism threatens to swallow all religions in the coming gener=\r\nations, unless we put brakes on it.\n \n&gt; &gt; With omputer facilities - it is a=\r\n likely that what people took 12\n&gt; &gt; years in Shankara&#39;s times can be learn=\r\nt by kids in 3 months.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, you will be able to provide examples of peo=\r\nple whose skill can\n&gt; rival a traditional 12-year-Pandita within 3 months? =\r\nI truly wish you\n&gt; the best of luck.\n \nComputers, internet and connectivity=\r\n bring some advantages, but bring some disadvantages too. In any case, the =\r\nabove claim is laughable.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI learnt Sanskrit when yo=\r\nung, when I was 9-11 years of age. By the age of 11, I had two BA degrees i=\r\nn Sanskrit (Sanskrita Bhasha Kovida and Sanskrita Bhasha Visharada), one of=\r\n them with distinction (i.e. above 80% score). I could write intelligent co=\r\nmmentary in Sanskrit on the works of Kalidasa, Bhasa, Bharavi etc. At 10, I=\r\n could compose poetry in classical Sanskrit metres like ancients did. When =\r\nI saw new words, I could instinctively come up with the etymology and I was=\r\n always correct. I could understand various slokas and prayers fully the ve=\r\nry first time I read/heard them. Sanskrit was almost like a mother tongue t=\r\no me by the time I was 11. \n \nNow, I see children of this generation who ar=\r\ne in 10-20 age group. I absolutely cannot see them amassing the kind of sch=\r\nolarship I did when I was 9-11 years, though they are as smart as I was. Th=\r\ney are computer savvy, but they do not learn anything in depth. They are go=\r\nod at context switching and multi-tasking, but they are bad at focusing on =\r\none thing and mastering it. They can work with ten windows on a computer or=\r\n five devices in front of them at the same time, but they have a problem fo=\r\ncusing on one thing for a long time. Computers and technology are helpful, =\r\nbut they also distract them...\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn any case, the key=\r\n to learning anything, especially Sanskrit, is discipline and focus. Comput=\r\ners can bring neither. All they can do is provide access to info. BTW, comp=\r\nuters and internet today mix good knowledge with junk and present them toge=\r\nther. There is a lot of junk information out there!\n \nWell-meaning but over=\r\nzealous people, whose credentials can never be verified, can self-promote o=\r\nn the internet and create the toxic dish called pseudo-scholarship by addin=\r\ng the spice of fancy speculation to their half-baked learning. It may be ta=\r\nken as pramaana by some people not knowing better. Computers and Internet c=\r\nome with their own risk..\n \n*        *        *\n \nNamaste smartxpark,\n \n&gt; l=\r\nakShmi - the godess of weatlth and prosperity. The first part is [lakSh] me=\r\naning objective . In\n&gt; this one word is the truth of finance and human ende=\r\navour. And the entire science of management.\n&gt;\n&gt; Objective - first; Strateg=\r\ny to achieve the objective, Tactics to implement the strategy- Operations t=\r\no\n&gt; undertake activities according to some operational plan. Each of these =\r\nlayers have objectives or [lakShya]\n&gt;\n&gt; In short without [lakShya] lakShmi =\r\nmay bid you good bye. Related also is taking your own inventory and\n&gt; not o=\r\nthers. Successful busines take their own inventory very well and get rid of=\r\n junk as soon as possible.\n \nActually, lakSh does not mean objective. The w=\r\nord lakShya means objective. Without ya, lakSh only means &quot;to notice, to ob=\r\nserve, to perceive&quot;. Moreover, lakShmI comes from &quot;lakShma[n]&quot;, which means=\r\n a mark or token or symbol, typically of excellence or something good. Laks=\r\nhmi is the giver of tokens and symbols of excellence. Money, food, vehicles=\r\n, kingdom, knowledge, bravery, children etc are all symbols/tokens/marks of=\r\n excellence and well-being. Lakshmi in her various forms (dhana lakShmI, dh=\r\naanya lakShmI, vaahana lakShmI, raajya lakShmI, vidyaa lakShmI, vikrama lak=\r\nShmI, santaana lakShmI etc) is the giver of these. THAT is the correct deri=\r\nvation of the name lakShmI and not what you gave.\n \nBecause of your questio=\r\nnable understanding that Lakshmi shows business and money and because of yo=\r\nur notions (conditioning) about the qualities a good businessman needs to h=\r\nave, you ended up coming up with a questionable etymology, where consonant =\r\n&quot;m&quot; present in the word has been ignored and consonant &quot;y&quot; has been added.\n=\r\n \n&gt; Why these rules are important - grammar is a boring subject - And if I =\r\nwere not \n \nIt depends. I never found Sanskrit grammar boring and was alway=\r\ns excited by the consistency and logic in it, when I was young and learning=\r\n it.\n \nHowever, I will not try to excite anybody here about grammar. Spirit=\r\nual sadhana is more exciting and far more useful.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI=\r\n am somehow reminded of a small story.\n \nA couple of years back, we went to=\r\n New York city to drop off a senior Indian priest who visited us for a coup=\r\nle of months, at the New York airport. As there was still time for the flig=\r\nht, we went to a small temple. A young priest was chanting Chandipath to an=\r\n audience of just one person in a nice voice. We were happy to hear it. The=\r\n senior priest who was with us was in a 3-year mouna vratam (vow of silence=\r\n) then. BTW, he is about to finish the vratam and start talking again next =\r\nmonth. Anyway, he wrote on a paper and asked us to tell him about our daily=\r\n Chandi homam. So we told him that I do a Chandi homam everyday. He asked i=\r\nf I do the entire Saptashati. I said yes. He was surprised. To gauge my spe=\r\ned and judge how long it takes, he asked me to read a few verses. I was amu=\r\nsed, but read a few verses. He complimented me saying my pronunciation was =\r\nvery good. The senior priest who was with us likes me very much and fondly =\r\ncalls me &quot;guruji&quot;. He likes telling people good things about me, even in my=\r\n presence. He wrote on the paper asking other people with us to tell the yo=\r\nung priest about Guruji&#39;s (my) Sanskrit scholarship. So they told him I was=\r\n a Sanskrit scholar. That young priest asked me what I studied and kept get=\r\nting technical. I knew where it was going and kept answering tersely, tryin=\r\ng to end it. Finally, he started discussing Sanskrit grammar. I was not rea=\r\nlly interested. He was doing Chandipath before and then he got distracted i=\r\nnto Sanskrit grammar! If he wanted to discuss (or just chant!) Chandipath o=\r\nr discuss any spiritual matters, I would&#39;ve loved to spend some time with h=\r\nim. If he wanted to leave those and discuss grammar instead, I had no inter=\r\nest. Moreover, it was clear to me that he did not have any questions per se=\r\n or any useful information for me and he simply wanted to show off his own =\r\nscholarship and getting into my scholarship was a license for him to show o=\r\nff his scholarship! What happened later was exactly along those lines.\n \nUn=\r\ncomfortable as I was, one small thought came to me when the senior priest w=\r\nrote something critical about the attitude of that young priest on our way =\r\nout. It takes just a split second for Her to change a person and remove a w=\r\neakness, if and when She decides to do it! After all, I had been exactly li=\r\nke that, wanting to show off my scholarship and various abilities, not so l=\r\nong ago. Theoretical understanding of scriptures does not bring true dispas=\r\nsion. Only when the scriptural knowledge is internalized and one experience=\r\ns the transientness of maayaa first-hand, does one start to develop true di=\r\nspassion. Even then, passion about this and that may return now and then. W=\r\nhy deplore an unhealthy fancy of someone else, when we ourselves had that f=\r\nancy before and when we ourselves have various other fancies even now? Inst=\r\nead of feeling unhappy or disappointed, my mind was filled with compassion =\r\nfor that young priest as we came out.\n \nMy 2 cents of advice to anyone inte=\r\nrested in it is: Scholarship is good, but put it to a positive use. Do not =\r\nshow off to impress someone or for an ego trip. Use it to remove confusion,=\r\n use it to stop someone from creating confusion, and use it when you feel t=\r\nhere is a chance of serving a productive purpose. Otherwise, it is better t=\r\no keep quiet. However, when someone else is showing off or being arrogant/e=\r\ngoistic, ignore as much as you can. Engage only when you are clear about wh=\r\ny and how you are engaging.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sh=\r\nort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n--------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n \n---- Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@gma=\r\nil.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is reason to evaluate the sha~gkara as =\r\nhuman and not deva\n&gt;\n&gt; Most people put divine avataras on a pedestal so tha=\r\nt they need not\n&gt; attempt to emulate them.

The rumour-mill account, which is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; taken as the =\r\nabsolute truth says that Adi shankara saw an old man\n&gt; &gt;&gt; trying to start l=\r\nearning grammar by memorizing the dhAtu-pAtha, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; out of pity, he ins=\r\ntructed him by spontaneously composing 12 verses.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The remaining verses=\r\n are said to be later additions.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (a) It is difficult to justify t=\r\nhe composition of the 2nd verse\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (muuDha jahiihi) and especially diffic=\r\nult to justify the composition\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the 3rd verse (nArii-stana) as an up=\r\nadesha to an old man. If we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; assume that aspects of the traditional acc=\r\nount are true, it is much\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more likely that he recited these verses to =\r\nhis own sannyAsii students\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to cultivate vairAgya in them. Assuming tha=\r\nt you are a non-sannyAsii,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there&#39;s no reason to get riled up about adv=\r\nice that is not primarily\n&gt; &gt;&gt; directed at you.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (b) Adi shankara =\r\nis said to have composed the first 12 stanzas,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; following which, many o=\r\nf his students composed single verses that have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; been now been compiled=\r\n together. It is pretty unlikely that Adi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shankara would have had his =\r\ndisciples (young and old) gang up on an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; old man. It also seems unlikel=\r\ny that his students would have added\n&gt; &gt;&gt; onto a work that was composed for=\r\n someone else&#39;s benefit. In a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; satsanga of rishis, everyone waits for t=\r\nhe main rishi to speak. On the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; other hand, assume that this advice was=\r\n composed and imparted to his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; own students. It is more likely that his=\r\n students might add onto this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; kind of work. Again, there is no reason =\r\nfor you to get riled up about\n&gt; &gt;&gt; advice that is not primarily directed at=\r\n you.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (c) In the best case, the first verse (bhaja govindam) mere=\r\nly provides\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the context. At worst, it is a later addition. The moha-mu=\r\ndgara\n&gt; &gt;&gt; consists of verses 1-12. Let us take the first verse as a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; m=\r\nangala-shloka, rather than excluding it altogether. This stotram is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nwork of contemplation. Though Adi shankara is a master bhakta, this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wo=\r\nrk is not a good example of bhakti. The older name of the stotram\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (moh=\r\na mudgara =3D hammering delusion), is much more reflective of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; work=\r\n that the popular name (bhaja govindam). Across his works, Adi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shankar=\r\na is clear about people needing different solutions at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; different point=\r\ns in their spiritual life. First, they need karma +\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upAsana, and only =\r\nlater should they pursue viveka. Thus, the advice in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his stotra is int=\r\nended primarily for a different crowd. It is unlikely\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that he would ha=\r\nve given this advice to some random stranger. There is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; no reason for y=\r\nou to get riled up about advice that is not primarily\n&gt; &gt;&gt; directed at you.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (d) Now, let us assume that the rumour-mill account is true. As =\r\nyou\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have noted, Adi shankara&#39;s compositions are composed in sanskrit.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Further, it is clear that he is extremely well-versed in grammar. So,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; any conclusion that he is anti-grammar seems strange, and is wrong.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; There is no reason to get riled up over this.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (e) His sampradA=\r\nya safeguards grammar. Just as one example, vyAkaraNa\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is a regular top=\r\nic of discourse in the yearly vAkyArtha-sabhA at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sringeri. It is the s=\r\name institution that is publishing, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; re-publishing various grammati=\r\ncal works. His own disciples, who adorn\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this peeTha, are great scholar=\r\ns of vyAkaraNa. Adi shankara, and his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sampradAya are clearly not anti-=\r\ngrammar. In fact, they are clearly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pro-grammar. So, there is nothing t=\r\no get riled up about.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, let us take the &quot;bhaja govindam&quot; verse=\r\n at face value. I still\n&gt; &gt;&gt; don&#39;t see the problem --\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That there =\r\nis no point in studying the dhAtu-pATha on the death-bed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This makes s=\r\nense. &quot;dvAdasha-varShaiH shruuyate vyAkaraNam&quot;. Grammar is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; learned in =\r\n12 years. What point is there in starting the study on the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; death-bed? =\r\nThis doesn&#39;t mean that vyAkaraNam shouldn&#39;t be studied at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all. All it =\r\nmeans is that desha-kAla-pAtra should be taken into\n&gt; &gt;&gt; account. And, if y=\r\nou want to take things literally, Adi shankara said\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing about gram=\r\nmar in general. In this verse, all he talked about\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was the dhAtu-pATha=\r\n in particular.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; People who truly study the dhAtu pATha these days=\r\n are rare, and I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would expect a disproportionate number of them to con=\r\nsider Adi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shankara as their guru.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=AF=C2=BF=C2=BD =C3=AF=C2=BF=C2=BDajit\n\n\n"}}
