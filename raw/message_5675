E.g. if yantra&#39;s\nwere made what script were they written in?\n\nIs it also=\r\n possible that we lost many precious treasures of knowledge over the\nyears =\r\nas they were not written down? Writing down is somehow similar to burying\na=\r\n pot of gold to be recovered later on, isn&#39;t it?\n\nAlso, if Devanagari was u=\r\nsed later on to write sanskit how come it suddenly\nsprang from Brahmi?
