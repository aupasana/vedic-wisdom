Do they work? I will=\r\n give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and insights. I will be ho=\r\nnest, straight-forward and blunt.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhough believers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their pr=\r\noblems will be solved, many priests today are incapable of producing any re=\r\nsults. As a result, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a puddi=\r\nng exists even without eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And som=\r\ne intelligent people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first=\r\n address why this has come to be and then talk about what we should do.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; In ancient times, caste system was not as rigid as it is today. One&#39;=\r\ns varna was decided based on one&#39;s aptitude. One primarily interested in kn=\r\nowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana. One primarily intereste=\r\nd in power, authority and control over others would be a Kshatriya. One pri=\r\nmarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One primarily interested in p=\r\nhysical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would start off with the varna of =\r\none&#39;s father, as that is what one is exposed to in childhood. However, as o=\r\nne&#39;s vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would get one&#39;s own varna. On=\r\ne born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can later turn into a Braahmana =\r\nand become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for example, c=\r\nan later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In the old d=\r\nays, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be interested in knowledge a=\r\nnd spiritual progress and not caring about power, influence, money, pleasur=\r\nes etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure and accumulated enough spiritual e=\r\nnergy through continuous sadhana over years and were capable of performing =\r\nvery effective poojas for people.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Today, people who have spiritua=\r\nl potential may be born in non-Brahmana families and not allowed to develop=\r\n fully due to the rigid caste structures. Some people born in Brahmana fami=\r\nlies may also end up getting into modern careers and not developing fully a=\r\ns Brahmanas. Some people may be born in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Va=\r\nisya/Shudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests who are interested i=\r\nn power, authority and control over others, money and physical pleasures. T=\r\nhose priests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. tru=\r\ne Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine sa=\r\ndhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If one has one million dollars in one&#39;s ba=\r\nnk account, a check given by one for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one=\r\n&#39;s bank account is empty, what good is a thousand dollar check given by one=\r\n? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done and blessings given by a priest wi=\r\nthout enough spiritual energy cannot bring one any benefits.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; One =\r\nimportant note: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra) or =\r\na sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that FOCU=\r\nSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical action=\r\ns (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to wander =\r\nand instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focu=\r\ns points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. With=\r\nout it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of pr=\r\nactice. Most priests are just engaging in casual practice when they go and =\r\ndo poojas. In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that en=\r\nergy to the table when they did rituals at the houses of people or in templ=\r\nes.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I did see priests who have done good sadhana, purified themse=\r\nlves and carry some spiritual energy. But those are getting rarer and rarer=\r\n now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on finding such a priest.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Given this, one is better off not depen=\r\nding on the priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing against=\r\n the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana fa=\r\nmily myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; cla=\r\nss. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste - develop into =\r\ntrue Brahmanas.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Instead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possibly pr=\r\noud of his skills and thinking about money and possibly not identifying wit=\r\nh your trouble, you can do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your identif=\r\nication with the trouble and your desire to solve the problem will be bette=\r\nr than the priest. If you manage to generate enough focus after practice, t=\r\nhe mantra/ritual may actually produce some result. There is no harm in tryi=\r\nng.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Many people think that poojas t=\r\no gods are a serious matter and only a trained priest should do them. The p=\r\nrocedures have evolved to become quite complicated over the time too!\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; However, complexity of rituals should never be a deterrent. Suppose ru=\r\nles dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams of protein, =\r\nso many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such balanced=\r\n food. Will you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or will you =\r\nmanage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup)=\r\n and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nimilarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you n=\r\need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start with what you kno=\r\nw. It will only give you energy.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the notion that=\r\n some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally baseless=\r\n, but it is irrelevant today.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; It is possible to focus the mind on=\r\n some mantras and rituals and get specific results. When used by someone wi=\r\nth a high level of spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very=\r\n fast and give specific powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hid=\r\nden (almost) such things in this age.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I will give an analogy. A m=\r\nachine gun and a stick can be used to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use,=\r\n but, one using a machine gun needs to be very careful. One needs to learn =\r\nwell, practice well and then use it, lest one should hurt oneself by accide=\r\nnt.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, suppose the house lord purposely removed ammunition =\r\nfrom the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick and not risky. Inst=\r\nead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use the machine gun, just=\r\n take it and start beating your enemies with it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ammunition&quot; has=\r\n purposely been removed from most targeted mantras and rituals (machine gun=\r\ns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect knowledge, one can start usi=\r\nng them right away.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A lot of technicalities related to mantras an=\r\nd rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to be taken up with=\r\n faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicalities one can real=\r\nistically follow should be followed and emphasis should be placed on devoti=\r\non and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one&#39;s devotion and=\r\n focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may come.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Giv=\r\nen that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we cannot expect specif=\r\nic results to come in specific counts of recitation. So we should just do t=\r\nhe best job we can and leave the result to god, who decides when and what r=\r\nesult should be given.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in =\r\nthe end. Every sincere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime o=\r\nr the other!!!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Different mantras an=\r\nd rituals are like begging bowls of different shapes. They matter only so m=\r\nuch. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you use, you may be given dif=\r\nferent kind of alms. But it is important to start begging with some begging=\r\n bowl or the other, instead of spending years looking for the perfect beggi=\r\nng bowl.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or il=\r\nl-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual, do what you=\r\nr heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder you respect) tells you. Ma=\r\nntras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama s=\r\ntotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotr=\r\na, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s as=\r\nhtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga sapt=\r\nashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha s=\r\ntotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotra etc are *generi=\r\nc* and can work for anyone for any purpose.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Do not waste time loo=\r\nking for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc a=\r\nnd just do some sadhana or the other with a sincere heart.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Your e=\r\nffort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or you may overcome you=\r\nr situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus will improve.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In this context, I want to say a few words =\r\nabout homam, the sadhana of rishis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fire ritual is found in many a=\r\nncient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and air, fire is ever=\r\n pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name =\r\nfor fire is paavaka, i.e.  purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has=\r\n access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purifies one&#39;s subtl=\r\ne consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other sadhanas in im=\r\nproving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner personality and removing material=\r\n and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for granted. One can t=\r\nry for oneself for a few months. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regularly, for the benefit o=\r\nf the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece &quot;Brihat Paaraasara Hora=\r\na Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Kali yuga, for guidance to the people=\r\n of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended various types of homam as reme=\r\ndial measures for various problems in the horoscope. In fact, most remedies=\r\n he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to follow whatever procedures=\r\n one was taught for starting fire and did not focus on the nitty gritty of =\r\nhomam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in homam. Parasara&#39;s clear te=\r\nachings set to rest the notion that some people have, that homam is not for=\r\n Kali yuga.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Kr=\r\nishna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I am japa among all sacrifice=\r\ns. Some people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior=\r\n to homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In the line just =\r\nabove that line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;. Howeve=\r\nr, do we only meditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; and leave all other man=\r\ntras?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part o=\r\nf climbing a mountain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it usi=\r\nng various kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process to rea=\r\nch the pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Similar=\r\nly, Om is the supreme of all mantras being the source of all, but reaching =\r\nthe source may require using several mantras first to purify oneself. Medit=\r\nating and absorbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme =\r\nsacrifice, but it may require purification and preparation by engaging in o=\r\nther kinds of sacrifices (hama/yajna).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When one does homam or yaj=\r\nna, one is engaging in external actions and one is unlikely to reach samadh=\r\ni (absorbption in the Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam=\r\n (i.e. sits still and contemplates), one may reach samadhi. However, to pur=\r\nify oneself, homam is far more effective.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; Detailed manuals giving short procedures for doing various types of =\r\nhomam by oneself are available on the website given below. You can use the =\r\nresources on that website to perform several kinds of short homam by yourse=\r\nlf.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Now *hundreds* of people are performing homam by themselves e=\r\nither daily or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When M=\r\nanish (my spiritual guru - a small write-up on him can be read in message 3=\r\n481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom/message/3481) told me that the Divine Mother appeared before him durin=\r\ng Shata Chandi homam at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him to =\r\nspread a simplified homam ritual around the world, and showed him that hund=\r\nreds of thousands of people would be performing regular homam in a few year=\r\ns, thus helping reverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed q=\r\nuite far-fetched to my rational mind.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, just 4 years after=\r\n the Mother&#39;s command, hundreds of people are already performing regular ho=\r\nmam. Though these are just the early days, the developments are amazing. So=\r\nme of them are laymen who never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do =\r\nANY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle that such people are doing a homam eve=\r\nryday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that s=\r\nome people doing homam for a couple of years are actually starting to exper=\r\nience things within and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid =\r\ninternal transformation.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I am neith=\r\ner a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell anything to anyone, nor do I=\r\n force anything on anyone. I just freely share what I know, what I saw and =\r\nwhat I am inspired to share. The rest is not in my hands.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I want =\r\nto respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite those who have even an iota of =\r\ninterest to check out the homam website!
