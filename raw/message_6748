In homam/yajna, =\r\nwe make offerings to \n\nvarious beings living in various worlds. For example=\r\n, in jayadi homam \n\ndone at the end of various homas, we make offerings to =\r\npitris, parvatas, \n\nbhutas, samudras, yakshas etc.\n\n\n\nSecondly, to one who =\r\nsees Shiva as the supreme being, Shiva does not \n\n&quot;live in&quot; one place, but =\r\nhe is the underlying reality of everything.\n\n\n\nThough Shiva is depicted as =\r\nliving in smashana (cemetary) with spirits, \n\nit has esoteric significance.=\r\n I elaborated this in a Sanskrit shloka I \n\ncomposed just a few days back a=\r\nnd you can read it, its meaning and \n\ncommentary at that: \n\nhttp://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/6719\n\n\n\n*        *        *\n\n\n\n&gt; Lord S=\r\nhiva is never ever pleased with homa of any kind or any type. \n\n&gt; Not a sin=\r\ngle\n\n&gt; scriptural reference could be found out\n\n\n\nParasara mentioned making=\r\n offerings to Shiva in fire with &quot;tryambakam \n\nyajaamahe&quot; mantra (Mrityunja=\r\nya mantra) as a remedy to several horoscopic \n\nproblems!!\n\n\n\nVishnu Dharmot=\r\ntara Purana mentioned Rudra Yajna.

What Da=\r\nksha did was to break the rules \n\nby doing a &quot;Nirishwara yajna&quot;. He was try=\r\ning to insult Shiva and he paid \n\nfor it. It is foolish to take his foolish=\r\n act as an example to conclude \n\nthat offerings should not be made to Shiva=\r\n in fire.\n\n\n\n*        *        *\n\n\n\n&gt; Shiva homa is absolute nonsense.

Do homam to \n\nGanapathi, Lakshmi, Vishnu=\r\n, Shiva, Krishna, Chandi etc. Pick somebody \n\nelse. Or don&#39;t do homam at al=\r\nl if you please.\n\n\n\nBTW, I personally know people doing homam to Shiva and =\r\nmaking brisk \n\nspiritual progress.\n\n\n\nIf you really want to &quot;insult and rej=\r\nect&quot; someone, you will be better \n\noff picking someone killing and raping i=\r\nn the name of god or spreading \n\nintolerance and hatred in the name of god =\r\nand religion. Or people \n\nengaging in so many worse evils on earth today. W=\r\nhy target poor people \n\nworshipping Shiva in fire!\n\n\n\n*        *        *\n\n=\r\n\n\n&gt; One should consider himself as luck if he is able to save himself from =\r\n\n\n&gt; self titled\n\n&gt; kalyugi gurus.

If someone \n\nvoluntarily (and mentall=\r\ny) considers me a guru for the purpose of \n\nperforming homam, I do not mind=\r\n it. However, my main role is not to be a \n\nguru, but to show people their =\r\nguru. Let me elaborate.\n\n\n\nPeople who have access to a good external guru t=\r\no give a push to one&#39;s \n\nspiritual progress, they may follow that guru. Oth=\r\nerwise, I am giving \n\nthem access to a superb external guru who will remain=\r\n on earth in a \n\nphysical form even after you and I leave - Agni (Fire), th=\r\ne original \n\npreceptor, guru, priest and purohit of Veda! Invite Agni into =\r\nyour life \n\nas your guru and purohit and spend some sacred time with him ev=\r\neryday \n\nwith reverence. He will transform you from the core and show the c=\r\norrect \n\ndirection. I am not a guru, but I can show you a guru who can chan=\r\nge you \n\nfor better.\n\n\n\nAnd, BTW, I do not sell ANYTHING. So don&#39;t worry ab=\r\nout &quot;falling prey to \n\nmarketing&quot;.

In \n\n&gt; this yu=\r\nga tamo guna exists in predominance and sattva exists in very \n\n&gt; marginal =\r\npotency. As is it impossible to see anything in darkness, \n\n&gt; people in kal=\r\ni yuga engage themselves in all kind of stupid and \n\n&gt; foolish things since=\r\n these their intellect is blinded by the kalyugi \n\n&gt; darkness.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Things=\r\n like erecting huge buildings which are destined to be shattered \n\n&gt; and ru=\r\nined by natural calamities are being considered as object of \n\n&gt; pride. Eve=\r\nn people feel proud to create weapons which are capable of \n\n&gt; destroying w=\r\nhole humanity within fractions of seconds. If one wants to \n\n&gt; be proud of =\r\nanything be proud of an achievement which is not destined \n\n&gt; to be devasta=\r\nted by eternal time.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; People are digging deep into earth to set free a=\r\nll evil sprits \n\n&gt; sleeping in deep realms of hell and using it as fuel as =\r\nthe cost of \n\n&gt; bringing hell on earth. To compensate for the loss these pe=\r\nople have \n\n&gt; come up with a solution of wearing black, consuming alcohol, =\r\ntobacco, \n\n&gt; tea, coffee, chocolate and other such products.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Degenera=\r\nted intellect has bring us to verge in the history that some \n\n&gt; people are=\r\n promoting SHIVA HOMA since years and no one of these so \n\n&gt; called intelle=\r\nctual, scholars and people with wisdom (if anyone left) \n\n&gt; is coming forwa=\r\nrd and asking to stop this irreligious practice.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; It&#39;s very unfortunat=\r\ne that people with no knowledge and understanding \n\n&gt; of divinity are promo=\r\nting their irreligious believes without doing any \n\n&gt; research of ancient I=\r\nndian scriptures and gullible people are easily \n\n&gt; falling pray, more path=\r\netic is that no one is coming forward and say \n\n&gt; that stop this nonsense.\n=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Lord Shiva is never ever pleased with homa of any kind or any type. \n=\r\n\n&gt; Not a single scriptural reference could be found out where nativity \n\n&gt; =\r\nperforms Shiva homa to please lord Shiva. However there are many \n\n&gt; refere=\r\nnces in purans that Lord Shiva was not invited to fire sacrifice \n\n&gt; conduc=\r\nted by Duksha Prajapati.\n\n&gt; Why is it so?\n\n&gt; It is so because lord Shiva wi=\r\nll be accompanied by his ganas who are \n\n&gt; nothing but demons and evil spri=\r\nts and presence of anything impure \n\n&gt; will destroy the fire sacrifice. Thi=\r\nngs which are pure and sacred in \n\n&gt; nature are to be offered into homam pi=\r\nt since it is believed that \n\n&gt; these things will ultimately reach devtas i=\r\nn heaven and nothing impure \n\n&gt; is ever offered to homam pit.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Lord Sh=\r\niva didn&#39;t live in heaven; by performing fire sacrifice one in \n\n&gt; try to s=\r\nend lord shiva to heaven. It is lethal, catastrophic mistake \n\n&gt; and will d=\r\nestroy equilibrium of the cosmos.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Lord Shiva lives in Kalasha parvata=\r\n and the only way to reach it to \n\n&gt; try to offer flowers, raw milk, fruits=\r\n and sweets to shiva lingam. \n\n&gt; Performing rudrabhishakam is the only corr=\r\nect way to please lord \n\n&gt; shiva.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Even in Ramayana lord Rama tries to=\r\n please lord Shiva by worshiping to \n\n&gt; Shiva lingam. Why didn&#39;t he perform=\r\n homa?\n\n&gt; Shiva homa is absolute nonsense. I condemned it completely. All t=\r\nhose \n\n&gt; who perform such irreligious practice will be INSULTED AND REJECTE=\r\nD BY \n\n&gt; EVERYONE.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; It is good if someone is promoting vedic tradition=\r\n of homam but before \n\n&gt; doing so one must properly read religious scriptur=\r\ne to understand that \n\n&gt; which deity can be pleased by performing homa. One=\r\n should also \n\n&gt; understand that since pure cow ghee is not easily availabl=\r\ne and it&#39;s \n\n&gt; rare to find any people with fully activated Pingala nadi; a=\r\nny homam \n\n&gt; will not yield satisfactory results. Purity of material offere=\r\nd into \n\n&gt; homa and purity of the person performing the homa is essential.\n=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; If a person accustomed to alcohol, lying, cheating if perform homa \n\n=\r\n&gt; will only experience malefic results same is true if homam is \n\n&gt; perform=\r\ned with adulterated butter.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; If a person not corrupted by vice perform=\r\n homam with pure cow ghee and \n\n&gt; tries to please deities living in heaven =\r\nsuch as indra, varuna, soma, \n\n&gt; agni, prajapati etc then such a native is =\r\nequivalent(or will soon \n\n&gt; become) to demigods.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Same is true for a b=\r\nrahmachari or a yogi who perform internal homam.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; It is said in all sc=\r\nriptures that all spiritual practices should be \n\n&gt; followed under the guid=\r\nance of a bonafide guru. A native without a \n\n&gt; capable guru is like god wi=\r\nthout power.\n\n&gt; One should consider himself as luck if he is able to save h=\r\nimself from \n\n&gt; self titled kalyugi gurus. Just remember that one who comes=\r\n to you is \n\n&gt; not a true guru. Don&#39;t fall pray to marketing.\n\n&gt;  Its rare =\r\nfortune, that native found a true guru.

Or don&#39;t do=\r\n homam at all if you please.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBTW, I personally know people doing h=\r\nomam to Shiva and making brisk &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progress.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you rea=\r\nlly want to &quot;insult and reject&quot; someone, you will be better &lt;br&gt;\noff pickin=\r\ng someone killing and raping in the name of god or spreading &lt;br&gt;\nintoleran=\r\nce and hatred in the name of god and religion. Or people &lt;br&gt;\nengaging in s=\r\no many worse evils on earth today. Why target poor people &lt;br&gt;\nworshipping =\r\nShiva in fire!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One should consid=\r\ner himself as luck if he is able to save himself from &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; self titled=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; kalyugi gurus. Just remember that one who comes to you is not a t=\r\nrue &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; guru. Don&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fall pray to marketing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nJust fo=\r\nr the record, I do not consider myself a guru. If someone &lt;br&gt;\nvoluntarily =\r\n(and mentally) considers me a guru for the purpose of &lt;br&gt;\nperforming homam=\r\n, I do not mind it. However, my main role is not to be a &lt;br&gt;\nguru, but to =\r\nshow people their guru. Let me elaborate.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPeople who have access t=\r\no a good external guru to give a push to one&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progress, the=\r\ny may follow that guru. Otherwise, I am giving &lt;br&gt;\nthem access to a superb=\r\n external guru who will remain on earth in a &lt;br&gt;\nphysical form even after =\r\nyou and I leave - Agni (Fire), the original &lt;br&gt;\npreceptor, guru, priest an=\r\nd purohit of Veda! Invite Agni into your life &lt;br&gt;\nas your guru and purohit=\r\n and spend some sacred time with him everyday &lt;br&gt;\nwith reverence. He will =\r\ntransform you from the core and show the correct &lt;br&gt;\ndirection. I am not a=\r\n guru, but I can show you a guru who can change you &lt;br&gt;\nfor better.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nAnd, BTW, I do not sell ANYTHING. So don&#39;t worry about &quot;falling prey to =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nmarketing&quot;. Try homam if you want to and continue if you like it. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nPeriod. No strings attached.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish =\r\nSoftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                   &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Films that make a difference: &lt;a =\r\nrel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http:=\r\n//SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n   Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofo=\r\nllow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritin=\r\ngs&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                 =\r\n     Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:Jyotis=\r\nhGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3DJyotis=\r\nhGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Arun Yadav&quot; &l=\r\nt;aruninthecity@...&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nwrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jai Shree Rama,&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear List,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I usually talk about the degenera=\r\ntion of intellect in kali yuga. In &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; this yuga tamo guna exists in =\r\npredominance and sattva exists in very &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; marginal potency. As is it=\r\n impossible to see anything in darkness, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; people in kali yuga enga=\r\nge themselves in all kind of stupid and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; foolish things since thes=\r\ne their intellect is blinded by the kalyugi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; darkness.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Things like erecting huge buildings which are destined to be shatter=\r\ned &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and ruined by natural calamities are being considered as objec=\r\nt of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; pride. Even people feel proud to create weapons which are ca=\r\npable of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; destroying whole humanity within fractions of seconds. I=\r\nf one wants to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; be proud of anything be proud of an achievement wh=\r\nich is not destined &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to be devastated by eternal time.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; People are digging deep into earth to set free all evil sprits &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; sleeping in deep realms of hell and using it as fuel as the cost of &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; bringing hell on earth. To compensate for the loss these people hav=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; come up with a solution of wearing black, consuming alcohol, to=\r\nbacco, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tea, coffee, chocolate and other such products.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Degenerated intellect has bring us to verge in the history that som=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; people are promoting SHIVA HOMA since years and no one of these=\r\n so &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; called intellectual, scholars and people with wisdom (if anyo=\r\nne left) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is coming forward and asking to stop this irreligious pr=\r\nactice.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s very unfortunate that people with no knowled=\r\nge and understanding &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of divinity are promoting their irreligious =\r\nbelieves without doing any &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; research of ancient Indian scriptures =\r\nand gullible people are easily &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; falling pray, more pathetic is tha=\r\nt no one is coming forward and say &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that stop this nonsense.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva is never ever pleased with homa of any kind or any =\r\ntype. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Not a single scriptural reference could be found out where =\r\nnativity &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; performs Shiva homa to please lord Shiva. However there =\r\nare many &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; references in purans that Lord Shiva was not invited to =\r\nfire sacrifice &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; conducted by Duksha Prajapati.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Why is it =\r\nso?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is so because lord Shiva will be accompanied by his ganas w=\r\nho are &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nothing but demons and evil sprits and presence of anythin=\r\ng impure &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will destroy the fire sacrifice. Things which are pure a=\r\nnd sacred in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nature are to be offered into homam pit since it is =\r\nbelieved that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; these things will ultimately reach devtas in heaven=\r\n and nothing impure &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is ever offered to homam pit.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Lord Shiva didn&#39;t live in heaven; by performing fire sacrifice one in &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; try to send lord shiva to heaven. It is lethal, catastrophic mistak=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and will destroy equilibrium of the cosmos.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; L=\r\nord Shiva lives in Kalasha parvata and the only way to reach it to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; try to offer flowers, raw milk, fruits and sweets to shiva lingam. &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Performing rudrabhishakam is the only correct way to please lord &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; shiva.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Even in Ramayana lord Rama tries to please lor=\r\nd Shiva by worshiping to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Shiva lingam. Why didn&#39;t he perform homa=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Shiva homa is absolute nonsense. I condemned it completely. All =\r\nthose &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who perform such irreligious practice will be INSULTED AND =\r\nREJECTED BY &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; EVERYONE.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is good if someone is =\r\npromoting vedic tradition of homam but before &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; doing so one must p=\r\nroperly read religious scripture to understand that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; which deity c=\r\nan be pleased by performing homa. One should also &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; understand that=\r\n since pure cow ghee is not easily available and it&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rare to fin=\r\nd any people with fully activated Pingala nadi; any homam &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will no=\r\nt yield satisfactory results. Purity of material offered into &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hom=\r\na and purity of the person performing the homa is essential.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; If a person accustomed to alcohol, lying, cheating if perform homa &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; will only experience malefic results same is true if homam is &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; performed with adulterated butter.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If a person not cor=\r\nrupted by vice perform homam with pure cow ghee and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tries to plea=\r\nse deities living in heaven such as indra, varuna, soma, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; agni, pr=\r\najapati etc then such a native is equivalent(or will soon &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; become)=\r\n to demigods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Same is true for a brahmachari or a yogi wh=\r\no perform internal homam.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is said in all scriptures th=\r\nat all spiritual practices should be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; followed under the guidance =\r\nof a bonafide guru. A native without a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; capable guru is like god w=\r\nithout power.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One should consider himself as luck if he is able to=\r\n save himself from &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; self titled kalyugi gurus. Just remember that =\r\none who comes to you is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not a true guru. Don&#39;t fall pray to marke=\r\nting.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Its rare fortune, that native found a true guru. Before tha=\r\nt one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; should build a fort strong enough so that one not fall prey=\r\n to kalyugi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gurus.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Arun&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  =\r\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-1005641281-1309842444=:14809--\r\n\n"}}
