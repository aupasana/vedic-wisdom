After all, the main thing is to reach god. As I keep saying again and =\r\nagain, specific advice given by saints may be adopted to their desa-kaala-p=\r\naatra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Things change from time to time and from place to place. For e=\r\nxample, the pervasiveness of sexualized imagery in mainstream media that is=\r\n encountered by people in their daily lives today from a very young age, we=\r\nre not there 120 years back. There are so many changes like that in our env=\r\nironment. What impact do they have on the minds of people and the challenge=\r\ns faced by them in spiritual progress? Will the relevance and usefulness of=\r\n different methods undergo change with time?\n&gt;   \n&gt; People like to stereoty=\r\npe and restrict ideas and concepts to stereotypes. But one need not call on=\r\neself an aghori or engage in all aghora practices to benefit from some idea=\r\ns associated with aghora.\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, whether one uses the front door or bac=\r\nkdoor, the main thing is to reach god inside. If someone has aversion for  =\r\nbackdoor, that&#39;s fine and he can use the front door.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, Ramakrishna did engage in all the 64 practices of tantra, un=\r\nder the guidance of Bhairavi Braahmani who was sent by Trilinga Swami.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Also, Ramakrishna did meet Trilinga Swami in person and fed him rice pudd=\r\ning with his own hands. Aghori Vimalananda also met Trilinga Swami before h=\r\nis life transformed with the darshan of Smashana Tara and said Trilinga Swa=\r\nmi was his guru-bhai (i.e. same lineage). It is a small world with many int=\r\neresting connections.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now on to the thread =\r\nquoted below..\n&gt;  \n&gt; Comment on Rajarshi&#39;s original point:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rina is so=\r\nmething you &quot;owe&quot; and hence &quot;give back&quot;. Rina is all about giving and not t=\r\naking. Most sense gratification people engage in involves more taking than =\r\ngiving. When you &quot;give&quot; something (to others or to universe), you are payin=\r\ng back your debt. When you &quot;take&quot; something (from others or from universe),=\r\n you are creating a new debt that will need to be paid back later. A simple=\r\n formula is &quot;give all you can and do not get worked up if you are not recei=\r\nving enough in return&quot;. Of course, when you have an opportunity to give dif=\r\nferent things to different people and have to pick some, you have to use yo=\r\nur judgment to pick the right ones, to pay off a more important rina with t=\r\nhe little you have!!\n&gt;  \n&gt; The problem is that it is so difficult to give w=\r\nithout getting something back (i.e. pay back old debt and create a new debt=\r\n)! This is true with anything and not just the example of sex you mentioned=\r\n. Of course, when it comes to sex, it may be even more difficult. One may t=\r\nend to think more about one&#39;s own pleasure than partner&#39;s. Even when one th=\r\ninks about partner&#39;s pleasure, it may be with an egoistic focus (&quot;am *I* ab=\r\nle to give pleasure&quot;). Who forgets own pleasure and thinks &quot;I will submit t=\r\no the god in my partner and give as much pleasure as I can to god in this f=\r\norm. My own pleasure does not matter at all and I will not think about it&quot;?=\r\n If one indeed does that successfully, then hardly new rina is created and =\r\nold rina is paid back.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now, forget sex. Even in other things, giving =\r\ngoes hand-in-hand with taking and we often create new rinas. As long as our=\r\n ego remains, we are always pursuing self-gratification in many ways.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Suppose I made a promise to my guru in last life to spread homam and astro=\r\nlogy and created a rina. Or suppose I undermined them in my last life and e=\r\nnded up creating a rina. Or suppose I benefited from those subjects and cre=\r\nated a rina.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Somehow or the other, suppose I created a rina that set =\r\nthe stage for the work of this life. Suppose the rina requires me to do som=\r\nething for those subjects, e.g. teach homam, teach astrology, give a free a=\r\nstrology software etc. All this is what I am &quot;giving&quot;, i.e. I am paying bac=\r\nk a rina I created before somehow or the other.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now, suppose people s=\r\ntart praising me for what I am doing and I feel proud and gratified. This g=\r\nratification I derive is something I am &quot;taking&quot; from others and the univer=\r\nse. So this is a rina.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, I cannot control what others do. Wh=\r\nen I give something to them - knowledge or manuals or software etc - they m=\r\nay praise me to ANY level. That I cannot control. But I CAN control how pro=\r\nud and gratified I feel. By conscious effort, constant contemplation, surre=\r\nnder to the Mother and viewing it as a lila in which I a small instrument, =\r\nI can try to not focus my mind on what universe is giving me and focus it i=\r\nnstead on what more I can give to the universe.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If by exercising ones will power, an individual is able to avoid=\r\n paying a rna, what happens then? &lt; &lt; &lt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Everything you took does need=\r\n to be paid back. Actually, paying back is never a problem. If you can pay =\r\nback a rina without incurring a new rina in the process, it is safe anytime=\r\n to give back and there is no need to delay or avoid.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, if that is=\r\n not the case, you can try to use your will power to delay payback to a tim=\r\ne later when you are hopefully able to give without taking something back.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Utpal, in your example, &quot;Curse, Constantly =\r\nfollow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress&quot; under (1) are useless activit=\r\nies. They involve no giving and no productive action.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I said earlier:=\r\n &quot;Of course, when you have an opportunity to give different things to diffe=\r\nrent people and have to pick some, you have to use your judgment to pick th=\r\ne right ones, to pay off a more important rina with the little you have!!&quot;\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; So part of option (1) is valid. If one believes there is a chance to =\r\nretrieve the money and put it to a good use to fulfil some other important =\r\nrina, one can try. But, if one determines that there is no chance, one shou=\r\nld be able to put it to rest (i.e. (2)). Similarly, one should put in one&#39;s=\r\n effort prepared for any outcome and not thinking about the money always.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; What action you engage in decides the outcome and not whether you thin=\r\nk about this action and its object all the time. By thinking about it all t=\r\nhe time and becoming anxious, you achieve nothing. In fact, such anxiety ma=\r\ny sometimes cloud your judment, stop you from doing the right thing and red=\r\nuce your efficiency. Attachment limits efficiency. It is action that gets r=\r\nesult and not attachment. Detached action is the best formula for efficient=\r\n action. Both inaction and attached action are formulas for disaster.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyot=\r\nish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri T=\r\narpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films tha=\r\nt make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- dinesh_nambisan &lt;dinesh@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Utpal-bhai:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your thoughts.

Mr. VS gives many excuses and many dates but fails and ultimately=\r\n does not pay back. Mr. FL is under great pressure due to that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Mr. FL can have many options to react in the situations:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1]=\r\n Thinking constantly and repenting for the act He can-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Curse, Cons=\r\ntantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress, resort to other techni=\r\nques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal and external activities conce=\r\nrning that issue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In this case, He strongly identifies with th=\r\ne Money, act of Giving then expecting it back, Repenting etc...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; OR\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance to resort to =\r\nthe implementation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that=\r\n it was a Rina which needed to be paid back and practically starts training=\r\n the mind with that knowledge. He follows up for the money but with the att=\r\nitude of detachment. Although he shows to his family and friends that he is=\r\n extremely concerned and it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he think=\r\ns that it was a rina from some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks tha=\r\nt they were Money of Mother and she will take care. If they needed to come =\r\nback, she will do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas =\r\nthen they will not come back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; With the Second Approach, I thin=\r\nk, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and will be able to break free from thi=\r\ns particular chain. He may have successfully PAID BACK his debt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; With the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified himself very strongly wit=\r\nh Money and its ownership and hence all the actions done due to that, so He=\r\n may have created NEW RINAS which will be needed to settled on a later date=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However I am not sure for what I have written.

This comes from millions of janmas and samskar=\r\nas. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My spiritual father &quot;Vimalananda&quot; used to say  in a=\r\n slightly different context that he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I applied it to this as well and it works quite well.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tw=\r\no things  are going to be  useful, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Continue your mantra during =\r\nthe act and it will act as a continuation of your sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. If yo=\r\nur partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not be disheartened by failure=\r\n initially. As time goes on, the  thing in your mind which thinks of sex is=\r\n incinerated and slowly you find that a naked female(or male as  may be the=\r\n case)  body is like a landscape picture just like any other picture made b=\r\ny Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, you need not be disturbe=\r\nd by it, you can certainly  feel that the picture  is very beautiful  but y=\r\nou need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samasta Sakala jagatsu, tyaik=\r\niya.... ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once this stage is reached then the mind ceases to thin=\r\nk of sex all the while.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes you may still encounter it, but that is=\r\n another story.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Thu, Feb 25=\r\n, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

Swami Sathasivom had =\r\nseveral books on homam gifted to us by a friend  of his on the next day, wi=\r\nthout Manish telling anything about the Mother&#39;s command to anyone. He also=\r\n gifted a homa kundam to me enabling me to experiment with homam and prepar=\r\ne myself for creating the manuals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He is a priest in the=\r\n Sivacharya tradition of Tamil Nadu and his father Sri Sambamurthi Sivachar=\r\nya was  a very respected Sivacharya who trained a lot of priests and consec=\r\nrated many temples. Swami Sathasivom is one of the rare priests we find tod=\r\nay, who is not only a priest but also a yogi and a sadhaka. He has childlik=\r\ne innocence, simplicty, rare humility  and love for all. He conducts himsel=\r\nf with detachment by seeking nothing and avoiding nothing. He conducted som=\r\ne of the best homams and poojas I have witnessed. He has been on mouna vrat=\r\nam (vow of silence) for more than a year and communicates by writing (sayin=\r\ng mantras in pooja/homam is an exception).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *            =\r\n   *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can give an analogy for the last =\r\npoint regarding an aghora&#39;s way to overcome any  weakness for sex that may =\r\nbe left in the mind (which may make sexual  thoughts arise in the mind now =\r\nand then).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose you are trying to read a book and a f=\r\nriend is distracting you and irritating you by talking about something else=\r\n. You can try to ignore him and focus on the book. Alternatively, you can a=\r\nlso try to get him interested in the book and call him to read the book alo=\r\nng with you. In the beginning, he may still distract you and make it more d=\r\nifficult to read. But, it is possible that he also likes the book and start=\r\ns enjoying the book along with you and stops distracting you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If meditation is like reading a book, weakness for sex is like the fr=\r\niend and sexual thoughts that arise in the mind are like the distractions c=\r\naused by the friend, then aghora&#39;s sadhana I mentioned is like getting the =\r\nfriend to read the book along with you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I sa=\r\nid, there are no guarantees. This friend may get interested in the book and=\r\n stop distracting you, or he may continue to distract you and make it worse=\r\n by being right next to you through the reading. It is tricky to know how l=\r\nong one should try before deciding that it is not working. That is why we s=\r\nay that aghora is not for everyone.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish=\r\n Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sho=\r\nrt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                    http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;          Films that make a difference: =\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;          Spirituality: http://groups. y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups. y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Me=\r\nssage ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: swamisathasivom@ rocketmail. com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 24, 2010 11=\r\n:48 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Aghora books by Svoboda (Re: Cha=\r\nndi Homam and Sri Vidya)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskarams   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis reply is amazing and true \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bow down to yr knowledge given by ma=\r\n durga Mahalakshmi .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was stunned by this answers ,its answers to =\r\nmany questions in our inner mind .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I stopped all and read this repl=\r\ny almost 5 th time .each time some new points I am catching from in it ,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nandhi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent from my BlackBerry =C2=AE smartphone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* =\r\nunderstands and appreciates it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of s=\r\nymbolic stories of wars that the divine Mother fought, which explain how on=\r\ne can fight and overcome various weaknesses that typically bind one in Maay=\r\naa. Reciting these stories on a regular basis will promote the fighting spi=\r\nrit within one that fights these weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is no=\r\nthing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to fight/overcome it at the =\r\nsame time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa. One aspect of the Mothe=\r\nr makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of the Mothe=\r\nr makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. One aspect of the Mother make=\r\ns you fight and overcome it. When one realizes Self at the end, irrespectiv=\r\ne of the path taken, one finally sees that all these are aspects of a Singl=\r\ne Mother who is also essentially true Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *           =\r\n    *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read the=\r\n Aghora series books by Dr. Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Svobodha. For now I have very =\r\nmixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need to read more! \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not e=\r\nveryone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of L=\r\nord Shiva is Aghora. A true  Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as terri=\r\nble or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god and =\r\ntries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) always, =\r\ninstead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When someo=\r\nne dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carrying the dead=\r\n body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is true and ever=\r\nything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself that life and de=\r\nath are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. But the questi=\r\non is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth only when some=\r\none dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing we have done=\r\n and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama n=\r\naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporary illusions. O=\r\nnly the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;? When =\r\nwe feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, can&#39;t we tell =\r\nourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other =\r\nthings that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is=\r\n real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  When someon=\r\ne attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tel=\r\nl ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary illusions. On=\r\nly the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. Hi=\r\ns mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelli=\r\nng* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and th=\r\ninking about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on=\r\n what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *      =\r\n         *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. Th=\r\ne variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If=\r\n feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent real=\r\nity within them is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not fece=\r\ns. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.  But, please remember that =\r\neating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consu=\r\nmed and not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit e=\r\ntc), is the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no pu=\r\nrpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestatio=\r\nn of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating fece=\r\ns, but the mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; =\r\nwith certain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be t=\r\nhinking that he is Self and he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course=\r\n, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when =\r\neating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Ne=\r\nvertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed =\r\nin one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manife=\r\nstations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overl=\r\ny salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the s=\r\name truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. B=\r\nut aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure results =\r\nin a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in for=\r\ncing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic v=\r\nerse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus an=\r\nd nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self whi=\r\nle eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-ni=\r\nce) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand=\r\n, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it =\r\nwill be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad du=\r\nal experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyon=\r\ne merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succe=\r\neds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *               *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of s=\r\nadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose on=\r\ne&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sad=\r\nhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away fro=\r\nm sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. =\r\nAfter all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps=\r\n celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the m=\r\nind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascin=\r\nation some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora will take i=\r\nt to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination f=\r\nrom the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activitie=\r\ns (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them into one without suc=\r\nh distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his par=\r\ntner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, th=\r\nis may titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being =\r\nmade impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several mon=\r\nths/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that=\r\n he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The assoc=\r\niation in his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing nak=\r\ned pictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but=\r\n evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that sudde=\r\nnly rise in the head may not lead to denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  denser thoughts re=\r\nlating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind ba=\r\nck to meditation. After spending so much time in meditation while sitting n=\r\naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or i=\r\nntimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness =\r\nfor sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of condition=\r\ning based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora s=\r\nometimes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging in certai=\r\nn practices that undermine those structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, is=\r\n this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that the person =\r\nkeeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytim=\r\ne he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he se=\r\nes naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *               *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Bottom=\r\nline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a =\r\nhigh stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push the problems =\r\nunder the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strateg=\r\ny is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *               *  =\r\n             *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedan=\r\nta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and =\r\nabsorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes war pl=\r\nan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversio=\r\nn. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on a wron=\r\ng understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.  Aghora stands=\r\n for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people pu=\r\nrsuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Up=\r\nanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the =\r\ntruth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual pat=\r\nhs and explains the basic reality.

But wha=\r\nt I am trying to understand  is that how to worship both forms simultaneous=\r\nly. For  instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one o=\r\nf the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sas=\r\ntry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krit=\r\nhis  mention  great details about all the  nine avaranas and different form=\r\ns of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana.  In the Dhyana Kri=\r\nthi  of those, in the very  first line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpala=\r\ntike, ChanDike&#39;.  That line tells me that  even through Sri Vidya one can w=\r\norship Chandi Ma, in that form.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So my question was in =\r\nthat perspective. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mentioned=\r\n how the Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in those =\r\nterms. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to=\r\n get practise of reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, wh=\r\nich I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comf=\r\nortable reading the saptashati! Have to see how mother will help me achieve=\r\n my target. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora ser=\r\nies books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the=\r\n subject. Perhaps I need to read more! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 2/12/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi Homam and Sr=\r\ni Vidya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Friday, Fe=\r\nbruary 12, 2010, 11:31 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My p=\r\nerforming a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On the ot=\r\nher hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 =\r\nhours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their first attempt. THEY=\r\n are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is a=\r\nwe-inspiring.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Integrating various sadhanas is a personal p=\r\nroblem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pic=\r\nk one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of split=\r\nting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is be=\r\ntter to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places,=\r\n if one wants to find water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One possibility is to do a ho=\r\nmam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one=\r\n is attached to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vid=\r\nya. However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symbl=\r\nic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, t=\r\noo, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; L=\r\nalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mothe=\r\nr who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who i=\r\ns stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictne=\r\nss). Both are valid paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: ht=\r\ntp://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gr=\r\noup/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, nagraj@sbcglobal. net =\r\n&lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: nagraj@sbcglobal. net =\r\n&lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam and Sri=\r\n Vidya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Friday, Feb=\r\nruary 5, 2010, 11:51 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am very much in awe after I learnt that you do chandi homam ev=\r\neryday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do yo=\r\nur chandi homam. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a=\r\n short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 mi=\r\nnutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishek=\r\nam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about =\r\n35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several t=\r\nimes a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these=\r\n along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could yo=\r\nu please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very mo=\r\ntivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen=\r\n interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nav=\r\na-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Nagraj Kota\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
