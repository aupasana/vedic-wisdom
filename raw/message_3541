It conveys a message as=\r\n if Sri Aurobindo and the Mother were looking for disciples and were all ou=\r\nt to &quot;get&quot; Ganapathi Muni to their Ashram!\n\nWhat a distortion of truth from=\r\n a person considered to be a close disciple of Ramana Maharishi and former =\r\ndisciple of the Mother and Sri Aurobindo!!\n\nIn Sri Aurobindo Ashram, the fa=\r\ncilities a visitor or member would get depended on their inner evolution. I=\r\nf they had a chance of expansion in an artistic field say they had a fine s=\r\nense of beauty or music, etc., they would be provided a large room with pos=\r\nsibility of practicing their passion and the Mothers Force would work throu=\r\ngh them as they work on their art and their Spiritual evolution would happe=\r\nn that way. It has nothing to do with &quot;getting&quot; people. The number of famou=\r\ns & &quot;powerful&quot; devotees refused permission to stay permanently in the Ashra=\r\nm was much higher than those that were allowed to stay.\n\nWhat a contrast be=\r\ntween Kapali Shastri and Balaram Reddy! Kapali Shastri left Ramana Maharish=\r\ni & Ganapati Muni to come to Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. But he never mis=\r\nrepresented Ramanashram or Ramana Maharishi by speaking out his &quot;assumption=\r\ns&quot; as facts. \n\n-Shiva.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Prasanth Jalas=\r\nutram &lt;jvrsprasanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ganapati Muni\n&gt; \n&gt; I never met Ganapat=\r\ni Muni, but I remember being with Kapali Sastri in\n&gt; Aurobindo Ashram when =\r\nthe news of his death arrived. I saw Sastri openly\n&gt; weep, lamenting the Mu=\r\nni&#39;s death. At that time Kapali Sastri had so much\n&gt; faith in Aurobindo and=\r\n Mother, I heard him say, &quot;If Nayana was here (at\n&gt; Aurobindo Ashram) he wo=\r\nuld not have died.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhagavan was once talking about him to me and said=\r\n, &quot;If Nayana had not come\n&gt; here (meaning to himself) and had his mind turn=\r\ned inwards to the Self, he\n&gt; would have certainly ended up in jail.&quot; Nayana=\r\n had in his earlier years a\n&gt; predilection for political activity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aur=\r\nobindo and the Mother recognized Ganapati Muni&#39;s extraordinary gifts.\n&gt; Kap=\r\nali Sastri once took the Muni to Aurobindo Ashram and everyone there was\n&gt; =\r\neager that he should stay. He was given a royal welcome and offered a house=\r\n\n&gt; and all the necessary conveniences for him and his family. Someone back =\r\nat\n&gt; Sri Ramanasramam informed Bhagavan of how Nayana was being enticed to =\r\nstay\n&gt; in Aurobindo Ashram. While this person was describing it all to Bhag=\r\navan, he\n&gt; expressed the opinion that Nayana, indeed, might very well settl=\r\ne down\n&gt; there. Bhagavan looked at the man in surprise and said, &quot;Nayana ? =\r\nSettle\n&gt; down at Aurobindo Ashram? Impossible!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Learned Scholars\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMany learned scholars and sannyasins would often visit Bhagavan and ask\n&gt; q=\r\nuestions. Bhagavan&#39;s response to these visitors, and also to other\n&gt; visito=\r\nrs, was not always uniform. To some people he would give much\n&gt; attention, =\r\neither by talking to them or pouring out his grace through a\n&gt; silent look;=\r\n others he would stoically ignore. All these variations were not\n&gt; governed=\r\n by status, wealth, or fame.\n&gt; \n&gt; One morning a famous swami of Ahmedabad a=\r\nrrived at the ashram. I understood\n&gt; he had many wealthy disciples and was =\r\nhimself attired in a costly silk,\n&gt; ochre-colored cloth. He also had severa=\r\nl pieces of luggage, which clearly\n&gt; indicated he was a man of some means. =\r\nThe swami came into the Guest House\n&gt; for Gentlemen and introduced himself =\r\nto me. He wanted to know when he could\n&gt; see the Maharshi. I told him at 10=\r\n a.m. I would be going to the hall and he\n&gt; could accompany me and at that =\r\ntime I would introduce him to the Maharshi.\n&gt; \n&gt; During that period, betwee=\r\nn 10 and 11 a.m. every morning in the Old Hall,\n&gt; Devaraja Mudaliar, Munaga=\r\nla Venkataramiah and I were going through\n&gt; Venkataramiah&#39;s English transla=\r\ntion of a Tamil scripture. Bhagavan would\n&gt; open and hold the Tamil book in=\r\n his hand and we would read the English\n&gt; translation for each verse. Then =\r\nwe would discuss it until we found it\n&gt; acceptable to Bhagavan.\n&gt; \n&gt; The sw=\r\nami entered the hall with me at 10 a.m. and I introduced him to\n&gt; Bhagavan.=\r\n He was fluent in Sanskrit and other languages, and also was well\n&gt; versed =\r\nin all the scriptures. He inquired if he was allowed to ask a\n&gt; question. T=\r\nhe consent was given and he asked Bhagavan if Ishwara, the\n&gt; personal God, =\r\nactually existed. The Maharshi replied with one of his\n&gt; standard rejoinder=\r\ns: &quot;We do not know about Ishwara or whether he exists or\n&gt; not. But what we=\r\n do know is that we exist. Find out who that &#39;I&#39; is that\n&gt; exists. That is =\r\nall that is required.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The swami was not satisfied with this answer an=\r\nd continued to discuss the\n&gt; matter, quoting from various scriptures. Bhaga=\r\nvan then said, &quot;If the\n&gt; scriptures say all this about it, why question me =\r\nfurther?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This also was not acceptable to the swami and he proceeded w=\r\nith more\n&gt; elucidation, at which point Bhagavan cut him off by turning to u=\r\ns and\n&gt; saying, &quot;Come on. Let us begin our work.&quot; It is needless to say tha=\r\nt the\n&gt; swami became quite annoyed and soon left the hall.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later in th=\r\ne day I met him and he told me that my Maharshi doesn&#39;t seem to\n&gt; know very=\r\n much. I simply replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; And although this visitor was\n&gt; originally =\r\nplanning on staying for three days, he cut his visit short and\n&gt; left that =\r\nvery afternoon, without ever going back into the hall to see the\n&gt; Maharshi=\r\n. Bhagavan later asked me what the swami said before leaving. When I\n&gt; told=\r\n him, he simply smiled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another incident comes to my mind when yet one=\r\n more learned swami visited\n&gt; Bhagavan. He questioned Bhagavan in Sanskrit =\r\nand Bhagavan, once again,\n&gt; patiently answered in Malayalam, the swami&#39;s mo=\r\nther tongue. As the session\n&gt; continued it became clear that this swami&#39;s s=\r\nole intention was to defeat\n&gt; Bhagavan in argument. Eventually Bhagavan sai=\r\nd, &quot;Will you be satisfied if I\n&gt; issue you a certificate stating you have d=\r\nefeated me in the argument?&quot; But\n&gt; even that did not silence the swami&#39;s im=\r\npertinence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jagadish Sastri, a Sanskrit pundit, was quietly listening =\r\nto the\n&gt; proceedings. When he saw that the swami was incorrigible, he blurt=\r\ned out in\n&gt; Sanskrit, &quot;He dushta bahirgachha,&quot; which means &quot;O wicked man, g=\r\net out!&quot; I\n&gt; don&#39;t remember anyone ever making such an aggressive remark in=\r\n the presence\n&gt; of Bhagavan. But it worked. The swami finally got the messa=\r\nge and left the\n&gt; hall.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once a group of influential devotees from Madr=\r\nas came up with a scheme to\n&gt; take Bhagavan away to Madras. In an attempt t=\r\no execute this plan, a number\n&gt; of them arrived at the ashram and came into=\r\n the hall. It wasn&#39;t long before\n&gt; they realized that Bhagavan would never =\r\nconsent to leave Ramanasramam, and\n&gt; eventually they left.\n&gt; \n&gt; One old dev=\r\notee was sitting in the corner of the hall quietly watching the\n&gt; whole dra=\r\nma unfold. He said nothing while the discussion was underway,\n&gt; though he w=\r\nas secretly in collusion with the group from Madras. After the\n&gt; group left=\r\n, Bhagavan turned to one of his attendants and said, &quot;Some people\n&gt; will si=\r\nt quietly as if they have nothing to do with what is taking place\n&gt; before =\r\nthem. But on the contrary, they have everything to do with what is\n&gt; going =\r\non.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The old devotee questioned, &quot;Bhagavan, are you testing me?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nBhagavan simply remained silent. Any acts of insincerity were easily known\n=\r\n&gt; to Bhagavan and he did not hesitate to point them out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Foreigners an=\r\nd the English Language\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhagavan was familiar with, and had respect for=\r\n, the classical English\n&gt; works. He had read many English books and would d=\r\naily read an English\n&gt; newspaper. W. Y. Evans-Wentz had given Bhagavan copi=\r\nes of his published\n&gt; books, and of these books Bhagavan liked best Tibet&#39;s=\r\n Great Yogi, Melarepa.\n&gt; He once requested me to read it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although he =\r\nread and understood English quite well, he rarely spoke it. If\n&gt; people spo=\r\nke English to him with clear diction and pronunciation he would\n&gt; not have =\r\nmuch trouble understanding them. Once he said to me, &quot;I couldn&#39;t\n&gt; understa=\r\nnd a word Chadwick said.&quot; Which shows he did fail to understand\n&gt; English a=\r\nt times if not spoken clearly.\n&gt; \n&gt; The State of a Jnani\n&gt; \n&gt; On another oc=\r\ncasion there was a French visitor named Jean Herbert, who had\n&gt; written sev=\r\neral books on India, its holy men, and ashrams, etc. I saw him\n&gt; while he w=\r\nas on his second visit to the ashram. During this visit he\n&gt; requested the =\r\npublication rights of all of the ashram literature, as he\n&gt; planned on usin=\r\ng this material in his books. The ashram authorities were at\n&gt; first enthus=\r\niastic about books being published in the West on Bhagavan and\n&gt; his teachi=\r\nngs. I told Bhagavan that Jean Herbert also requested the same\n&gt; permission=\r\n from Aurobindo Ashram, but they decided not to give it. Perhaps\n&gt; they fel=\r\nt he would exploit Aurobindo&#39;s writings. When I had told Bhagavan\n&gt; this, h=\r\ne requested me to go to the office and explain it to them. I did, and\n&gt; the=\r\n permission was withheld.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this way, I observed Bhagavan taking spec=\r\nial interest in the affairs of\n&gt; the ashram and, at times, personally direc=\r\nting them. It might not always\n&gt; have been so apparent as in the two cases =\r\nabove, but it was, no doubt,\n&gt; forthcoming.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though Bhagavan generally =\r\nopposed any funds being solicited for the ashram,\n&gt; he did not object in al=\r\nl cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; Krishnaprem visits the Ashram\n&gt; \n&gt; After my visit with Krishn=\r\naprem in 1938, I had corresponded with him a few\n&gt; times. In each of his le=\r\ntters he promised that he would soon be coming to\n&gt; see the Maharshi. But h=\r\ne never came and I began to think that he would miss\n&gt; his chance to have d=\r\narshan of Bhagavan. This all changed on a December\n&gt; morning in 1948.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI was sitting with my eyes closed next to Bhagavan, outside on the verandah=\r\n.\n&gt; When I opened my eyes, who did I see sitting before me but Krishnaprem.=\r\n I\n&gt; said to him, &quot;You have finally come. Why didn&#39;t you write and let me k=\r\nnow\n&gt; you were coming?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He said, &quot;After writing to you so many times a=\r\nnd promising to come, but\n&gt; didn&#39;t, I was embarrassed to write you again.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; During this visit, Krishnaprem handed over his small Gopala Krishna id=\r\nol to\n&gt; Bhagavan. Bhagavan tenderly turned it this way and that, looking at=\r\n it\n&gt; intently, and then returned it to Krishnaprem. In other places it has=\r\n\n&gt; already been recorded about Krishnaprem&#39;s vision and inner experiences w=\r\nhile\n&gt; sitting before Bhagavan in the Old Hall.\n&gt; \n&gt; From Sri Ramanasramam =\r\nhe travelled to Sri Aurobindo&#39;s Ashram. After staying\n&gt; there a few days we=\r\n planned that he and I would rendezvous at the Villupuram\n&gt; train station, =\r\nfrom where we would depart together and travel south,\n&gt; visiting several fa=\r\nmous temples and holy places. My train from\n&gt; Tiruvannamalai was scheduled =\r\nto leave at 1 P.M. So, immediately after lunch\n&gt; I approached Bhagavan to t=\r\nake leave of him. He had just then finished his\n&gt; meal and was massaging hi=\r\ns rheumatic knee joints=E2=80&quot;in his old age he had to do\n&gt; this prior to w=\r\nalking. I prostrated before him and informed him of my\n&gt; departure. He alre=\r\nady knew all the details relating to this trip, and he\n&gt; also knew I was pl=\r\nanning on visiting Kanyakumari. He said to me, &quot;These\n&gt; people (meaning the=\r\n management) have written to an advocate-devotee of\n&gt; Nagerkoil to send us =\r\nthe three different-coloured sands that are available\n&gt; at Kanyakumari. The=\r\nse are needed for the Kumbhabhishekam of the\n&gt; Matrubhuteswara Temple. So f=\r\nar, he has not sent them.&quot; Though Bhagavan did\n&gt; not say specifically that =\r\nI should bring those sands, I naturally understood\n&gt; what was on his mind. =\r\nIn fact, he often employed this manner of speaking,\n&gt; asking us indirectly,=\r\n when he wanted something done. Before leaving he also\n&gt; asked me to write =\r\nand send him details about the pilgrimage.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I arrived in Kanyakuma=\r\nri I discovered that the government had enforced\n&gt; a law prohibiting the re=\r\nmoval of any sand from the beaches of Kanyakumari.\n&gt; Uranium, the mineral u=\r\nsed for making atomic bombs, had been found in some of\n&gt; the sand. Neverthe=\r\nless, I thought I should take my chances and stealthily\n&gt; proceeded to gath=\r\ner the three different sands. I filled three bags with the\n&gt; sands and conc=\r\nealed them in my bedroll. At the train station I hired a man\n&gt; to carry my =\r\nbedroll and luggage and moved on towards the station gate.\n&gt; Standing at th=\r\ne gate, I saw the ticket collector and two policemen. The\n&gt; ticket collecto=\r\nr was checking tickets and the policemen were checking\n&gt; baggage for illega=\r\nl sand. I asked my man to stop and we both stood there\n&gt; momentarily as I c=\r\nontemplated the situation. Pondering over my next move, I\n&gt; mentally prayed=\r\n to Bhagavan, &quot;You wanted me to bring this sand. Now look at\n&gt; this=E2=80&quot;p=\r\nolice! What am I to do?&quot; As soon as I had prayed thus, the policemen,\n&gt; for=\r\n some unknown reason, turned and looked in a certain direction and walked\n&gt;=\r\n away from the gate. I immediately told my man, &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; and we passed\n&gt;=\r\n through the gate and boarded the train.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I returned to the ashram=\r\n and brought the bags of sands to Bhagavan, he\n&gt; called everyone around to =\r\ncome and look. Later, the sands expected from the\n&gt; advocate arrived by pos=\r\nt, but the bags had broken en route and the three\n&gt; varieties of sands mixe=\r\nd, making them useless. When Bhagavan heard that he\n&gt; remarked, &quot;If Balaram=\r\n Reddy had not brought the sands, how could we have\n&gt; gotten a fresh consig=\r\nnment on time for the consecration ceremony?&quot;Krishnaprem\n&gt; finally returned=\r\n to North India after his tour of the South.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sources:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) http://w=\r\nww.arunachala.org/newsletters/1996/?pg=3Djan-feb\n&gt; 2) http://www.arunachala=\r\n.org/newsletters/1996/?pg=3Dmar-apr\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =E0=B0&quot;=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=AF\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
