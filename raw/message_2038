It seems to me like you =\r\nhave a unique background.\n\nThough I always insist that direct experience is=\r\n far more important than\ntheoretical discussions, it is useful to discuss s=\r\nometimes.\n\nMy background is mainly in vedanta and sanatana dharma and not i=\r\nn\nBuddhism. I will comment on your post based on MY understanding of what\ny=\r\nour background is and what you are saying. Your mail is quite loaded\nand I =\r\nwill respond only to some salient points in a freewheeling manner.\n\n*      =\r\n  *        *\n\nMy world view is slightly different. Aatman is that which is =\r\nin ALL\nbeings and things as the non-dual and permanent reality. But we do n=\r\not\nperceive Aatman and perceive only the objects of the dual world, which\na=\r\nre impermanent. However, the impermanent objects of this dual world too\nare=\r\n made of Aatman and non-different from Aatman. They do not consist of\n&quot;anaa=\r\ntman&quot; (non-aatman), but aatman only. Let me give an analogy.\n\nA ripple in t=\r\nhe pond is also part of pond and not non-pond. While the\npond is stationary=\r\n and permanent, the ripple is moving and transient. It\nwill vanish after a =\r\nwhile and merge in the stationary pond. Some ripples\ndie away too fast and =\r\nsome take a very long time. Some transform from\none structure to another be=\r\nfore they vanish. But each ripple vanishes\neventually and the pond remains =\r\nin the place where there was a ripple\nonce. As a matter of fact, even when =\r\nthe ripple existed, one can still\nview it as the pond and not as a ripple.\n=\r\n\nAatman or Brahman described by Veda and Upanishad is like the pond. All\nbe=\r\nings of the dual world that are perceivable to us are like the ripples\nin t=\r\nhe pond. They arise, they move, they get transformed into different\nshapes,=\r\n they interact with each other and get disturbed by each other\nand eventual=\r\nly they slow down and vanish.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThus, we do not talk in=\r\n terms of aatman and anaatman (non-aatman). We\nconsider everything as aatma=\r\nn. However, some parts of imperishable\naatman seem perishable because of ou=\r\nr way of looking, when our\nperspective is limited by duality.\n\nThe preserva=\r\ntional and destructive aspects are both part of duality and\nnon-dual aatman=\r\n is free from all such considerations. Nothing is created\nor preserved or d=\r\nestroyed in aatman. But, when one looks from a\nperspective that is limited =\r\nby duality, it seems like there are objects\nbeing created, preserved and de=\r\nstroyed.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOne gets liberation or moksha when one&#39;s per=\r\nspective is not limited by\nthe duality. Even when stuck in a ripple that fe=\r\nels like a violent\nwhirlpool, if one can think &quot;I am the pond&quot; and act like=\r\n it, then one is\nliberated. If a ripple is going to come hit the ripple one=\r\n is in and\ndisturb one&#39;s stability, if one can still think &quot;I am the pond&quot; =\r\nand act\nlike it, then one is liberated. Of course, I am talking in terms of=\r\n the\nanalogy I introduced earlier.\n\nWhen one is not liberated and one&#39;s per=\r\nspective is clouded by duality,\none experiences happiness, sadness, love, l=\r\nust, hatred, anger, jealosy\netc and various emotions. When one is liberated=\r\n and one&#39;s perspective is\nnot limited by duality, one is filled with great =\r\nbliss. This was the\ngoal of Buddha as well as Vedic rishis.\n\n*        *    =\r\n    *\n\nThough rishis declared that everything is Aatman and inability to\nre=\r\ncognize it is due to one&#39;s perspective being limited by duality, they\ndid n=\r\not leave it at that. They did not say &quot;this duality is nonsense or\ndelusion=\r\n or magic or anaatman. Just get over it&quot;, because getting over\nit is not ea=\r\nsy. For one stuck in a whirlpool in a pond and panicking,\nthe mere preachin=\r\ng &quot;ignore the whirlpool and think of the pond&quot; is\nuseless.\n\nThey prescribed=\r\n various paths that are appropriate for people of various\nbackgrounds to sl=\r\nowly get over duality. In fact, for people who do not\nwant to get over dual=\r\nity and want to remain in it, manipulate it to\ntheir [temporary] advantage =\r\nand enjoy it also, they prescribed various\npaths.\n\nThe respect rishis showe=\r\nd to both non-dual Aatman AND the field of\nduality is perhaps unique to san=\r\natana dharma and perhaps missing in\nBuddhism.\n\n*        *        *\n\nAghora =\r\nis not meant to be a path of addition to sex or drugs or pain. It\nis the pa=\r\nth of seeing Aatman even in depraving conditions. If an\naghori&#39;s focus of m=\r\nind wavers from the chosen deity and becomes aware of\nthe body or its sense=\r\n inputs, then he has failed badly. Only a sadhaka\nwith a very high level of=\r\n purity already is capable of testing\nhimself/herself in depraving conditio=\r\nns and see if they disturb the\nmental focus on god. As Svoboda correctly po=\r\nints out at the beginning of\nhis book on Aghora, the sadhakas who are pure =\r\nenough to succeed in\nAghora practices usually are not attracted to Aghora a=\r\nnd those who find\nthe practices attractive are usually not pure enough to s=\r\nucceed in them.\n\nHowever, we cannot equate goddess worship to aghora. Aghor=\r\na is a set of\nextreme practices. Goddess worship has a wide range of practi=\r\nces in\nIndia. Some worship the goddess without any &quot;self-destruction&quot; or ev=\r\nen\nself-deprivation and pursue rank materialism along with goddess worship.=\r\n\nSome worship goddess with varying levels of self-deprivation aimed at\nslow=\r\nly limiting the influence of sense inputs and considerations of\nsense pleas=\r\nures/pains on the ability of the mind to focus on the Divine.\nSanatana dhar=\r\nma has a wide variety of practices that are appropriate for\npeople of vario=\r\nus level of spiritual evolution and various degrees of\ninternal purity.\n\n* =\r\n       *        *\n\nBut, given the wide variety of teachings and practices a=\r\nvailable, people\nsometimes lap up the wrong teachings for them. For example=\r\n, one person\nmay claim &quot;I am Brahman, I am imperishable aatman, I am Buddha=\r\n and I\nhave to do no sadhana&quot;. A pretension or a mere academic statement is=\r\n not\na substitute for an internal *realization*. If a terrible strife\nbefal=\r\nls, like a slow and painful death or a debilitating disease or\nterrible inj=\r\nury, one may start saying &quot;I am in great pain&quot;. Well, if one\nis Brahman, th=\r\nere is no pain or pleasure.\n\nOne should realize that teachings relating to =\r\nnon-duality are\ninapplicable to most people and they need to do some sadhan=\r\na to wade the\nfield duality and reach non-duality. In this light, we must a=\r\nppreciate\nthe respectful treatment of duality by rishis (who themselves had=\r\n\novercome it completely) and their teaching of many tools to slowly wade\nit=\r\n.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n=\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lesso=\r\nns (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:=\r\n//www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jberger001&quot; &lt;jberger0=\r\n01@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; I recently joined this group after having bee=\r\nn forwarded some\ninteresting posts by a colleague. As an introductory post,=\r\n I would like\nto address a theme that is most pressing in my current worldv=\r\niew, namely\nthe problem of reconciling the preservational aspect of Atman w=\r\nith what\nappears to be the dominance of a dark embrace between Anatman theo=\r\nry and\nthe Aghori path throughout most of the world. I don&#39;t think this is =\r\nas\nsimple as recongnizing that Shaivic and Vishnaivic energies are held in\n=\r\nconstant balance, because the focus of the argument seems more oriented\ntow=\r\nard an almost unconscious Kali worship among parts of the world in\nwhich Bu=\r\nddhism is planting or has planted roots.\n&gt;\n&gt; For some time I have struggled=\r\n with the unsettling suspicion that\nBuddhism is a terrible trap for the min=\r\nd to stumble upon. Ever since I\nheard a clip of U.G. Krishnamurti saying th=\r\nat Buddhism introduced the\nconcept of conversion into the world, and perhap=\r\ns before, I have been\nplagued by this suspicion. It appears that Anatman th=\r\neory merely creates\na a playground for various forms of absurdity which man=\r\nifest themselves\nas a culture&#39;s obsession with sex and death, which result =\r\nin the economy\nof many parts of the world being driven by war and prostitut=\r\nion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now the Aghori path is what is is for most people: a path of\nself-=\r\ndestruction which is also a form of Goddess worship. But I would\nmaintain t=\r\nhat such naive practitioners of this path have used,\nconsciously or unconsc=\r\niously, the prevalent Anatman-related theories as\nexcuses to perpetuate the=\r\n endless cycle of imperialism,\nheroin-trafficking and prostitution that gen=\r\nerally drives world economy.\nBecause of this fatal misunderstanding of Shai=\r\nvic energies, along with\nthe corresponding fascination with the lingo of An=\r\natman theory, most of\nthe world has become a wasteland of dispersed energy,=\r\n prematurely\nsacrificed to Kali without a shred of taste or sophistication.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It is here that I suppose one could get into some kind of\nnirvikalpa/s=\r\navikalpa samadhi debate regarding whether the Buddha, by\nrenouncing his fam=\r\nily, actually created the disintegration of focus\nwhich is symbolic of the =\r\nstate of the world, in that Atman theory,\nrepresented by Hinduism is left h=\r\nolding down the homestead while Anatman\ntheory actually creates suffering b=\r\ny attempting to remove it through\nmeditation. I would submit that the curre=\r\nnt state of world dharma locked\nin some kind of identity crisis over who is=\r\n supposed to be holding\nKali&#39;s left leg and who the right. This is the esse=\r\nntial problem, Shiva\njust lay there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jeff Berger\n\n\n\r\n--6-4293225679-9597001794=:4\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;arial&quot;&gt;Namaste Jeff,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the g=\r\nroup!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;It is interesting that each one of us comes with a diffe=\r\nrent world view based on all the literature and thinking one has been expos=\r\ned to and the life experiences.

I would submit that the current state of world dharma locked in some k=\r\nind of identity crisis over who is supposed to be holding Kali&#39;s left leg a=\r\nnd who the right. This is the essential problem, Shiva just lay there.&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Jeff Berger&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n\r\n--6-4293225679-9597001794=:4--\r\n\n"}}
