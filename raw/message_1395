How can i again experie=\r\nnce the Beloved.\n          That then is the experience of mantra when it is=\r\n done correctly.\n          When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such th=\r\nat the deity&#39;s personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself a=\r\ns that Deity(Devata).\n          There then arises no difference in the sadh=\r\nak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be it what appears to=\r\n be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality i=\r\ns crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so=\r\n self identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution cont=\r\ninues.\n          Remember, there is very little according to me which is bl=\r\nack magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher =\r\nshakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your po=\r\nwer will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the deat=\r\nh of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was ori=\r\nginally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these beings=\r\n. \n          Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto =\r\nthe heads of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detrim=\r\nent( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Sha=\r\nkti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black mag=\r\nic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal pe=\r\nrson, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed=\r\n maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifyi=\r\nng with the universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself=\r\n attacks you, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identif=\r\nication, ie God or the universe).\n          If people persist in using the =\r\nShakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shak=\r\nti which can be used, moreover then their minds and intellects will not be =\r\nfree of identification with the body and so their actions are those which a=\r\nre generally termed as black magic. These people usually join the same spir=\r\nits which they have been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experi=\r\nence.\n          Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifet=\r\nimes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a s=\r\nadhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous=\r\n effort).\n          On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in th=\r\nis lifetime may feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial=\r\n and may not acheive in this lifetime.\n          According to me the proof =\r\nof the pudding is in the eating, so let me suggest an easy sadhana.\n       =\r\n   If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 reitition=\r\ns of the Savitri(some call this the Gayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidden=\r\n) every day, main constraints\n          Same time every day.\n          Same=\r\n place.\n          Same materials.\n          Same direction.\n          As li=\r\nttle movement as one can.\n          Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your =\r\ninclination.\n          Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body=\r\n, not just the body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n          Do not ea=\r\nt 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty before you start.=\r\n\n          Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n=\r\n          See the difference in your personality before and after.\n        =\r\n  Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some =\r\nsadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically possibl=\r\ne.\n          I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being di=\r\nscussed.\n\n          Kind Love and Regards\n          manish\n          You ma=\r\ny post this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel that this is=\r\n suitable.\n\n          On Sun, Mar 1, 2009 at 10:12 PM, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao=\r\n &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n            Dear Sanjay,\n\n            &gt; Mantra S=\r\nhastra is a very detailed work and includes mantra dosha etc.\n            &gt;=\r\n It is very scientific and accurate. It takes a lifetime to master this. \n\n=\r\n            Some may be fascinated by the texture, color and volume of the =\r\nchaff and miss the grain.\n\n            Most people who talk about mantra sh=\r\nastra focus on the chaff and not on the grain.\n\n            &gt; You talk of b=\r\negging God vs commanding God? Now where did that come from?\n            &gt; H=\r\now is it related to what is under discussion. Perhaps I have missed many\n  =\r\n          &gt; mails and am not able to get the context. Trying to command God=\r\n is\n            &gt; *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable to say the least. Th=\r\ne attitude should\n            &gt; always be that of a beggar in front of God.=\r\n If anyone has said otherwise, I\n            &gt; also disagee with him/her.\n\n=\r\n            I mentioned the above with respect to the need of thousands of =\r\nmantras and technicalities. If one does not want to command god and wants t=\r\no be a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no need for thousan=\r\nds of mantras and all the umpteen technicalities. These thousands of mantra=\r\ns and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of different resu=\r\nlts from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this =\r\ncommanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I will elaborat=\r\ne.\n\n            Also, commanding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low lev=\r\nel beings is black magic, which can be accomplished even by a person not qu=\r\nite elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy ego. However, commandin=\r\ng higher beings such as gods is possible only for a spiritually elevated pe=\r\nrson with no or extremely small ego. This commanding that I am referring to=\r\n is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only=\r\n a person succeeding in completely effacing individual ego can achieve this=\r\n commanding! I will repeat something from the previous mail to clarify:\n\n  =\r\n          The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many being=\r\ns and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between=\r\n them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able t=\r\no perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts =\r\nbut the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences =\r\nthe mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then ca=\r\nuses internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (sp=\r\necific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the=\r\n universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n\n =\r\n           Each set of &quot;karmic interactions between various objects&quot; is a &quot;=\r\nresult&quot;. Various mantras are for various &quot;results&quot;. One may term merging se=\r\nlf-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific result from it as &quot;co=\r\nmmanding a result&quot; from god. Whether you like the term or not, it is essent=\r\nially that.\n\n            *        *        *\n\n            But the bottomlin=\r\ne is this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command speci=\r\nfic results from god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but act=\r\ning as an unattached instrument of Nature fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set by Na=\r\nture). Various mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishi=\r\ns are meant for such sadhakas.\n\n            Those are hardly of use to so m=\r\nany people out there with dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They=\r\n cannot command specific results from god (because of their heavy attachmen=\r\nt to the result, which is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited =\r\nego), even if they use all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the ass=\r\nociated rules of astrology. Instead of wasting their time with these techni=\r\ncalities, they will be better off learning to be good beggars at God&#39;s door=\r\n.\n\n            Just pick any prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracte=\r\nd to, without worrying about so many technicalities, and learn to be humble=\r\n and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait for him to give you what you wan=\r\nt. Like a beggar, take whatever and whenever he gives.\n\n            Keep pr=\r\naying every day or every second when you are able to. Even when you are not=\r\n praying, remember him in all of your actions. When you enjoy something in =\r\nthe material world, tell yourself that it is his and that he gave it to you=\r\n. If you remember him all the time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start=\r\n to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important t=\r\nhan picking the right mantra, right weekday, right tithi etc (that too base=\r\nd on unreliable knowledge coming from questionable sources!).\n\n            =\r\n*        *        *\n\n            There may be a mountain with thousands of =\r\npaths (mantra) for climbing it. Each path may lead to a different spot (dif=\r\nferent experience) on the top and show a different scenery (result). Expert=\r\n advisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific path (mantra) to see=\r\n a specific scenery (result). But such advice is useless to a handicapped p=\r\nerson without legs (a selfish person with dense ego). It is relevant only t=\r\no person with legs and one who is strong and sturdy, who can successfully c=\r\nlimb the mountain (a reasonably detached person with very little ego).\n\n   =\r\n         Even when you encounter a person who has legs and can actually cli=\r\nmb the mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and trav=\r\nerse the long path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers who are=\r\n bogged down by all the technicalities and people who take customized mantr=\r\na advice from astrologers and think that they will get a result quickly by =\r\ndoing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing the basic point. The power of a po=\r\nwerful mantra is with respect to the experience and result obtained *after*=\r\n one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is akin to a=\r\n path leading to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a particula=\r\nrly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to survive th=\r\ne climb along the long path.\n\n            We need to emphasize the attitude=\r\n and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the choice=\r\n of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great spir=\r\nitual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize pickin=\r\ng the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having =\r\nthe correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persisten=\r\nce, discipline, humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and useful =\r\nthan trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress =\r\ngod.\n\n            *        *        *\n\n            &gt; when should the worshi=\r\np of a graha be done? Let us say someone\n            &gt; wishes to worship Ma=\r\nrs (Mangala graha). When do you think this\n            &gt; worship should be =\r\ndone?\n             \n            You can do anyday. Parasara does not mentio=\r\nn any day for doing homam to a graha.\n\n            In fact, if one wants, o=\r\nne can do a homam or worship to Mars (or any planet) every day. It is even =\r\nbetter that way.\n\n            If an astrologer suggests doing it on a Tuesd=\r\nay, it is fine. But saying that doing it on so and so day will bring seriou=\r\ns dangers because Mars is an enemy of so and so planet would be stretching =\r\nthings.\n\n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishn=\r\na dvaipaayana) got his\n            &gt; knowledge and those who wrote it as sc=\r\nribes for him, where did they get it from?\n             \n            From S=\r\nelf - from within. That is the source of all knowledge. A sadguru need not =\r\nspecifically teach thousand things, but needs to open the door inside.\n\n   =\r\n         *        *        *\n\n            &gt; OK, just spell it out. What is =\r\nthe reason for Gandanta being in 0 deg,\n            &gt; 120 deg and 240 deg o=\r\nf the zodiac if it is not a junction between agni\n            &gt; and jala...=\r\nI want to her your words if you have any.\n\n            Parasara&#39;s definitio=\r\nn of gandanta is restricted to two neighboring areas in a contiguous space =\r\nhaving a predominance of fire and water elements. &quot;I see fire and I see wat=\r\ner. So there is gandanta&quot; is a wrong approach. One can then call Venus, a w=\r\natery planet, being in a fiery sign or Mars, a fiery planet, being in a wat=\r\nery sign as gandanta. Gandanta requires a *transition* in a contiguous spac=\r\ne.\n\n            In your example of upapada lord&#39;s tithi, there is no contig=\r\nuous space where there is a water-fire transition.\n\n            &gt; Now somew=\r\nhere you talked of wasting time!!!

OK, just spell it out. What is the r=\r\neason for Gandanta being in 0 deg, 120 deg and 240 deg of the zodiac if it =\r\nis not a junction between agni and jala...I want to her your words if you h=\r\nave any. You keep saying Parasara says so and yet there is nothing forthcom=\r\ning.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; The rashi is associated with the Aditya a=\r\ns the rashi come into existence because of the Sun, which is the agni tattv=\r\na. Vara is also agni tattva among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That is why Va=\r\nara is related to rashi. Karma has been advised in the vaara of the lords o=\r\nf the rashi or the hora of the lords of the rashi related to a bhaava and f=\r\nor this reason, fasting and other such karma related to rashi are also base=\r\nd on this. [See Prashna Marga for details].\n            &gt; \n            &gt; Mo=\r\non is the significator of the Aroodha. It is the *emotional content* relate=\r\nd to the maya manifestation of everything in life. Suffering is caused as w=\r\ne do not fathom the karma associated that resulted in suffering and fasting=\r\n is a a means of self punishment and correction related to the raashi where=\r\n the aroodha is. Just as Agni has the purity to burn the root of sin, fasti=\r\nng on vaara related to the UL is surely going to cleanse the sins associate=\r\nd with the suffering in it. While this may not give a 100% satisfaction as =\r\nthe *moon* content has not been addressed, at least the initiation of the a=\r\nroodha occurs and people find their partners, get married and get along wit=\r\nh life. Proof lies in the pudding and with so many cases where people have =\r\nfasted on UL days and have got result, we have found faith in these teachin=\r\ngs reinforced. Why fast? Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting the flaw=\r\n associated with the raashi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it is related t=\r\no the material effects of the bhava and that is what people are looking for=\r\n when they come to th astrologer. You have done well to recall my teachings=\r\n in this =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C remember what I taught =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=80=9C Men should worship a female deity and women shold worship a male dei=\r\nty for the UL fasting. I wonder if they really follow this.\n            &gt; \n=\r\n            &gt; Why not give fasting at night instead of day? Sun is always g=\r\nood for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) and that is why we have limited this to d=\r\nay fasting and not night fasting as well or 24 hour fast. This is my interp=\r\nolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders would have given long periods of fast start=\r\ning from the vaara, like keeping 21 days fast for the birth of child! You t=\r\nhink I should be doing that! You think anyone will lsiten. Try it yourself =\r\nbefore asking me to advise those hard penance kind of fasts.\n            &gt; =\r\n\n            &gt; Who says the Moon has nothing to do with the arudha. It is t=\r\nhe sustainer. Now people to an astrologer when they are looking for getting=\r\n married and hardly anyone comes these days asking for prolonging marriage.=\r\n Either they want to get into one or get out of one and into another...astr=\r\nologers these days are relegated to helping people make these transitions p=\r\nainless and fast.

His section on remedial measures is full of various h=\r\nomas. I am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I a=\r\nm in fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by t=\r\nhemselves.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] what about the Puran=\r\nas? Have you gone through the Navagraha mantras given in the Garuda Purana =\r\nand other puranic literature?\n            &gt; \n            &gt; Parasara did *no=\r\nt* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (e.g. planetary hom=\r\nas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola=\r\n dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. =\r\nBut the days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart.\n           =\r\n &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya dosha is to be performed on Am=\r\navasya, when should the worship of a graha be done?

I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thi=\r\nnking. There may be a little difference between doing an austerity on diffe=\r\nrent days, but my point is that it is smaller compared to the difference be=\r\ntween doing and not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does no=\r\nt cause danger as being suggested.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rat=\r\nh:] I am sorry.

For =\r\nworshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is bette=\r\nr than others. This is based on the deity and irrespective of the person wo=\r\nrshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man comes out with more money =\r\nto give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is better off going and begg=\r\ning on that day.

J\n      =\r\n      &gt; \n            &gt; Choosing the day of a remedy based on the deity is m=\r\nore important and the variations based on individual horoscope are less imp=\r\nortant. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variations. But they are sm=\r\naller and, more importantly, I question if they are actually well-understoo=\r\nd by astrologers today to apply *reliably*.

I question w=\r\nhether the new theory on fasting is really in line with everything you have=\r\n learnt (and taught).\n\n            BTW, I specifically asked for a clarific=\r\nation on whether this was based on your own thinking or from classics/param=\r\npara (see quoted mail below for the full context).

Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is l=\r\nimited and we should take our limitations into consideration.\n\n            =\r\nThe universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many=\r\n objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Acc=\r\nordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectl=\r\ny control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the ma=\r\nntra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra=\r\n. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes inter=\r\nnal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to =\r\nthe mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe =\r\nand corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n\n           =\r\n However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to=\r\n one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to absorb the min=\r\nd fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is =\r\nquite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers are extrem=\r\nely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience any mantra a=\r\nnd mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.\n\n            *    =\r\n    *        *\n\n            Just repeating a combination of sounds does not=\r\n guarantee anything. Some people may think that certain results come when t=\r\nhey repeat a mantra certain number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A=\r\n mantra may work for one person quickly and another may spend the whole lif=\r\ne chanting it and nothing may happen. Absorption of the entire mind into a =\r\nmantra is needed for a mantra to really work and it is much more difficult =\r\nthan one may think.\n\n            *        *        *\n\n            A highly =\r\nlearned scholar in the court of a king may be able to command the king and =\r\nget whatever he wants from king. An incapable one is better off begging the=\r\n king, rather than trying to command (and failing for sure).\n\n            S=\r\nimilarly, most people are better off begging god for what they want rather =\r\nthan trying to use the right mantra to command what they want. A beggar doe=\r\ns not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of =\r\nhumility and helplessness, surrender, patience and persistence are what hel=\r\np a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude rather than knowledge=\r\n. In this age and time, best bet for most people is to learn to be a good b=\r\neggar at god&#39;s door.\n\n            What people today need for material and s=\r\npiritual progress through remedial measures is a better attitude in begging=\r\n god rather than a better choice of tools such as mantras and other specifi=\r\ncs such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific result from god.\n\n     =\r\n       It is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers who came in=\r\n the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right mantra based o=\r\nn horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct attitude - sur=\r\nrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, humility e=\r\ntc. *That* is a lot more important and useful than trying to be oversmart w=\r\nith the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n\n            *        * =\r\n       *\n\n            One more thing. We have many mantras given by rishis,=\r\n but the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra based=\r\n on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not operate solely=\r\n based on them. They use all kinds of other rules coming from various tradi=\r\ntions. They are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most scriptures =\r\nassociate various mantras with various results, irrespective of horoscope. =\r\nFor example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A=\r\n6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt control. And so o=\r\nn. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s astrologers, way beyond th=\r\ne scope of Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n\n            If one has a sadguru, I reco=\r\nmmend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theore=\r\ntician.\n\n            If not, there is no foolproof way to know the right pa=\r\nth. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to=\r\n) instead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latte=\r\nr is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god&#39;s door.=\r\n Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in b=\r\neing a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than grea=\r\nt scholars.\n\n            Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchaksha=\r\nri, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krishna mah=\r\na mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra etc) ca=\r\nn help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Without the ri=\r\nght attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.\n\n         =\r\n   *        *        *\n\n            I hope this sufficiently clarifies my s=\r\ntand. I discuss these matters related to spiritual sadhana more on the vedi=\r\nc-wisdom yahoogroup.

Which is =\r\nperfectly in line with everything I have learnt.\n\n              Two stateme=\r\nnts you have made contradict standard texts on Jyotish and Mantra Shastra. =\r\nPlease correct me if I am not understanding you well out here -\n\n          =\r\n    1. Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as th=\r\ne sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to. Results mayb=\r\ne a bit delayed but will be there.\n              2. Statement 2: *reciting =\r\nany prayer* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy=\r\n\n\n              Is this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?\n\n=\r\n              Statement 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra =\r\nis bogus and has no relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasa=\r\nra and others to be done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much con=\r\nsequence. This sounds like another astrologer I had known some time back wh=\r\nose statements like this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so=\r\n that people are not misled but such pretexts to knowledge.\n\n              =\r\nStatement 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless and t=\r\nhe Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantr=\r\nas for the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman=\r\n when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying that we can take p=\r\naracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have to write a boo=\r\nk on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic seers.\n\n        =\r\n      I think there is something wrong in the way you are saying what you w=\r\nant to say.

The basic point is that Up=\r\napada is a rashi and carries energy\n              &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If=\r\n you fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n              &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, y=\r\nou are bringing the jala energy to vara, and gandanta may\n              &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n    =\r\n          &gt; \n              &gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara onl=\r\ny and not that of the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n   =\r\n           &gt; \n              &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by=\r\n Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Nar=\r\nasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n              &gt; \n              &gt; A=\r\nfter all, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the ele=\r\nment of water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Ven=\r\nus (water) is the karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marria=\r\nge is represented by water element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings th=\r\ne element of water (prosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One =\r\ncould even say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited =\r\nas it brings the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and=\r\n causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n              &gt; \n              &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is t=\r\nhe Maya and is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is=\r\n the creator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates everything throug=\r\nh the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are created by her due to the lor=\r\ndships of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will=\r\n be a *more correct* answer.\n              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n       =\r\n       [Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are represented by Sun=\r\n (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n\n              Thus, 12th=\r\n house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creator in the field of=\r\n maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and S=\r\nhiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) should actually be as=\r\nsociated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the t=\r\nripod method in dasa judgment.\n\n              Thus, it is actually more log=\r\nical to say that 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and=\r\n UL and UL lord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n\n              Is the above=\r\n &quot;*more correct* answer&quot; based on your own thinking or is it from a classic=\r\n or from tradition?\n\n              &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n            &gt;=\r\n The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more ef=\r\nfective than at other times. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on =\r\ndigestion or speech will enable far more effective mantra meditation. So fa=\r\nst or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of=\r\n the mantra.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree wit=\r\nh this. Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On da=\r\nys when one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to bur=\r\nn and churn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is=\r\n many many times better than complete fasting.\n\n            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quot=\r\ne &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n            [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is des=\r\ntined to expend some energy on digestion after all and not focus all energy=\r\n on the mantra. But the bottomline is that shastras say that one should med=\r\nitate either without or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In a=\r\nny case, I hope we agree that meditation sessions after heavy eating are he=\r\navily restrained in effectiveness.\n\n            &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n=\r\n            &gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta conce=\r\npts is quite illogical.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is n=\r\not stretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=80=9C the interface between fire and water. Put a burning match in a glass=\r\n of water, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s i=\r\nn the chart but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya a=\r\nnd Tula.\n\n            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n            [Narasimha] Putt=\r\ning a burning match in a glass of water does indeed kill fire. But the ques=\r\ntion is of contact. If I am thinking of fire in my mind while standing in w=\r\nater, it does not kill the fire. There is no contact.\n\n            My point=\r\n is that the examples given have no real identifiable contact between water=\r\n and fire.\n\n            One can be creative and come up with a lot of theor=\r\nies. For example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all r=\r\nasis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as agni rasis and som=\r\ne as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon and Venus cause c=\r\nontact between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on the weekdays of =\r\nthe dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta and serious danger.\n\n    =\r\n        It is not enough to show some fire and some water. See what counts =\r\nas contact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical extrapolations.\n\n      =\r\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n            &gt; Three years back you said yo=\r\nu are leaving jyotish....then again you told me two years back and again re=\r\ncently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is getting very evident that *j=\r\nyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyotish is PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different levels of their understanding =\r\nand intelligence. \n\n            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n            [Naras=\r\nimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one&#39;s cannot be taken away. And one can=\r\nnot cling on to what is not one&#39;s. Some rejoice when it seems like somethin=\r\ng comes and cry when it seems like something leaves. Some impassionately ob=\r\nserve as things seem to come and go and do what they see as their dharma wi=\r\nth the things they seem to have.\n\n            Just a factual correction tho=\r\nugh\n            : I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years after=\r\n my spiritual master entered my life, my interest in other things went down=\r\n (though I continued to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadhana =\r\nintensified. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However, m=\r\ny guru gave me a task later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Parasar=\r\na independently, meditate on them and share my interpretations with the wor=\r\nld. He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, and he =\r\nwanted me to do the same now but dispassionately and without an attachment.=\r\n He felt that I still have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wants me t=\r\no do it as an unattached karma. His word is everything for me.\n\n           =\r\n What I told you recently is not that I was leaving Jyotish but what I said=\r\n above.\n\n            However, if your judgment is correct and if Jyotish is=\r\n indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure my spiritual guru will realize it sooner or=\r\n later and change his command to me.\n\n            &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n \n            &gt; I can categorically declare one thing with utmost confidenc=\r\ne. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (=\r\nremain silent) on that weekday or tithi and meditate with a particular mant=\r\nra (any) at the end of the day. You can take a vow to keep that practice fo=\r\nr a certain duration of time (say, a few months or years) for a specific pu=\r\nrpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for the duration. If brahmacharya can =\r\nbe kept for the duration of the vrata, there is nothing like it!\n          =\r\n  &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but then you se=\r\nem to be saying that the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is of not=\r\n much relevance. Of course you are right as it will be spiritually benefici=\r\nal. For example, a person wishing to marry should not fast on UL days and s=\r\nhould choose any day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all tithi are th=\r\ne same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few =\r\ndays, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you=\r\n did not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you =\r\nare wrong, so I agree that what you say is right.\n\n            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End q=\r\nuote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n            [Narasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.\n\n       =\r\n     Is all that is being taught and practiced now strictly from &quot;Puranas a=\r\nnd other teachings of the seers&quot;?\n\n            I did not say all days and t=\r\nithis are the same. Of course, there is some difference. But, it is not as =\r\nbig as being made here.\n\n            To make khoa, whether one uses cow mil=\r\nk or buffalo milk or milk of a brown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or =\r\nanother cow does make some difference. But it is secondary. To say that &quot;da=\r\nnger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot; (see the quoted mails for such claims) can be ca=\r\nused by a wrong choice is wrong. To say that a wrong choice means khoa will=\r\n take 100 years to make is also a gross exaggeration.\n\n            The main=\r\n thing is that you need milk and sugar. If one is confused by endless claim=\r\ns of khoa making consultants and ends up not making khoa at all, that will =\r\nbe sad. In such a case, one can simply pick some milk or the other, take su=\r\ngar and start cooking khoa. It will take an extra half hour, but the job wi=\r\nll be done.\n\n            I request Jyotishis to behave responsibly and humb=\r\nly and not engage in scare-mongering and say that a speicifc austerity (fas=\r\nting on a specific weekday or tithi in a chart) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;ser=\r\nious doshas&quot;. No wonder some spiritual teachers look down upon Jyotish and =\r\ndismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and self-importance from us does not h=\r\nelp our cause!\n\n            Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us not oversel=\r\nl it or overplay the importance...\n\n            &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n=\r\n            &gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, austerities l=\r\nike prayers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any ha=\r\nrm. If your body can take fasting, you can do it on any weekday or tithi wi=\r\nthout too many calculations.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Br=\r\nahmacharya is good for someone planning to have a baby or one who cannot co=\r\nnceive and this is kept for some period before the appointed date of nishek=\r\na. Brahmacharya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence=\r\n from physical union as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so different.\n\n            =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n            [Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is=\r\n much more, but also very difficult for most. Even physical celibacy is a g=\r\nood enough austerity. Physical celibacy over an extended period of time inc=\r\nreases the efficacy of other austerities such as fasting, mouna vrata, medi=\r\ntation and homam.\n\n            Best regards,\n            Narasimha\n        =\r\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    =\r\n        Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n   =\r\n         Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana=\r\n\n            Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n     =\r\n       Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n     =\r\n       Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n    =\r\n        Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n   =\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n \n             \n            --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sanjay Rath&quot; &lt;=\r\nsjrath@...&gt; wrote:\n            &gt;\n            &gt; om paramesthi gurave namah\n =\r\n           &gt; \n            &gt; Dear Narasimha\n            &gt; \n            &gt; Jus=\r\nt added a few thoughts and questions since we are on the topic of spiritual=\r\nity, which is not my forte.

J Any difference?\n=\r\n            &gt; \n            &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point and view about the quest=\r\nion raised. 2nd bhava is\n            &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, sustainer,=\r\n and if we fast on the day of UL in\n            &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we bring =\r\ninsult to Vishnu who provides the food for us.\n            &gt; \n            &gt;=\r\n My dear Zoran, please allow me to express my disagreement.\n            &gt; \n=\r\n            &gt; Austerities can never be seen as an insult to Vishnu. Self-de=\r\nprivation of 2nd house matters such as food (fasting) or speech (mouna vrat=\r\na - vow of silence) are austerities. Giving up food or speech is not an ins=\r\nult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e. brahmacharya) is not an insult to=\r\n Sukracharya (Venus).\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I though =\r\nBrahma was very angry that his sons decided not to have progeny and stayed =\r\ncelibate. So He created others. Why was Brahma angry when his sons remained=\r\n celibate? Why should Sukracharya be angry if someone is celibate? How is i=\r\nt an insult or not an insult to Sukracharya? You are taking planet signific=\r\nation of Venus for 7H ...and linking this to creation process...which is wr=\r\nong Narasimha. Brahma is seen from lords of dusthana 6, 8 and 12 from lagna=\r\n or 7th which is....you know this.There is nothing wrong with the 7th house=\r\n as it is necessary for procreation. It is only the link of this with the B=\r\nrahma graha that causes it to become a serious shad-ripu. Married people ar=\r\ne as eligible for moksha as unmarried ones and bachelors. It depends on the=\r\n following of dharma and ashrama.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; Various gods=\r\n bestow various things on us, some at the gross physical level and some at =\r\nthe subtle spiritual level. As we overcome our dependendency on gross thing=\r\ns, we make progress at the subtle level.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; If on=\r\ne eats food, a good amount of internal fire (and subtle internal energy ass=\r\nociated with it) is used for digesting it and for generating physical energ=\r\ny from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy is unused and available for oth=\r\ner things. This is a tremendous benefit. As a result, one can better digest=\r\n mantras and spiritual food available all around one.\n            &gt; \n      =\r\n      &gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far =\r\nmore effective than at other times. The conservation of energy otherwise sp=\r\nent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective mantra meditation=\r\n. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the ef=\r\nfect of the mantra.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not ag=\r\nree with this. Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise=\r\n. On days when one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach=\r\n to burn and churn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aaha=\r\nara) is many many times better than complete fasting.\n            &gt; \n      =\r\n      &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be honest, I have not heard this about 2nd lord an=\r\nd\n            &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and =\r\ncarries energy\n            &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ru=\r\nled by tithi of the 2nd\n            &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala =\r\nenergy to vara, and gandanta may\n            &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may c=\r\nome into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; Wh=\r\ny does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that of the tithi????=\r\n Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanj=\r\nay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by Surya and for doing so Surya took =\r\n12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happe=\r\nning?\n            &gt; \n            &gt; After all, Rudra rules over the element =\r\nof fire and Gouri rules over the element of water and one worships Gouri at=\r\n the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka for marriage. =\r\nSo one could even say that UL/marriage is represented by water element and =\r\nfasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (prosperity and well=\r\n-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that fasting on the week=\r\nday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings the fire element represent=\r\ned by weekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n            &gt; \n    =\r\n        &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi N=\r\narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...just as the mother=\r\n Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the graha, all the arudha a=\r\nre created by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the ti=\r\nthi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n            &gt; =\r\n\n            &gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta conc=\r\nepts is quite illogical.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is =\r\nnot stretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=80=9C the interface between fire and water. Put a burning match in a glass=\r\n of water, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s i=\r\nn the chart but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya a=\r\nnd Tula.\n            &gt; \n            &gt; Now one more thing: Marriage is a yog=\r\na between two souls and why not suggest fasting on the yoga day of the UL l=\r\nord?\n            &gt; \n            &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] What! What a brilliant sug=\r\ngestion...why don=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t you start it?  \n            &gt; \n =\r\n           &gt; * * *\n            &gt; \n            &gt; &gt; Now suppose instead of 11=\r\nth house if Mercury goes to 12th house or 4 \n            &gt; &gt; house then you=\r\n cannot choose Dwadashi or Chaturthi for the same \n            &gt; &gt; because =\r\nthese thithis are ruled by Mercury only and fasting on these \n            &gt;=\r\n &gt; tithis will\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
