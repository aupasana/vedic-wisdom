Not being able to perform this wo=\r\nnderful homam everyday, I am not able to get the mantras byheart and always=\r\n have to keep referencing the manual as I do homam, which is kind of inconv=\r\nenient. I thought of solution to get around this. I want to take up a manda=\r\nla deeksha of doing the homam everyday for 41 days (hopefully get it byhear=\r\nt by the end of it), culminating in Vinayaka Chaturthi that falls on Septem=\r\nber 11th, Saturday, this year. Is my calculation right? I have Jagannatha H=\r\nora software to determine what date is Bhadrapada Shukla Chaturthi in Michi=\r\ngan, USA. Is my approach right? \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. The purpose of doing this homam is=\r\n for myself to have more clarity on spiritual matters (and nothing else). F=\r\nrom time to time I keep getting into several internal debates in my mind as=\r\n to what is right / wrong even when I am interpreting great books like Srim=\r\nadbhagavadgita. In the recent past I am trying to involve myself in an inte=\r\nnse study of this great scripture and keep getting all kinds of Dharma Sand=\r\nehas (just like Arjuna did) and I think the only way one will have the kind=\r\n of understanding that Arjuna had at the end of it, is only after having a =\r\nfull darshana of the lord (in whichever life it happens). So, in my opinion=\r\n, only Sadhana can lead to some real answers for the questions we keep gett=\r\ning from time to time as we read these confusing scriptures. Am I thinking =\r\nin the right direction?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In \n&gt; vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yes, this is a reasonable substitute for Satya Narayana vratam. If=\r\n you want, you could add aahutis for loka palakas also (OM gaNapataye swaah=\r\naa, OM brahmaNe swaahaa, OM lakShmyai swaahaa, OM viShNave swaahaa, OM rudr=\r\naaya swaahaa, OM gauryai swaahaa).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Manish specifically mentioned =\r\nto me that Ganapathi homam, Chandi homam and Vishnu sahasra naama homam are=\r\n very important in this age and we need several people doing them regularly=\r\n. Ganapathi homam and Chandi homam seem to have caught on and a critical ma=\r\nss of people are already doing them. This will only increase with time. I h=\r\nope Vishnu sahasra naama homam also catches on. Many people know how to cha=\r\nnt Vishnu sahasra naama stotra and doing a homam with it adds only 10 minut=\r\nes to the chanting time! Of course, if one wants to make it longer, one can=\r\n repeat a few times.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Vishnu&#39;s 1000 name prayer is very powerful a=\r\nnd charges one with saattwik energy, a sense of dharma and purpose in life.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short=\r\n Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\n&gt; &gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n   Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;   Jyotish w=\r\nritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ----------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---- &quot;nagraj@=\r\n...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Everyone, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am really h=\r\nappy to inform you all that we performed Sri Vishnu Homam at my Friend&#39;s pl=\r\nace recently. One of my friends bought a house recently and wanted me to pe=\r\nrform Ganapathi Homam and Sudarsana Homam. But since I did not know how to =\r\ndo a Sudarsana homam and more over I was not inclined to get details on Sud=\r\narsana homam since it was discussed by Shri Narasimha here before as a homa=\r\nm for a weapon, I prefered to do a more satvik homam like VishnuHomam and s=\r\nuggested the same. They agreed and we first did a Ganapathi Homam and then =\r\nproceeded to do a Vishnu Homam after a short break. Indeed it was a great e=\r\nxperience that while reciting Vishnu Sahasranamam and offering Ahutis, the =\r\nfire has risen really nicely (almost upto a foot and half in height with ju=\r\nst three dry coconut-halves and it was a wonderful sight). This is very sim=\r\nilar to Satyanarayana vratam that we offer ahutis to navagrahas, do the reg=\r\nular dikpalaka pooja etc. Except for the &#39;Pancha Loka Palaka Pooja&#39; and the=\r\n five stories after the vratam, I find that in Vishnu homam, all the essent=\r\nials are still covered. I find that this Homam is a good substitute (and ta=\r\nkes lesser time) than Satyanarayana Vratam, if one is falling short of time=\r\n! Am I right, Sri Narasimha?\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
