In t=\r\nhis birth, reborn Y will encounter a situation where he can be mad at rebor=\r\nn X and hit reborn X. If reborn Y does it, it will be a payback for X&#39;s pre=\r\nvious karma, FROM the perspective of reborn X.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; However, it is a fresh karma from the perspective of reborn Y, if reborn=\r\n Y *identified* with that action, i.e. if the limited I-ness of reborn Y fe=\r\nlt the emotions associated with that action and &quot;engaged&quot; in the action. If=\r\n Y is a liberated being with no limited I-ness engaging in actions non-voli=\r\ntionally, then no new karma is generated for Y.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Until one overcomes attachment to a limited I-ness, all of one&#39;s action=\r\ns generate new karmas.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://S=\r\naraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp; Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- =\r\nwisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http:/=\r\n/groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ------------ ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- On Fri=\r\n, 1/15/10, vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore @...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; From: vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore @...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [vedic-wisdom] Unforgivable Karmas-3 Vimalananda&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;=\r\nnofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ y=\r\nahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Date: Friday, January 15, 2010, 7:09 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;       Narasimha Ji&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have just finished reading the thir=\r\nd book &quot; the law of karma &quot; by Aghori Vimalananda . It is no doubt as you s=\r\naid written by a great being . Vimalananda in his book mentions three karma=\r\ns which cannot be easily gotten rid of and are very terrible by nature and =\r\nmight take an immense amount of lifetimes to even clear.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The two I remember are Killing of one&#39;s guru and rape =\r\n. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Now the doubt that has arisen in =\r\nmy mind is this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1.How do we know whe=\r\nther a thing that is happening now is an reaction to an past action or a fr=\r\nesh action being set forth in this lifetime...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The learned gurujan&#39;s on the board might question ..Is there rea=\r\nlly a use by knowing that since either way the action is taking place and c=\r\nannot be stopped.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The reason I ask t=\r\nhis is  ...the mother goddess is described as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ati Soumyati Roudrayai Nathastasyai namo namah &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; She is the most pleasing among beautiful things an=\r\nd the most ferocious among terrible things ...There is no relative scale of=\r\n good or bad for nature ( Ramarkrishna&#39; s parable of Devi Kali bringing up =\r\na child and killing it ) ....I fully understand good or bad exists only in =\r\nthe human mind.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But if a certain act=\r\n right now is not happening as a reaction to a past act... What on earth ca=\r\nn possibly cause a person to do such a severe act.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; :( And how should one console a person who has undergone s=\r\nuch a punishment.. ..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One more reaso=\r\nn for me asking this is ...A lot of great gurus have always said &quot; Whatever=\r\n happening in the world right now is Mangala and the very form of Shiva him=\r\nself &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; How can I reconcile such acts=\r\n of violence happening in this kali yuga as Mangala especially some of the =\r\nhenious acts ....which brings back my original question...Are these happeni=\r\nng more in number in kali yuga as a reaction of the souls who needed this p=\r\nunishment being born in greater numbers now...or are these a fresh set of a=\r\ncts.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I do not know whether my questi=\r\nons would make sense.
