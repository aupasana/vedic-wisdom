Someone \nelse may have to first overcome his lust even to have a vision of the deity. \nWhat is good for goose is not good for gander. In general, it is good to try \nto overcome lust if it is possible.\n\nSeveral &quot;normal college going people&quot; were taken under his wings by \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa and transformed into spiritual giants. Swami \nVivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Yogananda etc were college students \nwhen they met Ramakrishna.\n\nBut it is not easy to overcome lust at all. Several of Ramakrishna&#39;s \ndisciples also struggled with it initially and overcame lust with his \nblessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and not at all easy to kill \ncompletely.\n\nIn the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go out of the mind. Set a \nrule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some period like that and \nmaintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.\n\nFeeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overcoming the basic \nproblem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n\n&gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root\n\nTrue, suppressing desire will make the desire come back later. But, if one \nkeeps fulfilling desires, they never end!!  This is the nature of desire. \nWhether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other than Self) or \nphysical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter how much one gets.\n\nRemoving desire from the root often requires suppressing the desire \ntemporarily. But the thing to remember from the Aghora book is that just \nsuppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing desires, but do \nremember that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep working on it.\n\n&gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if\n&gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n\nThat is the right spirit!\n\nSpiritual progress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is one thing. \nThe most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not become attached to \nthings. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions and \ndeveloping a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing.\n\nThere are several things in spiritual progress. They all come together! One \nperson may develop detachment to actions and possessions and brahmacharya \nmay become easy as a result. One person may achieve brahmacharya first and \ndetachment may become easy as a result and come later. Various signs of \nspiritual progress come almost together, but the exact order can change from \nperson to person. Thus, do not be disappointed by your inability to get \nsomething. It may be possible to work it out from another angle!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nNamaste sir\n\ni know you are lot busy but since i couldn;t ask this question on a\npublic forum as it may probably offend others.\nIf you have time ,if you could please reply.\n\nI was thinking this for many days\nthat as mentioned in recent thread on brahamcharya,\nit was important to maintain brahamcharya but i wanted to ask that\neven vimalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming lust though\nhe had his deity with him from the very early in life.\n\nhow can normal college going people like me who don&#39;t even have a\ndeity obtain this goal.\nThough i try to maintain physical brahamcharya for few months but\nafter that i am not able to hold it ,\nand even if i maintain some physical chastity it refuses to go out\nof mind\n\nMoreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\nsuppress desires but remove them from the root\n\nSo, how can i finish it completely from my mind\nThough i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of Brahamcharya\nbut i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progress in maintaing\nBrahamcharya\n\nand sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.\n\nThe only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\nvimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if\nnot in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n\nyou can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove my\nidentity from this that would be appreciable\n\nif what i worte offended you please delete this mail\n\nregards\n&lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
