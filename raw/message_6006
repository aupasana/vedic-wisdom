Even if =\r\nyou leave your\n&gt; room with &quot;Black Shades&quot; would be fine and actually more b=\r\neautiful :)\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Answers to your questions:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) YES. It is portable. =\r\nEvery day I adjust it near my window and after\n&gt; finishing homam, i take it=\r\n back little inside so that window can be closed.\n&gt; I am able to adjust it =\r\nmyself alone in just a few *seconds*.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galv=\r\nanized Iron) of 22 Gauge. This was\n&gt; manufactured by a Local EPC contractin=\r\ng company dealing in AC Duct\n&gt; installation. A Technical Supervisor of that=\r\n company is my close family\n&gt; friend. He did this for me. I suggest checkin=\r\ng with any Restaurants. They\n&gt; all are having such arrangements and they wo=\r\nuld be able to help you to\n&gt; contact such manufacturers.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) YES, becaus=\r\ne it is a Metal (GI Sheet) it gets quite heated up. One can\n&gt; not touch dur=\r\ning Homam. However, it also cools down quickly. Within half an\n&gt; hour after=\r\n Homam is finished, temperature of the chimney comes down to room\n&gt; tempera=\r\nture.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) It has a Metallic FAN at the end. I was starting that FAN only=\r\n when Fire\n&gt; goes of and lot of Smoke is generated. Reasons are as follows:=\r\n\n&gt; i)The fan is powerful and makes a lot of noise which disturbs\n&gt; concentr=\r\nation.\n&gt; ii) In the beginning, when Fire is very small, the powerful exhaus=\r\nt by the\n&gt; fan, disturbed the flames and sometimes extinguished it.\n&gt; 1ii) =\r\nWhen Fire is there in the Homam, one need not worry about smoke\n&gt; handling.=\r\n the reason is that the smoke naturally travels upward and it is\n&gt; automati=\r\ncally guided to the exit of the chimney. Once the fire becomes\n&gt; strong, it=\r\n generates vacuum around Homam kundam area and starts pulling\n&gt; outside air=\r\n. For instance, smoke from incense stick (Agarbatti), though\n&gt; outside of c=\r\nhimney and quite far away, actually gets diverted into the\n&gt; Chimney via sq=\r\nuare opening at the bottom. Hence during homam, FAN is not\n&gt; required.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\niv) Now very important thing. I used fan for many months (only at the end\n&gt;=\r\n of Homas). One day my fear proved right. Due to heat of chimney, the cable=\r\n\n&gt; of the Fan got burnt and there was a short-circuit. mccb tripped. Since =\r\nthen\n&gt; I am not using the Fan. You may have to go for Heat resistant cable =\r\nfor the\n&gt; FAN if you wish to use it but i am fine without using the fan in =\r\nmy chimney.\n&gt; Actually without Fan, The whole arrangement will become much =\r\nLighter and\n&gt; much easier to handle. Please also do not forget to make a su=\r\npport. You can\n&gt; see that in pictures which I have loaded. Support is a sep=\r\narate part\n&gt;\n&gt; (Please check the Picture of Fan which i have added in the P=\r\nhoto section)\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have further queries, please do not hesitate to as=\r\nk.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, G=\r\nirish Sundaram &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaskaram Phatakji,\n&gt; &gt; You k=\r\nnow what I am faced with the same problem that you had (and I am\n&gt; sure man=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; others doing regular homam do)..

I\n&gt; remember\n&gt; &gt; different fears i w=\r\nas having in my mind. I was then staying as a paying\n&gt; guest\n&gt; &gt; with a fam=\r\nily. though i had a separte room, i was not sure if they would\n&gt; allow\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nme to do something related to fire. that was the main worry. then there\n&gt; w=\r\nas self\n&gt; &gt; doubt concerning my ability to perform Homam but I decided to p=\r\nerform and\n&gt; did\n&gt; &gt; the first Homam which was Maha Ganapati homam on 1st d=\r\nay of Ashwin\n&gt; Navaraatri. I\n&gt; &gt; remember that i took me around 2.5 hours t=\r\notal including all the\n&gt; preparation\n&gt; &gt; after that rest of the 8 days, i p=\r\nerformed Chandi Homams. each Chandi\n&gt; homam took\n&gt; &gt; around 4 hours. I reme=\r\nmber that on the Ashtami day, some of My colleagues\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; family came =\r\nto see my chandi Homam and they told me that the smoke was\n&gt; even\n&gt; &gt; visib=\r\nle in the ground floor (The Apartment i was staying was on 4th) and\n&gt; there=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; were nice smell every where. The interesting thing is that Old lady of=\r\n\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; family actually co-operated with me. she used to help me in cutt=\r\ning Dray\n&gt; coconut\n&gt; &gt; in to small peices with knife. I cut my finger on se=\r\nveral occasions while\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; cutting coconuts for chandi homam. I used to of=\r\nfer the blood stained\n&gt; coconut\n&gt; &gt; peices in Chandi Homas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My all =\r\nprevious fears thus proved absolutely Non-existent. From the very\n&gt; first\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Homam, It was a smooth ride. I was exahusted after Navaratri and could\n&gt;=\r\n not\n&gt; &gt; continue and there was a break of a week or so. Then again i start=\r\ned\n&gt; daily Maha\n&gt; &gt; Ganapti Homam while learnt the technic of breaking Dry =\r\ncoconut halves by\n&gt; &gt; crushing it with both palms.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After few months=\r\n, I had to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tried to\n&gt; search\n&gt; &gt; for =\r\nit. few families rejected when i put the condition of doing Homam\n&gt; everyda=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; at last One christian family agreed for that. I paid bigger amount b=\r\nut\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; allowed me to do homam and i continued there for around 3 mon=\r\nths. during\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; time i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path eve=\r\nryday for 1 year.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; after 3 months, i started searching for my own se=\r\nparate Rental Apartment\n&gt; because\n&gt; &gt; my family was joining me. Again the s=\r\name concern (Prime) is to search for\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Apartment where there is no obst=\r\nacle to do Homam. I got a brand new\n&gt; apartment. I\n&gt; &gt; observed the flat an=\r\nd finalised the dealing. continued Homam every day\n&gt; for 1\n&gt; &gt; year. The wh=\r\nole flat became black. even the Home applicances liem\n&gt; refrigerator\n&gt; &gt; et=\r\nc.. were covered with black dust of Homa smoke. clothes in the\n&gt; wardrobe,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Openings of Central A/c etc... were all filled with black dust. My whol=\r\ne\n&gt; brand\n&gt; &gt; new apartment became dark due to the Homam. Smoke particles t=\r\nravelled to\n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; lungs and throat and i started coughing badly. I suffe=\r\nred with severe\n&gt; Cough for\n&gt; &gt; many months and there was pressure from nea=\r\nr ones to stop Homam or\n&gt; atleast\n&gt; &gt; perform it once every week. But there=\r\n was lot of determination provided\n&gt; by *some\n&gt; &gt; power* which i like to ca=\r\nll as &quot;Mother&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After 1 year in that Apartment, i started serching =\r\ndifferent place. I\n&gt; searched\n&gt; &gt; whole area and was looking for a apartmen=\r\nt which also has Balcony so that\n&gt; My\n&gt; &gt; homam goes smoothly without nmaki=\r\nng my whole aprtment look black and\n&gt; there are\n&gt; &gt; no more complaints from=\r\n my wife .\n&gt; &gt; I could not get one such perfect place which gives me a Blac=\r\nony and at\n&gt; the same\n&gt; &gt; time there are no buidlings in front which can ob=\r\nserve me doing homam in\n&gt; balcony\n&gt; &gt; and make a instant complaint to polic=\r\ne and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was\n&gt; very\n&gt; &gt; comfirtable and required opti=\r\non so that i can do it there and smoke\n&gt; handling\n&gt; &gt; becomes very easy but=\r\n at the same time it is also that much risky because\n&gt; any\n&gt; &gt; road-side pe=\r\nrson can complain seeing smoke comming out.\n&gt; &gt; Finally i got one aprtment =\r\nwithout balcony but with a special location.\n&gt; When i\n&gt; &gt; vacated the previ=\r\nous apartment, the owner&#39;e representative was\n&gt; shell-shocked\n&gt; &gt; looking a=\r\nt the condition of the apartment :) He told me over Phone -\n&gt; &quot;Aaap Kya\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n karata tha flat me?&quot;. He then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; compensation. I happily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal\n&gt; =\r\ninstaed\n&gt; &gt; of going to police station.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In new Apartment (current o=\r\nne), security is very tight. But I decided to\n&gt; make an\n&gt; &gt; arrangement so =\r\nthat i do not *spoil* condition of the Apartment. hence i\n&gt; came\n&gt; &gt; out wi=\r\nth the Idea of Chimney. (Please see the more pictures in photo\n&gt; section)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; and started doing Homam. Though the chimney is visible to neighbours and=\r\n\n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; flat owners, no body has complained till now. neither to polic=\r\ne nor to\n&gt; security\n&gt; &gt; personnel. Only once Security person cautiuoned me.=\r\n I stopped for a few\n&gt; days and\n&gt; &gt; started as usual. It is going on till t=\r\noday. I do not know about tomorrow\n&gt; but i\n&gt; &gt; do not worry. becuase after =\r\n2.5 years of experience, it is more than\n&gt; clear to me\n&gt; &gt; that It is not I=\r\n who is arranging all these but there is Mother behind\n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; these. SHE=\r\n is making my road clear so that i can perform Homam as i wish.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ***=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; The moral of the story is that if you genuinely desire to perform\n&gt; Ho=\r\nmam/Havan,\n&gt; &gt; then It will be done. No obstacle will stand on your way.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Do not fear. All the fears will break like Papads once you start walking\n=\r\n&gt; over\n&gt; &gt; them to do homam. i can swear for it!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No owner will kick=\r\n you out, No neighbour will call 9-1-1 and even if that\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; happens, ther=\r\ne will open a way!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; PS: Forgive me f=\r\nor spellings and Grammar!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ast=\r\nro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nanks very much for the photo.

Still brainstorming, though, as I can&#39;t install a fireplace in m=\r\ny condo (because I can&#39;t install a chimney).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;Warm regards,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Aditi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;O=\r\nn Tue, Mar 22, 2011 at 8:23 AM, vedic_pathak &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic_pathak@...&quot;&gt;vedic_pathak@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; MARGIN: 0px 0px =\r\n0px 0.8ex; PADDING-LEFT: 1ex&quot; class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROU=\r\nND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Namaskaram Girish Ji=\r\n,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good to know that you repainted your room twice. Even if you leave=\r\n your room with &quot;Black Shades&quot; would be fine and actually more be=\r\nautiful :)&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;Answers to your questions:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;1) YES. It is port=\r\nable. Every day I adjust it near my window and after finishing homam, i tak=\r\ne it back little inside so that window can be closed. I am able to adjust i=\r\nt myself alone in just a few *seconds*.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) It is made of G.I Sheets =\r\n(Galvanized Iron) of 22 Gauge. This was manufactured by a Local EPC contrac=\r\nting company dealing in AC Duct installation. A Technical Supervisor of tha=\r\nt company is my close family friend. He did this for me. I suggest checking=\r\n with any Restaurants. They all are having such arrangements and they would=\r\n be able to help you to contact such manufacturers.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;3) YES, becaus=\r\ne it is a Metal (GI Sheet) it gets quite heated up. One can not touch durin=\r\ng Homam. However, it also cools down quickly. Within half an hour after Hom=\r\nam is finished, temperature of the chimney comes down to room temperature. =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;4) It has a Metallic FAN at the end. I was starting that FAN only=\r\n when Fire goes of and lot of Smoke is generated. Reasons are as follows:&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;i)The fan is powerful and makes a lot of noise which disturbs concentrati=\r\non.&lt;br&gt;\n\nii) In the beginning, when Fire is very small, the powerful exhaus=\r\nt by the fan, disturbed the flames and sometimes extinguished it.&lt;br&gt;1ii) W=\r\nhen Fire is there in the Homam, one need not worry about smoke handling. th=\r\ne reason is that the smoke naturally travels upward and it is automatically=\r\n guided to the exit of the chimney. Once the fire becomes strong, it genera=\r\ntes vacuum around Homam kundam area and starts pulling outside air. For ins=\r\ntance, smoke from incense stick (Agarbatti), though outside of chimney and =\r\nquite far away, actually gets diverted into the Chimney via square opening =\r\nat the bottom. Hence during homam, FAN is not required.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;iv) Now ve=\r\nry important thing. I used fan for many months (only at the end of Homas). =\r\nOne day my fear proved right. Due to heat of chimney, the cable of the Fan =\r\ngot burnt and there was a short-circuit. mccb tripped. Since then I am not =\r\nusing the Fan. You may have to go for Heat resistant cable for the FAN if y=\r\nou wish to use it but i am fine without using the fan in my chimney.&lt;br&gt;\n\nA=\r\nctually without Fan, The whole arrangement will become much Lighter and muc=\r\nh easier to handle. Please also do not forget to make a support. You can se=\r\ne that in pictures which I have loaded. Support is a separate part&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;(Please check the Picture of Fan which i have added in the Photo section)&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have further queries, please do not hesitate to ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B=\r\nest Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utpal \n&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&lt;/a&gt;, Girish Sundaram &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Nam=\r\naskaram Phatakji,&lt;br&gt;&gt; You know what I am faced with the same problem th=\r\nat you had (and I am sure many &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; others doing regular homam do).. =\r\nBlack walls with smoke (I am doing this in my &lt;br&gt;&gt; own house so had to =\r\nrepaint the puja room couple of times :) )..

I remember &lt;br&gt;&gt; different fears i was having in my mind. I was then =\r\nstaying as a paying guest &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; with a family. though i had a separte =\r\nroom, i was not sure if they would allow &lt;br&gt;&gt; me to do something relate=\r\nd to fire. that was the main worry. then there was self &lt;br&gt;&gt; doubt conc=\r\nerning my ability to perform Homam but I decided to perform and did &lt;br&gt;\n\n&=\r\ngt; the first Homam which was Maha Ganapati homam on 1st day of Ashwin Nava=\r\nraatri. I &lt;br&gt;&gt; remember that i took me around 2.5 hours total including=\r\n all the preparation &lt;br&gt;&gt; after that rest of the 8 days, i performed Ch=\r\nandi Homams. each Chandi homam took &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; around 4 hours. I remember t=\r\nhat on the Ashtami day, some of My colleagues with &lt;br&gt;&gt; family came to =\r\nsee my chandi Homam and they told me that the smoke was even &lt;br&gt;&gt; visib=\r\nle in the ground floor (The Apartment i was staying was on 4th) and there &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&gt; were nice smell every where. The interesting thing is that Old la=\r\ndy of the &lt;br&gt;&gt; family actually co-operated with me. she used to help me=\r\n in cutting Dray coconut &lt;br&gt;&gt; in to small peices with knife. I cut my f=\r\ninger on several occasions while &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; cutting coconuts for chandi hom=\r\nam. I used to offer the blood stained coconut &lt;br&gt;&gt; peices in Chandi Hom=\r\nas.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; My all previous fears thus proved absolutely Non-exist=\r\nent. From the very first &lt;br&gt;&gt; Homam, It was a smooth ride. I was exahus=\r\nted after Navaratri and could not &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; continue and there was a break=\r\n of a week or so. Then again i started daily Maha &lt;br&gt;&gt; Ganapti Homam wh=\r\nile learnt the technic of breaking Dry coconut halves by &lt;br&gt;&gt; crushing =\r\nit with both palms.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; After few months, I had to look for an=\r\nother Sharing Apartment. I tried to search &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; for it. few families =\r\nrejected when i put the condition of doing Homam everyday. &lt;br&gt;&gt; at last=\r\n One christian family agreed for that. I paid bigger amount but they &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; allowed me to do homam and i continued there for around 3 months. during=\r\n that &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; time i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path everyday =\r\nfor 1 year.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; after 3 months, i started searching for my own=\r\n separate Rental Apartment because &lt;br&gt;&gt; my family was joining me. Again=\r\n the same concern (Prime) is to search for &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; Apartment where there=\r\n is no obstacle to do Homam. I got a brand new apartment. I &lt;br&gt;&gt; observ=\r\ned the flat and finalised the dealing. continued Homam every day for 1 &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; year. The whole flat became black. even the Home applicances liem refr=\r\nigerator &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; etc.. were covered with black dust of Homa smoke. cloth=\r\nes in the wardrobe, &lt;br&gt;&gt; Openings of Central A/c etc... were all filled=\r\n with black dust. My whole brand &lt;br&gt;&gt; new apartment became dark due to =\r\nthe Homam. Smoke particles travelled to my &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; lungs and throat and =\r\ni started coughing badly. I suffered with severe Cough for &lt;br&gt;&gt; many mo=\r\nnths and there was pressure from near ones to stop Homam or atleast &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; perform it once every week. But there was lot of determination provided b=\r\ny *some &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; power* which i like to call as &quot;Mother&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; After 1 year in that Apartment, i started serching different pl=\r\nace. I searched &lt;br&gt;&gt; whole area and was looking for a apartment which a=\r\nlso has Balcony so that My &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; homam goes smoothly without nmaking m=\r\ny whole aprtment look black and there are &lt;br&gt;&gt; no more complaints from =\r\nmy wife .&lt;br&gt;&gt; I could not get one such perfect place which gives me a B=\r\nlacony and at the same &lt;br&gt;&gt; time there are no buidlings in front which =\r\ncan observe me doing homam in balcony &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; and make a instant complai=\r\nnt to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was very &lt;br&gt;&gt; comfirtable and=\r\n required option so that i can do it there and smoke handling &lt;br&gt;&gt; beco=\r\nmes very easy but at the same time it is also that much risky because any &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&gt; road-side person can complain seeing smoke comming out.&lt;br&gt;&gt; F=\r\ninally i got one aprtment without balcony but with a special location. When=\r\n i &lt;br&gt;&gt; vacated the previous apartment, the owner&#39;e representative =\r\nwas shell-shocked &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; looking at the condition of the apartment :) H=\r\ne told me over Phone - &quot;Aaap Kya &lt;br&gt;&gt; karata tha flat me?&quot;. H=\r\ne then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the &lt;br&gt;&gt; compensation. I h=\r\nappily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal instaed &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; of=\r\n going to police station.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In new Apartment (current one), =\r\nsecurity is very tight. But I decided to make an &lt;br&gt;&gt; arrangement so th=\r\nat i do not *spoil* condition of the Apartment. hence i came &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; out=\r\n with the Idea of Chimney. (Please see the more pictures in photo section) =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; and started doing Homam. Though the chimney is visible to neighbou=\r\nrs and other &lt;br&gt;&gt; flat owners, no body has complained till now. neither=\r\n to police nor to security &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; personnel. Only once Security person =\r\ncautiuoned me. I stopped for a few days and &lt;br&gt;&gt; started as usual. It i=\r\ns going on till today. I do not know about tomorrow but i &lt;br&gt;&gt; do not w=\r\norry. becuase after 2.5 years of experience, it is more than clear to me &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&gt; that It is not I who is arranging all these but there is Mother be=\r\nhind all &lt;br&gt;&gt; these. SHE is making my road clear so that i can perform =\r\nHomam as i wish.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; ***&lt;br&gt;&gt; The moral of the story is tha=\r\nt if you genuinely desire to perform Homam/Havan, &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; then It will b=\r\ne done. No obstacle will stand on your way.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Do not fear. All the fe=\r\nars will break like Papads once you start walking over &lt;br&gt;&gt; them to do =\r\nhomam. i can swear for it!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; No owner will kick you out, No =\r\nneighbour will call 9-1-1 and even if that &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; happens, there will o=\r\npen a way!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;br&gt;&gt; PS=\r\n: Forgive me for spellings and Grammar! &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;astro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@&gt; wrote:&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks very=\r\n much for the photo.
