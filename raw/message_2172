Especially the solar eclipse of July 22 occu=\r\nrs when Sun is in the 6th degree of Cancer, which is Sun&#39;s Mrityu Bhaga (de=\r\nath inflicting degree) in Cancer. When the eclipse starts in New Delhi, Sun=\r\n, Moon, Ketu and ascendant are in the same rasi and navamsa. Hence, this ca=\r\nn be a problematic eclipse.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Eclipse time is a very favo=\r\nrable time for spiritual sadhana, though temple rituals are halted during e=\r\nclipses. There is a reason for it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sun and Moon are the=\r\n eyes of Parama Purusha (the supreme cosmic being). Microcosmically, indivi=\r\ndual soul (Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the eyes through which we se=\r\ne the dual world around us. If individual soul and individual mind stop see=\r\ning, one no longer experiences any objects in the field of duality. The obj=\r\nectification within Brahman ceases and one is established in Brahman, i.e. =\r\nnon-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In other words, one realizes Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To fulfil one&#39;s dharma as an individual in the field of duality, o=\r\nne needs to be awake to the duality. One needs the individualized conscious=\r\nness represented by Sun and Moon. Hence eclipse time when Sun or Moon is bl=\r\nocked is unfavorable for dharmik activities. Temples and temple rituals, wh=\r\nich are performed for collective dharma of society, are understandably halt=\r\ned. However, it is a great time for spiritual sadhana for self-realization.=\r\n This applies to homam as well. If one performs homam for material benefits=\r\n, one should stop during an eclipse. However, if one performs homam for spi=\r\nritual progress and self-realization, a homam performed during an eclipse i=\r\ns much more powerful than at other times. One can perform homam to any deit=\r\ny during an eclipse, though homam to an ugra devata may work better.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
