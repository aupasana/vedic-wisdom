But I am trying make o=\r\nne more crucial point. Let me make it using an analogy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Atleast in US=\r\n, we have child-proof scissors that cut paper/cloth but do not cut the fing=\r\ner even if a child accidentally puts finger in it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In an age when chi=\r\nldren did not need to use scissors and parents did scissors work for them, =\r\nthese kind of scissors weren&#39;t needed. Now, with parents being busy or othe=\r\nrwise unable to help, children need to use scissors for their homework some=\r\ntimes. So the market came up with child-proof scissors that are safe and do=\r\n not cut fingers.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Simialrly, remedies were done by trained experts (p=\r\nriests) in the past. As the priest class started to become weak and unable =\r\nto help laymen, Nature is evolving things so that laymen are enabled and sa=\r\nfely too.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the old days, ruling kshatriya=\r\n class contained very dharmik kings who were unselfish and used the power a=\r\nnd authority vested in them to provide prosperity to their subjects and ren=\r\nder selfless justice. As Kali yuga advanced and the kshatriya class became =\r\nselfish, self-serving and incapable, Nature gave rise to an evolution and p=\r\neople became responsible for governing themselves. Kings who rule for their=\r\n entire life are slowly fading away from the surface of earth and democracy=\r\n is taking root everywhere, where kings change in every few years.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Si=\r\nmilarly, priest class of old days contained genuine braahmanas who did sadh=\r\nana, realized god and were selfless and used the energy they accumulated th=\r\nrough sadhana to provide prosperity, material and spiritual, to people arou=\r\nnd them selflessly. As Kali yuga advances and the braahmana class becomes s=\r\nelfish, self-serving and incapable, Nature is giving rise to an evolution a=\r\nnd people are responsible for their own remedies and sadhana for material p=\r\nrosperity and spiritual evolution.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But it is not so bad. Nature is ve=\r\nry kind. Nature makes easy and safe tools available to laymen before its te=\r\nlls them &quot;you&#39;re on your own&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; People are s=\r\nuffering from terrible material problems now-a-days and also starving for g=\r\nood spiritual direction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Based on old habits, they instinctively expe=\r\nct someone else to fix their problems. They think that getting a pooja or h=\r\nomam done by a priest for a couple of hours oneday or getting a &quot;charged&quot; y=\r\nantra and rudraksha maalaa will magically cure their problems. Unfortunatel=\r\ny, it is not so simple today. If there is a sadhaka who does enough sadhana=\r\n and &quot;charges&quot; an object such as a yantra or a maalaa or an idol with that =\r\nenergy and gives it to you, you can indeed benefit from it. But gone are th=\r\nose days and gone are those people. Remember, you&#39;re on your own!\n&gt;  \n&gt; For=\r\nget special yantras, forget special maalaas, forget special idols, and forg=\r\net rituals done by priests. Have faith, have confidence and do sadhana by y=\r\nourself on a regular basis.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The most effective and safest sadhana to =\r\ndo by oneself is homam (fire ritual). Download the homam manuals (see site =\r\nbelow) and try a homam on a regular basis.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Or pick a mantra and do ja=\r\npam with it mentally everyday for an hour or so, while sitting still with c=\r\nlosed eyes and an erect back. If your knees hurt, sit on a chair or sofa co=\r\nmfortably, but keep the back straight and eyes closed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are many generic mantras (see my original mail at the bot=\r\ntom for a sample list) that are appliable to everybody and can solve ALL pr=\r\noblems. For example, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra explicitly says it can solv=\r\ne ANY problem. Instead of looking for a &quot;perfect mantra recommendation&quot;, yo=\r\nu can pick a generic mantra like that and start sadhana. The key is faith a=\r\nnd persistence.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, small=\r\n amount energy may be enough to move it away. If it is the size of a big bo=\r\nulder on the other hand, much more energy may be needed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; All that is =\r\nin your hands is to do sadhana with faith and persistence. And, remember, n=\r\no effort is ever wasted. Every effort bears a fruit of comparable size even=\r\ntually.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, you may be looking for a shortcut, but there is NO=\r\nNE. And sadhana is not so bad. Even before it solves your actual problem, t=\r\nhe first thing sadhana does to you is: it gives you the courage to face the=\r\n problem.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Doing sadhana and selfless surr=\r\nender to the supreme being\n&gt; &gt; is of course ideal, but not tenable in the c=\r\nurrent times\n&gt; &gt; for the majority of the humans. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Nothing is untenabl=\r\ne. Though selfless surrender makes sadhana more efficient, sadhana without =\r\nselfless surrender is also fine!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Even if one&#39;s mind is filled with re=\r\nasonable material desires (marriage, children, job, health etc), one can st=\r\nill do sadhana. Sadhana then takes care of one&#39;s material and spiritual nee=\r\nds and increases surrender and selflessness in one *over the time*.\n&gt;  \n&gt; B=\r\nottomline: Good sadhana increases selfless surrender and selfless surrender=\r\n promotes better sadhana. This is a positive feedback loop. One should some=\r\nhow or the other break through. Break the impasse and just start some sadha=\r\nna. Don&#39;t fear that something bad will happen or that you will not be able =\r\nto do it. Just pick a sadhana and take the plunge!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; And we need well-meaning people who are immersed in sadhana\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhemselves to come forward and show us the way. \n&gt;  \n&gt; That is what we are t=\r\nrying to do here..\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Every mandala in RigVeda=\r\n starts with hymns to Fire. Fire was worshipped by ancient people such as Z=\r\norostrains,  Vedic rishis and ancient Greco-Romans. Even progressive modern=\r\n paths such as Buddhism and Arya Samaj accept fire worship. Fire is a livin=\r\ng representation of divinity on earth and spending time worshipping god in =\r\nfire has a magical and purifying impact on one&#39;s consciousness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The p=\r\nroof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try homam every day or or ever=\r\ny weekend for a few months and see for oneself what it does to one.\n&gt;  \n&gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotis=\r\nh Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that =\r\nmake a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinicry=\r\nstal&quot; &lt;jyotish_vani@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I read i=\r\nn your posting is the simple fact that:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In mature hands, a knife c=\r\nan heal (surgeon&#39;s)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; or feed those who choose animal proteins for w=\r\nhatever reasons (Butcher&#39;s)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BUT in immature and evil hands, the sa=\r\nme knife would commit a punishable crime (Murderer!)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So it is not =\r\nthe mantra, ritual but the INTENT and the person who is wielding the knife =\r\n(III, to keep it simple!) that is important.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree fully and hop=\r\nefully that resonates with what you were trying to express, in a borader an=\r\nd general sense, at least partly so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ranjan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In Jyot=\r\nishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jyotishi&quot; &lt;raj@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; IMHO for a profe=\r\nssion to progress, you need art, science and commerce to work together in t=\r\nandem.

I will be honest, straight-forward a=\r\nnd blunt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhough believers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their pr=\r\noblems will be solved, many priests today are incapable of producing any re=\r\nsults. As a result, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a puddi=\r\nng exists even without eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And som=\r\ne intelligent people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first=\r\n address why this has come to be and then talk about what we should do.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In ancient times, caste system was not as rigid as it is=\r\n today. One&#39;s varna was decided based on one&#39;s aptitude. One primarily inte=\r\nrested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana. One primari=\r\nly interested in power, authority and control over others would be a Kshatr=\r\niya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One primarily int=\r\nerested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would start off with t=\r\nhe varna of one&#39;s father, as that is what one is exposed to in childhood. H=\r\nowever, as one&#39;s vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would get one&#39;s o=\r\nwn varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can later turn into =\r\na Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, fo=\r\nr example, can later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be i=\r\nnterested in knowledge and spiritual progress and not caring about power, i=\r\nnfluence, money, pleasures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure and accumu=\r\nlated enough spiritual energy through continuous sadhana over years and wer=\r\ne capable of performing very effective poojas for people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Today, people who have spiritual potential may be born in non-Brahmana=\r\n families and not allowed to develop fully due to the rigid caste structure=\r\ns. Some people born in Brahmana families may also end up getting into moder=\r\nn careers and not developing fully as Brahmanas. Some people may be born in=\r\n Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/Shudra tendencies and may end up b=\r\necoming priests who are interested in power, authority and control over oth=\r\ners, money and physical pleasures. Those priests who only care about knowle=\r\ndge and spiritual progress (i.e. true Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result=\r\n, Brahmanas who have done genuine sadhana and accumulated a good amount of =\r\nspiritual energy are so few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a c=\r\nheck given by one for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account=\r\n is empty, what good is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounc=\r\ne. Similarly, poojas done and blessings given by a priest without enough sp=\r\niritual energy cannot bring one any benefits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One imp=\r\nortant note: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra) or a s=\r\nequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that FOCUSES=\r\n on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (=\r\nritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to wander and=\r\n instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focus p=\r\noints may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Without=\r\n it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of pract=\r\nice. Most priests are just engaging in casual practice when they go and do =\r\npoojas. In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that energ=\r\ny to the table when they did rituals at the houses of people or in temples.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did see priests who have done good sadhana, purifi=\r\ned themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But those are getting rarer =\r\nand rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on finding such a pri=\r\nest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given =\r\nthis, one is better off not depending on the priest/Brahmana class for reme=\r\ndies. BTW, I have nothing against the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class, having bee=\r\nn born in an orthodox Brahmana family myself. I have neither love nor hatre=\r\nd for the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class. My only wish is that more people - fro=\r\nm any birth caste - develop into true Brahmanas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Inst=\r\nead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possibly proud of his skills and thinking=\r\n about money and possibly not identifying with your trouble, you can do the=\r\n mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your identification with the trouble and y=\r\nour desire to solve the problem will be better than the priest. If you mana=\r\nge to generate enough focus after practice, the mantra/ritual may actually =\r\nproduce some result. There is no harm in trying.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *   =\r\n     *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people think that poojas to gods=\r\n are a serious matter and only a trained priest should do them. The procedu=\r\nres have evolved to become quite complicated over the time too!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, complexity of rituals should never be a deterrent. Supp=\r\nose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams of pro=\r\ntein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such ba=\r\nlanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or wil=\r\nl you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil=\r\n soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a ma=\r\nntra/ritual, you need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start=\r\n with what you know. It will only give you energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fear to do rituals without &quot;per=\r\nfect knowledge&quot; stems from the notion that some mantras/rituals can be dang=\r\nerous. That notion is not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant today.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and rit=\r\nuals and get specific results. When used by someone with a high level of sp=\r\niritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give specif=\r\nic powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such thi=\r\nngs in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will give an analogy. A machine gu=\r\nn and a stick can be used to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one=\r\n using a machine gun needs to be very careful. One needs to learn well, pra=\r\nctice well and then use it, lest one should hurt oneself by accident.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, suppose the house lord purposely removed ammuniti=\r\non from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick and not risky. I=\r\nnstead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use the machine gun, j=\r\nust take it and start beating your enemies with it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nAmmunition&quot; has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras and ritua=\r\nls (machine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect knowledge, on=\r\ne can start using them right away.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A lot of technical=\r\nities related to mantras and rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and ritu=\r\nals are to be taken up with faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever =\r\ntechnicalities one can realistically follow should be followed and emphasis=\r\n should be placed on devotion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, ev=\r\nentually one&#39;s devotion and focus will improve and, for all you know, a res=\r\nult may come.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given that we do not have perfect focus=\r\n and surrender, we cannot expect specific results to come in specific count=\r\ns of recitation. So we should just do the best job we can and leave the res=\r\nult to god, who decides when and what result should be given.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in the end. Every sincere e=\r\nffort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or the other!!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Different mantras an=\r\nd rituals are like begging bowls of different shapes. They matter only so m=\r\nuch. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you use, you may be given dif=\r\nferent kind of alms. But it is important to start begging with some begging=\r\n bowl or the other, instead of spending years looking for the perfect beggi=\r\nng bowl.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of waiting for astrologers with half=\r\n-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual,=\r\n do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder you respect) t=\r\nells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sa=\r\nhasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi H=\r\nanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, Venka=\r\nteswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chandipath=\r\n (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa&#39;s=\r\n navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotra etc=\r\n are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purpose.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Do not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedur=\r\ne, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the other with a sincere=\r\n heart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your effort will not go waste. Your problem m=\r\nay be solved or you may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atlea=\r\nst your focus will improve.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this context, I want to say a few words about homam, th=\r\ne sadhana of rishis.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fire ritual is found in many anci=\r\nent religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and air, fire is ever pu=\r\nre and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for=\r\n fire is paavaka, i.e.  purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has ac=\r\ncess to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purifies one&#39;s subtle c=\r\nonsciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other sadhanas in impro=\r\nving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner personality and removing material an=\r\nd spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for granted. One can try =\r\nfor oneself for a few months. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regularly, for the =\r\nbenefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece &quot;Brihat Paaraa=\r\nsara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Kali yuga, for guidance to t=\r\nhe people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended various types of homa=\r\nm as remedial measures for various problems in the horoscope. In fact, most=\r\n remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to follow whatever p=\r\nrocedures one was taught for starting fire and did not focus on the nitty g=\r\nritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in homam. Parasara&#39;s=\r\n clear teachings set to rest the notion that some people have, that homam i=\r\ns not for Kali yuga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i=\r\n.e. I am japa among all sacrifices. Some people use this line to suggest th=\r\nat japam (meditation) is superior to homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspec=\r\ntive.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the line just above that line, Sri Krishna a=\r\nlso said, &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;. However, do we only meditate with th=\r\ne supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; and leave all other mantras?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If=\r\n one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of climbing a mount=\r\nain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it using various kinds o=\r\nf gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach the pinnacle. M=\r\nost cannot reach the pinnacle directly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, Om=\r\n is the supreme of all mantras being the source of all, but reaching the so=\r\nurce may require using several mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating =\r\nand absorbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrif=\r\nice, but it may require purification and preparation by engaging in other k=\r\ninds of sacrifices (hama/yajna).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one does homam =\r\nor yajna, one is engaging in external actions and one is unlikely to reach =\r\nsamadhi (absorbption in the Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does=\r\n japam (i.e. sits still and contemplates), one may reach samadhi. However, =\r\nto purify oneself, homam is far more effective.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Detailed manuals giving short procedur=\r\nes for doing various types of homam by oneself are available on the website=\r\n given below. You can use the resources on that website to perform several =\r\nkinds of short homam by yourself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now *hundreds* of p=\r\neople are performing homam by themselves either daily or weekly. Some peopl=\r\ne are also doing monthly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Manish (my spiritual g=\r\nuru - a small write-up on him can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom y=\r\nahoogroup, i.e. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481) to=\r\nld me that the Divine Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi homam =\r\nat a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him to spread a simplified h=\r\nomam ritual around the world, and showed him that hundreds of thousands of =\r\npeople would be performing regular homam in a few years, thus helping rever=\r\nse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetched to m=\r\ny rational mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, just 4 years after the Moth=\r\ner&#39;s command, hundreds of people are already performing regular homam. Thou=\r\ngh these are just the early days, the developments are amazing. Some of the=\r\nm are laymen who never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja=\r\n or ritual. It is a miracle that such people are doing a homam everyday, li=\r\nke the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that some peopl=\r\ne doing homam for a couple of years are actually starting to experience thi=\r\nngs within and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid internal =\r\ntransformation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell anything to a=\r\nnyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just freely share what I know, =\r\nwhat I saw and what I am inspired to share. The rest is not in my hands.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite thos=\r\ne who have even an iota of interest to check out the homam website! If one =\r\ngets into the habit of performing homam regularly, it has the great potenti=\r\nal to transform one&#39;s life, materially and spiritually..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Homam website:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
