It w=\r\nas the Telugu New Year&#39;s Day. It was\nthen, before the meal began, that she =\r\ntold me her story.\n\nShe belonged to a wealthy Telugu family of Madras. She =\r\nmarried young but\nvery soon lost her husband. As a widow, she continued to =\r\nlive at home,\nsurrounded by the love of her parents and brothers. She rarel=\r\ny went out, and\nwhen she did, it was always with her father. One day he too=\r\nk her to the\nneighboring temple to hear a talk given by a sadhu. This sadhu=\r\n was a devotee\nof the Maharshi. He told his audience about the sage&#39;s `conv=\r\nersion,&#39; his\ndisappearance from the world [leaving Madurai], his resort to =\r\nthe mountain\nof Arunachala, and the rest.\n\nSundarammal was deeply moved. Sh=\r\ne begged her father to allow her to\naccompany some pilgrims to Arunachala. =\r\nHe refused, but promised that he\nwould soon take her there himself.\n\nSome w=\r\neeks later, she was alone one night in her room, weeping and calling\non the=\r\n Maharshi. Then, quite worn out, she fell asleep. Suddenly she felt a\nblow =\r\non her side and awoke with a start. It was about three o&#39; clock in the\nmorn=\r\ning. There was the Maharshi standing by the head of her cot. &quot;Come,&quot; was\nal=\r\nl he said.\n\nShe followed him downstairs, crossed the hall and came out on t=\r\nhe verandah.\nHardly had she reached it when to her alarm she found herself =\r\nalone. The\nMaharshi had disappeared. She sat down uneasily.\n\nSoon a ricksha=\r\nw appeared and the rickshaw puller said: &quot;Is this Number 12,\nand are you Su=\r\nndarammal? An old sadhu told me to come here and take you to\nthe bus. Get i=\r\nn.&quot; Sundarammal thought quite simply, &quot;It is Bhagavan, the\nMaharshi,&quot; and g=\r\not into the rickshaw.\n\nAt the bus stand she and the rickshaw puller were bo=\r\nth surprised not to find\nthe old sadhu. However, she asked for the Tiruvann=\r\namalai bus and got in.\n\nSomewhere on the way her bus passed another one fro=\r\nm which someone alighted\nand then entered the Tiruvannamalai bus. &quot;Are you =\r\nSundarammal?&quot; he asked.\n&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; she replied. &quot;Good. Bhagavan has sent =\r\nme to look for you.&quot;\n\nIn the evening she reached Tiruvannamalai and retired=\r\n for the night in one\nof the large halls kept for pilgrims. She prepared a =\r\ncake to offer to\nBhagavan and fell asleep full of joy.\n\nThe next morning sh=\r\ne went to the Ashram and fell at the feet of Bhagavan.\n&quot;Here you are at las=\r\nt,&quot; he said to her.\n\nSome days later her brothers arrived, unable to unders=\r\ntand how this child,\nwho by herself had never set foot outside her home, co=\r\nuld have managed to\nreach Tiruvannamalai. But Sundarammal was so deeply abs=\r\norbed that she never\neven saw her brothers, either in the hall or at midday=\r\n in the dining hall.\nOnly in the evening were they able to approach her. Th=\r\ney told her how upset\neveryone was at home and begged her to return. If she=\r\n wanted, they would\nbuild her a hermitage in the garden. But nothing moved =\r\nher and the brothers\neven spoke of taking her home by force. &quot;If you do, I =\r\nwill throw myself into\na well,&quot; she said. Her brothers had to yield, but th=\r\ney soon returned with\ntheir father. They found her in a cottage near the As=\r\nhram and arranged for\nher continued stay there as well as they could.\n\nDuri=\r\nng the fifteen years that remained of the Maharshi&#39;s life, she never\nleft T=\r\niruvannamalai even for a day.\n\nThis was the story that Sundarammal told me =\r\nthat morning=E2=80=94Sundarammal who\ncould never speak of God without her v=\r\noice breaking with emotion and her\neyes filling with tears.\n\n(Rendered from=\r\n French into English by Father James Stuart)\n=E2=80=94 The Mountain Path, O=\r\nct. 1980\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636163c5d04d6b1048ac3d683\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sundarammal By Swami Abhishikta=\r\nnanda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, towards the end of her retreat, she invited me=\r\n and some other sadhus to share a meal at her cell.
