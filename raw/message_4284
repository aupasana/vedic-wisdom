Whatever is destined no=\r\nt to happen will not happen,\ntry how hard you may. Whatever is destined to =\r\nhappen will happen, do what\nyou may to prevent it. This is certain. The bes=\r\nt course, therefore, is for\none is to be silent. (Maharshi=E2=80=99s Upades=\r\na to this Mother in 1898)\n\nIf one resorts to contemplation of the Self unin=\r\ntermittently, until the Self\nis gained, that alone would do. As long as the=\r\nre are enemies within the\nfortress, they will continue to sally forth; if t=\r\nhey are destroyed as they\nemerge, the fortress will fall into our hands. (W=\r\nho Am I?)\n\nHe who gives himself up to the Self that is God is the most exce=\r\nllent\ndevotee. Giving one=E2=80=99s self up to God means remaining constant=\r\nly in the Self\nwithout giving room for the rise of any thoughts other than =\r\nthe thought of\nthe Self. (Who Am I?)\n\nThe mind will become quiescent only b=\r\ny the enquiry =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99. The thought\n=E2=80=98Who am I?=\r\n=E2=80=99 will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for\nstir=\r\nring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then,\nthere=\r\n will arise Self-realization (Who Am I?).\n\nAs long as there are impression =\r\nof objects in the mind, so long the enquiry\n=E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 is =\r\nrequired. As thoughts arise they should be destroyed then and\nthere in the =\r\nvery place of their origin through enquiry. (Who Am I?).\n\nWhatever burdens =\r\nare thrown on God, He bears them. Since the supreme power\nof God makes all =\r\nthings move, why should we, without submitting ourselves to\nit, constantly =\r\nworry ourselves with thoughts as to what should be done and\nhow, and what s=\r\nhould not be done and how not? (Who Am I?)\n\nJust as the pearl-diver ties a =\r\nstone to his waist, sinks to the bottom of\nthe sea and there takes the pear=\r\nls, so each one of us should be endowed with\nnon-attachment, dive within on=\r\neself and obtain the Self-Pearl. (Who Am I?)\n\n\nOther than enquiry, there ar=\r\ne no adequate means. If through other means it\nis sought to control the min=\r\nd, the mind will appear to be controlled, but\nwill again go forth. (Who Am =\r\nI?)\n\nHappiness is the very nature of the Self; happiness and the Self are n=\r\not\ndifferent. There is no happiness in any object of the world. We imagine\n=\r\nthrough our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. (Who Am I?)\n\n\n=\r\nInquiring into the nature of one=E2=80=99s self that is in bondage, and rea=\r\nlizing\none=E2=80=99s true nature is release. (Who Am I?)\n\nBy the strength o=\r\nf meditation (i.e, by the strength of Self attention)\nabiding in the state =\r\nof being which transcend meditation, alone is the truth\nof supreme devotion=\r\n (pure parabhakti). (Upadesa Undhiar,9)\n\nThrough the senses=E2=80=99 gross =\r\ndesires, we have become submerged in a false world\nof drams. Destroying the=\r\n mind=E2=80=99s resultant accumulation of suffering in the\nfire of vigilant=\r\n awareness, the holy truth of the mantra Sivaya Namaha\nestablishes itself w=\r\nithin as we eat in joy and celebrate the blessed Pongal\nfestival. (Sri Rama=\r\nnanubuthi, 240)\n\nEnquiry consists in retaining the mind in the Self, Medita=\r\ntion consists in\nthinking that one=E2=80=99s self is Brahman, Existence-Con=\r\nsciousness-Bliss. (Who AM\nI?).\n\nAbiding in the Heart of being whence we spr=\r\nang is the path of action of\ndevotion, of yoga and jnan. (Upadesa Undhiar, =\r\n10)\n\nAs there is no consciousness (chit) other than existence (sat) to know=\r\n\nExistence itself is being consciousness. So we are verily consciousness.\n(=\r\nUpadesa Undhiar, 23)\n\nWhat is called the world is only thought. When the wo=\r\nrld disappears, i.e.,\nwhen there is no thought, the mind experiences happin=\r\ness; and when the world\nappears, it goes through misery. (Who Am I?)\n\nRemai=\r\nning quiet is that is called wisdom-insight. To remain quiet is to\nresolve =\r\nthe mind in the Self. Telepathy, knowing past, present and future\nhappening=\r\ns and clairvoyance do not constitute wisdom-insight. (Who Am I?)\n\nWhen one =\r\nenquires the form of mind without forgetfulness or slackness of\nattention, =\r\nit will be found that there is no such thing as mind. This is the\ndirect pa=\r\nth for all (types of sadhakas). (Upadesa Undhiar, 17)\n\nIt is true wisdom fo=\r\nr the mind to twin away from worldly objects and behold\nits own form of lig=\r\nht (its true of effulgent consciousness the real Self).\n(Upadesa Undhiar, 1=\r\n6)\n\nDesirelessness is wisdom. The two are not different=E2=80=99 they are t=\r\nhe same.\nDesirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any obj=\r\nect.\nWisdom means the appearance of no object. In other words,not seeking w=\r\nhat is\nother than the Self is detachment or desirelessness; not leaving the=\r\n Self is\nwisdom. (Who Am I?)\n\nAll the texts say that in order to gain relea=\r\nse one should render the mind\nquiescent; therefore their conclusive teachin=\r\ng is that the mind should be\nrendered quiescent; once this has been underst=\r\nood there is no need for\nendless reading. In order to quieten the mind one =\r\nhas only to inquire within\noneself what one=E2=80=99s Self is; how could th=\r\nis search be done in books? One\nshould know one=E2=80=99s Self with one=E2=\r\n=80=99s own eye of wisdom. (Who Am I?)\n\nRather then viewing God as differen=\r\nt from one contemplation that is done\nwith the conviction. =E2=80=98He is I=\r\n=E2=80=99 is indeed the best of all the various kinds\nof meditation (Upades=\r\na Undhiar, 8)\n\nKeeping the mind fixed in the Self at all times is called Se=\r\nlf-enquiry\nwhereas thinking oneself to be Brahman, which is sat-chit-ananda=\r\n\n(being-consciousness-bliss), is meditation. Eventually, all the one has\nle=\r\narnt will have to be forgotten. (Who Am I?)\n\nThe Self is within the five sh=\r\neaths; but books are outside them. Since the\nSelf has to be inquired into b=\r\ny discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to\nsearch for it in books. Ther=\r\ne will come a time when one will have to forget\nall that one has learned. (=\r\nWho Am I?)\n\nThrough the control of breath also, the mind will become quiesc=\r\nent; but it\nwill be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled=\r\n, and when\nthe breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and wil=\r\nl wander as\nimpelled by residual impressions. The source is the same for bo=\r\nth mind and\nbreath. (Who Am I?)\n\nAs thoughts arise, destroying them utterly=\r\n a without any residue in the very\nplace of their origin is non-attachment.=\r\n (Who Am I?)\n\nI am pure existence, I am not the body nor the senses, mind n=\r\nor life, nor\nignorance for, all these things are quite insentient and so, u=\r\nnreal.\n\nWe know that the train carries all loads, so after getting on it wh=\r\ny should\nwe carry our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead =\r\nof putting\nit down in the train and feeling at ease? (Who Am I?)\n\nThought, =\r\nindeed, is the nature of the mind. The thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is the f=\r\nirst\nthought of the mind; and that is egoity. It is from the whence egoity\n=\r\noriginates that breath also originates. Therefore, when the mind becomes\nqu=\r\niescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the\nmi=\r\nnd becomes quiescent. (Who Am I?)\n\nOf all the thoughts that arise in the mi=\r\nnd, the =E2=80=98I-thought=E2=80=99 is the first. It\nis only after the rise=\r\n of this that the other thoughts arise. It is after\nthe appearance of the f=\r\nirst personal pronoun that the second and third\npersonal pronouns appear; w=\r\nithout the first personal pronoun there will not\nbe the second and third. (=\r\nWho Am I?)\n\nThe Self is that where there is absolutely no =E2=80=98I=E2=80=\r\n=99 thought. That is called\n=E2=80=98Silence=E2=80=99. The Self itself is t=\r\nhe world. The Self itself is =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99; the Self\nitself is God; a=\r\nll is Siva, the Self. (Who Am I?)\n\nWhat exists in truth is the Self alone. =\r\nThe world, the individual soul and\nGod are appearances in it. Like silver i=\r\nn mother-of-pearl, these three\nappear at the same time and disappear at the=\r\n same time. (Who Am I?)\n\nThat which rises as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in this bo=\r\ndy is the mind. If one enquires as tow\nhere in the body the thought =E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99 rises first, one would discover that it\nrises in the Heart. T=\r\nhat is the place of the mind=E2=80=99s origin. Even if one\nthinks constantl=\r\ny =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, one will be led to that place. (=\r\nWho Am I?)\n\nThe consciousness (I am) where there is neither knowing nor not=\r\n-knowing is\nthe True Knowledge. There is no object to be known (outside the=\r\n\nconsciousness) there. (Upadesa Undhiar, 27)\n\n\nOne should, with faith, hand=\r\n over to Iswara all of the burdens, such as the\nfamily and the body, which =\r\nnaturally appear, and then remain without\nanxiety. Otherwise, one cannot pe=\r\nrform, with a one-pointed mind, either\ndevotion or Self-enquiry. (Ulladu Na=\r\nrpadu =E2=80=93 Supplement, 17)\n\nIt is a matter of ridicule to say either I=\r\n have not realized myself. Or I\nhave realized myself. Why? Are there two se=\r\nlves, one self to become an\nobject known (by the other)? =E2=80=98I am one=\r\n=E2=80=99 is the truth that is the experience\nof everyone (Ulladu Narpadu =\r\n=E2=80=93 Supplement, 33)\n\nIn truth, God and the Guru are not different. Ju=\r\nst as the prey which has\nfallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so =\r\nthose who have come within\nthe ambit of the Guru=E2=80=99s gracious look wi=\r\nll be saved by the Guru and will not\nget lost; yet, each one should, by his=\r\n own effort pursue the path shown by\nGod or Guru and gain release. (Who AM =\r\nI?)\n\nWhen the triads disappear due to the destruction of the base, fooling =\r\nego,\nand when the states of waking and dream are thus completely destroyed,=\r\n the\npure broad day-light (Self) that then shines like a hundred suns is th=\r\ne\nNight of Siva (Sivaratri). (The Garland if Guru=E2=80=99s Sayings, 459)\n\n=\r\nHow is that Atma Vidya (Self Knowledge) is said to be the easiest?\nSri Bhag=\r\navan: Any other Vidya requires a knower, knowledge and the object to\nbe kno=\r\nwn whereas this does not require any of them. It is the Self. Can\nanything =\r\nbe so obvious as that? Hence it is the easiest. All that you need\nto do is =\r\nto enquire =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 (Talk 551)\n\nQ: How is meditation to =\r\nbe practiced?\nSri Bhagavan: Meditation is, truly speaking Atmanishta (to be=\r\n fixed as the\nSelf). But when thoughts cross the mind and an effort is made=\r\n to eliminate\nthem, the effort is usually termed meditation. Atmanishta is =\r\nyour real\nnature. Remain as you are. That is the aim. (Talk, 294)\n\nRealizin=\r\ng that which remains after the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 has ceased to exist, tha=\r\nt alone\nis excellent Tapas=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 Thus said Lord Ramana. (Upade=\r\nsa Undhiar, 30)\n\nThe way shown by the Master is final, straight and makes f=\r\nor unity; it is\nwell-tried, natural free of fancy, and free from travail. W=\r\nhen you are\nfollowing the way shown by the Master doubts will not arise, th=\r\nere will be\nno fear. Fear and doubt are the characteristics of darkness. If=\r\n you follow\nthe path shown by the Master it will convince you that it is th=\r\ne right One.\n(All is One)\n\nOnly the one, whose mind is ripened by supreme d=\r\nevotion to Him, can attain\nDeliverance through zeal for the Quest of the Se=\r\nlf and inward turning of the\nmind. (Guru Ramana Vachana Mala, 87)\n\nIf the d=\r\nuties fulfilled according to the injunctions (of the scared lore)\nfail to g=\r\nenerate devotion to the Supreme Being, then all such activity is\nvain; it i=\r\ns (even) equal to sinful conduct, since it creates (fresh)\nbondage. (90)\n\nQ=\r\n: if I go on rejecting thoughts can I call it Vichara?\nSri Bhagavan: It may=\r\n be a stepping stone. But really vichara beings when you\ncling to your self=\r\n and are already off the mental movement, the\nthought-waves.\n\nThe truth of =\r\nthe Supreme Being is the one Infinite Reality transcending all\nrelativity, =\r\nwhich is the fundamental Substance of the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, which is the=\r\n\nbasis of the world.

(Upadesa Undhiar, 17)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt is true wisdom for the =\r\nmind to twin away from worldly objects and behold its own form of light (it=\r\ns true of effulgent consciousness the real Self). (Upadesa Undhiar, 16)&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Desirelessness is wisdom. The two are not different=E2=80=99 they are t=\r\nhe same. Desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any obj=\r\nect. Wisdom means the appearance of no object. In other words,&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;not seeking what is other than the Self is detachment=\r\n or desirelessness; not leaving the Self is wisdom. (Who Am I?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;All the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the =\r\nmind quiescent; therefore their conclusive teaching is that the mind should=\r\n be rendered quiescent; once this has been understood there is no need for =\r\nendless reading. In order to quieten the mind one has only to inquire withi=\r\nn oneself what one=E2=80=99s Self is; how could this search be done in book=\r\ns? One should know one=E2=80=99s Self with one=E2=80=99s own eye of wisdom.=\r\n (Who Am I?)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Rather then viewing God as different from one contemp=\r\nlation that is done with the conviction. =E2=80=98He is I=E2=80=99 is indee=\r\nd the best of all the various kinds of meditation (Upadesa Undhiar, 8)&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Keeping the mind fixed in the Self at all times is called Self-enquiry w=\r\nhereas thinking oneself to be Brahman, which is sat-chit-ananda (being-cons=\r\nciousness-bliss), is meditation. Eventually, all the one has learnt will ha=\r\nve to be forgotten. (Who Am I?)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Self is within the five sheath=\r\ns; but books are outside them. Since the Self has to be inquired into by di=\r\nscarding the five sheaths, it is futile to search for it in books. There wi=\r\nll come a time when one will have to forget all that one has learned. (Who =\r\nAm I?)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Through the control of breath also, the mind will become qu=\r\niescent; but it will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains contro=\r\nlled, and when the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and=\r\n will wander as impelled by residual impressions. The source is the same fo=\r\nr both mind and breath. (Who Am I?)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;As thoughts arise, destroying =\r\nthem utterly a without any residue in the very place of their origin is non=\r\n-attachment. (Who Am I?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am pure existence, I am not the body nor =\r\nthe senses, mind nor life, nor ignorance for, all these things are quite in=\r\nsentient and so, unreal.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;We know =\r\nthat the train carries all loads, so after getting on it why should we carr=\r\ny our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead of putting it do=\r\nwn in the train and feeling at ease? (Who Am I?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Thought, i=\r\nndeed, is the nature of the mind. The thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is the fi=\r\nrst thought of the mind; and that is egoity. It is from the whence egoity o=\r\nriginates that breath also originates. Therefore, when the mind becomes qui=\r\nescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the min=\r\nd becomes quiescent. (Who Am I?)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Of all the thoughts that arise in=\r\n the mind, the =E2=80=98I-thought=E2=80=99 is the first. It is only after t=\r\nhe rise of this that the other thoughts arise. It is after the appearance o=\r\nf the first personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronouns ap=\r\npear; without the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and t=\r\nhird. (Who Am I?)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The Self is tha=\r\nt where there is absolutely no =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 thought. That is called =\r\n=E2=80=98Silence=E2=80=99. The Self itself is the world. The Self itself is=\r\n =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99; the Self itself is God; all is Siva, the Self. (Who A=\r\nm I?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;What exists in truth=\r\n is the Self alone. The world, the individual soul and God are appearances =\r\nin it. Like silver in mother-of-pearl, these three appear at the same time =\r\nand disappear at the same time. (Who Am I?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That which rise=\r\ns as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in this body is the mind. If one enquires as tow h=\r\nere in the body the thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 rises first, one would disc=\r\nover that it rises in the Heart. That is the place of the mind=E2=80=99s or=\r\nigin. Even if one thinks constantly =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99=\r\n, one will be led to that place. (Who Am I?)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The consciousness (I =\r\nam) where there is neither knowing nor not-knowing is the True Knowledge. T=\r\nhere is no object to be known (outside the consciousness) there. (Upadesa U=\r\nndhiar, 27)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One should, with faith, hand over to Iswara all of t=\r\nhe burdens, such as the family and the body, which naturally appear, and th=\r\nen remain without anxiety. Otherwise, one cannot perform, with a one-pointe=\r\nd mind, either devotion or Self-enquiry. (Ulladu Narpadu =E2=80=93 Suppleme=\r\nnt, 17)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is a matter of ridicule to say either I have not realiz=\r\ned myself. Or I have realized myself. Why? Are there two selves, one self t=\r\no become an object known (by the other)? =E2=80=98I am one=E2=80=99 is the =\r\ntruth that is the experience of everyone (Ulladu Narpadu =E2=80=93 Suppleme=\r\nnt, 33)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In truth, God and the Guru are not different. Just as the =\r\nprey which has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who =\r\nhave come within the ambit of the Guru=E2=80=99s gracious look will be save=\r\nd by the Guru and will not get lost; yet, each one should, by his own effor=\r\nt pursue the path shown by God or Guru and gain release. (Who AM I?)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;When the triads disappear due to the destruction of the base, fooling eg=\r\no, and when the states of waking and dream are thus completely destroyed, t=\r\nhe pure broad day-light (Self) that then shines like a hundred suns is the =\r\nNight of Siva (Sivaratri). (The Garland if Guru=E2=80=99s Sayings, 459)&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;How is that Atma Vidya (Self Knowled=\r\nge) is said to be the easiest?&lt;br&gt;Sri Bhagavan: Any other Vidya requires a =\r\nknower, knowledge and the object to be known whereas this does not require =\r\nany of them. It is the Self. Can anything be so obvious as that? Hence it i=\r\ns the easiest. All that you need to do is to enquire =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=\r\n=80=99 (Talk 551)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Q: How is meditation to be practiced?&lt;br&gt;=\r\nSri Bhagavan: Meditation is, truly speaking Atmanishta (to be fixed as the =\r\nSelf). But when thoughts cross the mind and an effort is made to eliminate =\r\nthem, the effort is usually termed meditation. Atmanishta is your real natu=\r\nre. Remain as you are. That is the aim. (Talk, 294)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Realizing that=\r\n which remains after the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 has ceased to exist, that alon=\r\ne is excellent Tapas=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 Thus said Lord Ramana. (Upadesa Und=\r\nhiar, 30)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way shown by the Master is final, straight and makes f=\r\nor unity; it is well-tried, natural free of fancy, and free from travail. W=\r\nhen you are following the way shown by the Master doubts will not arise, th=\r\nere will be no fear. Fear and doubt are the characteristics of darkness. If=\r\n you follow the path shown by the Master it will convince you that it is th=\r\ne right One. (All is One)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Only the one, whose mind is ripened by s=\r\nupreme devotion to Him, can attain Deliverance through zeal for the Quest o=\r\nf the Self and inward turning of the mind. (Guru Ramana Vachana Mala, 87)&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the duties fulfilled according to the injunctions (of the scared l=\r\nore) fail to generate devotion to the Supreme Being, then all such activity=\r\n is vain; it is (even) equal to sinful conduct, since it creates (fresh) bo=\r\nndage. (90)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Q: if I go on rejecting thoughts can I call it Vichara=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;Sri Bhagavan: It may be a stepping stone. But really vichara beings wh=\r\nen you cling to your self and are already off the mental movement, the thou=\r\nght-waves.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The truth of the Supreme Being is the one Infinite Real=\r\nity transcending all relativity, which is the fundamental Substance of the =\r\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, which is the basis of the world.
