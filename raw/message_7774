However, it is difficult\nto objectively defend the pronounciatio=\r\nn of &quot;brahma&quot; as &quot;bramha&quot;.\n\nThere is a little bit of confusion because ther=\r\ne is a traditional shloka\nwhich talks about an alternate pronounciation of =\r\n&quot;ha&quot; in some cases (e.g.\nbrahma, vahni, hyaH etc). This is sometimes used a=\r\ns a justification to\nswitch the placement of the &quot;h&quot; in brahma and vahni ..=\r\n. but this applies to\n&quot;hyaH&quot; too. Just try to pronounce it as &quot;yhaH&quot;, and y=\r\nou will see the\nproblem with this line of reasoning.\n\nFurthur, &quot;ha&quot; is usua=\r\nlly pronounced from the throat. This alternate &quot;ha&quot; in\nthe case of brahma, =\r\nvahni etc is said to be aurasya (i.e. from the chest).\nNo one can authorita=\r\ntively say what this sounds like, and this is\nconsidered &quot;lost knowledge&quot;. =\r\nBut, we can use some common sense. If you\npronounce &quot;brahma&quot;, &quot;vahni&quot; and &quot;=\r\nhyaH&quot; as written, you will see that there\nis a tendency to prononce it a li=\r\nttle lower (a little bit from the chest)\nwhen compared to words like &quot;hAhA&quot;=\r\n.
