Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; N=\r\namaskar,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Quite seriously, please do not address me as a guru. Guru is=\r\n a very \nheavy word. It means the remover of the darkness of ignorance. I a=\r\nm \nNOT a guru.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If She wants to answer something, She can pick someone=\r\n and answer \nthrough them. The person in question is just a nimitta.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nActually, Vasishtha teaches that even a guru is a nimitta! Then \nwhat about=\r\n someone like me? Everything here is just a coincidence. \nShe is the master=\r\n planner. If She wants something to be given to \nsomeone, she will select s=\r\nomebody else as a nimitta for it and make \nthe second person give that thin=\r\ng to the first person. She is the \nenergy that moves the entire universe. S=\r\nhe is the ichcha sakti \n(desire), kriya sakti (action) and jnaana sakti (kn=\r\nowledge) of each \nbeing in this creation. It is amazing how She plans the w=\r\nhole thing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; She is like a master film director who is making a secret=\r\nive magnum \nopus. Imagine a director who has a really complicated script an=\r\nd \nshoots one scene with one set of actors and another scene with \nanother =\r\nset of actors etc. Each actor only knows the scenes (s)he is \nin. No actor =\r\ncan figure out the complete story from the few scenes \nthat (s)he knows. Th=\r\ne Mother is like that. She has a beautiful \nscreenplay and we are all actor=\r\ns playing out roles. We only know a \nlittle bit of the story.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some pe=\r\nople become too attached to the play and start wondering \nwhat the complete=\r\n story is. They waste their time and energy \nwondering what the complete st=\r\nory is or what the next scene is. This \ndoes not improve their performance =\r\nin their own scenes even one bit. \nOn the contrary, this guesswork sometime=\r\ns biases them and they end up \nmessing up their own scenes due to the mista=\r\nkened biases.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now take an actor who leaves it completely to the direc=\r\ntor, resigns \nto the mastery of the director and just does what (s)he is to=\r\nld to \ndo. Such an actor gives a perfect performance and does not waste any=\r\n \ntime or energy in unnecessary activities. Similarly, one who realizes \nHe=\r\nr mastery and realizes that She is the doer of everything and \nconsiders on=\r\neself a pawn in the hand of a master chess player does \nnot over-analyze ev=\r\nerything and leads a blissful and fruitful life \nand serves Her agenda perf=\r\nectly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is not a direct comment on what you said, but an extensio=\r\nn of \nthe previous streams of thought...\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thank you for your blessings=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org/homam\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.=\r\nnet\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri=\r\n Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original =\r\nMessage ----- \n&gt;   From: Amit Puri \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;=\r\n   Sent: Sunday, June 17, 2007 8:57 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: =\r\nvedic wisdom for learners\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   parnam guru ji \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   thanks for su=\r\nch a nice mail ...... this morning i was unable  to \nconcentrate my mind on=\r\n japa(it happen many time ) and i was thinking \nto post a message to my own=\r\n guru or in this group ........... and  \nwith the blessing of mother as aft=\r\ner japa i opened my box i read your \nmessage got my answer thanks for sprea=\r\nding knowledge keep it up may \ngod bless you with more knowledge ,,energy a=\r\nnd time to teach us.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Regard \n&gt; \n&gt;   Amit puri\n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Narasimha P=\r\n.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;     Dear Kishore,\n&gt; \n&gt;     There are so many =\r\npractices that are geared towards creating \ndiscipline, reducing ego, overc=\r\noming the inner enemies and purifying \noneself.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Any practice will =\r\ndo. However, depending on who one was earlier \nand what one did earlier, on=\r\ne may experience different levels of \naffinity towards different practices =\r\nand also get results at \ndifferent speeds with different practices.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n  Normal people can only give you good advice from THEIR \nperspective. They=\r\n cannot give you advice from YOUR perspective. Only \na sadguru, who knows m=\r\nore about the real you than you yourself do, \ncan give you advice from your=\r\n perspective. Unfortunately, I am  not \none.\n&gt; \n&gt;     If you want my sugges=\r\ntion nevertheless, here are some basic \nsuggestions.\n&gt; \n&gt;     (1) In &quot;Yoga =\r\nVaasishtham&quot;, Maharshi Vasishtha prescribes \ncompany of saints as the first=\r\n step in acquiring self-knowledge. \nSpend some time every week with spiritu=\r\nally inclined people \ndiscussing spiritual matters.\n&gt; \n&gt;     (2) Identify o=\r\nne personal weakness (e.g. anger, jealosy). Make \na sincere effort to overc=\r\nome it. Whenever the weakness strikes you \n(e.g. you become angry), conscio=\r\nusly restrain yourself and divert \nyour mind to something else (e.g. repeat=\r\ning a mantra).\n&gt; \n&gt;     (3) Take a mantra (e.g. Gayatri mantra). Spend atle=\r\nast 30 \nminutes everyday repeating that mantra. Sit comfortably with a \nrea=\r\nsonably straight back and closed eyes and repeat the mantra. If \nyour mind =\r\nwanders off the mantra and its deity and you get distracted \nby all kinds o=\r\nf thoughts, do not worry. Accept it as the nature of \nmind and make a consc=\r\nious effort to pull the mind back into the \nmantra and its deity.\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n(4) Before that japa, do a simple pranayama for 5 minutes. \nBreath in throu=\r\ngh the right nostril for n seconds, breath out through \nthe left nostril fo=\r\nr n seconds, breath in through the same left \nnostril for another n seconds=\r\n and then breath out through the right \nnostril for n seconds. Keep the tim=\r\ne duration - n seconds - \napproximately the same in all steps. If you want,=\r\n you can use a small \nmantra as the measure of time and say it mentally in =\r\neach step. Keep \nrepeating this sequence for 5 minutes.\n&gt; \n&gt;     (5) Cultiv=\r\nate the thinking that you do not own anything. Think \nthat you are just a *=\r\ntemporary caretaker* of things that seem like \nyour possessions (e.g. you r=\r\nelations, your house, your car and even \nyour own body, name, fame etc). Te=\r\nll yourself that all these are \ngod&#39;s property and that you are servant and=\r\n a temporary caretaker. \nJust as a servant working at a rich man&#39;s house ta=\r\nkes excellent care \nof things entrusted to him without developing the &quot;it i=\r\ns mine&quot; \nattachment to the things, tell yourself that you too have to take =\r\n\nexcellent care of all the things entrusted to you (e.g. your \nrelations, y=\r\nour house, your car, your body, name, fame etc) while \ncultivating the &quot;it =\r\nis god&#39;s and not mine&quot; sense.\n&gt; \n&gt;     This is a very important step and ju=\r\nst keep on trying if you \nkeep failing.\n&gt; \n&gt;     (6) Read a little of some =\r\nscripture or teachings of a holy man \neveryday. Examples are BhagavadGita, =\r\nJnaneshwari etc. I particularly \nrecommend &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot;. Ramakri=\r\nshna Parahamahamsa was a \ngreat master who taught the highest knowledge in =\r\nsimplest terms to \nall kinds of people. Read his teachings with an open min=\r\nd, understand \nthem and try to follow them.\n&gt; \n&gt;     *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;     If some previous karmas are blocking one&#39;s spiritual progress, \none =\r\nhas to either burn those karmas through sadhana or experience the \nresult o=\r\nf the karmas. Then only the blockage will go away. There is \nno other way.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;     Each minute spent in spiritual sadhana - including japam, homam \ne=\r\ntc - contributes to that. No effort is wasted. One should never get \ndishea=\r\nrtened.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Best regards,\n&gt;     Narasimha\n&gt;     ----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt;     Homam manual and audio: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;     Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:/=\r\n/vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;     Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;     Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;     --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; \n&gt;       ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;       From: Kisho=\r\nre Chitrapu \n&gt;       To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;       Sent: Sunday=\r\n, June 17, 2007 10:08 AM\n&gt;       Subject: [vedic-wisdom] vedic wisdom for l=\r\nearners\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Dear PVR,\n&gt; \n&gt;       There is a profound gravitation =\r\ntowards the knowledge flowing \nhere.
