(Texas is in the=\r\n far southern US, bordering Mexico, the country south of us, for anyone unf=\r\namiliar.)  My devotion has had its ups and downs for many years, but I am t=\r\nrying now to get firm in my practice.\n\nI lived near a Smarta temple in Ohio=\r\n (a far northern state in the USA, bordering Canada, the country to the nor=\r\nth of us) where I used to go to worship on occasion, and had a teacher ther=\r\ne who was teaching me some Sanskrit and a little theology along the way.  T=\r\nhat was several years ago.  Since moving to Texas, I have just discovered t=\r\nhat there is a Vedanta center not very far from where I live, and I plan to=\r\n go there when I can.\n\nPhilosophically, I hold to advaita vedanta, worshipi=\r\nng Siva as Ishvara.  (I may use some words in the wrong way, so please excu=\r\nse and correct me!)  I have done a good bit of reading, and meditate on a r=\r\negular basis, but I do lack good grounding in some of the actual day-to-day=\r\n worship and understanding of mantras and such.\n\nHaving been told that this=\r\n group could help me with some of that, I immediately joined.  I trust that=\r\n you will forgive my ignorance on many, many matters!\n\nDavyd\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
