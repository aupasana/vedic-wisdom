Sometimes,a physical=\r\n presence in guiding/teaching would help.\n\nOne more advantange is ,a group =\r\nof peoples can collectively perform a homam at one place on specific cause =\r\n(sattvic).Also they can share their experinces and correct/clarify each oth=\r\ner. \n\nThank you,\nSrini. \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;=\r\npvklnrao@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; For a long time, I wanted to teach homam locally a=\r\nnd was thinking of going to a local temple and teaching homam.
