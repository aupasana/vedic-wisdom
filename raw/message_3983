Not adding swaha for Ratri and Devi sooktam is suggested by some because people of this age may not be able to figure out modification of the ending intonation to add swaahaa. If you are not doing Vedic versions and doing pournaanik versions, there is no problem. The one in chapter 5 is pouraanik version of Devi sooktam. The Vedic version from Rigveda goes as aham rudrebhiHs.\n \nIf you want to do a smaller version instead of all 700 verses, I suggest doing a homam with the 4th or 11th chapters of saptashati.\n \nI am usually quite busy and have to leave out some mails without replying.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vishal sharma &lt;mbavishal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Charan Sparash PVR JI\n&gt; \n&gt; I am doing GaneshJi and Vishnu Ji Homam from last one year. On Sunday Rath\n&gt; saptami\n&gt; I got a desire to do devi/chandika homam including above ones.but as I am\n&gt; not good at reading durga saptasati\n&gt; so I decided to read the ratri devi suktakm [ as in chapter 5 of durga sapta\n&gt; sati] and also given in the end of gita press book in the last. and I am\n&gt; putting savaha with each of that mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please guide me is this OK.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am reposting this. I do not know but I wrote to this group four times.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1- One for myself to you  - I did not get any reply.\n&gt; 2- Wrote for my friend quest - I got the reply.\n&gt; 3- Wrote about manish ji article in TOI\n&gt; 4- Again the above mail I posted 15 days back - I did not get any reply\n&gt; \n&gt; So whenever I am writing for myself getting no reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; hope this time.............\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; vishal Sharma\n\n\n"}}
