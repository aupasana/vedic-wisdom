These five corpses are of Brahma,\n&gt; Vishnu, Rudr=\r\na, Mahadeva and Sadashiva. Simply put, She is representative\n&gt; energy of ev=\r\nerything. Personally, I don&#39;t like this explanation. To me the\n&gt; five preta=\r\ns are the five koshas surrounding the human organism. She\n&gt; controls all of=\r\n them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now if we take this line literally, She sits on an asana of five=\r\n pretas -\n&gt; spirits of a kind. You must have read the biographies of many s=\r\niddhas who\n&gt; worshipped Lalita Tripursundari. How many have you found who h=\r\nas had a\n&gt; vision of Her in this form, sitting on corpses? The Lalita Sahas=\r\nhranama is\n&gt; a complete text of ALL possible attirbutes of Lalita Tripursun=\r\ndari. Of\n&gt; these, what percentage of names do you find which can be describ=\r\ned as ugra?\n&gt;\n&gt; Consider this example. If you ask 100 people who is Sachin =\r\nTendulkar, all\n&gt; will reply that he is a great cricketer. But isn&#39;t Tendulk=\r\nar also a father,\n&gt; brother, son, husband, a responsible citizen of India, =\r\na consumer at the\n&gt; local grocery store, and for all you know maybe even a =\r\nreasonable bathroom\n&gt; singer? These are all his identities too. But why don=\r\n&#39;t we refer to them\n&gt; when we speak of Tendulkar? Because his central defin=\r\ning identity for us is\n&gt; his cricket.\n&gt;\n&gt; Same way, each deity eventually i=\r\ns everything. But each has its own\n&gt; &quot;defining identity&quot; which has its own =\r\nset of attributes. Of all the people\n&gt; worshipping Lalita Tripursundari at =\r\nthis very moment, probably a 2 percent\n&gt; or less will realize Her in this l=\r\nifetime. Of these, 99.9999999999999999999\n&gt; percent will realize Her ONLY i=\r\nn Her chief identity as Lalita. How many\n&gt; will, or have till date, actuall=\r\ny realized that form of Lalita\n&gt; Tripursundari sitting on a pretasana? And =\r\nwhy is this form so remote and so\n&gt; uncommon for most standard worshippers =\r\nof Lalita Tripursundari? These are\n&gt; questions to ponder!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve very l=\r\nittle knowledge of worship of Sri Lalita Tripursundari, either\n&gt; theoritica=\r\nl or from the point of practical worship, but if there is beauty\n&gt; in this =\r\nworld, it is Her. Like a five course gourmet meal, like a sublime\n&gt; poetry,=\r\n like an efforlessly brilliant music, like a dazzling play of\n&gt; lights, lik=\r\ne a classic Tendulkar shot,.... all these combined together and\n&gt; much much=\r\n more ...you feel and wish that it never comes to an end. It is\n&gt; difficult=\r\n to describe the feeling that She evokes, but it&#39;s like a flood of\n&gt; pure, =\r\ndistilled essence of beauty and you feel like there is nothing more\n&gt; to be=\r\n done, no goal to reach, no path to walk, no battles to fight - simply\n&gt; ba=\r\nsk in the depth of the moment because therein lies fullfilment and a\n&gt; whol=\r\ne new world! She banishes the very roots of the sense of strife and\n&gt; uglin=\r\ness from your system... the knowledge that She exists is enough to\n&gt; incapa=\r\ncitate you from asking anything more.

You must have read the biographies of many sidd=\r\nhas who worshipped Lalita Tripursundari. How many have you found who has ha=\r\nd a vision of Her in this form, sitting on corpses? The Lalita Sahashranama=\r\n is a complete text of ALL possible attirbutes of Lalita Tripursundari. Of =\r\nthese, what percentage of names do you find which can be described as ugra?=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consider this exam=\r\nple. If you ask 100 people who is Sachin Tendulkar, all will reply that he =\r\nis a great cricketer. But isn&#39;t Tendulkar also a father, brother, son, =\r\nhusband, a responsible citizen of India, a consumer at the local grocery st=\r\nore, and for all you know maybe even a reasonable bathroom singer? These ar=\r\ne all his identities too. But why don&#39;t we refer to them when we speak =\r\nof Tendulkar? Because his central defining identity for us is his cricket.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Same way, each deit=\r\ny eventually is everything. But each has its own &quot;defining identity&qu=\r\not; which has its own set of attributes. Of all the people worshipping Lali=\r\nta Tripursundari at this very moment, probably a 2 percent or less=C2=A0wil=\r\nl realize Her in this lifetime. Of these, 99.9999999999999999999 percent wi=\r\nll realize Her ONLY in Her=C2=A0chief identity as Lalita. How many will, or=\r\n have till date, actually realized that form of Lalita Tripursundari sittin=\r\ng on a pretasana? And why is this form=C2=A0so remote and so uncommon for m=\r\nost standard worshippers of Lalita Tripursundari? These are questions to po=\r\nnder!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&#39;ve very little knowledge of worship of Sri Lalita T=\r\nripursundari, either theoritical or from the point of practical worship,=C2=\r\n=A0but if there is beauty in this world, it is Her.=C2=A0Like a five course=\r\n gourmet=C2=A0meal, like a sublime poetry, like=C2=A0an efforlessly brillia=\r\nnt music, like a dazzling play of lights, like a classic Tendulkar shot,...=\r\n. all these combined together and much much=C2=A0more ...you feel and wish =\r\nthat it never comes to an end.

She banish=\r\nes the very roots of the sense of strife and ugliness from your system... t=\r\nhe knowledge that She exists is enough to\n incapacitate you from asking any=\r\nthing more.

They bestow different aspects of Supreme Know=\r\nledge. &lt;br&gt;\nWorshipping them for winning a court case or getting a job (whi=\r\nch many &lt;br&gt;people try to do today) is like trying to use a missile to crus=\r\nh an ant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding your dream, it may be genuine or merely a projec=\r\ntion of your &lt;br&gt;\nmind. Remember that mind is very powerful and projects va=\r\nrious conscious &lt;br&gt;and sub-conscious conditioning as its experiences, espe=\r\ncially in a &lt;br&gt;dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you feel that the dream is a genuine exper=\r\nience of the devata, then &lt;br&gt;\nkeep doing\n the mantra and see what happens.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you had the same experience with another mahavidya, it is possib=\r\nle &lt;br&gt;that your mind is just projecting. If your mind has affinity to a so=\r\numya &lt;br&gt;devata with certain nature, it may imagine whichever devata you wo=\r\nrship &lt;br&gt;\nto have that nature!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your mind is imagining an Ugra de=\r\nvata as a benign smiling form, &lt;br&gt;perhaps you should stick to a Soumya Dev=\r\nata. If the devata really gives &lt;br&gt;you a darshan in a fierce form, is your=\r\n mind capable of handling it? If &lt;br&gt;\nyour mind can visualize and perceive =\r\nan Ugra Devata in a truly fierce &lt;br&gt;form and yet feel deep love and surren=\r\nder for her, then only you are &lt;br&gt;suitable for such a sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good=\r\n luck in your sadhana!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;--------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual ma=\r\nnuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast=\r\nrologer.org/&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.=\r\norg/&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nSpirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriti=\r\nngs&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyoti=\r\nshWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nTwitter ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Hello,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; One of the M=\r\nahavidyas I got a mantra from an astrologer and did it &lt;br&gt;&gt; for 40 days=\r\n, but with 5 days of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sadhana, it&#39;s was so cool , but got a rea=\r\nl vison in dream of what they &lt;br&gt;&gt; call ugra devata , but Smiling&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; at me???
