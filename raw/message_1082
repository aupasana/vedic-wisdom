I remember there were th=\r\nree\nof them, but I am unable to find now.\n\nKedar Damle\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Some people hold the view that one with a living father cannot do it\nand \n=\r\n&gt; one&#39;s father must do it instead. The other view is that anybody can\ndo it=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I subscribe to the later view.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one&#39;s grandfather had some un=\r\nfilfilled desires and one&#39;s father\nis alive, \n&gt; of course, one&#39;s father can=\r\n offer tarpana. However, grandson can\nalso do it. \n&gt; Depending on the karmi=\r\nc debts, the unfilled desires may have more\neffect on \n&gt; the grandson than =\r\nson and hence tarpana offered by grandson may work\nbetter \n&gt; than tarpana o=\r\nffered by son. Thus, the idea that father has the\nexclusive \n&gt; &quot;right&quot; to t=\r\narpana and his son will get that right only after he\npasses away \n&gt; is illo=\r\ngical.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a father is a rich man with a lot of money, son may not need=\r\n to\nwork. \n&gt; However, if father is not that rich, son should better work.\nE=\r\nspecially if \n&gt; father is not capable of getting a good job and son is capa=\r\nble of\ngetting a \n&gt; good job, son should definitely find a job and work. Sa=\r\nying that\nonly father \n&gt; should work as long as he is alive and son should =\r\nstay home is\nwrong.
