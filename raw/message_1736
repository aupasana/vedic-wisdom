Thoughts and desires without a strong force behind them are \nnot a big problem. We engage in many of them. Small thoughts and desires \nwithout much force behind them are not a big problem.\n\nThe desires and thoughts with a strong force behind them are the ones that \nblock people. So try not to get attached to anything too much and desire \nanything so badly.\n\nDo your best at any point of time to get what you thing you should get or to \ndo what you think you should do. But learn to accept whatever comes your way \nas a result and move on.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;gulatiganesh&quot; &lt;gulatiganesh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, April 28, 2009 7:04 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n\n\n&gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt;\n&gt; The Karma and its various aspect as explained are clarly understandable. \n&gt; From the following quote few question arises\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Karma is not just good and bad things we do to people. It is also the \n&gt; thoughts entertained by the mind. Suppose you see a nice car and think \n&gt; &quot;how I wish I had such a car&quot;. Any action or thought that has some force \n&gt; behind it becomes a karma and gets a reaction from Nature. When your punya \n&gt; balance is sufficient in a future life, Nature will give you such a car, \n&gt; whether or not you want it in that life! You may not know why you got it, \n&gt; but you got it because you asked for it earlier.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nature is like a bank which keeps track of your wish list and your debt \n&gt; list. It automatically withdraws from your karma account to pay back your \n&gt; debts and it automatically withdraws from your karma account to pay for \n&gt; things on your wish list.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; When we are small child we have various wish.... say unlimited some of \n&gt; which we remeber and some we may not.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the current life itself we find some wish fulfilled and some remain \n&gt; unfulfilled and some have been forgetten by the end of this cycle of life.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, all those desire and thoughts which have force of our little \n&gt; childhood brain remain as our Karma to be carried by us? How to mitgate \n&gt; those? How the balance in the bank of the Nature for our wish list be \n&gt; withdrawn and debts be reduced in the present life cycle?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kindly enlighten\n&gt; Sincerely yours\n&gt; Ganesh Gulati\n\n\n"}}
