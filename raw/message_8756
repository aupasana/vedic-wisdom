In contrast the &quot;higher vital&quot; is more connected to elevated levels=\r\n of consciousness and expresses itself a joy, love, happiness, surrender, h=\r\numility etc. Generally, the deeper and positive qualities. \n\nThe advices be=\r\nlow are real for all of us (I found it particularly useful for myself) for =\r\nall of these are things that can and very often do happen to sadhaks, even =\r\npotentially excellent sadhaks. Those who do not find it useful can ignore i=\r\nt safely.\n\n*   *   *\n\n&quot;Whatever there may be in these higher parts (of man)=\r\n, aspiration to the Truth, devotion, or will to conquer the obstacles and t=\r\nhe hostile forces, it cannot become integral, it cannot remain unmixed or u=\r\nnspoilt or continue to be effective so long as the lower vital and the exte=\r\nrnal personality have not accepted the Light and consented to change. \n\nIt =\r\nwas inevitable that in the course of the sadhana these inferior parts of th=\r\ne nature should be brought forward in order that like the rest of the being=\r\n they may make the crucial choice and either accept or refuse transformatio=\r\nn. My whole work depends upon this movement; it is the decisive ordeal of t=\r\nhis yoga. For the physical consciousness and the material life cannot chang=\r\ne if this does not change. Nothing that may have been done before, no inner=\r\n illumination, experience, power or Ananda is of any eventual value, if thi=\r\ns is not done. If the little external personality is to persist in retainin=\r\ng its obscure and limited, its petty and ignoble, its selfish and false and=\r\n stupid human consciousness, this amounts to a flat negation of the work an=\r\nd the sadhana.\n\nThe difficulty in the lower vital being is that it is still=\r\n wedded to its old self and in revolt against the Light; it has not only no=\r\nt surrendered either to a greater Truth or to myself and the Mother, but it=\r\n has up to now no such will and hardly any idea even of what true surrender=\r\n is. When the lower vital assumes this attitude it takes its stand upon a c=\r\nonstant affirmation of the old personality and the past forms of the lower =\r\nnature. Every time they are discouraged, it supports and brings them back a=\r\nnd asserts its right to freedom - the freedom to affirm and follow its own =\r\ncrude and egoistic ideas, desires, fancies, impulses or convenience wheneve=\r\nr it chooses.\n\nIn the nature the resistance [of the lower nature to change]=\r\n takes certain characteristic forms which add to the confusion and to the d=\r\nifficulty of transformation. It is necessary to outline some of these forms=\r\n because they are sufficiently common, in some in a less, in others in a gr=\r\neater degree.\n\n1. A certain vanity and arrogance and self-assertive rajasic=\r\n vehemence which are a deformation of the vital force and habit of leading =\r\n[others] and domination that certain qualities in the higher vital gave the=\r\nm. This is accompanied by an excessive amour-propre [Feelings of excessive =\r\npride] which creates the necessity of making a figure, maintaining by any m=\r\neans position and prestige, even of posturing before others, influencing, c=\r\nontrolling or &quot;helping&quot; them, claiming the part of a superior sadhak, one w=\r\nith greater knowledge and with occult powers..... It is the Divine Shakti f=\r\nrom whom they [all powers] come and must use them only as the Mother&#39;s inst=\r\nrument and according to her directions; if it intervenes with the claim of =\r\nits ego and puts itself between her and the work or between her and other s=\r\nadhaks, then whatever its natural power, it deviates from the true way, spo=\r\nils the work, brings in adverse forces and wrong movements and does harm to=\r\n those whom it imagines it is helping. There is no better way of calling in=\r\n hostile forces into the general work or of vitiating and exposing to their=\r\n influence one&#39;s own sadhana. On a smaller scale these defects of vanity, a=\r\nrrogance and rajasic violence are present in most human natures.\n\n2. Disobe=\r\ndience and indiscipline. This lower part of the being is always random, way=\r\nward, self-assertive and unwilling to accept the imposition on it of any or=\r\nder and discipline other than its own idea or impulse. Its defects even fro=\r\nm the beginning stand in the way of the efforts of the higher nature to imp=\r\nose on the [lower] nature a truly regenerating tapasya. This habit of disob=\r\nedience and disregard of discipline is so strong that it seems to be immedi=\r\nate, irresistible and instinctive. Thus obedience to the Mother is repeated=\r\nly promised or professed, but the action done or the course followed is fre=\r\nquently the very opposite of the profession or promise. This constant indis=\r\ncipline is a radical obstacle to the sadhana and the worst possible example=\r\n to others. \n\n3. Dissimulation and falsity of speech. This is an exceedingl=\r\ny injurious habit of the lower nature. Those who are not straightforward ca=\r\nnnot profit by the Mother&#39;s help, for they themselves turn it away. Unless =\r\nthey change, they cannot hope for the descent of the supramental Light and =\r\nTruth into the lower vital and physical nature; they remain stuck in their =\r\nown self-created mud and cannot progress. Often it is not mere exaggeration=\r\n or a false use of the imagination embroidering on the actual truth that is=\r\n marked in the sadhak, but also a positive denial and a falsifying concealm=\r\nent of facts. This he does sometimes to cover up his disobedience or wrong =\r\nor doubtful course of action, sometimes to keep up his position, at others =\r\nto get his own way or indulge his preferred habits and desires. Very often,=\r\n when one has this kind of vital habit, he clouds his own consciousness and=\r\n does not altogether realise the falsity of what he is saying or doing.\n\n4.=\r\n A dangerous habit of constant self-justification. When this becomes strong=\r\n in the sadhak, it is impossible to turn him in this part of his being to t=\r\nhe right consciousness and action because at each step his whole preoccupat=\r\nion is to justify himself. His mind rushes at once to maintain his own idea=\r\n, his own position or his own course of action. This he is ready to do by a=\r\nny kind of argument, sometimes the most clumsy and foolish or inconsistent =\r\nwith what he has been protesting the moment before, by any kind of mis-stat=\r\nement or any kind of device. This is a common misuse, but none the less a m=\r\nisuse of the thinking mind; but it takes in him exaggerated proportions and=\r\n so long as he keeps to it, it will be impossible for him to see or live th=\r\ne Truth. \n\nAnd the worst suggestions and most dangerous deception come when=\r\n this spirit of demand and desire is dissimulated in a spiritual garb and t=\r\nakes a form which makes it seem to the sadhak a part of the yoga. There is =\r\nonly one way of escape from this siege of the lower vital nature. It is the=\r\n entire rejection of all egoistic vital demand, claim and desire and the re=\r\nplacement of the dissatisfied vital urge by the purity of psychic [inner-so=\r\nul/Godward] aspiration. Not the satisfaction of these vital clamours nor, e=\r\nither, an ascetic retirement is the true solution, but the surrender of the=\r\n vital being to the Divine and a single-minded consecration to the supreme =\r\nTruth into which desire and demand cannot enter. For the nature of the supr=\r\neme Truth is Light and Ananda, and where desire and demand are, there can b=\r\ne no Ananda.&quot;\n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
