That is the &quot;story&quot; or the\n&quot;myth&quot; coming aliv=\r\ne &quot;inside&quot; of &quot;you&quot;.\n\nDifficult concept to put into words, at least for me.=\r\n\n\nLet us consider Ms DS for example, short for durga saptashati.\n\nIt is a f=\r\nreaking long text!! at least for people who are initially\nstarting out reci=\r\nting it. But then this the path that is not easy to\nbegin with. And if it w=\r\nere easy, everybody would be very successful with\nit, and not many are ( it=\r\n all depends on her and your madness)\n\nThe main point with recitation is , =\r\nthat Ms DS comes &quot;alive&quot; &quot;inside&quot; of\n&quot;you&quot;.\nThe hell does that mean? It mea=\r\nns that you visualize the chapters as\nthey are.\nIt means that your focus or=\r\n the mind is not with the sexy girl you saw\nin the mall, the quickfire repl=\r\ny you should have given to the turd that\nslightly insulted you, or what pay=\r\nments you have to collect tomorrow\nfrom the bank etc etc. And neither it sh=\r\nould be somewhere singing songs\nand just waiting for this text (DS) to end.=\r\n\n\nBelieve you me , Rakesh ji it is tough. Insanely tough to get the mind\nfi=\r\nxed or visualizing the fight and all the carnage/beauty that is there\nin DS=\r\n. And what aids to the fun, is if you don&#39;t know sanskrit. Ha!!\n\nYou may kn=\r\now how to read the devanagri script, but dont really know what\nit means, th=\r\nen the real fun starts. So you are reciting a text, but\ncan&#39;t really visual=\r\nize it because you just don&#39;t know what the hell it\nmeans or what are you r=\r\neading!\n\nThere is a solution to that, you will need to read, re-read and re=\r\n-read\none chapter at a time and tie in the hindi translation or an\ninterpre=\r\ntation with the sanskrit text above. It will take time, an this\nis not a on=\r\ne day process. It might take years or days , and varies on a\ncase to case b=\r\nasis.\n\nI think the video would have ended in the other tab by now, you can =\r\nplay\nthis now.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHReN67juhCg\n\nLet us take C=\r\nhapter 10 for example,\nin the beginning fo the chapter, once he sees that h=\r\nis brother is dead\nGunda no 2 ( (Mr shumbh bhai) shouts at madameji for che=\r\nating and\nrelying on various other ladies  for killing his brother in crime=\r\n gunda\nno 1 ( Nishumbh bhai ) and cheating, and madame-ji replies with aww,=\r\n\nthose all were actually me and merges all the forms back and shows him.\n\nN=\r\now , when you get to the tenth chapter, this visualization should be\nthere =\r\n,when you read the specific verses about this incident and not be\nthinking =\r\nabout oh my god when will this end I am tired and mere paise us\nkutte haram=\r\ni ke paas pare hain aur woh nahin de raha hai.\n\nOver a period of time when =\r\nyou repeatedly visualize the entire story\nalong with the reading, then will=\r\n it one day come alive inside of you\nand teach you further, because there a=\r\nre layers upon layers upon layers\nof meaning there and it will be slowly ta=\r\nught very serenely depending on\nher wish and judgement.\n\nVideo must have en=\r\nded\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DKpGhw6bdmEQ\n\n&quot;If one has to do 108 tim=\r\nes sapatshati reading then can u pls guide what\nr rules in this time like &quot;=\r\n\n\nIf you can manage one good reading with a nice visualization going on,\nit=\r\n will be much better than 108 times of just rushing through with it.\n\n\n1] d=\r\niet ,\nYou will want to keep it as light as possible, khichri does the trick=\r\n,\nyou will need all the &quot;inner fire&quot; for your focus on the text and it is\na=\r\n limited resource, so the more heavier food you have the more it will\nbe us=\r\ned for digestion and potty preparation.\n\n2] can it be recited in 2 or 3 sit=\r\ntings in a day\nNo problems in that, but decide the routine before you commi=\r\ntting to\nmadame- she just does not like people backing off.\n\n3] if few word=\r\ns are not properly recited then is there any harm , if\nfeelings r just for =\r\nmothers love with nishkam bhav\n\nBhaisahab, kuch nahin hoga, you are not wor=\r\nshipping a churail here,\neventually ma hain, tumko kategi bhi toh roegi bhi=\r\n, pehle hi maafi maang\nlo. bum nahin phootega/phootegi.\n\nPlus you are sayin=\r\ng harm with nishkam bhav, not sure those two fit in\nthe same sentence.\n\n4] =\r\nis 13 chap enough or any start addition is reqd if so then pls\nsuggest,\nBha=\r\niyo, 13 hi karlo theek thaak focus ke saath , go to bigger things\nlater.\n\n5=\r\n] any other advice\nYou try to improve your one reading and step by step get=\r\n it to a point\nwhere the text is flowing inside of you and out, other wise =\r\n108 will be\njust a mental burden with you trying to hurriedly complete, wit=\r\nh you\ngetting terribly bored while youa re at it.. Don&#39;t expect any fruits\n=\r\npost your 108 completion.\n\n6]also as  u said that it is essence of vedas bu=\r\nt how can it give moksha\nas we r just reading but if one does recitation of=\r\n one mantra with\nclosed eyes then is mantra better.\n\nOoh the video must hav=\r\ne ended, here another one\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=3Dendscreen&=\r\nNR=3D1&v=3DKEvKcdBfqtU\n\nYou make the entire text run inside of your head li=\r\nke a HD movie in\n1080p resolution and you will yourself say that it is the =\r\nessence of the\nvedas.\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;but how can it give moksha as we r just reading&quot;=\r\n&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\nYou dont just have to read, hehe.\n\nRegarding, moksha, all i can say us=\r\ned to be the name of very pretty girl\nback in school, saali ki shaadi ho ga=\r\nyi, god-damn it!!\n\nAnyways if anyone expects any results , forget it. All s=\r\nhe will be doing\nis smoking a cigarette and yawning, if you just go through=\r\n it\nmindlessly.\n\nBut it always start mindlessly and if you keep at it, she =\r\neventually\ndecides to teach you. So start today ,and make small improvement=\r\ns every\nday.\n\nIts all training and the amount of hard work that you put in,=\r\n in any\nfield of life, same here.\n\nOne good reading of only 13 chapters tak=\r\nes about 1 hour 10 minutes or 20\ndepending on your speed and if you are rea=\r\nlly comfortable it can go down\nto about an 55 to sixty minutes for one read=\r\ning, that is if you have\nreally been living with Ms DS for years.\n\nBhagwan =\r\naapke saath rahe for 108 in a day.\n\nJai Radhika!\n\nVideo phir over - ek aur =\r\nlo\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D_2ETPkAktTA&feature=3Dendscreen&NR=3D1\n=\r\n\nOk\ntata\nbirla\nambani\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rakesh.behal&quot; =\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narsimha ji,\n&gt; namaste.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one has to do 108 times sap=\r\natshati reading then can u pls guide\nwhat r rules in this time like\n&gt;\n&gt; 1] =\r\ndiet ,\n&gt; 2] can it be recited in 2 or 3 sittings in a day\n&gt; 3] if few words=\r\n are not properly recited then is there any harm , if\nfeelings r just for m=\r\nothers love with nishkam bhav\n&gt;\n&gt; 4] is 13 chap enough or any start additio=\r\nn is reqd if so then pls\nsuggest,\n&gt;\n&gt; 5] any other advice\n&gt;\n&gt; 6]  also as  =\r\nu said that it is essence of vedas but how can it give\nmoksha as we r just =\r\nreading\n&gt; but if one does recitation of one mantra with closed eyes then is=\r\n\nmantra better.\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; rakesh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
