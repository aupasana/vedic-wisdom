The stick is helpful only if you c=\r\nonsciously spare the leg from effort. Once the leg cures, you can then not =\r\nonly walk but also run. Similarly, a lot of technical details of the mantra=\r\n do not matter much. Use mantra to focus the mind and cure it of its condit=\r\nioning (i.e. impurity!).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best\n regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Fr=\r\nee Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals fo=\r\nr short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.o=\r\nrg/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;F=\r\nilms that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writing=\r\ns: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-astrology%40yahoog=\r\nroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrolog=\r\ny%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Chandan Sabharwal=\r\n &lt;chandan.sabharwal@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; then what about tantr=\r\nas which proclaim that unless the 5 elements are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not purified firs=\r\nt , every puja / ritual is simply abhichara ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Chandan Sabharwal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo=\r\n.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targ=\r\net=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astr=\r\nology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Ranjan-da,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nice words!

Thank you for sharing this simple mantras with the readers; li=\r\nterally hundreds would benefit from this as they seek their solace.

But for a trained eye and the learned gurus, and for =\r\nthose who have focused more on the good lord to seek the knowledge (with to=\r\ntal discipline and in\n submitting to the Lord unconditionally), this art be=\r\ncomes a science as they acquire &quot;vak-suddhi&quot;; AND they are able to guide th=\r\ne people.

Mr. PVRji has listed some, but would be good to develop such list and ma=\r\nke them available in one place. I truly believe that would be more useful a=\r\nnd powerful than prescribing remedies which may or may not work(with possib=\r\nle high degree\n of error possibilities in the charts).
