Please forgive me/ignore me for I do not have ability to write systemati=\r\ncally and i write things from my own experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; If one wishes =\r\nto know the benefits of Chandi path, one can simply go though 11th chapter =\r\nlater part and 12th chapter where in Mother herself describes those.\n&gt; ***\n=\r\n&gt; I started Chandi path in Jan 2008 (As per tradition) unplanned-with my ow=\r\nn intuition and without any initiation (I even did not know that Initiation=\r\n is required for CP). I went ahead to complete 108 consecutive days of reci=\r\ntation.\n&gt; After that, within few months a Guru came in my life and also Agn=\r\ni Sadhana. Since then Chandi-path (whether In terms of Simple recitation or=\r\n Chandi Havan) is part of my daily life. \n&gt; A couple of years back, My Guru=\r\n told me that 13 chapters are the most important part and it is ok to recit=\r\ne 13 chapters and skip other limbs. So I started reciting 13 chapters only-=\r\ndaily. It was taking 1 hour 20 minutes earlier which has come down to 50 mi=\r\nnutes and loud recitation has changed to mental recitation.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Though =\r\nI was reciting CP daily since a long time, nobody from my near ones was int=\r\nerested in that. I never forced or even insisted anybody to do that. I knew=\r\n the hard fact that spending 2/3 hours of time daily is almost not possible=\r\n for people.\n&gt; As it happened one day in Jan 2010, I forced my sister to re=\r\ncite CP over a phone conversation. I say I forced her because I told her th=\r\nat If she loves me sincerely, She must start Chandi Path recitation and to =\r\nmake her start that I suddenly got one idea. I asked her to recite Kavach a=\r\nnd one chapter in Rotation daily. Kavach+1st ch, Kavach+2nd ch=85.Kavach+13=\r\n ch. Kavach+1st Ch and so on=85.She accepted the idea and started. Thank yo=\r\nu so much to MAA that she started. Violation of traditional way never cross=\r\ned my mind and never bothered me. Maa is very kind. Very compassionate. She=\r\n did not let down me. My Sister, just after few weeks of recitation started=\r\n getting strange happy worldly results (Sattwik though) and she got a mirac=\r\nulous relief from a issue which was troubling her for many years. That Init=\r\nial encouragement was enough to cement her faith and since then she is doin=\r\ng recitation on daily basis (same way).\n&gt; After that trigger, one by one ma=\r\nny people started CP same way. My wife, Brother, his wife, few distant rela=\r\ntives, few close friends and few colleagues. More than Dozen people are now=\r\n reciting it daily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of the above mentioned people who started CP =\r\nactually got some instant surprising material results which cemented their =\r\nfaith which was very strong factor that is keeping them reciting it daily. =\r\n\n&gt; For Instance, One lady whose daughter was not having child even after 5 =\r\nyears of marriage, called my wife one day and asked her to check with me he=\r\nr daughter&#39;s chart for the progeny. Instead of seeing the chart, I asked my=\r\n wife to convey that let her start reading CP daily (Kavch+1 ch). It so hap=\r\npened that she said started CP on 1st day of chaitri Navaratri and on the s=\r\name day she got good news from her daughter.\n&gt; Another lady, suffering from=\r\n sever problems in marriage is now getting very encouraging results regardi=\r\nng her marital life. Even I feel that it is a kind of miracle because it wa=\r\ns a hopeless situation for her.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; I am not saying here that all the a=\r\npparent good things will happen if one starts reciting CP. I also do not wi=\r\nsh to discount importance of traditional method of reciting CP. I myself st=\r\narted that way and did it for almost couple of years. However I definitely =\r\nwish to stress a point that Mother is very-very kind. Especially in times w=\r\ne live in, she would not look for perfect ritualistic method for Chandi rec=\r\nitation even though people recite in hope of some material (reasonable) ben=\r\nefits.\n&gt; In fact, I have gone through major material and spiritual problems=\r\n since I started Chandi Path and Havan. However for me, I most of the times=\r\n never thought for benefits and keep going with CP as I think I have starte=\r\nd loving her. I started CP because I wanted to progress spiritually.\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\nIt is my strong faith (developed due to my experiences as well as some soun=\r\nd logic) that in Kaliyuga, recitation of CP with some level of devotion is =\r\nenough and more important than traditional technicalities such as particula=\r\nr Method, specific range of voice, speed,Initiation etc=85\n&gt; \n&gt; So friends,=\r\n it is important to start Loving mother. If you are bogged down by idea of =\r\ncomplete Chandi path daily then start with 1 ch or 2 ch or 3 ch + Kavach da=\r\nily or which ever way suitable to you. As Vimalananda, a great devotee of M=\r\nother, used to fondly say=85carve your own niche! \n&gt; Once you start it, Maa=\r\n will take care and provide further guidance as when required. Leave it to =\r\nher. Eventually start ignoring results and keep doing whatever may be the r=\r\nesults. My concluding comments are that Chandi Path is &quot;Sab dukho ki ek daw=\r\naa&quot; =96 It&#39;s a sure shot Rama-bana.\n&gt;   \n&gt; While at the moment when Shani d=\r\newa is on the verge of entering Tula Rashi (Uchha Rashi-Uchha Navamansha as=\r\n per SSS), I pray to Maa Chandi to drive many more closer to her by easiest=\r\n & one of her most effective instrument called Chandi-Path.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
