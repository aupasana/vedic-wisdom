I finally got to \nread a little from it. I am impressed =\r\nwith this work.\n\nThe book is called &quot;Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hi=\r\nnduism Studies in \nAmerica&quot; (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicola=\r\ns and Aditi Banerjee). \nIt has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 section=\r\ns.\n\nPerverted scholars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look down upo=\r\nn India \nand Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted perverted re=\r\nsearches in \nthe name of academic freedom at the religious studies departme=\r\nnts of western \nuniversities, published them and gained name and fame, tram=\r\npling the sacred in \nthe process. Crying foul or getting frustrated with th=\r\nis will not improve the \nsituation or solve the problem. Interested religio=\r\nus scholars have to firmly and \npatiently crtique these works in the same a=\r\ncademic style, in order to reclaim \nthe rightful place for Hinduism.\n\nSever=\r\nal papers in this book do exactly that. They take specific works by western=\r\n \nscholars and rebut them quite well and show how they are fallacious, hast=\r\ny, \nnonsensical or sometimes downright manipulative or filled with lies.\n\n*=\r\n        *        *\n\nI will just give an example of the offensive work that =\r\nwas rebutted in this \nbook. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offensive =\r\nwritings should skip the \nnext three paragraphs.]\n\nJeffrey Kripal from Univ=\r\n of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal \nand did research on=\r\n Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people there \nenthusiastically helped him=\r\n in the researches. In the end, what he produced is \nutterly nonsensical an=\r\nd filled with lies. He published his PhD dissertation \nwithout showing it t=\r\no Ramakrishna Mission people to check for factual or \nlinguistic inaccuraci=\r\nes. Ramakrishna mission people found out about what he \nproduced only years=\r\n later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based on the PhD \ndissertation won gr=\r\neat acclaim in the West. He won an award at the Americal \nAcademy of Religi=\r\non for that book, landed a job at Harvard and his book was \nsadly mentioned=\r\n in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number one* choice for \nlearning ab=\r\nout Ramakrishna.\n\nIn the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually perve=\r\nrted person, a \nhomosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali or Hind=\r\ni or Sanskrit well \nand did not take help from any Bengali people at the Mi=\r\nssion for this work. He \nused his own faulty translations, willful distorti=\r\nons and manipulation of \nsources to arrive at sensational (and damning) con=\r\nclusions. For example, he \ntranslated a word that means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;=\r\n, in the context of Swami \nBrahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and a =\r\nyoung boy then) sitting in \nRamakrishna&#39;s lap. He translated a word that me=\r\nans &quot;touching softly&quot; as \n&quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penise=\r\ns of boys&quot;.\n\nEven in places where there was no material to mis-translate, h=\r\ne simply \nspeculated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of Totapuri=\r\n and \nRamakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught=\r\n advaita \nvedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali and exp=\r\nerience \nnirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have been like for Ramakrishna, =\r\na homosexually \noriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut with =\r\nanother, stark-naked \nman. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man&#39;s nu=\r\ndity, and more especially, \nhis penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s a=\r\nttention. How could it not?&quot; \nPlease note that he is not referring to any s=\r\nource and mis-translating it, but \nsimply speculating based on his perverte=\r\nd agenda!\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf you see the book, you will see many exam=\r\nples of such pseudo-scholarship \ndriven by heinous agendas. It is a fact th=\r\nat many perverted people under asuric \ninfluences make their livelihood, mo=\r\nney and fame lying and spreading falsehoods \nabout Hinduism, Hindu deities =\r\nand Hindu saints.\n\nThose who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha agai=\r\nnst this may ignore this \nand go on doing their sadhana. After all, if enou=\r\ngh people do sadhana to \nstrengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things wi=\r\nll automatically weaken. \nHowever, some scholars engaging these pseudo-scho=\r\nlars academically is really \nrequired on the ground.
