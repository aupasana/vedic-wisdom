Some people use the tubes in which incense sticks (dhoop or agarbatti sticks) are sold. Even with bamboo tubes, if air directly goes from mouth into fire, it can carry saliva. The key is that air blown from mouth should touch some surface (e.g. inside wall of bamboo tube) at an angle slightly less than 180 deg, get reflected and then go towards fire. Then, air touching fire will not have saliva in it. You can experiment by blowing air onto one palm by reflecting it off the other palm. You&#39;ll see that air coming to the latter is wet and the air coming to the former is dry. In any case, like I said, maintaining a good sized fire always is better than letting it nearly extinguish and then resuscitate it by blowing air.\n \nIdeally, one should not leave in the middle and stay till the end. If one must leave the area for a nature&#39;s call, one can add enough wood (or other fuel) before the break.\n \nAfter the nature&#39;s call, it is a good idea to take bath again. Some level of physical cleanliness is to be maintained with external fire. One cannot say &quot;I am pure inside and why does external purity matter&quot;. Just as the internal fire is affected by internal purity, external fire is affected by external purity.\n \nWhen the external fire is strong, the internal fire tries to follow it and resonate with it. So the rules of external fire must be obeyed. If a yogi with a very strong internal fire is doing homam, then actually the internal fire may dominate and the external fire may follow it and resonate with it! Then the rules of external fire do not apply.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- S &lt;tejomaya101@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;          I remember reading somewhere( some book on homa vidhi) that the proper way to do this is to use a bamboo tube. In  the old days, this was the way it was done even in the kitchen. The agni used to cook food is also holy and some of the same rules apply.If you dont have a bamboo tube, then you can get it from one of the people who make and sell ladders and the like( if you are in India). Not to disparage others, but some of the priests themselves are ignorant of all the things which needs to be observed in a homa. As an example, for long homas one is allowed to drink water and milk in between- but no stimulants(coffee/tea being the most common).\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;             Namaste! What do the sastras say about what we should do when we have to answer the call of nature during a homa ? For japa, the rules are clear to me- do the same rules apply for homa ? If for example we must get up and go for a &#39;long call&#39; and hence have to take bath- the fire could go off- do we add more wood/cow dung/samit and go ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; S\n&gt; \n&gt; p.s.

If there is any other\n&gt; &gt; auspicious day in the near furute for conducting a mahalakshmi homam in the\n&gt; &gt; near future, please suggest us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i am sorry to say that most of the moderen day priests but not everyone are\n&gt; &gt; very commercial in nature.Its my practical experience with them.IMO, its ok\n&gt; &gt; if they demand more money from the clients but atleast they should try to\n&gt; &gt; justify the poeple who approach them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i am neither a brahmin nor my family has ever condcuted these kind of\n&gt; &gt; religious rituals.so i dont know the Do-s and Dont-s while performing a\n&gt; &gt; homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sir, it would be more helpful if you can publish a list of Homa instructions\n&gt; &gt; or &#39;things -to - remember while performing homam&#39; (something like i was told\n&gt; &gt; to put the offerings in the fire without spilling it on the edges of the\n&gt; &gt; homakundam, having more fore than smoke as you said below, etc), key\n&gt; &gt; ingredients of every homa,etc or please point me to the material if its\n&gt; &gt; already existing somewhere so that we can raise our voice when something\n&gt; &gt; during homam is getting devaiated from how it is intended to be done. Sorry\n&gt; &gt; if its too much of an ask.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again, your selfless efforts in spreading the Homam significance for the\n&gt; &gt; benefit of entire universe is really appreciative and i sincerely wish that\n&gt; &gt; your teachings should reach every nook and corner of the world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Hima Bindu\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Mon, Sep 6, 2010 at 8:25 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your grandmother is correct and her teaching is more applicable in the case\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of holy homam fire. The priest you mentioned below simply showed poor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; judgment and understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one blows air into homa kundam directly from mouth, small amounts of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s saliva and one&#39;s germs get into homa kundam. That is a very bad idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one must absolutely blow air, Vimalananda suggests blowing through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hand or some other object, i.e. you blow onto your palm and the air reflects\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at a slight angle and goes into homa kundam. That is better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I never blow air. When fire is getting smaller, I offer ghee, sesame seeds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or wood to make it bigger. One need not wait so long that fire is about to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguish. One should make it bigger earlier.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ideally, there should be fire in a bigger part of homa kundam than smoke.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If fire has gone out in a bigger part of the homa kundam and there is smoke\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and if fire is present in a smaller part of homa kundam, that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inauspicious and ineffective. Lord Vishnu specifically taught that homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should be done with more fire in homa kundam than smoke.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the habit of waiting till fire becomes so small that it comes close\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to extinguishing, is a bad one to start with. One should maintain a bigger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire always.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When a sadhaka with a very thin kaarmik pipeline does something, the result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is seen very soon. So, if one starts a wrong practice, one will see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; result soon and learn one&#39;s lesson. When someone with a very deep kaarmik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pipeline starts engaging in a wrong practice, the result may be seen much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much later. By that time, one may have done that wrong thing too many times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests used to do intense sadhana and burn their karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even if they did something wrong, they would quickly figure it out and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; correct themselves. Many priests of today have very deep kaarmik pipelines,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do not do much sadhana and the Nature&#39;s feedback system is broken.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When a priest or someone respectable does something incorrect, one can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speak out if one thinks there is a reasonable chance of benefit from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speaking out. Some priests are open-minded and understanding, but some are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; egoistic and they do not want to be corrected by laymen. If one questions a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; priest and the priest becomes angry, can one remain calm or will one start\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to feel guilty or scared? If so, one should not question. One should not do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something, unless one is prepared for the consequences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- pinky s &lt;shakti.axapta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Respected sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With the inspriration of &quot;Do Homam Yourself&quot; from Pujya Sri PVR Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rao garu, i thought it would be a gud idea to perform mahalakshmi homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during sravana month friday and approached a brahmin priest for the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lotus flowers dipped in honey, Bilva fruits, Bilva leaves and other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flowers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were offered during the homa with 16 times recital of Srisuktham. With\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; virtue of knowledge gained from your previous posts, which essentially\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that any sattvic material can be offered to gods in the homam fire, i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; took a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; piece of red cloth and red bangles for the purnahuti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the first time i participated/performed a homam and it was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spritual experience. i felt that i gained a lot of positive energy from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; homam. i strongly felt that my offerings reached mahalakshmi devi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through the homakunda. Such is the impact of your teaching about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Homam-significance on me! Thank you, sir.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, my mind is slighlty disturbed over a co-priest&#39;s action during\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; homam. When the homam fire was weakened and about to extinguish, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; priest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has blown air through his mouth directly into teh homa kundam to increase\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the intensity of flames in it :(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i have heard from my grandmother that blowing air through mouth into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flame/fire is equal to spitting on it and its a very unholy act. Since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i desisted myself from celebrating my birthday by blowing candles too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to stop this act of his..but again i thought that my &#39;fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extinguishion(by blowing air through mouth)&#39; knowledge may not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relevant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the homam fire and i should not interfere with the priest,who seemed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be well experienced in performing homams.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PLease comment something about this and enlighten us with your knowledge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that i will be careful from next time. Also, if there are any other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ingredients specific for mahalakshmi homam, please suggest us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
