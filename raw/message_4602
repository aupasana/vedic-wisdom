Perfection in external matters such as pronunciation and ritual actions is merely one factor. The intention and internal attitude is a more important factor. One with perfect pronunciation may not get results and one with a terrible pronunciation may get results.\n \nTo give a cricketing analogy, a batsman may have a bad technique and play cross-batted shots away from his body without moving his feet much. Still, he may have excellent eye-hand co-ordination and instincts and may score well and become a great player (like Virender Sehwag). However, most people with such style may fail and Sehwag is an exception rather than a rule.\n \nThough pronunciation and external ritual actions are a small factor, one can start off trying to do a decent job with those. Slowly, disciplined performance of external actions may transform internal attitude.\n \nIt is much more than a &quot;strange combination of American and Oriya/Bengali accent mixed together&quot;. Short and long vowels are mixed up. Vowels in consecutive consonants are also sometimes mixed up. Some consonants are mixed up. The length of syllables fluctuates wildly. As I said, I know Americans who read Chandipath and other Sanskrit hymns reasonably well (despite some detectable accent). This particular case is unusually off.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- deleted &lt;deleted&gt; wrote: \n&gt; This bought up a question that I&#39;ve been meaning to ask:\n&gt; Yes, I cringed too when I first heard the pronunciation of the Swamiji, a\n&gt; strange combination of American and Oriya/Bengali accent mixed together. But\n&gt; on reading his biographical account where it was described that he would sit\n&gt; naked for hours on a glacier and chant the Chandi forwards and backwards, I\n&gt; could not help but wonder --- where is that fine line anyway, where it (i.e.\n&gt; pronunciation) no longer matters? Surely the Lord must be listening to that\n&gt; plaintive cry? After all, Shri Ramakrishna himself said that if your heart\n&gt; is being wrung like a wet towel longing for the Lord, the Lord has no option\n&gt; but to reveal Himself!!\n&gt; I keep wondering if there is a slider scale that offsets ritualistic\n&gt; perfection with intensity of the desire, past karmas etc - after all there\n&gt; are plenty of learned Pundits with complete mastery of rituals with no\n&gt; *Experience* per se, and plenty of people ignorant of rituals or without\n&gt; complete mastery who have had real Experiences?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am sorry, but I have to strike a discordant note.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Swamiji at Shree Maa&#39;s ashram may be a learned and sincere man and may\n&gt; give nice lectures on Chandipath. However, his pronunciation is unbelievably\n&gt; terrible. I have seen several westerners who do a far far better job with\n&gt; the pronunciation of Chandipath as well as other Sanskrit hymns. His\n&gt; pronunciation is particularly bad.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, pronunciation may not matter to some and, if so, please ignore\n&gt; my mail. But, in case it matters, I must say that his pronunciation is\n&gt; unbelievably terrible and not a good starting point for learners.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am basing my judgment on listening to the first few verses of &quot;Chapter\n&gt; 4&quot; at\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/shree_maa_chandi_path_audio_classes\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After listening to two verses, I simply could not continue listening.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where they have conducted the most Chandi Homas in all over USA.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They seem to have done a Sahasra (1000) Chandi homa over a period of 1000\n&gt; days and they seem to be still doing Chandi homam on every Sunday. That is\n&gt; excellent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, it is not possible to know where most Chandi homas were done in\n&gt; USA.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At my house, we do 3 Chandi homas per day (one by myself and two by two\n&gt; other sadhakas). I myself have done about 1200 Chandi homas here. In a\n&gt; neighboring town 10 miles from here, a priest from India has been doing 10\n&gt; Chandi homas per day for the last 2 months and plans to finish 1000 Chandi\n&gt; homas in August. He is doing it as a private sadhana, but without a private\n&gt; sankalpa and for peace and dharma in the world.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Like this, there may be several sadhakas doing intense sadhana with Chandi\n&gt; homam that we may not know about.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In any case, numbers do not matter. Manish once told me, &quot;Narasimha,\n&gt; numbers do not matter. What one needs is one homam where one experiences Her\n&gt; in oneself and not twenty homas where nothing happens. These days, I cannot\n&gt; properly finish even one Chandi homam. Once I am in the 4th or 5th chapter,\n&gt; I go into a trance and I cannot continue anymore. I stay like that for many\n&gt; hours and cannot finish the homam.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- m540i98 &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Respected Shree Maa has a ashram in Napa Valley, a couple hour drive\n&gt; from bay area.
