Sastry ji has written m=\r\nany wonderful books clarifying dharma from the Mahabharata and other common=\r\n dharmic dilemas faced by the common man.\n\n2.Often he has referred to the b=\r\neginning of Kali yuga as the time when the great war took place or to be mo=\r\nre specific when Parikshit dies.\n\n3.Most of the Sages meet in Naimisharanya=\r\n to discuss strategies to guide the people about the imminent dawn of Kali =\r\nyuga.\n\nThe Wikipedia entry is biased by Western historians who have bandied=\r\n about this date of Mahabharata as being 3000 B.C to fit their bibilical vi=\r\new of the world and to distort the timeline of the SIndhu Saraswati Civiliz=\r\nation ( I will not for the life of me call it the Indus valley civilization=\r\n because it distorts the reality ) \n\nIn the past twenty years many noted In=\r\ndian historians have effectively questioned this date. Notable among them b=\r\neing S venkataraman , Prof Subash Kak and other independent authors like Da=\r\nvid Frawley .Frawley also wrote the famous book &quot; In search of the cradle o=\r\nf Civilization &quot;. The book is available on Amazon.\n\n4.Recently one of the I=\r\nISC researchers has used a star map to tally the positions of the stars per=\r\ntaining to the time of eclipses mentioned in the Mahabharata to come up wit=\r\nh a date similar to 5000 B.C which was also mentioned in Saraswati Films do=\r\ncumentary .\n\nI am personally not sold on the date being close to 3000 B.C .=\r\nIt would be more close to 5000/6000 B.C\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n--=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Veneet Kumar &lt;kveneet@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; He=\r\nllo Sanjayji\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not have the Sanskrit text of Jaimini MBH.
