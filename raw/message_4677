May his soul rest in pe=\r\nace.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Electricity too is a form of fire. Burning by normal fire is bet=\r\nter, but electric cremation is not too bad. It is far better than burial, w=\r\nhere the gross body remains intact and decays slowly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one is evict=\r\ned from the house one has lived in for decades and has an attachment to, on=\r\ne may camp outside the house in the hope that one will be allowed back into=\r\n the house. If the house is bulldozed, one will have to accept it and move =\r\non. Moving on to other non-physical realms of being or to another physical =\r\nbody is easier if body is reduced to ashes than if it is buried.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some=\r\n people put a small lamp inside a dry coconut and place it along with the b=\r\nody in the electric cremation chamber. If that is allowed, that may be cons=\r\nidered.\n&gt;  \n&gt; After being forced out of a body, soul may hang around for a =\r\nvariable amount of time. It can range from hours to days or even months or =\r\nyears. It is better to burn as soon as possible. However, 48 hours is not t=\r\noo bad.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As in the analogy, soul is like a person evicted from a house=\r\n he lived in for decades. One may hang around the house (body) in the hope =\r\nthat one may get back in. If the house is destroyed, one will be forced to =\r\ndeal with it and leave the town and go to another town (different loka) or =\r\nfind another house in the same town (another physical body to be born in).\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; If the soul has already moved on before cremation, it is not a bad th=\r\ning. You are fixing a non-problem then. If the soul has not moved on before=\r\n cremation, cremation will hopefully help. So, in either case, cremation is=\r\n a good idea, either by fire or electricity.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I will write more things=\r\n about things you should consider, in the next day or two. First, good luck=\r\n with the cremation. Think as much as you can and make the decision. Once y=\r\nou make a decision, do not think further or listen to what others say.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; If you have the guts and people around you can reconcile with it, burning=\r\n the body on real fire, calling the divine Mother or Shiva in the fire and =\r\ndoing a homam is not a bad idea. If one does it, one can skip the &quot;kravyaad=\r\namagnim&quot; mantra after starting fire. If you can visusalize that god has com=\r\ne in the fire and pray to god to take care of the soul, it can give a good =\r\npush (depending on how good your visualization is and how pure you are). Ev=\r\nen if one does no such ritual, one can sit in front of the funeral pyre (at=\r\n a safe distance) with an erect back and closed eyes and meditate. One can =\r\nmeditate for god to come in fire and show direction to the soul of the depa=\r\nrted.\n&gt;  \n&gt; More later..\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manua=\r\nls for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.or=\r\ng\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyoti=\r\nsh writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- vedicastro=\r\nstudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji (or other wise=\r\n people on this group),\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My father passed away a few hours ago, and=\r\n I am in shock.
