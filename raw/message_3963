I =\r\nsaid &quot;Yes&quot; and started (I went on two whealer yesterday, and hence confiden=\r\nt I could make it in time).\n&gt; \n&gt; Normally when I drive, I will be mentally =\r\nchanting some mantras. Yesterday was no different. But, at some point, I wa=\r\ns getting struck in the traffic and unthinking, I was telling, Oh, my God, =\r\nensure I reach in time. Afterall before starting my boss challenged me if I=\r\n could reach&quot;. The very next movement, I thought, &quot;Why am I seeking Gods he=\r\nlp in such a small thing.

Can I really manage it by my=\r\nself?&quot;.Abosolutely NO.\n&gt; \n&gt; While, I was correct in thinking, I should not =\r\nask God&#39;s help in petty things, I was incorrect in assuming &quot;This I can do =\r\non my own&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; What we do, we do by grace of God.

Like Rajarshi has mentioned, I wish to say that many members of this l=\r\nist are well read. I assume that they must have read many a books from diff=\r\nerent authors and covering many philosophies. I have myself read books of v=\r\narious sages, yogis and philosophers. It was not accurate when you said Vim=\r\nalananda is the only saint, this list discuss about. This assumption was no=\r\nt right.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I being a gruhastha, know very well, the importance o=\r\nf Material success, even for survival. I am not completely against asking f=\r\nor some material success while doing some saadhana (Say Homa, Japa etc...) =\r\nbut i feel that it is much better, atleast for people who engage in serious=\r\n saadhana, to consciously try for reducing and removing the thoughts of som=\r\ne or the other wants. If i take my example, When i started Homam, i dont re=\r\nmember thinking anytime about money, fame, career etc...during Homam or Jap=\r\na. it is clear now to me that i was provided by Mother what i needed to sur=\r\nvive and even better. It also happened that I lost a good amount of money i=\r\nn a certain case but i never related to the Spiritual practices especially =\r\nHomam. Infact i tried not to relate any Material succes or losses to Homam.=\r\n though I must say here that several people who attended Homam with me have=\r\n been benefited materially and that has instilled faith in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In m=\r\ny opinion, it is a very beautiful suggetion to leave it to God to decide wh=\r\nat is right and what is wrong, what is required and what is not for us rath=\r\ner than asking or doing saadhana for getting specific material result on a =\r\n*Regular basis*. but that is my personal opinion and it can differ with you=\r\nrs and i respect that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My message to Rajesh was on the same li=\r\nne. as i known him, i was little personal when i wrote.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; It is to be also noted that while this group is propogating Homam as Sa=\r\nadhana, it also respect other paths such as Japa, Kirtana, Self inquiry. Na=\r\nrasimha and others are open in that way. What i personally say is that do a=\r\nny saadhana you like but do it with regularity, seriously and dedicatedly. =\r\nLast thing i (or others on the list) will want is to be fanatic about one p=\r\narticular saint or path or God or book.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, i should also add he=\r\nre that after going through many books and many different forms of Saadhana=\r\ns, it is better to get the crux, select one Saadhana or Idea to experience =\r\nand stick to it. reading many books has a danger of creating fascination fo=\r\nr reading, generate confusions and stop one for engaging in to Saadhana.  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On some other discussions about Guru, I should put m=\r\ny personal experience again. I never hanker for Finding Guru. i never went =\r\nout for that. Niether in Astrology nor in Spirituality. As Ramakrsihna aptl=\r\ny used to say- &quot;Satchidananda is the real Guru&quot;. God is all knowing. i trus=\r\nt and relied upon. when my time was up, Guru in flash and blood came.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is my habit to describe personal experiences which may or may no=\r\nt be useful. As it is in fashion to say now a days - :Igonre me as a fool i=\r\nf it does not make any sense to you&quot; and also &quot;No Offence meant&quot; is also an=\r\nother popular statement. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; PS: Raju, there is no pint of thinking as to how Homam will change your =\r\ndestiny and such things.

There is nothing wrong in doing this, even =\r\nif sadhana done for materialistic benefits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today even tho=\r\nse who have renounced householder life have to pray god to fulfill some of =\r\ntheir material needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We live in very difficult and challa=\r\nnging times and it appears it is going to become more challenging.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some material gain can at times make a person better or more balan=\r\nced or be more prepared to do sadhana for spiritual benefits. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Even during an eclipse many people do mantras etc to solve problems or=\r\n improve material conditions, there is nothing wrong about it. I have read =\r\nmessages in the past on this group suggesting natives not to do it or it is=\r\n wrong. These type of messages are not correct, it only confuses people. Ti=\r\nme during the eclipse is very good for getting results for any sadhana done=\r\n during that time. it is equally good for material or spiritual type.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everyone has right to have a opinion and share their views but =\r\none needs to also understand the influence aspect of those views.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every Shotra or prayer or even Geeta or Ramayan, there are riders a=\r\nt the end for results like becoming wealthy, overcoming challenges, enemies=\r\n etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it were inappropriate the Seers from the past would not wr=\r\nite it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are they wrong in writing that?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They writ=\r\ne it to motivate people to read them as one reads more times there is a pos=\r\nsibility that may lead to change in the person&#39;s attitude.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Moving to original set of questions,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every one is born wi=\r\nth accumulated sanskars out of which as a native interacts with the world s=\r\nome of these accumulated or sanchit sanskars take the form of prarabdh sans=\r\nkara, these type of sanskars give pleasure, pain and challanges to the nati=\r\nve. Sanchit Sanskars are like seeds and Prarabdh sanskars are like a tree t=\r\nhat bears fruit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All human beings are also born with anoth=\r\ner quality and that is known as will power. They say will power can change =\r\ndestiny ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one does sadhana like say Homaam or Japam=\r\n. Many things happen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at many levels, at times there is improvement =\r\nin materialistic situation, problems get solved or if the problems remain t=\r\nhat state of sadhaka becomes such that he or she pays less attention to the=\r\n problem or attaches less importance to the problem. God or Guru or Shakti =\r\nshows the sadhaka a path to move forward. Sadhana does increase will power =\r\nand makes one more tolerant and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhana also help in eliminating t=\r\nhe sanchit sanskars, in fact one Saint use to say, do your sadhana and your=\r\n sanchit sanskars will get crushed such that they can never germinate or fr=\r\nuitify into prarabdh sanskars.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So yes doing sadhana can he=\r\nlp one overcome many things at different levels and help one move in the ri=\r\nght direction. At times one moves faster or very slowly. The important thin=\r\ng is moving and if one falls down, than one should immediately get up.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are many ways to improve and move faster towards spirtua=\r\nlity,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vimalanda is not just one saint, there are many who have reac=\r\nhed similar or higher or lower realizations adopting different methods and =\r\nhave written very good books too. Sprituality is much bigger, deeper and br=\r\noader than what Vimalanada has described in his books.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I f=\r\nind it little cultish to just refer him all the time in the group. Spiritua=\r\nity is atleast not a narrow cult.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that I have =\r\nnothing against Him, I respect him as I respect other saints from the botto=\r\nm of my heart. I did spent money to get his books and plan to read in near =\r\nfuture.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I urge all the readers of this group to read more =\r\nbooks from different sects, different saints and try to get appropriate inf=\r\nluence. Get broader and deeper views as that helps forming a good base for =\r\nspirituality. Spirtuality is about tolerance and remaining neutral in diffe=\r\nrent situations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Nath Sampradaya, Shiviates from Kashm=\r\nir, the lineage of Ramananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Datta Sampradaya, the sufis, even som=\r\ne christain saints (The book of Mirdad) and many more sects some of the Lha=\r\nmas of Buddhism had very deeper realizations and experiance. There are many=\r\n sects in south india too, kerala, tamil nadu, andhra pradhesh, maharastra,=\r\nrajasthan, gujarat and other states, all of them had great saints.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Generally these saints never bothered to write or explain or were =\r\nnot able to explain. But some did write and a lot of good work is out there=\r\n to explore along with doing sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We live in times whe=\r\nre there is very little guidance available on the path of spirituality. So =\r\nin these times we have to make up with reading good books written by saints=\r\n of yestaryers and surrender more to god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is scarcit=\r\ny of Sadgurus and good Sadhaks, we have many entry level and confused situa=\r\ntion :-) ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you look at sikhism, the last sadguru dev=\r\n from their sect made the book &quot;granth saheb&quot; as the guru instead of making=\r\n anyone else take his seat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Lahiri Mahashaya met a fa=\r\nmoius saint of kashi, he got lot of respect from him. Some of the famous sa=\r\nint&#39;s disciple were upset,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at that the saint reminds them that to r=\r\neach his own spiritual state he took 400 or so years but Lahiri Mahashaya d=\r\nid it in one birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His name slips my tongue, he was big and very s=\r\ntrong lived in water many hours at a time, his name starts with tri. They s=\r\nay that one is not able to stare at the eyes of the statue of the saint at =\r\nhis samadhi mandir.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One must always try to broaden ones pe=\r\nrspective, all of us have a long long way to go, even if some may feel that=\r\n oh I only have some more things left so I may be done in some years, even =\r\nthat is an interesting situation as there is always a chance of falling dow=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even for Saint Bharathari one of the nav naths, he was =\r\nso elevated but he also had some sanskars that forced him to take birth and=\r\n enjoy first and than suffer due to pingala. He was already realized before=\r\n his birth as the rajah.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did not intend to offend anyone=\r\n or thier veiws, If I inadvertantly did it I appologize in advance, Narashi=\r\nma has written very well many times and of late has written some good stuff=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mitesh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Raju,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems honest outburst.

It&#39;s like acting very smart with God. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha Insisted in his homam manual about the mental attitude. He =\r\nindicated that one is hoped to use these manuals for Spiritual purpose (pur=\r\nifying or getting control over internal nature) and to the benefit of the e=\r\nxternal nature (World at large) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not trying to be=\r\n rude or &#39;holier than thou&#39; but sincerely request you to change this mental=\r\n attitude. I, you and others must cultivate the idea of self surrender. Oh =\r\nMother! We are doing this homam and request you to take us from darkness to=\r\n Light, from lesser truth to higher truth, from poison (desires) to Nectar =\r\n(Devotion). Please make us so strong that we can accept, with mental equili=\r\nbrium, whatever you decide for us. Eradicate our ego and make us tools in y=\r\nour hands. Make us sit on your lap by purifying us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After some fe=\r\nw years struggle, i have understood that one must not confuse Spiritual rit=\r\nuals with Material benefits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Narayana said our mone=\r\ny, fame etc...are the result of Rnas/Karmas. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We must =\r\npray during homam for the continuation of daily Homam. Let Mother take care=\r\n of that in the same breath i would also say here that it is perfectly huma=\r\nn to ask for help if something in life is really going unbearable. If once =\r\nin a while, i ask Maha Ganapati to show me a way out from a troubled relati=\r\nonship or disastrous financial troubles. such prayer may naturally come if =\r\none is really going through deep trouble and that should be fine but we mus=\r\nt consciously avoid to pray for so called good things in life-Name, fame, m=\r\noney, career, Roti, Kapada, makan, dukan, biwi, bachha, motor gadi etc...:)=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regret if I was all &quot;Chhota mu badi baat&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajesh rajgor &lt;rajesh_rajg=\r\nor2003@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narsimhagaru, Utpal, Rajars=\r\nhi and others..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Last year, I was in trouble =\r\n( financial/social/physical) &=C2=A0I was fortunate to be advised by my fri=\r\nend utpal to start homam..
