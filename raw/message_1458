Reading Vishnu&#39;s 1000 \n&gt; na=\r\nmes can NEVER harm you. NEVER. It may increase good results or decrease \n&gt; =\r\nbad results, but never increase bad results.\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, the symptoms yo=\r\nu are describing sound a lot like some movement of \n&gt; praana (life force) i=\r\nn some of the upper chakras. This is not a bad thing at \n&gt; all. If some oth=\r\ner pieces of the puzzle fall in place, this can actually \n&gt; help your spiri=\r\ntual progress considerably.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of telling you to stop Vishnu saha=\r\nsranaam, I will suggest increasing \n&gt; the number of times you read it. If y=\r\nou spend an hour in the morning and an \n&gt; hour in the evening, it will be a=\r\nwesome.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, if it is possible, doing a homam every morning with V=\r\nishnu \n&gt; sahasranaam will accelerate the progress. I will have to soon put =\r\ntogether a \n&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Sho=\r\nrt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpan=\r\nas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http:=\r\n//groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http=\r\n://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.S=\r\nriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;harikishan1962&quot; &lt;hari=\r\nkishan1962@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thurs=\r\nday, March 05, 2009 11:52 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Is reading Vishnusha=\r\nharanamas Thries a day will \n&gt; Reduce our Past Life Karma?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaskara=\r\nm GuRU NARASIMHA GARU,\n&gt; &gt; I had a Health Problem which doctors do not iden=\r\ntify.
