September 12th being a Sunday, I did the =\r\nhomam again on Sunday (since I do homam every sunday anyway. That made it a=\r\n 41 day continuous Ganapathi homam at my place. I got all the Mantras and p=\r\nrocedures by heart and I do not need the manual anymore for this ritual. By=\r\n the way, I have a small question. Ganapathi Mula Mantram ends with Swaha. =\r\nSo, I have added another Swaha at the end of the recitation for the offerin=\r\ng of the mantram. [following your directions, I have ended the 108 times re=\r\npetitions of this with &quot;Vaushat&quot; instead of the second &quot;Swaha&quot; for the last=\r\n time]. Was I doing it right? In between I was reviewing your audio track a=\r\nnd I realized that you were reciting Swaha only once. Did I make a mistake?=\r\n \n\n\n"}}
