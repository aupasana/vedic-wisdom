My desire to praise the =\r\nDivine Mother in this way, keeps increasing everyday especially now that we=\r\n are coming close to the auspicious Navratri festival. I am plannig to star=\r\nt with the recitation first so that I am up to scratch when I start doing t=\r\nhe homam. (Learning to walk before learning to run) :)\n\nI don&#39;t know if you=\r\n had such dilemmas before you began doing Homams regularly. Please kindly s=\r\nhare how you have managed? My dilemmas are two-fold. Firstly, I encounter o=\r\nbjections from outside from fellow friends and family members who say that =\r\n&quot;the Chandi homam isn&#39;t part of the family tradition&quot; hence the family devt=\r\na won&#39;t be pleased or &quot;un-initiated people cannot perform such a high level=\r\n ritual&quot; or even &quot;un-married people cannot get married if they do this on a=\r\n regularly basis&quot;! However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and I=\r\n am prepared to disregard the superstitions.  \n\nWhat I find harder to disca=\r\nrd though, are personal objections that I create for myself..I call it the =\r\n&quot;I-am-not-worthy-enough&quot; syndrome. I am not confident of being able to stay=\r\n completely detached during the homam. I think what I am trying to say is t=\r\nhat I do not know to what extent my underlying motives can remain pure (uns=\r\nelfish) enough. At some point or another won&#39;t one end up automatically ask=\r\ning for one&#39;s personal gains? After all, isn&#39;t it human nature to confide e=\r\nverything/ask the Mother for everything..Maa mujhe new car chaahiye, please=\r\n give my kids good health/good grades etc? Will one incur the Brahma&#39;s curs=\r\ne for reciting the Paath with these motives in mind? In that case, is the B=\r\nrahmadi Sapa Vimochan mantra enough to &#39;white-wash&#39; one&#39;s selfish motives?\n=\r\n\nSecondly, I have to admit that after listening to some tales about regular=\r\n recitation of the Chandi Paath being associated with &#39;Kundalini jagran&#39;, I=\r\n am a bit worried. Can sadhana and &#39;kundalini jagran&#39; ever be mutually excl=\r\nusive? What if one wants to pray for the sake of praying only? Do they stil=\r\nl have to undergo chakra awakening etc? \n\nThank u.\nSomanathan\n\n\n\n"}}
