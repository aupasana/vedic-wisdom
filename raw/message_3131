He removes the pride of Gauri without even debating. Then again he cr=\r\nies like child and asks everybody as to what will happen to his twisted arm=\r\n. if he will be cured or not, then again he dances like a storm in the kirt=\r\nan at Balaram&#39;s house, Then he cries when he doesnot see Naren even for few=\r\n days, he simply walks out of his room when asked by Authority of Temple an=\r\nd comes back in the same manner without any noise when requested to come ba=\r\nck, Tears rolls from the eyes of He and Naren when later one is about to as=\r\nk the permission for sanyaas, to whom even prositiutes salutes and curse Ma=\r\ntur for planning to corrupt such a man, the man who explains deepest mystic=\r\n truths in such a simple manner (for e.g. Brahma and Shakti are not differe=\r\nnt. they are like Milk and its whiteness, like Fire and its burning power, =\r\nlike snake and its wringling motion), the man who looks with child&#39;s enthus=\r\niasm and wonder, the crowd, the carriages etc.. on the street of calcutta, =\r\nand again in the Samaadhi, frequently, unaware of the world and objectifica=\r\ntions...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Son of Kali, The man with uncountable moods and yet t=\r\nhe most simple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Kumbha Lagna with Sun, Moon and Mercury. All t=\r\nhe 3 most important Lagna coinciding in the Philosophical Kumbha and who ca=\r\nn be more focussed then such a person? and again complimented immensly with=\r\n exalted Mars and exalted Venus from both the sides. and Jupiter and Saturn=\r\n from the Trines.He is also the delight of Astrologers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warm Regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Naras=\r\nimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail!\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna is absolutely unique. Though many other masters cam=\r\ne to earth in the last few centuries, who perfected some types of spiritual=\r\n moods or the other, he is someone who perfected everything. He would chant=\r\n Hari&#39;s name, melt with emotion and go into bhaava samaadhi for hours toget=\r\nher. He would engage in 64 kriyas of tantra, without his mind being perturb=\r\ned by anything. He would be in samadhi where he is at the feet of god. He w=\r\nould be in samadhi where he is in oneness with god. He would be in nirvikal=\r\npa samadhi where there are no gods, no demons, no beings or objects, but ju=\r\nst Aatman or Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The same person who would behave like a=\r\n small child at times would also show unmatched wisdom all the time. He wou=\r\nld transform an illiterate servant boy (Latu) into a great spiritual master=\r\n (Swami Adbhutananda) who was established in Shiva-consciousness at all tim=\r\nes. He would transform an energetic, skeptical, irreverant, independent, ra=\r\ntional and highly intelligent young man with several biases (Naren) into a =\r\nvenerable and compassionate saint known as a great teacher around the world=\r\n (Swami Vivekananda).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He practiced karma yoga and his sishyas=\r\n and the mutt established by them engaged in so much social service across =\r\nIndia. He practiced jnaana yoga and his sishyas popularized Adwaita across =\r\nthe world. He even engaged in raja yoga and taught a select few like Viveka=\r\nnanda. He of course practiced bhakti yoga and melted in devotion when think=\r\ning of Kaali in the same way as he did when thought of Krishna. He even did=\r\n Christian and Islamic sadhanas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He not only experienced the =\r\nAbsolute himself, but was capable of making others experience. His mere tou=\r\nch took Vivekananda into samadhi in their second meeting. Vivekananda exper=\r\nienced other higher states later due to Ramakrishna&#39;s will (e.g. what happe=\r\nned for a few days after he mocked the Vedantic statement that all is god, =\r\nin front of Ramakrishna). Even his guru Totapuri who was an adept in Adwait=\r\na and experienced nirvikalpa samadhi several times was, for the first time =\r\nin his life, introduced to the power of the Mother by Ramakrishna. Totapuri=\r\n considered faith in saguna forms of god as childish and believed only in t=\r\nhe formless Brahman. But he left Dakshineshwar with a healthy respect for t=\r\nhe Saguna forms. He actually went inside the temple and prostrated before t=\r\nhe idol before he left Dakshineshwar! And, there is the kalpataru day, when=\r\n people started experiencing different levels of spiritual bliss just by to=\r\nuching him. Everyone who touched him that day went into a spiritual ecstasy=\r\n and stayed in it frozen right there in the garden. Some even went into dif=\r\nferent levels of samadhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this is how the Leela of an inca=\r\nrnation is, imagine how the leela of a poorna purusha like Lord Krishna mus=\r\nt have been!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally love analogies, allegories, metapho=\r\nrs and parables. Ramakrishna was an absolute master of those. He demystifie=\r\nd things and taught the highest Truths in simple terms so that everybody ca=\r\nn understand the essence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna is an absolutely unique=\r\n saint who showed that all paths lead to god, not by stating theory, but by=\r\n demonstrating it practically.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unlike saints like Buddha, Aad=\r\ni Shankara, Moses and Jesus, he is relatively recent and his life is well-d=\r\nocumented.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The field of dua=\r\nlity is like a dream. Being established in Brahman or Aatman is like the wa=\r\nkeful state. All the objects of dream disappear when one is awake. They are=\r\n unreal. However, they are quite real for one who is still in the dream! An=\r\nd, a roaring lion from a dream and a meowing cat from a dream are so differ=\r\nent in their nature, abilities and effect. Even though a jnaani may tell yo=\r\nu there is god (Brahman) in everything and all are equal, it is true only f=\r\nor one established in Brahman. If one is awake, a roaring lion from a dream=\r\n and a meowing cat from a dream are equal. But, to somebody still sleeping,=\r\n both are so different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though all beings are but god, differ=\r\nent beings play different roles in the field of Maayaa and there is a clear=\r\n hierarchy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality writing=\r\ns: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:=\r\n//vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; w=\r\nrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have not read the Kathamrita=\r\n - so I cannot comment on it really but I found Sri Ramakrishna Lilaprasang=\r\na by Swami Saradananda to be an excellent book, exhaustive and detailed in =\r\nthe analysis. Swami Saradananda takes so my pains to beautifully explain va=\r\nrious aspects of Ramakrishna&#39;s spiritual behaviour and general explanations=\r\n of spiritual things as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example it is from thi=\r\ns book that I first understood why an Avatar like Ramakrishna had to perfor=\r\nm such severe sadhana. Also thiis book gives a detailed recording of Ramakr=\r\nishna&#39;s Tantric sadhanas, how he completed all the 64 kriyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; There is one point I have observed with Ramakrishna&#39;s teachings.His ad=\r\nvises are often specific to the person he was advising. For someone he may =\r\nsay study the Adhyatma Ramayana, for another he advised never to touch the =\r\nAdhyatma Ramayana! Like a perfect teacher he advised the specific medicine =\r\nfor the specific problem in the path of spirituality that the specific pers=\r\non was facing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Second is his  fantastic razor sharp intel=\r\nlect. No one gives better examples to explain some aspect of spirituality t=\r\nhan Ramakrishna. Simple yet perfect. He uses the intellect to explain yet d=\r\noes not get caught up in the mazes of words. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Third and m=\r\nost important, the range of spiritual moods he expressed was staggering. Wi=\r\nth all due to respect to every great master who has walked on this planet, =\r\nI can&#39;t recall another name who has expressed/manifested such diverse spiri=\r\ntual moods. His spiritual journey is not like a bicycle race but rather a s=\r\neven course meal where he relishes every dish to the core.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Juding purely from an intellectual perspective, I believe there are some =\r\npossibility of corruption in the teachings of almost all masters starting f=\r\nrom Jesus to Buddha to Shanakara to Guru Nanak to Chaitanya to Vivekanada t=\r\no Aurobindo . Corruptions not in the teaching per se but corruption arising=\r\n out of misinterpretation of the words over time. One cannot really blame t=\r\nhem for this because it is almost impossible to forsee what turn of events =\r\nlead to what kind of mindsets which can make their statements/advises defuc=\r\nt or even dangerous over time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Jesus says I =\r\nam the path. Obviously Christians have mistook this to understand that Jesu=\r\ns is the only path. What he ment by I may not be Jesus the man, but Jesus t=\r\nhe idea - of purity and of love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddha gave a practical =\r\nadvise that Nirvana is sunya and practical spirituality is more important t=\r\nhan spiritual discussion. People mistook that to understand Budha was as at=\r\nheist.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shanakara, the great man that he was, would have d=\r\nied of a heart attack if he saw the flippant way in which we later day coll=\r\nege educated Indians use the phrases like Aham Brahmasmi and everything is =\r\nBrahman as if we are speaking about the latest movie in town.  Also I feel =\r\nhis misjudged certain paths like Tantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Guru Nanak in or=\r\nder to infuse more life into spirituality of Hindus as well as Muslims and =\r\nbring a comprise in the two ideas decried practises like idol worship and p=\r\nitri tarpan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chaitanya was the emotional pinnacle of spir=\r\nituality. He was capable. Others less capable misunderstood the path to fee=\r\nl that without shedding bucket full of tears you wont land at God&#39;s doorste=\r\nps. Emotions are good, but they can mislead too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekana=\r\nnda - absolute leader. Like all leaders, he does make some statements at ti=\r\nmes which are not well deliberated upon, which results in misinterpretation=\r\ns later on. Of course a leader cannot be expected to think for ten days bef=\r\nore speaking one  sentence. A leader has to be spontaneous, just like Vivek=\r\nanada, but the price of spontaneity is misrepresentation at a later date sp=\r\necially if you are fantastic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aurobindo, brilliant and ra=\r\nre analysis of spiritual steps/stages. One that I have never found in any o=\r\nther writing. However the problem is exactly the same. Often people wrongly=\r\n believe that only by reading and intellectually comprehending Aurobindo;s =\r\nwritings one can make spiritual progress. There is no substitute for raw ol=\r\nd fashioned sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note all these are great men =\r\nwere without question, spiritually much realized. I am merely doing an inte=\r\nllectual analysis from a historial perspective.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And then =\r\nRamakrishna, such a vast range of emotions and practices coupled with simpl=\r\ne and pointed examples and advises, it is hardly possible for him to get mi=\r\nsinterpreted. He uses Shanakra&#39;s phrase &quot;Brahma satya jagat mithya&quot; but he =\r\nalso teaches Totapuri why Mahamaya is so powerful. He seems like a perfect =\r\nassimilation of all ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just my two cents. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of conscio=\r\nusness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 20/11/09, ve=\r\ndic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedi=\r\nc_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Ramakrishna deals with a=\r\n debater.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Friday, 20=\r\n November, 2009, 9:17 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;That is the effect of Ramakrishna, who was born and brought up in a &gt;vil=\r\nlage in west bengal, who probably could not even sign his own &gt;name.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna, whom i lovingly address as &#39;Thakur&#39; is simply Rama =\r\nand Krishna and no less......\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And Kathamruta is THE book w=\r\nhich has given answers and confirmations to my queries and understandings w=\r\nhich haunted me from childhood.

The brahman=\r\ni - who was Thakur&#39;s guru - had called Gauri for a session of discussion on=\r\n the spiritual abilities etc of Thakur. Now Gauri was a very famous debater=\r\n and a sadhaka=C3=82 who never lost any debate. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plus Thakur used=\r\n to say that Gauri had remakrable siddhis. He used to perform a homa of Ma =\r\nKali by stretching out his left hand, piling wood on the bare=C3=82 arm, li=\r\nghting it and then using his right hand to pour ghee! And the homa would la=\r\nst for an hour or more and he would keep his left hand perfectly still all =\r\nthis while. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He had a certain siddhi in the use=\r\n of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtue of which one could never win in a debate=\r\n=C3=82 against him. Plus he had a deep, resounding voice which Ramakrishna =\r\ndescribed as the &quot;rumbling of clouds&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Gau=\r\nri entered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw the Kali temple, he st=\r\narted repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that time was coming out of =\r\nthe temple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna started saying that specif=\r\nic mantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that Gauri could hear. Gau=\r\nri, on being thus challanged=C3=82 started shouting the mantra even louded.=\r\n To this Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just given him a divine voice a=\r\nnd he too thundered back. Gauri was even more amazed. He roared again=C3=82=\r\n but Ramakrishna roared louder. Finally, suddenly Gauri realized he has los=\r\nt his voice. And his siddhi too! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At first he w=\r\nas furious with anger and ego but soon he became friends with Ramakrishna. =\r\nFinally he proclaimed that Ramakrishna was He by a fraction of whose power =\r\ndo Avatars come down on earth. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later one day G=\r\nauri came to Ramakrishna asking for his blessing to take sanyasa.
