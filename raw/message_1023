When I \nvisited the\n&gt; =\r\nHanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near \nChenna=\r\ni\n&gt; and asked the priest about a mantra, he advised me to chant the \nmantra=\r\n\n&gt; inscribed on the walls of the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya \nram| w=\r\nhich\n&gt; comes out to be a 7 word, 10 aksharas mantra.
