I also learnt adva=\r\nnce course as well as Padmasadhana (PS) from AOL in 2006. I also regularly =\r\nkept doing PS ALMOST everyday. For about 3 years, I used to do SK and PS re=\r\ngularly. \n\nNow I got started with Homa on daily basis since 2008 Sept and k=\r\neep doing it till date (with few breaks/irregularities at times) and since =\r\nthen I have stopped SK, however sometime do PS as i enjoy that systematic Y=\r\nogaasanas.\n\nJust gave above background which may help to assess.\n***\nSK and=\r\n PS helped me cure some physical chronic issues which troubled me since chi=\r\nldhood and were helpful to strengthen my will power. It generated an inner =\r\nattitude to sustain any problems or calamities life may throw by making my =\r\nmind generally calmer then it used to be. I am able to say that because I a=\r\nctually faced deep crises in 2006 July to sept and I was still more or less=\r\n unperturbed and could handle the situation. i increasingly become philosop=\r\nhical in my attitude.\n\nNow I started Chandi paath and Havan combination in =\r\n2008. if i now sit back and look at things then i can see some striking dif=\r\nferences. Havan and CP combination striked at my emotional aspect. In the p=\r\nast, i was hardly tested on Emotional/Relational issues in general with soc=\r\niety. i hardly faced any trouble in that area. However, when I started Hava=\r\nn and CP, it looks that it badly attacked this aspect of my being and I was=\r\n severely tested. in Short, My public relations which used to be always exc=\r\nellent (naturally) started falling apart. It shook me up very badly as it n=\r\never happened in the past and I did not have enough experience, knowledge t=\r\no handle such things. severe EQ testing then surfaced other weaknesses whic=\r\nh i felt that i never had :-). it amazed me at one side while at the same t=\r\nime It threw a formidable challenge to my so called **ballooned spiritual e=\r\ngo**. All these happening were more inside and much less tangible outside. =\r\nThere are crises i went through in my job which also tested me a lot. I los=\r\nt a good some of money in a cheating case within 6 months of starting Havan=\r\n. however, fortunately I intuitionally realised that Mother is removing bad=\r\n karmas using Pavaka and I steadfastly kept doing Havan in the midst of all=\r\n these emotional, financial, career, family troubles and now it seems as if=\r\n the dust have been settled more or less. quite peaceful with myself after =\r\nseeing Stars in the bright Sunny day ;-)\n\n***\nSo if now i compare it, the p=\r\neace of mind and will power given by SK and PS was a surface one. They neve=\r\nr created a situation where in i was ruthlessly tested on my weaknesses. So=\r\n i would say that they are spiritual practices which worked quite slowly an=\r\nd quite easily without disturbing me. While CP and Homam actually turned me=\r\n on my head. It started giving me a real kind of Detachment, wisdom. Few vi=\r\ntal things have become much clearer now.\n***\nPlease note that these are my =\r\npersonal experiences and others can have entirely different experiences. th=\r\nere are many variables in this. i just tried to state my own experiences fo=\r\nr whatever worth they may be. Please also note that Havan Sadhana does not =\r\nnecessarily throw throubles in life of people. It all depends upon Past Sam=\r\nskaars of individuals. we&#39;ll not know such things.\n***\nPlease forgive me to=\r\n almost always write personal things because I like to write the things whi=\r\nch i have gone through myself.\n\nJay Bhavaani!\n\nUtpal \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, vinayak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Gur=\r\nuji,\n&gt; I consider you as my Guru as you are the one of the 4\n&gt; prominent pe=\r\nople who have influenced & inspired me on spiritual path(whatever\n&gt; little =\r\nI do) & I find your explanations\n&gt; very very convincing.

How well one is enjoying food and digesting it is pri=\r\nmary.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, what sadhana one does, how many years one does =\r\nsadhana for and how many hours one spends in sadhana everyday is secondary =\r\n(though it matters too). How involved one is in and how much one is enjoyin=\r\ng sadhana is primary.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one finds a sadhana that one can enjoy =\r\nand engage in without forcing oneself mechanically and if one feels love an=\r\nd attachment to the tools, symbols\n&gt;  and steps involved in that sadhana, o=\r\nne is lucky. Otherwise, one may engage in a sadhana mechanically for a long=\r\n time without making much progress.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But, realize that one may ha=\r\nve to try many cuisines before finding what one really loves. Secondly, one=\r\n may dislike a cuisine at first and slowly get hooked. All these variables =\r\nare there. But, eventually, one needs to enjoy what one is eating, to diges=\r\nt well. Similarly, one needs to eventually start enjoying one&#39;s sadhana, to=\r\n progress spiritually.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Having said th=\r\nat, fire is something separate and special.

Similarly, no matter what kind of sadhana one does, doin=\r\ng some fire worship can\n&gt;  provoke one&#39;s internal fire and make one digest =\r\nbetter.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Also, just as a good nutritionist working with one can h=\r\nelp one in picking the right balance of foods, a good guru or mentor workin=\r\ng with one can help one in picking the right balance of sadhanas.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; So a good guru/mentor and company of fire are two things that put one in =\r\ngood stead, irrespective of what else one does.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; I do not like to comment on specific people or organizations.
