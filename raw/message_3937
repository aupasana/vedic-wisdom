I remember quite clearly in the starting of book3 aghora Vimalanand=\r\na says Karma is nothing but the sum total of Aashirwad and Abhishaap.\n\n1.Da=\r\nily many people curse us knowingly or Unknowingly...do all these curses aff=\r\nect us in a way even though we might not be knowingly causing any harm to t=\r\nhe other person. Is the curse still justified and is there a way this effec=\r\nt can be reduced. For example : An employee might have an very troublesome =\r\ncolleague who might be cursing him for no fault of his .\n\n2.Can pitri tarpa=\r\nna and homa be performed one after the another . Would I be causing an offe=\r\nnse to the deity invited into the fire by performing at the same place wher=\r\ne an pitri tarpana was performed.\n\n\n3.Also is it okay to peform Pitri tarpa=\r\nna in the night if time is not available in the mornings. Somehow I am very=\r\n comfortable with the idea of homa at night...but Pitri tarpana at night se=\r\nems to make me uncomfortable . \n\n4.Mango sticks seem to available in the lo=\r\ncal indian store in the place currenty am , Can these sticks be used for an=\r\n homa or is there any spiritual injunction against their use.\n\n\n5.Could you=\r\n please suggest a good book with both sanskrit and english transliteration =\r\nfor the Devi Mahatyam/Chandi path .\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n"}}
