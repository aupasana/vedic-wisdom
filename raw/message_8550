Not least because as a University student aged 23 I=\r\n spent 2-3 years in turmoil as I foolishly thought external Sanyas was the =\r\nonly way to Realisation. Swami Vivekananda&#39;s quotation &quot; The difference bet=\r\nween a Sanyasi and a householder is like that between Mount Meru and a must=\r\nard seed&quot; rang in my head for ages and destroyed my peace for a long time (=\r\nand destroyed a relationship too!). \n\nI was desperate not to be a lowly &#39;mu=\r\nstard seed&#39;. Anyway, I have grown up a little since, and realised it is the=\r\n mind not the clothes that need to be &#39;dyed ochre&#39; as it were. It is no eas=\r\ny task to immerse the mind in God as a &#39;householder&#39; (the path I have chose=\r\nn) but perhaps not that much easier sitting in an Ashram or distant cave ei=\r\nther. So might as well stay put in the world and be useful, and think of Go=\r\nd too. That&#39;s my path anyway for now. I&#39;m sure each one of us is where we n=\r\need to be at any point in time...be it &#39;householder&#39; or &#39;sanyasi&#39;. \n\nOm Nam=\r\no Narayanaya. \n\nAparna\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot;=\r\n &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Visitor: &quot;Honored sage, should we take the way=\r\n of monastic renunciation after our social and family responsibilities are =\r\ncompleted?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna: &quot;The path of monastic discipline is not neces=\r\nsary for everyone who longs to awaken. The passion for external renunciatio=\r\nn is like a bolt of lightning. It may strike at any time. It is not a reaso=\r\nned choice. But why not renounce all sense of limitation, even the limitati=\r\non of monastic forms? Why not enjoy all possible dimensions of human experi=\r\nence as already merged in God? Can one get completely inebriated on just a =\r\nfew pennies&#39; worth of wine? Fill up the whole pitcher!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This radical r=\r\nesponse surprises the questioner, who had already tacitly assumed a traditi=\r\nonal, pious answer. He gazed, speechless, at the laughing sage, and then as=\r\nks with astonishment: &quot;A spiritual practitioner should lead a worldly life?=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna: &quot;Why not? What is there to fear or avoid when Divine Re=\r\nality is know to be all-embracing=85 Relatively few persons have the destin=\r\ny to drop social and personal connections entirely in order to enter the ex=\r\nternal state of sannyasa - wandering aimlessly in the ecstasy of knowledge =\r\nand love, taking no direct responsibility for educating or serving society =\r\nin pragmatic ways.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Visitor: &quot;Master, what does it mean to say that a =\r\nperson has reached the end of worldly enjoyments?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna: &quot;=85To=\r\n come to the end of worldly enjoyments is to EXPERIENCE Divine Bliss flowin=\r\ng through EVERY ACTION, EVERY PERCEPTION.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Visitor: &quot;How can I get rid=\r\n of sexual passion?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna: &quot;Why get rid of it? Turn its powerfu=\r\nl energy in another direction. Lust is blind, but the Great Delight conferr=\r\ned by the Goddess is ever-pure and resplendent.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The new questioner is=\r\n also disconcerted by such a radical response delivered with such wonderful=\r\n laughter. This seeker has been conditioned by the teaching that cultivates=\r\n liberation by categorically rejecting what ever appears as ignorance, limi=\r\ntation, or bondage. Intrigued by the relaxed, all-embracing tantric attitud=\r\ne of the Goddess-worshiping sage, drawn deep into inquiry by this magnet of=\r\n Divine Mother&#39;s Knowledge and Love, this visible form of the dancing Kali-=\r\nthe seeker cries in consternation: &quot;Please, most revered Master, why would =\r\na benign Deity project the power of ignorance and limitation?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakri=\r\nshna melts into laughter, his eyes swimming in ecstasy, his body, like burn=\r\nished gold, glowing with heavenly light. This response emanates directly fr=\r\nom Mother Mahamaya, beyond reason, religion, philosophy. Now our Master is =\r\nweeping tears of pure love: &quot;It is ALL Her Play, Her delirious Play. OM KAL=\r\nI, OM KALI, OM KALI!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Visitor: &quot;Beloved Paramahamsa, who is really to =\r\nblame for sexual obsession and its bondage? Men or women?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna=\r\n: &quot;You are male, so I will speak to you about women. To women, I give the s=\r\name teachings about the spiritual danger and the spiritual potential of men=\r\n. A women who has awakened in her body and mind the energy of transcendent =\r\nwisdom, which is the brilliant healing and enlightening presence of the God=\r\ndess, can be a tremendous blessing for a male practitioner - as a tantric c=\r\nonsort, as consecrated wife, or simply as the inspiring friend of his soul.=\r\n But a woman who has developed exclusively her biological and social drives=\r\n is filled with a subtle energy that can be detrimental to the progress of =\r\na male aspirant. Eventually - without either person recognizing any danger-=\r\nshe can stifle his aspiration by drowning him in the forces of the limited =\r\nego world. Precisely the same facts must be explained to women concerning m=\r\nen...The brilliant feminine energy of wisdom, which incarnates through the =\r\nbodies and minds of both men and women, cultivates the refined taste for sw=\r\neet spiritual companionship, for knowledge of oneness, for tears of pure lo=\r\nve, for ecstatic union with various revealed forms of Divinity, and for ref=\r\nreshing renunciation of all deceptive, habitual expectations. By contrast, =\r\nthe energy of limitation consists of the random, compulsive play of the min=\r\nd and senses with their objects - an instinctual drive for experience that =\r\nlacks both subtlety and harmony and causes the heart to forget the delight =\r\nof Divine Reality, the communion that is natural to the human soul. But, bo=\r\nth currents - the energy of wisdom and the energy of limitation - are simpl=\r\ny Mother&#39;s Energy. When only God exists, who is there to praise and whom to=\r\n blame?&quot; (7)\n&gt; \n&gt; Copied from Lex Hixon&#39;s book, Great Swan: Meetings with R=\r\namakrishna.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
