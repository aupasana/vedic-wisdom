Nature has created a \n&gt; situation =\r\nwhere it can be paid back. In other words, Nature has placed that \n&gt; person=\r\n in a position to cheat or hurt you and tempted him to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) That=\r\n person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he has used the \n&gt; opportunit=\r\ny provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he engages in the \n&gt; actio=\r\nn while identifying with the action (&quot;I am doing it&quot;), he now gets a \n&gt; new=\r\n karma. He will be paid back later.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both are correct. From his perspec=\r\ntive, he is doing it with identification \n&gt; and he is incurring a new karma=\r\n. From your perspective, you are being paid \n&gt; back for what you did before=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In order to break out of this cycle, accept it when someb=\r\nody does something \n&gt; to you. Do not hate the person or pity yourself. Don&#39;=\r\nt think &quot;why does it \n&gt; have to happen to me&quot;. Think only about your curren=\r\nt action (&quot;what is the \n&gt; best thing for me to do NOW?&quot;) and do NOT think a=\r\nbout what happened, why it \n&gt; happened, who did it and how things happening=\r\n to you are unfair.\n&gt; \n&gt; The tricky thing is when Nature places you in a po=\r\nsition to pay back \n&gt; somebody else&#39;s bad karma and creates a strong tempta=\r\ntion for you to do so. \n&gt; You may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a ba=\r\nd thing to someone! But \n&gt; remember one thing. Any thought or action with a=\r\n sense of doership (&quot;I am \n&gt; doing&quot;) will create a new karma, even if the o=\r\nther person brought it on \n&gt; himself with a previous action.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you ca=\r\nn engage in an action without a sense of doership and surrendering \n&gt; the a=\r\nction to the Lord completely, you will not incur karma. But that is \n&gt; very=\r\n very difficult - almost impossible for most. Of course, you can also \n&gt; po=\r\nstpone the payback through the use of your *will power*, i.e. avoid the \n&gt; =\r\ntemptation and not do the bad thing to the other person. As long as we live=\r\n \n&gt; in a body, some karmas will need to be incurred. But good discretion, \n=\r\n&gt; self-control and strong will power will enable one to postpone the most \n=\r\n&gt; troublesome karmas to a later time.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the reactions to your previ=\r\nous karmas are paid back and through who is \n&gt; not in YOUR control. Nature =\r\nand the will power of others decide that. So you \n&gt; can do nothing except a=\r\nccept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to a large \n&gt; extent under your co=\r\nntrol. Use your will power to do the right things.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;=\r\n Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pit=\r\nri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituali=\r\nty: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows)=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: htt=\r\np://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kr=\r\nitels@grouply. com&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, =\r\nApril 26, 2009 2:19 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Sri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks you for the beautiful explanation.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not very clear on some of the points you have mentioned:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; is=\r\n it that everything that is happening to us in this life is all reaction \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to some of our past actions?it is difficult for me to understand this.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; To me, it can also be that someone is pushing this suffering onto us as =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; his action than a reaction of our old karmas.\n&gt; &gt; In any case, if we a=\r\nre getting cheated and we know it clearly why should \n&gt; &gt; we sit back and j=\r\nust let things happen against us, why should we not fight \n&gt; &gt; back?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; KK\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P=\r\n.V.R.

Before I answer it, I want to say that I am impressed \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with the de=\r\ncription of your friend. My pranaams to him. Does he live in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the grea=\r\nter Boston area too?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Karma and karmaphala (action=\r\n and reaction) are like pushing something and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; being pushing back as a=\r\n reaction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When you karmically push an object with some force and=\r\n that object pushes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you back karmically with the same force at a late=\r\nr point of time, it is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; not necessary that you resist it and apply som=\r\ne more force to push again. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; You pushed it earlier. That is action. Yo=\r\nu are being pushed now. That is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; reaction. How you take this push and =\r\nwhether you resist or not has \n&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing to do with the old action and r=\r\neaction balance. IF you resist and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; apply some force NOW, it becomes a=\r\n new action which will get its reaction \n&gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level of mental equanimity and stability does \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have an ego. Each living person has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; him to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks lik=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt;&gt; this, who knows so and so things, who does so and so things, who wa=\r\nnts so \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the fathe=\r\nr of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc =\r\netc). If \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the binding is completely removed and one becomes completely=\r\n unbound from \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain=\r\n in the body. So \n&gt; &gt;&gt; any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness).=\r\n As one dies and gets \n&gt; &gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off f=\r\nrom one body and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; environment and re-attached to another body and envi=\r\nronment. Nature \n&gt; &gt;&gt; tracks this change. Just as post office delivers all =\r\nmail addressed to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; your old apartment to your new apartment when you c=\r\nhange address, Nature \n&gt; &gt;&gt; delivers the reactions of all previous life act=\r\nions to the sense of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I-ness in this life.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As long as one is=\r\n embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will \n&gt; &gt;&gt; continue to deliver =\r\nthe reactions to various previous actions from that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; being. Death of w=\r\nife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an \n&gt; &gt;&gt; election, being=\r\n criticized by thousand people, being hit by wife, being \n&gt; &gt;&gt; abused by hu=\r\nsband, being killed by a brother, being cheated by a friend \n&gt; &gt;&gt; etc etc a=\r\nre examples of reactions to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sense =\r\nof I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver \n&gt; &gt;&gt; reactio=\r\nns to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pre=\r\nvious good karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or \n&gt; &gt;&gt; exc=\r\nited or elated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s good \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one sh=\r\nould \n&gt; &gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to o=\r\nne&#39;s bad \n&gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoints him. Y=\r\nou cheated \n&gt; &gt;&gt; someone. Nature will arrange such that that person cheats =\r\nyou now. How \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you feel about it now is not relevant as far as the old =\r\naction-reaction \n&gt; &gt;&gt; equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-=\r\nminded and calm does \n&gt; &gt;&gt; not stop Nature from doing its job.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In=\r\n fact, it is better that way. By not reacting to what is happening now, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; one is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction to your own action (but if he does =\r\nit \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with self-identification with the action, it becomes a new karma f=\r\nor that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; person. But, that is irrelevant to you). If you just face it =\r\ncalmly and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; without doing anything, you finish off your karmic debt. I=\r\nnstead, suppose \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you fight and try to stop the person from cheating yo=\r\nu. Then your current \n&gt; &gt;&gt; actions would become a NEW karma and you will ha=\r\nve to face its reaction \n&gt; &gt;&gt; later. If you want to pay off old debts witho=\r\nut incurring new ones, you \n&gt; &gt;&gt; have to behave like the person you describ=\r\ned below. Accept whatever comes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; your way with neither happiness nor s=\r\nadness, but with a calm and relaxed \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind. On top of it, keep doing wh=\r\nat seems like the right thing to do at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the moment, with as little sel=\r\nf-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; this&quot;) as possible. As you bec=\r\nome better at this, your instincts and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; judgment will guide you better=\r\n and show you the right action.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri=\r\n Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lesson=\r\ns (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) we=\r\nbsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Karma\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; De=\r\nar Narsimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they are abl=\r\ne to be in a neutral \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; frame\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected by wh=\r\nat is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours =\r\nlost his wife in a road accident a few \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; years\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ago.
