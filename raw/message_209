Some difference (pervasive \neffectiveness-may be my feelings I =\r\ndo not know) I found while counting \nthe mantra through Kar mala than the o=\r\nrdinary finger method that I \nfollow. At this juncture, I shall be much obl=\r\niged if it is possible \nfor you to permit us to know the subtle details lik=\r\ne why the finger \nshould not touch the finger lines and while counting eigh=\r\nt why we are \nomitting first and the last angusa and the specific method of=\r\n starting \nfrom Surya finger and why not including other angusa of the midd=\r\nle \nfinger?\nWith respects.\nYours Sincerely,\nS.Dheenadayalan\n\n\n\n"}}
