Just stick to the time basis=\r\n,pick any mantra and recite for  half-an hour or an hour or more than to it=\r\n as you wish.Forget about the counts like 28,1008 etc.\n\nYour can avail lamp=\r\ns in the market which will not blow off due to winds.If that is lingering y=\r\nour mind during homam- even you can leave it as is once you started Agnipra=\r\ntistapana.\n\nLearned members please correct me if i am wrong.Above ideas are=\r\n given just to get much focus on mantra or God instead hanging around at th=\r\ne stirring up thoughts\n\nThank you,\nSrini.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Ananda Kishora Dadi &lt;varaha_2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I had experinced the =\r\nsame problem when I do it terrace, homam fire gets blown \n&gt; away by gusty w=\r\ninds.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have started putting some chairs=C2=A0 in front of fire=C2=A0k=\r\nund in a row, to reduce \n&gt; the intensity of the wind and to minimize the fi=\r\nre blowing away...although not \n&gt; much success.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it going to reduce =\r\nthe homam benifit one would receive=C2=A0if one=C2=A0re-ignites the \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0fire several times?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thx,Ananda \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________=\r\n_______________________\n&gt; From: miveda91 &lt;miveda91@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sun, December 11, 2011 5:55:46 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Maha Ganapati Homam Questions\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Om Gane=\r\nshai Namah!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Since Navaratri, for last three months, I have been doing=\r\n Maha Ganapati Homam \n&gt; once a month.
