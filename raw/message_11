The \nimagery is very powerful.\n\n&quot;Om! Veri=\r\nly, the dawn is the head of the sacrificial horse; the sun, \nhis eye; the w=\r\nind his breath; universal fire, his open mouth. The year \nis the body; the =\r\nsky, his back; the atmosphere his belly; the earth, \nthe underpart of his b=\r\nelly; the quarters his flanks; the intermediate \nquarters, his ribs; the se=\r\nasons his limbs; the months and half months \nhis joints; the days and night=\r\n his fee; the stars his bones; the clouds \nhis flesh. Sand is the food inhi=\r\ns stomach; rivers are his entrails. His \nliver and lungs are the mountains;=\r\n plants and trees his hair. The \norient is his fore part; the occident his =\r\nhind part. When he yawns then \nit lightens. Whe he shakes himself it thunde=\r\nrs. When he urinates then \nit rains. Voice indeed is his voice&quot;\n\nIf one let=\r\ns the imagination go wild then the concept of birth (dawn) / \nrising ascend=\r\nant, (and therefore also death of the sacrificial horse?); \nthe atman; the =\r\nelements; the space; the time; the energies; the \nphysical; the five senses=\r\n; everything appears to be there. in the very \nfirst shloka.\n\nThe theme of =\r\nsacrifice / sacrificial oblations, etc. occur again and \nagian throughout t=\r\nhe text of this Upanishad.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nwhy, is it essential to use =\r\nimagination to understand what is written? \nDoes that mean that each person=\r\n has to experience the meaning on his or \nher own depending on his or her a=\r\nwareness? Then the question is how \nreal is imagination? Can we depend on i=\r\nt to understand things? \ncorrectly? The shlokas appear to be so  multi-laye=\r\nred /multi-\ndimensional that there is no &quot;logical&quot; way to understand them (=\r\nassuming \nof course, that imagination does not relate to logic)!\n\nBut most =\r\nimportant of all: WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF SACRIFICE IN \nEXISTENCE??? WHY =\r\nTHE SYMBOL OF ASHWA MEDHA?\n\nDoes it have something to do with movement from=\r\n gross to the subtle? \nSelf purification?\n\nWould love to hear the views of =\r\nothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
