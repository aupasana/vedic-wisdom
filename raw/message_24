Whenever a \nmantra \n&gt; is recited=\r\n it is accompanied by a particular chanda. But then we \n&gt; hear mantras bein=\r\ng recited in different ways by different people? \n&gt; MAybe two gurus will us=\r\ne two different chandas to recite the same \n&gt; mantra. Are they both &quot;correc=\r\nt&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am asking this because once somebody made a statement that in \nt=\r\nhe \n&gt; ultimate mantra is nothing but a chanda.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Vini=\r\nta\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
