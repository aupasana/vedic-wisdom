It becomes a play, =\r\na play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A l=\r\nittle point about love these days, One day a man who is in love with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthe sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n open field with no shade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrades and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; was sweating profusely as expected. He was getting irritated with the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you wa=\r\nnt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked dow=\r\nn in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in =\r\nsummers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my bod=\r\ny is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for hi=\r\nm in the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summ=\r\ners we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his=\r\n face, is this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, h=\r\ne wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbl=\r\ned, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, =\r\nyou know, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I lov=\r\ne &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (That last l=\r\nine was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the su=\r\nn, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and =\r\nsince that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, afte=\r\nr all because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen w=\r\nhich leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Withou=\r\nt him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s=\r\n , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, =\r\ntrue love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t giv=\r\ne one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking ab=\r\nout people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite =\r\na few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respo=\r\nnd favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because=\r\n she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Del=\r\nhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with=\r\n him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is=\r\n lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these char=\r\nacters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen=\r\n form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask=\r\n of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhna=\r\nth&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya=\r\n aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiy=\r\ne, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is=\r\n far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThen he went on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right=\r\n, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sak=\r\ne. All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but da=\r\nre I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it w=\r\nill be delivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i bec=\r\nome big enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam=\r\n hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herse=\r\nlf should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rathe=\r\nr prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, b=\r\necause if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can =\r\nthen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. I=\r\nf you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial.

His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is h=\r\nappy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is h=\r\nappy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Equ=\r\nate doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We ar=\r\ne never happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expecting =\r\nbutter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waa=\r\nle hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bo=\r\nlo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subcons=\r\nciously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I neve=\r\nr want food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want hi=\r\nm, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish do=\r\ngs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji =\r\nbrings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that m=\r\nilk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his th=\r\nought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the g=\r\nreat dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nope.

He was getting irritated with the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you =\r\nwant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked d=\r\nown in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him i=\r\nn summers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my b=\r\nody is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for =\r\nhim in the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in su=\r\nmmers we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see h=\r\nis face, is this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love,=\r\n he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The man was hum=\r\nbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because after all=\r\n, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I l=\r\nove &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (That last=\r\n line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the =\r\nsun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, an=\r\nd since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, af=\r\nter all because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen=\r\n which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. With=\r\nout him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba=\r\n&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us=\r\n, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t g=\r\nive one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking =\r\nabout people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there are quit=\r\ne a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t res=\r\npond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man.

What lo=\r\nve.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in D=\r\nelhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken wi=\r\nth him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he =\r\nis lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these ch=\r\naracters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chos=\r\nen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you a=\r\nsk of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me.

Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god her=\r\nself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rat=\r\nher prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;,=\r\n because if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually h=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how ca=\r\nn then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge.=\r\n If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That =\r\ndoesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I n=\r\need to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki =\r\nnaukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, eve=\r\nn if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, t=\r\nhey are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surr=\r\nender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. =\r\nIts a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in=\r\n 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the great=\r\nest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always maintain=\r\ned be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when he see=\r\ns his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; master , =\r\nto bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is=\r\n happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is=\r\n happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; E=\r\nquate doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We =\r\nare never happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expectin=\r\ng butter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame w=\r\naale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari =\r\nbolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subco=\r\nnsciously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I ne=\r\nver want food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want =\r\nhim, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish =\r\ndogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that masterj=\r\ni brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that=\r\n milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his =\r\nthought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the=\r\n great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nope. T=\r\nhat is mental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Si=\r\nr, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.
