Vasishtha&#39;s teachings to Rama were later re=\r\npeated by Maharshi Valmiki to Maharshi Bharadwaja. They are captured in a c=\r\nlassic called &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;. For any sincere seeker of the Highest Tru=\r\nth who is attracted to Adwaita, &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is a must-read book.\n \n&gt;=\r\n Something can be spiritual and still have form. But spiritual form is \n&gt; n=\r\not perceivable to our material eyes.\n&gt; I wonder what you think of this.\n \nW=\r\nhether you are talking about a form made of gross matter (e.g. a human bein=\r\ng) or a form made only of subtle ethereal matter (e.g. a god), it has some =\r\n&quot;attributes&quot; (gunas). Attributes are attributes, whether gross or subtle. T=\r\nhey are limiting.\n \nA form with attributes can be perceived by the mind (th=\r\nrough the senses of the gross body in the former case and through the subtl=\r\ne perception in the latter) while mind is still mind. It is only the formle=\r\nss reality that cannot be perceived by the mind while it is a mind. Only wh=\r\nen mind ceases does the duality of the world cease and the reality that is =\r\nnot limited by any attributes is revealed.\n \nSo, my definition of a form is=\r\n not what is &quot;perceivable to our material eyes&quot;. It is what can be perceive=\r\nd by the mind through senses or subtle perception, in its various levels of=\r\n existence. My definition of formless reality is that which is revealed whe=\r\nn mind ceases to exist.\n \n&gt; It may be useful for you to read more deeply in=\r\nto the ISKCON \n&gt; philosphy. I can provide links to the Caitanya Caritamrta,=\r\n Srimad \n&gt; Bhagvatam, Bhagvad Gita if you are interested.\n \nHindu philosoph=\r\ny as outlined by Upanishads is a very vast and complex one. When Kali Yuga =\r\nstarted, it seems to me like some great souls were born on this earth to si=\r\nmplify and slightly re-adjust the teachings of Upanishads to make them more=\r\n palatable and understandable to the masses. A simplified and systematic re=\r\nligion that people can appreciate is perhaps better in Kali Yuga than a com=\r\nplicated philosophy that seems self-contradictory and alienates people.\n \nT=\r\nhus, I respect the works of several great souls and consider each work to b=\r\ne an important one, but I am clear about my own path.\n \nAs far as Bhagavad =\r\nGita is concerned, it is the highest teaching of the Absolute Reality. The =\r\ncommentary on Bhagavad Gita by Jnaneshwar (a great saint from Maharashtra) =\r\nis the one that I like the most. It is unabashedly Adwaitic (non-dualistic)=\r\n. I cannot reconcile most other commentaries with the teachings of Upanisha=\r\nds and the teachings of Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama. However, Jnaneshwa=\r\nr&#39;s interpretation fits perfectly with the rest.\n \nA literal English transl=\r\nation of the Marathi commentary (containing the original Sanskrit verses al=\r\nso) is available at\n \nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Sw=\r\nami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648/sr=3D8-1/qid=3D1171905959/ref=3Dsr_1_1/105-846=\r\n6969-7236409?ie=3DUTF8&s=3Dbooks\n \n*        *        *\n \nI humbly suggest t=\r\nhat you should follow the path that you feel comfortable with.

As we can perceive &lt;BR&gt;things that originate from the origin as having=\r\n \n  form. Therefore the &lt;BR&gt;origin cannot be any less than what originates =\r\nfrom \n  it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Something can be spiritual and still have form. But spi=\r\nritual form \n  is &lt;BR&gt;not perceivable to our material eyes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I wonder=\r\n what you think of \n  this.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It may be useful for you to read more de=\r\neply into the ISKCON \n  &lt;BR&gt;philosphy. I can provide links to the Caitanya =\r\nCaritamrta, Srimad \n  &lt;BR&gt;Bhagvatam, Bhagvad Gita if you are interested.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yours \n  benevolently&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kasim&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group emai=\r\nl --&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_046C_01C75421.F04D4C00--\r\n\n"}}
