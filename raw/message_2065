He did not=\r\n know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and=\r\n I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he saw wa=\r\ns a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I =\r\ntold him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This =\r\nboy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him on=\r\ne morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week aft=\r\ner the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I asked what he was th=\r\ninking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come has not already=\r\n happened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen later whe=\r\nn the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, =\r\nbut pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He said=\r\n, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be=\r\n overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is us=\r\nually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he wa=\r\ns onto something today. But he could not express himself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I helped=\r\n him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happened at some level, b=\r\nut will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may ha=\r\nve been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have already see=\r\nn it. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it is happening i=\r\nn front of them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He exclaimed=\r\n, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to happen in fu=\r\nture, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be able to see it =\r\nbefore future comes, because it has already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though he d=\r\nid not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along these lines. When I tol=\r\nd him the man riding the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he=\r\n was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given his age and ability to th=\r\nink and understand things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that =\r\nhe should see somebody who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how =\r\nit was possible and came to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his =\r\nown way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. =\r\nHowever, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes chan=\r\nged. It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman o=\r\nr Brahman or Self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a ve=\r\nry short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beeja=\r\nakshara added before name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I fel=\r\nt a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energ=\r\ny I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blis=\r\nsful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done her=\r\ne. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciou=\r\nsnss.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice befo=\r\nre that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting n=\r\next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time wa=\r\ns when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya o=\r\nf a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, w=\r\nhich was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy=\r\n I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I fee=\r\nl that intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation=\r\n and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did =\r\nso far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know=\r\n how to say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than =\r\nwhat I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a po=\r\nwerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is the=\r\n most important thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps on=\r\ne do a ritual better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken probl=\r\nem and one has to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Keep per=\r\nforming your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal p=\r\nurity as you engage in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of s=\r\npiritual progress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego become=\r\ns smaller, you can resist attraction to external things better and you can =\r\nresist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do yo=\r\nur dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is t=\r\nhe root cause of all problems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using=\r\n jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think th=\r\nat all that is around you - including your house, money, cars, spouse, chil=\r\ndren and your own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary car=\r\netaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but with=\r\nout entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very g=\r\nood care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those thin=\r\ngs as his or her belongings.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;m=\r\nine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves one=\r\n&#39;s master takes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is t=\r\naken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant wil=\r\nl accept that is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enab=\r\nles one to do the best job with what one possesses and not worry about what=\r\n one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Developing =\r\nthe attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help o=\r\nne wade the ocean of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/v=\r\nedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcas=\r\nt. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; -=\r\n----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nCC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!

But, does he already know =\r\nhow I will excersize it)?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vijay&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; --- In &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, however, I could no=\r\nt help it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind. One of the oft =\r\ndiscussed and eternal questions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If events=\r\n have already been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they =\r\nhappen in our plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug?=\r\n Like a placebo that makes us &quot;happy&quot; but in reality does not exist!&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am not questioning that wh=\r\nat you wrote in the mail about events having already happened, because same=\r\n has been said by other great spiritual people in the world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; But my question is because I cannot reconcile this wit=\r\nh a freewill. Both cannot be correct. It is either this or that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Theoritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majori=\r\nty of the world reforms itself, does a self correction exercise and brings =\r\nin peace, harmony etc etc, then why should the Kalki Avatar still incarnate=\r\n? But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then s=\r\nuch a self correcting option is already negated out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any ch=\r\noice in the sense that finally everyone will end up merging with the divine=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So I guess freewill is not really as fre=\r\ne as we love to think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness)=\r\n is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09,\n=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Miscellany: Future, bestest homam, purity and overcoming ego&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow tar=\r\nget=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very short Chandi=\r\n homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in the following ma=\r\nil:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; rel=3Dnofollow t=\r\narget=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 7=\r\n61&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This boy was born and brought up in US and is=\r\n not\n proficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about s=\r\nome of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who wa=\r\ns who and a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man wi=\r\nth white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was Ka=\r\nlki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when=\r\n I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This w=\r\nas abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the fu=\r\nture that is to come has not already happened. It has already happened in r=\r\neality, but it will happen later when the time comes. You know what I mean?=\r\n&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no.=\r\n What do you mean?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how\n =\r\nto say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly intelligent =\r\nor articulate. His main characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, play=\r\nful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something tod=\r\nay. But he could not express himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I helped h=\r\nim, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happened at some level, but=\r\n will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have=\r\n been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have already seen =\r\nit. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it is happening in =\r\nfront of them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going=\r\n to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be=\r\n able to see it before future comes, because it has already happened.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why he\n was thi=\r\nnking along these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vi=\r\nsion over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confus=\r\ned. Given his age and ability to think and understand things, this probably=\r\n seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet c=\r\nome. So he was trying to think how it was possible and came to some importa=\r\nnt conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Time=\r\n seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in many plane=\r\ns of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses its=\r\n meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The same boy once =\r\nperformed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Ka=\r\nali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were meditating after poor=\r\nnaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was\n quite different=\r\n from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel sat=\r\nisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as=\r\n &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my =\r\nentire consciousnss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I had experienced the same =\r\nkind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energ=\r\ny when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chan=\r\ndi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to =\r\nmeditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet =\r\nfrom the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a gr=\r\neat saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occa=\r\nsions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that b=\r\noy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did\n so far, this is the bes=\r\ntest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it =\r\njust felt awesome and different.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, =\r\nshorter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful i=\r\nn making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal =\r\npurity is the most important thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rituals help=\r\n purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more out of it.=\r\n It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it until one br=\r\neaks through.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Keep performing your chosen spirit=\r\nual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you engage in ext=\r\nernal practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and puri=\r\nty is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist =\r\nattraction to external things better and you\n can resist internal enemies l=\r\nike lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - t=\r\nhinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all prob=\r\nlems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Overcomin=\r\ng ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easie=\r\nr. Think that all that is around you - including your house, money, cars, s=\r\npouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a te=\r\nmporary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you ca=\r\nn, but without entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant t=\r\nakes very good care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all=\r\n those things as his or her belongings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Realize =\r\nthat thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of =\r\nthem. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best care of things entrus=\r\nted to one. When a thing is taken\n away, a servant does not waste time worr=\r\nying and crying. A servant will accept that is master&#39;s property and can be=\r\n taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best job with what one poss=\r\nesses and not worry about what one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s=\r\n control.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Developing the attitude of a servant w=\r\nho takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the ocean of worldl=\r\ny life without getting caught and overcome ego.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yoursel=\r\nf: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://groups./&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.c=\r\nom/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/=\r\nA&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.srijagan/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A=\r\n&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ICC World Twenty20 England &amp;#=\r\n39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!
