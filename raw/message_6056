Please spare some t=\r\nime to answer. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Can we give aahutis to Maharishi Parashara while do=\r\ning homam for Shri Krishna? If yes, please give mantra to be used and how a=\r\nnd when during homam we can do this\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Recently it dawned to me that w=\r\ne should thank to navagraha deities for all the work they have been doing f=\r\nor us and we should thank them for showing all us the path in their own way=\r\n. Can we do this through homam? If yes please give a manual for Navagraha h=\r\nomam. Or better if we can use Kuja/shani homam as a basic and make some cha=\r\nnges in them. In this case, please tell the changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or can we give ah=\r\nutis to Navagraha while doing Krishna homam? if yes please give mantras to =\r\nbe used and how and when we can do this\n&gt; \n&gt; I shall be thankful to you\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Regards\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
