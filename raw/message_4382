Can someone please answer the following: -\n\n- I consid=\r\ner &quot;Vratam&quot; as &quot;Sankalpam&quot; (Means a Vow) and not mainly &quot;Upwaas&quot; (Which mea=\r\nns bowls empty). And I observe Ekadashi Vratam as Falaahar Vratam i.e. Vow =\r\nto sustain myself on Fruits mainly. At the same time, I observe it as a Upw=\r\naas in the sense that I eat only two times a day, thereby, keeping my bowls=\r\n empty for most of the time. Is this the right way of doing Ekadashi Vratam=\r\n?\n\n- Also, there is an ambiguity about Udaya Tithi. For Example, Ekadashi i=\r\nn India starts this noon and remains till tomorrow noon or so. But, since E=\r\nkadashi will be the Tithi per tomorrow&#39;s sunrise, Tomorrow is recommended f=\r\nor Vratam by Panchangas. I am not sure if this sampling (or synchronisation=\r\n) by sunrise (clock) of the tithi (data) comes from ancient texts or some r=\r\necent modifications have brought this concept. This becomes specifically am=\r\nbiguous when Ekadashi happens to begin just after one sunrise (hold violati=\r\non) and ends few minutes after the next sunrise. Per Udaya Tithi, Ekadashi =\r\nwill be the next day, although all the conjuct (in degrees from 120 or 240 =\r\nto 132 or 252 so) has lost its impact by that time.\nCan someone please clar=\r\nify?\n\n- For me, Ekadashi is the day when Sun and Moon are in trines i.e. Ou=\r\nr mind has close trinal conjunct with our soul. That is how this is an ausp=\r\nicious day. Now, based on Udaya tithi, Ekadashi is celebrated on the day wh=\r\nen at sunrise, Sun is in Lagna and Moon is in any of the trines. Thus, on t=\r\nhe sunrise, it is auspicious with Sun, Moon and Lagna all being in auspicio=\r\nus positions. But, does that make that whole day auspicious enough for Vrat=\r\nam?\n\n-  Any specific Homams that can be done on Ekadashi to boost your spir=\r\nitual progress?\n\n- Any specific Mantras?\n\nI have more questions which I wil=\r\nl try ask as and when my understanding of these things get better.\n\nBest Re=\r\ngards,\nSriram \n\n\r\n--0-2086365506-1274595273=:70477\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, se=\r\nrif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hi All,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have been obser=\r\nving a fast on Ekadashi for quite some time now.
