Also related to t=\r\nhis is the question of how do planets really affect us , Vimalananda in the=\r\n aghora books says it is through the rasa or food that is ingested by us. \n=\r\n\nI know science does not yet possess the right tools to measure this phenom=\r\nena and einstein&#39;s grand search for a unified filed theory and the universa=\r\nl particle is still ongoing and might take ages for modern science to under=\r\nstand the workings of even a commonplace phenomena like gravitation.\n\nHowev=\r\ner a simple test like admission rates in a mental aslyum should hold up to =\r\nproof if the moon is truly having a effect on humans.\n\nhttp://www.scientifi=\r\ncamerican.com/article.cfm?id=3Dlunacy-and-the-full-moon\n\nThis article in th=\r\ne scientific american finds no such correlation...also there have been many=\r\n studies in the past some for and some against this correlation effect but =\r\nnone of them found a strong evidence....And always there is the risk of mis=\r\ntaking correlation as causation in any experiment.\n\n\nIt is just out of curi=\r\nosity that am asking this question...Does astrology matter at all for a ser=\r\nious sadhaka. Can not any day /time or hour be picked for worship. If the r=\r\nelationship with the deity is truly personal why should one even consider t=\r\nhe nava grahas in the ritual worship. I increasingly find that astrology is=\r\n only serving to discourage the masses rather than pointing them in the dir=\r\nection of worship of divinity. \n\n\nHope you could throw some light on this.\n=\r\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n"}}
