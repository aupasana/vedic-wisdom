As I have not been \ninitiated into the pooja vidhanam and=\r\n only had the fortune of \nwitnessing the ritualistic pooja done by my mothe=\r\nr-in-law according \nto Sri sooktam. Unfortunately I was not a great fan of =\r\nrituals then. \nI live abroad and downloaded the pooja vidhanam according to=\r\n sri \nsooktam and started my pooja. I found that it was pertaining to \nDurg=\r\na and the shodasopachara pooja and the pranapratishta. The Devi \nKavacham a=\r\nnd the Sapta sloki are also included. When I started the \npooja I wondered =\r\nif I could chant and perform the pooja as it was a \npart of Saptashati. My =\r\nfather-in-law advised me not to do it as I \nwas not initiated.

Not doing a \nmantra be=\r\ncause of no initiation is basically like that.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Getting ini=\r\ntiation is good, especially if the one initiating has \nsome level of sadhan=\r\na in that mantra. But it is neither necessary \nnor sufficient for making pr=\r\nogress in your own sadhana.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; If you see my homam document, =\r\nI gave an analogy for this. A \nmillionaire may open a bank account in his s=\r\non&#39;s name with a \nstarting balance of a million dollars. This is akin to a =\r\ngood guru \ninitiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishya starts off by getting so=\r\nme \nof guru&#39;s attainment. But the son may waste those million dollars \nand =\r\nend up with nothing. Similarly the sishya may fall and not \nachieve anythin=\r\ng. Another person may not have anyone to give money \nand may start off with=\r\n a zero bank balance but accumulate millions \nof dollars with own effort. T=\r\nhis is akin to=C3=82=C2=A0a person doing sadhana \nwith a mantra without gur=\r\nu and attaining some level in the mantra.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Some people hold=\r\n the view that mantras cannot be chanted without a \nproper &quot;initiation&quot; . T=\r\nhis view is especially prevalent in some \nsections of society w.r.t. navarn=\r\na mantra. However, I disagree with \nthat view.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; If you know=\r\n the mantra (!), just chant it. What would an \ninitiating guru have done fo=\r\nr you? Perhaps he would&#39;ve given some of \nhis attainment in the mantra to y=\r\nou. Well, you can do it yourself if \nyou work hard. Or a guru would&#39;ve taug=\r\nht you the right nyasas to be \ndone before the mantra. Well, you can get th=\r\ne nyasas from books too. \nMoreover, what most people do today for nyasas is=\r\n anyway just a \nritual with no meaning. Nyasa literally means placement. Yo=\r\nu place \nvarious sounds in various body parts (like the tips of various \nfi=\r\nngers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some \nsignals w=\r\nhile saying the sounds. This &quot;placement&quot; is actually \nsupposed to be an int=\r\nernal act and it creates an ideal environment \nfor the repetition of mantra=\r\n. Due to the external actions, what is \nsupposed to occur internally does n=\r\not occur in most. So the sounds \nend up not getting properly placed in the =\r\nbody. In other words, what \nI am trying to say is that most people do\n&gt; not=\r\n know how to &quot;place&quot; various &quot;sounds&quot; in various body parts. \nThey merely p=\r\nerform meaningless ritualistic actions. So, if you do \nnot know nyasas, you=\r\n are not really missing much compared to others \nwho were initiated.\n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; In my humble opinion, the most important qualification is to ha=\r\nve \ndevotion and sense of surrender to Her.

This happens &lt;BR&gt;sometimes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you live on US east coast, then Chaturthi comes twices on &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Thursday and Friday (Oct 2 &amp; 3). It lasted the entire Thursday and &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;extended into Friday. Panchami was on Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;on Sunday (Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday (Oct 8). Navami is on &lt;BR&gt;Wednesd=\r\nay (Oct 9). Dasami is on Thursday (Oct\n 10).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I=\r\nf one&#39;s parents did not do a proper &quot;anna praasana&quot; ritual (the &lt;BR&gt;ritual =\r\nof first feeding of solid food to a baby) to one, should one &lt;BR&gt;consider o=\r\nneself not entitled to eat any solid food? Not doing a &lt;BR&gt;mantra because o=\r\nf no initiation is basically like that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Gettin=\r\ng initiation is good, especially if the one initiating has &lt;BR&gt;some level o=\r\nf sadhana in that mantra. But it is neither necessary &lt;BR&gt;nor sufficient fo=\r\nr making progress in your own sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you =\r\nsee my homam document, I gave an analogy for this. A &lt;BR&gt;millionaire may op=\r\nen a bank account in his son&#39;s name with a &lt;BR&gt;starting balance of a millio=\r\nn dollars. This is akin to a good guru &lt;BR&gt;initiating a sishya in a mantra.=\r\n Sishya starts off by getting some &lt;BR&gt;of guru&#39;s attainment. But the son ma=\r\ny waste those million dollars &lt;BR&gt;and end up with nothing. Similarly the si=\r\nshya may fall and not &lt;BR&gt;achieve anything.\n Another person may not have an=\r\nyone to give money &lt;BR&gt;and may start off with a zero bank balance but accum=\r\nulate millions &lt;BR&gt;of dollars with own effort. This is akin to=C3=82&nbsp;a=\r\n person doing sadhana &lt;BR&gt;with a mantra without guru and attaining some lev=\r\nel in the mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some people hold the view th=\r\nat mantras cannot be chanted without a &lt;BR&gt;proper &quot;initiation&quot; . This view =\r\nis especially prevalent in some &lt;BR&gt;sections of society w.r.t. navarna mant=\r\nra. However, I disagree with &lt;BR&gt;that view.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If=\r\n you know the mantra (!), just chant it. What would an &lt;BR&gt;initiating guru =\r\nhave done for you? Perhaps he would&#39;ve given some of &lt;BR&gt;his attainment in =\r\nthe mantra to you. Well, you can do it yourself if &lt;BR&gt;you work hard. Or a =\r\nguru would&#39;ve taught you the right nyasas to be &lt;BR&gt;done before the mantra.=\r\n Well, you can get the nyasas from books too. &lt;BR&gt;Moreover, what most peopl=\r\ne do today for nyasas is anyway just a &lt;BR&gt;ritual\n with no meaning. Nyasa l=\r\niterally means placement. You place &lt;BR&gt;various sounds in various body part=\r\ns (like the tips of various &lt;BR&gt;fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). Peo=\r\nple merely act out some &lt;BR&gt;signals while saying the sounds. This &quot;placemen=\r\nt&quot; is actually &lt;BR&gt;supposed to be an internal act and it creates an ideal e=\r\nnvironment &lt;BR&gt;for the repetition of mantra. Due to the external actions, w=\r\nhat is &lt;BR&gt;supposed to occur internally does not occur in most. So the soun=\r\nds &lt;BR&gt;end up not getting properly placed in the body. In other words, what=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;I am trying to say is that most people do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not know how to &quot;pla=\r\nce&quot; various &quot;sounds&quot; in various body parts. &lt;BR&gt;They merely perform meaning=\r\nless ritualistic actions. So, if you do &lt;BR&gt;not know nyasas, you are not re=\r\nally missing much compared to others &lt;BR&gt;who were initiated.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In my humble opinion, the most important qualification is to=\r\n have &lt;BR&gt;devotion and sense of surrender to\n Her. If you have them, you ca=\r\nn &lt;BR&gt;consider yourself &quot;highly initiated&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- ----&lt;BR&gt;-----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.=\r\nVedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ &lt;BR&gt;tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://grou=\r\nps./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastr=\r\no./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. ne=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot;=\r\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot;\n targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -------=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----&lt;BR&gt;----- &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Chandra Prakash &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, October 05=\r\n, 2008 11:16 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Navaratri...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When does Navratri end?
