One who does a Chandipath thrice a day for a few years at l=\r\neasts,=C2=A0 ends up transforming himself completely from being an ordinary=\r\n, average, limited, frail human being to a &#39;god&#39; of sorts. Our religion tea=\r\nches the transformation of how a man becomes a god. Not G-d but god.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\ntrength, courage, confidence, devotion, knowledge, application of special k=\r\nnowledge, authority (if one so desires it), power, wisdom, spiritual experi=\r\nences, liberation, enlightenment etc - everything comes from this one text.=\r\n It is a whole package.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Eventually you get what you crave for de=\r\nep down. It is not too difficult to master the text. Some effort, some pati=\r\nence and it can be done.

Maybe not relevant right now, but if=\r\n ever by Her will you become an accomplished Chandi sadhaka in future then =\r\nthis will be of help. Don&#39;t ask for anything when doing Her worship is an i=\r\ndeal situation. If you pray simply as you pray in any temple, then too ther=\r\ne is not a problem. Praying with humility is never a problem. BUT if ever y=\r\nou try out kriyas with Chandi or do the Chandipath to get xyz results in ab=\r\nc timeframe, (specially during complex forms of worship of Chandi like thos=\r\ne involving charnel grounds), then be sure that you know the precise and ex=\r\nact procedures. There are no half measures in those. Nishkama worship in co=\r\nmplex methods is fine, but desire for material results without the knowledg=\r\ne of the procedures during complex rituals in begging for trouble, whoever =\r\nyou might be. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ami Jantra Tumi Jantri\n&gt; Ami Ghar Tumi Gharani\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAmi Ratha Tumi Rathi\n&gt; Jemon Chalao Temni Chali\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _______=\r\n_________________________\n&gt;  From: rakesh.behal &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;\n&gt; To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, 16 November 2011 11:09 PM\n&gt; =\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Why Sapthshati mantras is called Siddha mantra?=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Can u pls elaborate about durga sap=\r\nathshati, its benefits, and uses in general man life, also if i have to sta=\r\nrt reading chapters menas increasing one by one so pls tell me imortance vi=\r\nz how should i increase\n&gt; \n&gt; 1] 1 m fully comfortable in reading chap 11, n=\r\now started reading 2, 4,5\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; Rakesh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Priyank,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; The document refers to samputikaran mantras for the Chan=\r\ndi.

Yes, the Chandi is a siddha text. Siddha in=\r\n the sense of being &quot;accomplished for Self realization&quot; as well as &quot;siddhis=\r\n&quot;, depending on the inclination and capacity of the sadhaka and of course H=\r\ner will.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To understand why it is so, one has to do sadhana and kee=\r\np praying to Her. Intellectual comprehension falls flat beyond a point. It =\r\nis plain useless.=C3=82=C2=A0And the sadhana is not a one day/few months/on=\r\ne year or few years process. It is=C3=82=C2=A0like an endless ocean, there =\r\nare simply no limits except for the ones you set for yourself in your own m=\r\nind.
