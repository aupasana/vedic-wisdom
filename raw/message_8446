There is no need to feel embarrassment=\r\n as a great deal of people feel unhappy talking about ghost/spirit although=\r\n they might say otherwise. And what you experienced was very frightening at=\r\n such a young age but it will prove positive for you in future. One day soo=\r\nn or later you will become a teacher yourself and give Diksha to others and=\r\n if somebody asks your help in such a situation you will draw on your exper=\r\nience and not on some bookish knowledge.\n\n=C2=A0I have to say that I have e=\r\nxperienced a great deal of such similar disturbing incident . Each and ever=\r\ny time I have been saved by Grace of Divine mother. I will woke up shouting=\r\n and reciting Divine names. Sometimes I would know what might be the cause =\r\nof such a attack. I never dismiss such incidents as just my imagination=C2=\r\n=A0and try to take proper action by going over the things I have done previ=\r\nous day. I am also able to see very easily spirits/beings etc and some year=\r\ns back I used to give deep healing to certain persons whom I had never met =\r\nso they might go to higher dimensions and become free from cycle. And I alw=\r\nays ask Divine Mother&#39;s permission for it. Last year in Oct. ancestors of v=\r\nery famous family in England suddenly appeared in my front room where I was=\r\n doing my everyday japa and indicated they need similar sort of healing. Th=\r\ney were a couple who were very famous when they were alive. I became very n=\r\nervous and got up and avoided touching them\n and went to my Puja Room to as=\r\nk for guidance. Divine Mother immediately refused any healing for them thro=\r\nugh me. They have sort of disappeared since then.\n\nI am puzzled by somethin=\r\ng you said.You will pester -Her- for help. Help for What?? They are Sister =\r\nAnd Brother and in fact They are One and Same. This world is creation of Di=\r\nvine Mother. She is in it and also far away from it.And when She is meshed =\r\nup with Her devotees She feels joy and pain as well. And if you will pray a=\r\nnd worship Her for this reason She might not say anything but some heart st=\r\nring will not play right. And Her Big Brother will also look at Her. I woul=\r\nd hold Her Feet for Her sake and do the likewise for Divine Lord.\n\nWhen I w=\r\nas living in Brijbhoomi, it was the ashram of disciples of Swami Shivanand =\r\n=C2=A0where I have rented a room. When I came back to London I kept receivi=\r\nng pamphlets from the Sivanand Yoga centre for several years. I never atten=\r\nded any workshop there but I used to cut out the pictures and names of Divi=\r\nne Mother and keep them in my books.\n\nThanks\nLaxmiNarayan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________=\r\n______________________\n From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\nTo: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Thursday, 28 June 2012, 19:09\nSubject: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Re: Mahamrityunjaya and Divine Namapathy\n \n\n\nHello LaxmiNaray=\r\nanji,\n\nThanks for the encouraging message. The thought of Vishnu turning on=\r\n his watery resting place and glancing in this direction is rather sweet. Y=\r\nou&#39;ve motivated me to do the mantra with even more enthusiasm now. Thank yo=\r\nu. :) I will pester Her for help with this......Ramakrishna says you have t=\r\no keep tugging at Her sari till she gives you something vaguely worthwhile =\r\nlike devotion.\n\nVery interesting to hear of your experience in Delhi. I agr=\r\nee that the Name provides protection against dodgy situations. I don&#39;t like=\r\n to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I&#39;m embarrassed to say that have alw=\r\nays been scared of the dark since childhood, slowly getting over it now. \n\n=\r\nOnce at university, around 7 years ago, I was preparing for some exams. It =\r\nwas after term-time and I had stayed back to revise.=C2=A0 I was moved to a=\r\n room that was different to the one I had been staying in, as my usual room=\r\n\n was being used for some conference guests. I used to hang out with the Ha=\r\nre Krishnas then, and was really into chanting the Hare Rama mahamantra the=\r\nn (still love this mantra, but chant Om Namo Narayanaya more now)- used to =\r\ndo 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. \n\nI was lying on my back in this=\r\n new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in some sort of light sleep=\r\n state. At that point I had a very nasty sensation that can only be describ=\r\ned as something or someone trying really hard to strangle me! I felt very f=\r\nrightened, and couldn&#39;t move, speak or wake myself up.\n\nIn this state, my m=\r\nind started repeating &quot;Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, Hari&quot; very very fast in terro=\r\nr. I think I chose this name because it was short and I could say it very f=\r\nast with concentration! The frightening experience then passed and I felt t=\r\nhe Name saved me.\n\nI woke up and turned on the light feeling absolutely pet=\r\nrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then did something I wouldn&#39;t norm=\r\nally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in London at that time of night (=\r\nI knew they don&#39;t sleep till about midnight as I&#39;ve stayed there) and had t=\r\nhe nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who initiated me into my =\r\nchosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she very kindly came to the =\r\nphone and reassured me saying it could have been some real negative force o=\r\nr just something from my imagination. Either way, she reassured me saying I=\r\n had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating the Name was the right a=\r\npproach. She suggested chanting before bedtime to avoid similar experiences=\r\n. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra before going to bed and slep=\r\nt fine (had to sleep with the light though on because I&#39;m a coward ;).\n\nSin=\r\nce then, I keep up the practice of repeating the Name before bedtime. I fee=\r\nl it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings positive Divine energy to my=\r\n mind ensuring better sleep. :)\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0Hello,\n&gt;\n =C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Thanks for writing this mail and the=C2=A0l=\r\nink to to the article.=C2=A0.=C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This is a very powerful and =\r\nsacred mantra and I am sure regular japa=C2=A0brings peace and protection. =\r\nSome years back I went to Delhi for few days and stayed at my friend&#39;s hous=\r\ne which was on fifth floor.

It is weird to see how the body =\r\nloses all importance the moment it dies. It is also strange how a dead body=\r\n looks just like an empty house...exactly like someone just left. It certai=\r\nnly makes one\n think that there must be something more to us than this fles=\r\nhy cage. This cage that becomes unattractive in old age, filled with appall=\r\ning miseries in serious illness, and hideous in death. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is interest=\r\ning to think about what one can do to help the sick and dying, when they re=\r\nach a stage beyond all human aid. It is not pleasant to watch someone die w=\r\nhile feeling utterly helpless to relieve suffering. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sivananda used to=\r\n have great faith in the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divine Namapathy&quot;. While=\r\n modern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, he used to say =\r\nthat, Namapathy was an outstanding way to prevent disease and heal us on al=\r\nl levels- physical, mental and spiritual. \n&gt; \n&gt; While he said all names of =\r\nGod- Rama, Allah,\n Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the Maham=\r\nrityunjaya mantra specially for healing purposes. And especially for those =\r\nwho are very sick or dying.\n&gt; \n&gt; He says &quot;Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra will remo=\r\nve accidents, incurable diseases and bestow long life and immortality. It i=\r\ns a Moksha Mantra too.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I visited the Sivananda Charitable hospital in=\r\n Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu some years ago, and the doctors and nurses who work=\r\n there, start the day with chanting of mantras (including the Mahamrityunja=\r\nya) for their patients, each other and the whole world. I believe it is the=\r\n same with the little Ashram hospital in Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to=\r\n start the day.....repeating mantras with your colleagues. \n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted t=\r\no mention the power of this mantra for anyone who knows people who are sick=\r\n/seriously ill (or indeed, if you yourself are unfortunately unwell). It is=\r\n simply to invoke the blessing of God to ease suffering, or to help bear su=\r\nffering better. Basically saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because You know what i=\r\ns best. Of course it is NOT asking for a miracle cure (unless that happens =\r\nto be the Will of God). \n&gt; \n&gt; At any point in time, there are several human=\r\n beings, animals and various creatures who are dying, and unfortunately suf=\r\nfering greatly during the process of dying. I think it would be nice to rep=\r\neat this mantra a few times daily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it =\r\nworks, and I believe them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a link for those who are intereste=\r\nd\n in learning more about this great mantra. The article is written by a di=\r\nsciple of Swami Satyananda, a saint of very recent times. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.=\r\nyogamag.net/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.shtml\n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes,\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!

There is no need to feel e=\r\nmbarrassment as a great deal of people feel unhappy talking about ghost/spi=\r\nrit although they might say otherwise. And what you experienced was very fr=\r\nightening at such a young age but it will prove positive for you in future.=\r\n One day soon or later you will become a teacher yourself and give &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-0&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Diksha&lt;/span&gt; to oth=\r\ners and if somebody asks your help in such a situation you will draw on you=\r\nr experience and not on some bookish knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;I have to say that I have experienced a great deal of such\n similar\n=\r\n disturbing incident . Each and every time I have been saved by Grace of Di=\r\nvine mother. I will woke up shouting and reciting Divine names. Sometimes I=\r\n would know what might be the cause of such a attack. I never dismiss such =\r\nincidents as just my imagination&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;=\r\n&quot;&gt;and try to take proper action by going over the things I have done previo=\r\nus day. I am also able to see very easily spirits/beings etc and some years=\r\n back I used to give deep healing to certain persons whom I had never met s=\r\no they might go to higher dimensions and become free from cycle. And I alwa=\r\nys ask Divine Mother&#39;s permission for it. Last year in Oct. &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv=\r\n695049507misspell-1&quot; class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ancestors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of very famou=\r\ns family in England suddenly appeared in my front room where I was doing my=\r\n everyday &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-2&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;ja=\r\npa&lt;/span&gt; and indicated they need similar sort of healing. They were a coup=\r\nle\n who were very famous when they\n were alive. I became very nervous and g=\r\not up and avoided touching them and went to my &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507miss=\r\npell-3&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Puja&lt;/span&gt; Room to ask for guidance. Di=\r\nvine Mother immediately refused any healing for them through me. They have =\r\nsort of disappeared since then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:1=\r\n3px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;I am puzzled by=\r\n something you said.You will pester -Her- for help. Help for What?? They ar=\r\ne Sister And Brother and in fact They are One and Same. This world is creat=\r\nion of Divine Mother. She is in it and also far away from it.And when She i=\r\ns meshed up with Her devotees She feels joy and pain as well. And if you wi=\r\nll pray and worship Her for this reason She might not say anything but some=\r\n heart string will not play right. And Her Big Brother will also look at He=\r\nr. I would hold Her Feet for Her sake and do the likewise for Divine Lord.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;When I was living in &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507m=\r\nisspell-4&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Brijbhoomi&lt;/span&gt;, it was the ashram =\r\nof disciples of Swami &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-5&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv69504=\r\n9507mark&quot;&gt;Shivanand&lt;/span&gt; &nbsp;where I have rented a room.

The thought of Vishnu turning on his watery resting place and =\r\nglancing in this direction is rather sweet. You&#39;ve motivated me to do the m=\r\nantra with even more enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for he=\r\nlp with this......Ramakrishna says you have to keep tugging at Her sari til=\r\nl she gives you something vaguely worthwhile like devotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Very int=\r\neresting to hear of your experience in Delhi. I agree that the Name provide=\r\ns protection against dodgy situations. I don&#39;t like to think about ghosts/s=\r\npirits etc.... I&#39;m embarrassed to say that have always been scared of the d=\r\nark since childhood, slowly getting over it now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once at university=\r\n,\n around 7 years ago, I was preparing for some exams. It was after term-ti=\r\nme and I had stayed back to revise.&nbsp; I was moved to a room that was di=\r\nfferent to the one I had been staying in, as my usual room\n was being used =\r\nfor some conference guests. I used to hang out with the Hare &lt;span id=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv695049507misspell-14&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Krishnas&lt;/span&gt; then, and=\r\n was really into chanting the Hare Rama &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-15=\r\n&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;mahamantra&lt;/span&gt; then (still love this mantra=\r\n, but chant Om &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-16&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507ma=\r\nrk&quot;&gt;Namo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-17&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507m=\r\nark&quot;&gt;Narayanaya&lt;/span&gt; more now)- used to do 2 hours a day and it made me f=\r\neel good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was lying on my back in this new room trying to sleep a=\r\nround 11 pm, and was in some sort of light sleep state. At that point I had=\r\n a very nasty sensation that can only be described as something or someone =\r\ntrying really hard to strangle me! I felt very frightened, and couldn&#39;t mov=\r\ne, speak or wake myself up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this state, my mind started repeating=\r\n &quot;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-18&quot;\n class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-19&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-20&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Hari=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-21&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Har=\r\ni&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-22&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;H=\r\nari&lt;/span&gt;&quot; very very fast in terror. I think I chose this name because it =\r\nwas short and I could say it very fast with concentration! The frightening =\r\nexperience then passed and I felt the Name saved me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I woke up and t=\r\nurned on the light feeling absolutely petrified and unable to go back to sl=\r\neep. I then did something I wouldn&#39;t normally do. I rang the &lt;span id=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv695049507misspell-23&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Sivananda&lt;/span&gt; Yoga cen=\r\ntre in London at that time of night (I knew they don&#39;t sleep till about mid=\r\nnight as I&#39;ve stayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior=\r\n lady Swami who initiated me into my chosen mantra.\n Despite the late hour =\r\nof 11 pm, she very kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it coul=\r\nd have been some real negative force or just something from my imagination.=\r\n Either way, she reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, =\r\nand repeating\n the Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting befo=\r\nre bedtime to avoid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the =\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-24&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Mahamantra&lt;=\r\n/span&gt; before going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light thou=\r\ngh on because I&#39;m a coward ;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since then, I keep up the &lt;span id=3D=\r\n&quot;yiv695049507misspell-25&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;practice&lt;/span&gt; of rep=\r\neating the Name before bedtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! An=\r\nd brings positive Divine energy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-26&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv69504=\r\n9507mark&quot;&gt;Aparna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollo=\r\nw&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, =\r\nLaxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt;\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n =\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for writing this mail and t=\r\nhe&nbsp;link to to the article.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; This is=\r\n a very powerful and sacred mantra and I am sure regular &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695=\r\n049507misspell-29&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;japa&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;brings peace=\r\n and protection.

While modern medicine, Ayurv=\r\neda, &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-40&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Reiki&lt;=\r\n/span&gt; etc all have their place, he used to say that, &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049=\r\n507misspell-41&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Namapathy&lt;/span&gt; was an outstand=\r\ning way to prevent disease and heal us on all levels-\n physical, mental and=\r\n spiritual. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; While he said all names of God- Rama, Allah,\n=\r\n Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv69504950=\r\n7misspell-42&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Mahamrityunjaya&lt;/span&gt; mantra spec=\r\nially for healing purposes. And especially for those who are very sick or d=\r\nying.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; He says &quot;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-43&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Maha&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-44&quot; clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Mrityunjaya&lt;/span&gt; Mantra will remove accidents, inc=\r\nurable diseases and bestow long life and immortality. It is a &lt;span id=3D&quot;y=\r\niv695049507misspell-45&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Moksha&lt;/span&gt; Mantra too=\r\n.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I visited the &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-46&quot; clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Sivananda&lt;/span&gt; Charitable hospital in &lt;span id=3D&quot;=\r\nyiv695049507misspell-47&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Pattamadai&lt;/span&gt;, Tami=\r\nl &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-48&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Nadu&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt; some years ago, and the doctors and nurses who work there, start the day=\r\n with chanting of\n mantras (including the &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-=\r\n49&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv695049507mark&quot;&gt;Mahamrityunjaya&lt;/span&gt;) for their patients, =\r\neach other and the whole world. I believe it is the same with the\n little A=\r\nshram hospital in &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv695049507misspell-50&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv69504950=\r\n7mark&quot;&gt;Rishikesh&lt;/span&gt;. What a wonderful way to start the day.....repeatin=\r\ng mantras with your colleagues. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I wanted to mention the p=\r\nower of this mantra for anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously ill =\r\n(or indeed, if you yourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invo=\r\nke the blessing of God to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering better.=\r\n Basically saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because You know what is best. Of cour=\r\nse it is NOT asking for a miracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will =\r\nof God). &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; At any point in time, there are several human be=\r\nings, animals and various creatures who are dying, and unfortunately suffer=\r\ning greatly during the process of dying. I think it would be nice to repeat=\r\n this mantra a few times daily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it wor=\r\nks, and I believe them. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Here is a link for\n those who are=\r\n interested\n in learning more about this great mantra.
