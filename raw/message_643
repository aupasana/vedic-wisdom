Sri Yogeshwar was a very \n&gt; highly\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n realized saint. His book is very good. He does mention about his\n&gt; &gt; prevo=\r\nius birth and also mentions that Saccha Baba had also \n&gt; confirmed\n&gt; &gt; the =\r\nsame thing. Saccha Baba was another very highly realized saint \n&gt; too.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Sri Yogeshwar had many times visions of Sai Baba of shirdi and \n&gt; Naam=\r\ndev\n&gt; &gt; and also many other saints too. The initiation he got on the bank \n=\r\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; river Narmada awakened his kundalini and he has described very\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n accurately the state and symptoms after awekaning of kunalini. He \n&gt; had\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; very good command on all aspects of sprituality and was a fantastic\n&gt; &gt; =\r\norator. His followers have done a very good job of putting up the \n&gt; web\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; site and sharing the information for free both audio and books.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nChiti Leela or the play of Shakti or God is very complex, \n&gt; Ramakrishna\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; may have taken birth as more than one person and in future may take\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nore births.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His comsic body (karan sharir) or whatever name others=\r\n use pardon \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; lack of appropriate word, is also alive and manifest =\r\nfrom time to \n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; After reading this and other books, I feel that ea=\r\nch one of us has \n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; inner guru along with our atma and this inner gur=\r\nu in conjunction \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; our accumulated or sanchit sankaras give us vi=\r\nsions of these \n&gt; mahatmas\n&gt; &gt; or help us attach or attract to a Saint or s=\r\nome aspects of the \n&gt; saint\n&gt; &gt; more than others. This inner guru is the sa=\r\nme in all humam beings \n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; manifests uniquely based on each person. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also believe that one needs to get initiated by a Guru who is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; present in physical form and seek guidance from him time to time.\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nere are many instances of other forms of inititations like\n&gt; &gt; initiation i=\r\nn dream or inititation by cosmic forms, these forms of\n&gt; &gt; initiations thou=\r\ngh very important are very rare or uncommon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After reading Sri Yog=\r\neshwar&#39;s book I had some questions pop up in \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; mind about him.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 1) What was the purpose of his birth? Yes he may have guided many\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nspiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique.\n&gt; &gt; 2) Did =\r\nhe realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the \n&gt; book\n&gt; &gt; about =\r\nit in many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after \n&gt; that?\n&gt; &gt; 3) =\r\nHe did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of \n&gt; giving\n&gt; &gt; sp=\r\nirtual talks? It seems unusual.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have also read somewhere that on=\r\nce a person reaches a spiritual\n&gt; &gt; state, he cannot remain in human body f=\r\nor more than few days, was \n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; the case?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; May be others who=\r\n have read this book can share more light.\n&gt; &gt; I do recommend to seekers of=\r\n spirutuality to read this book if one \n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; time, it is available for=\r\n free to download as a pdf book on his \n&gt; web site.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Ram Sharma=\r\n also has done a lot of work for the betterment and\n&gt; &gt; upliftment, a lot o=\r\nf his information is wellknown.

There was=\r\n a Telephone exchange just opposite to \n&gt; Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to sa=\r\nme Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opera=\r\ntors. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. \n&gt; Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nas working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always \n&gt; talking =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a wee=\r\nkly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing de=\r\nvotional songs \n&gt; created \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singi=\r\nng. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters we=\r\nre attending this weekly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was =\r\nthen 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of \n&gt; 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go =\r\nto seashore daily at 7 pm after duty \n&gt; hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only=\r\n about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told=\r\n me--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and=\r\n my wife is remembering me. \n&gt; My \n&gt; &gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few min=\r\nutes to call me. I shall have to go \n&gt; now=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And =\r\nwith my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one an=\r\nother incident he told me that there will be a \n&gt; plane \n&gt; &gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka b=\r\ny \n&gt; Bus, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will=\r\n be punctured. \n&gt; Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come fr=\r\nom Dwarka as was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was \n&gt; a=\r\nttracted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be discip=\r\nle of \n&gt; shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I \n=\r\n&gt; surrendered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house =\r\nbefore Thakur picture. I \n&gt; prayed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart =\r\nto accept me as his follower and bestow \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; grace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nex=\r\nt day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 \n&gt; morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wh=\r\nile taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; waking\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I \n&gt; have\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed \n&gt; a=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy=\r\n should you take such a \n&gt; hasty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramh=\r\namsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. \n&gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grea=\r\nt Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide \n&gt; us, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; give=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Her arguments were right at her place as people in general \n&gt; not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; k=\r\nnow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have \n&gt;=\r\n taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was \n&gt; telling\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also \n&gt; decided=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=\r\n&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, \n&gt; Mr. Patel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You =\r\nhave also not seen him. He has \n&gt; never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am =\r\nliving. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house \n&gt; &gt; &gt; within\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 t=\r\no 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for \n&gt; Thakur is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nperfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9C=\r\nHow it is possible?
