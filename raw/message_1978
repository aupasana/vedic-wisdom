In fact, gods can be invoked and worshippe=\r\nd in one&#39;s breathing. Gods can be worshipped without any external invocatio=\r\nn also, as they have an indwelling presence always. However, external worsh=\r\nip in fire gives the best results and useful for progressing for most sadha=\r\nkas in the beginning.\n \nKurukshetra is the land of BhagavadGita and you are=\r\n blessed to be from that sacred land. I and my guru spent a couple of days =\r\nat Kurukshetra for shooting a documentary movie on Krishna&#39;s historicity in=\r\n May 2008. That whole region is filled with some powerful and strange spiri=\r\ntual energy. We had a couple of really nice homams and meditation sessions =\r\nin Kurukshetra. I loved the place.\n \nParticularly, one Chandi homam we did =\r\nin the night atop a small hill in Kurukshetra (Karna ka teela) was very nic=\r\ne. An old yogi and his grandson lived there and did sadhana everyday. They =\r\nbelonged to Naath pantha and were Gorakshaanaath (Gorakhnath) followers. Wh=\r\nen we were climbing the hill in the afternoon, Manish told me we probably h=\r\nad a rina there and might end up doing something there. When we found these=\r\n yogis, we talked to them for a while. Just when leaving, Manish saw their =\r\nhavan kund where they do a havan everyday. Manish asked them it would be al=\r\nright if we do Chandi homam in that havan kund that night. They welcomed us=\r\n under the condition that we would not call any dark energies, as they were=\r\n worshippers of Narayana. We told them we would call Mahalakshmi in fire an=\r\nd they consented. We went back later that night with all materials and did =\r\na Chandi homam. The place had around 10 dogs. They were barking loud before=\r\n, but they all came and sat around the homam once fire started. Surprisingl=\r\ny, the dogs just sat around the fire without any sounds or barking for a wh=\r\nole 2 hours. It was Manish, I, that old naath panthaa yogi and a bunch of d=\r\nogs that sat around the havan kund for 2 hours.\n \nUntil we invoked the Moth=\r\ner, it was very silent except for our soft voices. But the moment we invoke=\r\nd the Mother in fire, there were strange noises all around us on the hill a=\r\nnd in the valley. Suddenly, so many birds and flies started making various =\r\nnoises. The effect of transitioning from such silence to such an animated s=\r\ntate all around us was quite strange and eerie. That animated state continu=\r\ned for a few minutes. Also, when we offered bali at the end of homam, sudde=\r\nnly all the dogs got up and started running together towards the southweste=\r\nrn direction while jumping up now and then, as though they were chasing som=\r\nebody.\n \nThere was no electricity there. The ONLY light in the vicinity was=\r\n homam fire. There were so many mosquitos all around us and biting us conti=\r\nnuously. We did not eat anything since noon and it was 10:30 pm when we fin=\r\nished. Still, it was so nice. Like I said, there is something ethereal abou=\r\nt the air of Kurukshetra. Though I only spent only a couple of days there, =\r\nI have fond memories of that place.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast=\r\n.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Ja=\r\ngannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Messag=\r\ne ----- \n  From: manoj sharma \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: =\r\nSaturday, June 13, 2009 12:42 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Pitri Tarpan=\r\na Question (Re: &quot;Vishnu Sahasra Naama Homam&quot;..)\n\n        JAI MAA\n\n        N=\r\narsimha ji & others\n\n        Namaskar\n\n        i am sharing one thing, but =\r\ndon&#39;t want to disturb you.\n        my native village is in Kurukshetra and =\r\nthere is a water pond in almost every village the elders told us that you c=\r\nan worship or meditate any devta or devi standing in these ponds, your spir=\r\nitual progress will magnifying by many folds. one day a old village prist a=\r\nlso told that when the fire homa is not possible due to rain (in our tradit=\r\nion the homa done in open) then you can invoke the deva in water and perfor=\r\nm the ahuti in it.\n\n        thanks\n\n        --- On Sat, 13/6/09, Narasimha =\r\nP.V.R.

No=\r\nt so long ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pitri tarpana everyd=\r\nay, as a part of daily rituals. This is not without reason.\n\n          *   =\r\n     *        *\n\n          The thoughts of the minds around us do have a su=\r\nbtle impact on our mind. When too many depressed, sad or frustrated people =\r\nare around you, it will have a negative effect on you. Similarly, when some=\r\n peaceful and blissful people or elevated souls are around you, it will hav=\r\ne a positive effect on you. Thus, thoughts in the minds around you does hav=\r\ne an impact on you.\n\n          This is particularly true with respect to th=\r\ne minds of people who have genetic/kaarmik links/debts with you. When minds=\r\n of such people are in great distress or great excitement, it has an impact=\r\n on your mind.\n\n          If a deceased ancestor to whom you have a kaarmik=\r\n debt has some strong desires and unable to progress to a higher loka or be=\r\n reborn, his thoughts and desires will have an impact on your mind.\n\n      =\r\n    Thus, we invest our mental energy praying for their relief. While offer=\r\ning balls of solid food (shraaddha) on special occasions, pray that the anc=\r\nestor may get an appropriate body again to fulfil remaining desires. While =\r\nleaving water in pitri tarpana, pray that the ancestor&#39;s desires may be sat=\r\nisfied and the ancestor may be overcome the weaknesses. By praying for help=\r\ning an ancestor, you are indirectly helping yourself, by removing a powerfu=\r\nl negative influence on your mind and getting rid of some weaknesses.\n\n    =\r\n      Unfortunately, the extremely simple ritual of pitri tarpana is out of=\r\n fashion today. However, so many people will benefit tremendously if they d=\r\no it atleast once every month if not daily. Vimalananda says that he will p=\r\nick pitri tarpana if there is only one ritual he can perform.\n\n          * =\r\n       *        *\n\n          Not long ago, every orthodox Braahmana used to=\r\n perform a fire ritual and a water ritual (tarpana) everyday. Rituals use e=\r\nxternal symbols to induce internal changes. These two rituals are really im=\r\nportant and useful rituals.\n\n          A small comparison of homam and tarp=\r\nana is reproduced from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup archives:\n\n          -------=\r\n----- --------- -----\n          One word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you=\r\n are calling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pi=\r\ntris and the medium is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people ir=\r\nrespective of whether watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planet=\r\ns in their horoscope.\n           \n          In homam, devatas come in fire =\r\nand burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in wat=\r\ner and free you from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmicall=\r\ny inherited from them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor w=\r\nho was lustful or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased an=\r\ncestor is still having those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoug=\r\nhts due to the connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of th=\r\ne weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a re=\r\nbirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a ne=\r\nw body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect you=\r\nr consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong sou=\r\nrce of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. B=\r\noth are very important sadhanas for spiritual progress.\n           \n       =\r\n   Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self-identificatio=\r\nn is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They work on your ind=\r\nividual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are grosser for=\r\nms of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their self-identif=\r\nication is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. You may note=\r\n that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora chart o=\r\nf astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for them respectively.\n  =\r\n         \n          Devas and pitris have different ways of working and inf=\r\nluencing us and helping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to al=\r\nl of us and have a role to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping dev=\r\nas in fire and satisfying pitris in water are very important.\n          ---=\r\n--------- --------- -----\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasimha\n    =\r\n      ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n---\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ h=\r\nomam\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n tarpana\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wis=\r\ndom\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. =\r\nnet\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg\n          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.=\r\norg\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- \n           \n          --- In JyotishGroup@ yahoogroups. com, R=\r\namakrishnan Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki108@...&gt; wrote:\n          &gt;\n          &gt; Dea=\r\nr Narasimha,\n          &gt;  \n          &gt; Thanks for this valuable manual.

In homam, \n          you are calling devatas and the=\r\n medium is fire. In tarpana, you are \n          calling pitris and the medi=\r\num is water. Both sadhanas are applicable \n          to all people irrespec=\r\ntive of whether watery signs/planets are strong \n          or fiery signs/p=\r\nlanets in their horoscope.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;In homam, \n          devatas come i=\r\nn fire and burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In \n          tarpana, =\r\npitris come in water and free you from vasanas (conditioning \n          of =\r\nthe mind) that were karmically inherited from them. If you have \n          =\r\ngenes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry or \n       =\r\n   jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still having \n=\r\n          those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to th=\r\ne \n          connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the =\r\n\n          weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on gi=\r\nving a \n          rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness=\r\n is attached \n          to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that co=\r\nnsciousness will \n          not affect your consciousness in the same way. =\r\nThus, tarpana aims to \n          cut off a strong source of bad karmas, whi=\r\nle homam burns off \n          previously committed bad karmas. Both are ver=\r\ny important sadhanas for \n          spiritual progress.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Devata=\r\ns are very subtle forms of \n          consciousness. Their self-identificat=\r\nion is to what is known as soul \n          and represented by Sun. They wor=\r\nk on your individual soul and free it \n          from the karmas it carries=\r\n. Pitris are grosser forms of consciousness \n          with strong attachme=\r\nnts and desires. Their self-identification is with \n          what is known=\r\n as mind and represented by Moon. You may note that Sun \n          and Moon=\r\n are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora chart of \n          astro=\r\nlogy. Fire and water are the natural media for them \n          respectively=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Devas and pitris have different ways of \n          working a=\r\nnd influencing us and helping our spiritual progress. But \n          both a=\r\nre relevant to all of us and have a role to play in our \n          spiritua=\r\nl evolution. Worshipping devas in fire and satisfying pitris \n          in =\r\nwater are very important.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial si=\r\nze=3D2&gt;------------ --------- -----&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;Best \n          regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- \n          --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam=\r\n Yourself: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homa=\r\nm&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri \n          Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n          tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A \n       =\r\n   href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank \n   =\r\n       rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nFree \n          Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.co=\r\nmcast.net&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. hom=\r\ne.comcast. \n          net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n     =\r\n     href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath \n         =\r\n Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot; \n          t=\r\narget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan \n          nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- \n          ---------=\r\n --------- &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;--- In &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3DJyotishGroup@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow \n          ymailto=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;JyotishGroup@ \n          yahoogroups. com&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;, Ramakrishnan Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki108@...&gt; \n          wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks \n          for thi=\r\ns valuable manual.

It is hoped that \n          spiritual sadha=\r\nkas interested in homam will benefit from this and also \n          help in =\r\nincreasing collective dharma in this world with their \n          contributi=\r\non.
