Krishna clearly says in \nBhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is d=\r\nangerous to follow someone \nelse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n\nFollowing the path of dharma b=\r\nasically means engaging in the right \naction/duty. Right action varies from=\r\n person to person, from time to time \nand from place to place. It is depend=\r\nent on what nature expects from you, \nwhich in turn is based on who you hav=\r\ne been in the past, what actions you \ndid in the past while identifying wit=\r\nh the action, who you affected in the \npast (and how) with the actions that=\r\n you identified with, what debts you \ncreated in the process, and what ment=\r\nal tendencies you accumulated until \nnow.\n\nIf, based on one&#39;s mental tenden=\r\ncies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \nto kill evil persons, that be=\r\ncomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \ntendencies and karmic debts,=\r\n nature wants a person to spread the message of \nuniformity of all religion=\r\ns, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies and kar=\r\nmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the \nritual of homam in the worl=\r\nd, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental tendencies and kar=\r\nmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of \nmoney and construct a te=\r\nmple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n\n* * *\n\nThe dharma of a being may change f=\r\nrom one life to another.\n\nAt the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s d=\r\nharma to kill his gurus, \nelders and relatives. The time then was such that=\r\n there was too much weight \non earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved=\r\n of some weight. Tremendous \ndestruction was to take place and civilization=\r\n destroyed to a great extent, \nto welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it=\r\n. Arjuna being a great warrior, \nit was his dharma to facilitate that. Some=\r\n people he deeply loved and \nrespected were on the other side and it was hi=\r\ns dharma to kill them.\n\nWhen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th cen=\r\ntury as one of \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had bee=\r\nn Arjuna in a \nprevious life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was di=\r\nfferent in this \nnew time and place. He was born to renounce material life =\r\ndespite his \naristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and=\r\n inspire \ngenerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and ser=\r\nvice to \nothers. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakr=\r\nishna \nsaid), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.=\r\n\n\n* * *\n\nThe tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n=\r\n\nSome people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharm=\r\na \nand not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the conce=\r\npt \nof caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concep=\r\nt of \ncaste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by=\r\n \nkilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was=\r\n a \nkshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi =\r\n\nlater. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna=\r\n \nof father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one \nd=\r\nevelops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n\nThus, th=\r\ne misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \ndharma=\r\n from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \nthe w=\r\norld. Each person has individual dharma.\n\nKnowing what one&#39;s dharma is is v=\r\nery very very difficult. If one is pure \nenough, one will *know* one&#39;s dhar=\r\nma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \nmind that tells us what our dhar=\r\nma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \nnoise from other parts of our mind=\r\ns which tell other things. Thus, we get \nconfused.\n\nWe should make the best=\r\n judgment combining discrimination and intuition and \ndecide what is our dh=\r\narma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing \nthe best we can is =\r\nall that we can do!\n\nMore than following dharma, what is of utmost importan=\r\nce is to engage in \nactions without identification. *That* alone ensures th=\r\nat we are not \naccumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We sh=\r\nould not build \ntoo much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage =\r\nin the best \npossible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharm=\r\na in the given \nsituation is), with as little attachment and self-identific=\r\nation with the \naction as possible. When the action is finished, we should =\r\nleave the result \nto god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen=\r\n now&quot;, &quot;will it \nwork&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unficati=\r\non through \nuntached action) will simplify our ego and purify our conscious=\r\nness slowly. \nAs we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our d=\r\nharma clearer. \nThere is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable =\r\nus to see our \ndharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. T=\r\nhis is not easy, \nbut not as difficult as people think.\n\nThe bottomline is:=\r\n Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n&quot;this is my dha=\r\nrma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with \nlittle attachmen=\r\nt.\n\n* * *\n\nIn deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the =\r\ninputs. \nAnother external input is the words of scriptures and learned men.=\r\n One can \nderive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s =\r\nspiritual \nmaster. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take th=\r\ne words of \nthe master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n\n=\r\nWhen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing guru=\r\ns \nand relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his=\r\n \ndharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dhar=\r\nma \nand wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadha=\r\nna, \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the ma=\r\nterial \nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n\nOne who is not in tune wi=\r\nth nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \ndebts are and what natu=\r\nre expects from one can err in the judgment of what \none&#39;s dharma is. If on=\r\ne&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \none&#39;s inner core, s=\r\nuch a guru can give perfect guidance.\n\n* * *\n\nBottomline is that I (or anyb=\r\nody) cannot outline a set of principles and \ndeclare that as the dharma. No=\r\n, dharma changes from person to person, from \ntime to time and from place t=\r\no place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \nout what one&#39;s dharma is. B=\r\nut, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \ndharma by increasing inter=\r\nnal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \nsadhana (like homam, japam=\r\n etc) and engaging in actions without much \nattachment, one can slowly puri=\r\nfy oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of \none&#39;s individual dharma.\n\nBes=\r\nt regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homa=\r\nm\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpir=\r\nituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lesson=\r\ns (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Window=\r\ns): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: htt=\r\np://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiya=\r\njiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, S=\r\neptember 27, 2008 8:02 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n\n&gt; Namaste to all\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; Vimalanda s=\r\nays path of dharma is very personal.\n&gt; Can somebody share views on that and=\r\n how can we approach\n&gt; towards it\n&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas =\r\nand upanishads\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; jitender\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Add more frien=\r\nds to your messenger and enjoy!

But, one can ref=\r\nine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;dharma by increasing internal purity. =\r\nBy doing various kinds of spiritual &lt;BR&gt;sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and=\r\n engaging in actions without much &lt;BR&gt;attachment, one can slowly purify one=\r\nself and refine one&#39;s understanding of &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ved=\r\nicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot;\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;dahiyaj=\r\niten&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:dahiyajiten%40yahoo.co.in&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ni just finished my Aghora series&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vim=\r\nalanda says path of dharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Can\n somebody share vi=\r\news on that and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt; towards it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Does it has =\r\nto do something with vedas and upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; j=\r\nitender&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n    =\r\n  &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Connect with friends all over the world. &lt;a hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_messenger_1/*http://in.messenger.yahoo=\r\n.com/?wm=3Dn/&quot;&gt; Get Yahoo!
