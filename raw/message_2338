I am afraid  I have been asked to write on  an unpleasant topic,  as this subject is not relished by those members  who have no faith in scriptures.  Nevertheless, I shall try to indicate  the practices followed by  our ancestors  as well as the  scriptural provisions known to me.\n\nDuring menstrual periods,a woman was considered as impure during those 3-4 days and was  made to take rest at an isolated corner or room  with earmarked  plates,glasses, mat  etc. within the house and not on the mattress in  inregular  bedrooms.  She was not allowed to mingle with rest of the family.  No woman  passing through periods was allowed to touch any person, clothes, or utensils for three days. From the medical point of view, during menses lots of blood loss will be there. In addition, severe stomach ache and cramps, backache are also a few signs experienced by woman.  By staying separately she was getting good amount of rest.  On the fourth day, she was allowed to enter the the house  after having a purification bath(special for that occasion) but was not allowed to cook or perform pooja etc. The linen and clothes used by such ladies were subjected to washing  in river or in hotwater.   During those three days, women were forbidden to touch\n even other Rajaswala  ladies i.e. ladies having their periods. In southern parts of India men and women folk  used  to keep a  decent  distance  of about  ten feet or so from the woman undergoing periods.Separate food used to be cooked and served to Rajaswala ladies. Left over   food eaten by menstrual woman was not to be eaten by her husband or any other family members. Should  such a lady mistakenly touch any one or be touched by any other person accidentally, that person used to take bath immediately and change their clothes.\n\n Sastras say that any mistake/sin resulting from  not following the Rajaswala Dharma  can be erased the  Rishi Panchami Vratham. Kanchi Sankaracharya(Maha periyaval)  has stated  that entering temples or holy places by ladies during monthly  periods is a great mistake or &#39;dosham&#39;.  &quot;Since God is everywhere, one can very well worship Him at your own place. You need not come to temple to have His Darshan. When a temple is built and the deity is installed by following the Sastraic  vidhis etc. and by chanting Vedic and other sacred chantings, one has to follow the same Sastra or rules that have been laid down for having His Darshan too.  Because of violating the sastras, people meet with accident or disasters  even when they undertake a pilgrimage&quot;.\n\nThe Dharma Sastras say that a  woman in periods is an outcast woman on the first day, on the second day she is equivalent to a woman who has given birth to a child and on the third day just a woman in periods. On the fourth day during  Sanghava kala(after8-30A.M.) if she takes bath she becomes pure. When taking bath she has to wash her body with mud 21 times and pour water over herself one hundred times. After taking bath she should see  the Sun God  and pray for the birth of a son. This is the proper method according to Sastras. The Atri Smruti says if a woman bleeds again after 18 days, she becomes impure only for one day, but if it happens after 20 days, she has to take rest for three days and take bath on fourthday. When she is undergoing periods, she should not apply collyrium to her eys, should not comb her hair and should not spin yarn. She should eat unseen by anybody.\nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n\n----- Forwarded Message ----\nFrom: G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nCc: brahmin_world@...; USBrahmins@yahoogroups.com; viprasamhitha@...; -Vedic-Dharma@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, August 24, 2009 6:03:58 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Rishi Panchami !\n\n\nFriends,\nOn this day, obeisance and tributes are paid to Saptha Rishis---Kasyapa, Atri, Bharadwaja, Viswamitra, Gauthama,  Jamadagni and Vashishta.
