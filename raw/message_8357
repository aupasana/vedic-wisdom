Wish getting Darshan was so easy!\n\nNo=\r\n no I don&#39;t hate Durga. She and Hari are my two favourite forms of the Divi=\r\nne. I&#39;m even named after her, how can I hate her! But I wish I could live u=\r\np to my name- Parvati as Aparna did a great tapas- but my tapas is not quit=\r\ne up to the mark. That&#39;s why I&#39;m pissed off with her.\n\nThere is a generatio=\r\nnal gap or some gap that has caused this misunderstanding- I&#39;m 29 and belon=\r\ng to this shocking generation of children who are not as polite to their pa=\r\nrents and elders as they should be. This lack of politeness (sometimes) ext=\r\nends to the divine parents also. \n\nThanks for the kind words Utpal ji, it&#39;s=\r\n much appreciated. I wish you speedy attainment of your Ishta. And you too =\r\nPriya ji and others. :)\n\nRegards,\n\nAparna\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste My dear friend,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Listening alone to the song which i heard for the first time....tears a=\r\nre flowing in torrent and i cried like a child who is looking for his mothe=\r\nr lost in a mela.\n&gt; \n&gt; Its looks dramatic but its naturally true for the pe=\r\nrson who has Chanda in Rohini in Pushkara bhaga.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna ji...=\r\nKoi baat nahi...Damn Durga...But develop that disgust to the level of treme=\r\nndous hatred towards Jagadamba so that, that becomes the Mantra which your =\r\nheart, mind and soul can not live without for a second.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is my deep =\r\nconviction that Hatred is as much intense as love...probably even a bit mor=\r\ne. because once you hate somebody, you cant take out that person from you m=\r\nind easily...It is ruinous if it is for anything else then Divine.

The gentle man who liked God thought that It is ve=\r\nry heavy rain and i can skip my visit to the temple and he didn&#39;t go to tem=\r\nple on that morning. He made peace with his mind.

It becomes a play, a play of tha=\r\nt only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; understand.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A little point about l=\r\nove these days, One day a man who is in love with\n&gt; &gt; the sun, was doing ho=\r\nmam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an\n&gt; &gt; open field with no sha=\r\nde, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrades and\n&gt; &gt; was sweating profusel=\r\ny as expected. He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; sweat coming into his =\r\neyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; me to hide so that y=\r\nou are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and ask=\r\ned himself,\n&gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away t=\r\nhis very\n&gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down wit=\r\nh sweat.\n&gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming =\r\nout to\n&gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him =\r\naway, we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to =\r\nall that\n&gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave h=\r\nim\n&gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say b=\r\nack\n&gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up t=\r\no 48.\n&gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In winters we all sing song=\r\ns of loving the sun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its =\r\nmere usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives a=\r\nnd gives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads=\r\n to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost pro=\r\nof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, =\r\nno mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he love=\r\ns us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t g=\r\nive one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; I am talking abou=\r\nt people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; there are quite a fe=\r\nw.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favor=\r\nably,\n&gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;=\r\nt give\n&gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nactually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\non&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; Well=\r\n, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; mother=\r\n will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; bata-o=\r\non ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; chahi=\r\nye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; quite a =\r\nlot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told you that =\r\nyou are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; You love then claim that s=\r\nomebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; You people love, to=\r\n get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; is to look out for=\r\n her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; I ask, i am screw=\r\ned, because I know it will be delivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in tha=\r\nt, and when did i become big enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh t=\r\noh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; should be so intens=\r\ne, that god herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;=\r\n, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, de=\r\nserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; girl, who is eve=\r\nntually her.\n&gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered,=\r\n how can then\n&gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekh=\r\nenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. Th=\r\nat doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I =\r\nneed to do,\n&gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki n=\r\naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, even if th=\r\ne results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are g=\r\nod&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you =\r\nwon&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissfu=\r\nl life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet =\r\nhouse, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greate=\r\nst, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A do=\r\ng will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that is d=\r\nevotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or =\r\nmutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t =\r\nbring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants m=\r\naster, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us , and master =\r\nwith god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; We are never happy with what the maste=\r\nr brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya=\r\n paneer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bha=\r\ni kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;=\r\nt want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; then we claim =\r\nto others , oh no no, I never want food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; yeah right!!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies s=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; wag at his thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; about the great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.

It becomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; understan=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A little point about love these days, One day a man who is in l=\r\nove with\n&gt; &gt; the sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad=\r\n, in an\n&gt; &gt; open field with no shade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigr=\r\nades and\n&gt; &gt; was sweating profusely as expected. He was getting irritated w=\r\nith the\n&gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do=\r\n you want\n&gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; The man looked =\r\ndown in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in=\r\n summers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; moment, just because my body=\r\n is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; All of us look out for him i=\r\nn the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers w=\r\ne abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, =\r\nis this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants t=\r\no hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apolo=\r\ngized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is=\r\n the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matte=\r\nr what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summers we ha=\r\nte\n&gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmagnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nere is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nreathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; ex=\r\nist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; Hell, he =\r\nburns for us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet=\r\n what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; birt=\r\nhs combined.\n&gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship busi=\r\nness. And\n&gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a =\r\ngirl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore fo=\r\nr that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a who=\r\nre!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a bo=\r\ny I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has n=\r\never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existe=\r\nnce, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i kno=\r\nw these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to =\r\nhis chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t=\r\n you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Go=\r\nrakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri=\r\n kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chah=\r\niye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is=\r\n far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then h=\r\ne went on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; love?=\r\n???\n&gt; &gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can a=\r\nsk from God\n&gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her=\r\n. The moment\n&gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, =\r\nbut then\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to kn=\r\now whats\n&gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rath=\r\ner my love\n&gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come and tell =\r\nme &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) te=\r\nlls me first\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i alre=\r\nady have that\n&gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; To top it all he says si=\r\nnce he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; he say anything to his =\r\ngod? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; have surrendered, then i=\r\nt should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass w=\r\narming it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; everything god will do, k=\r\nyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Surrend=\r\ner is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; god&#39;s, =\r\nthe results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; If you =\r\nactually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; counse=\r\nlor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; in a=\r\n jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; O=\r\nne of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; al=\r\nways maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhen he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmaster , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\noggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; dog=\r\ngy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nEquate doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; We a=\r\nre never happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; expecting b=\r\nutter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale he=\r\nro, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopa=\r\nal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously wan=\r\nt the food, and\n&gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food ,=\r\n I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so=\r\n shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSC=\r\nIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch,=\r\n that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do w=\r\nant the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tails of great dog=\r\ns do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; about the great dogs, and pretend that=\r\n we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its=\r\n an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and the=\r\nn you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world wi=\r\nll salute you.
