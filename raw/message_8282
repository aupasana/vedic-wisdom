True, atma cannot be poluted and is bey=\r\nond desires and actions. But most people do not identify with atma. They\n i=\r\ndentify with a perishable body. So all the talk of &quot;all is atma and atma is=\r\n pure&quot; is just theory.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Atma is like an ocean in which waves and ri=\r\nppes arise and move. Ocean does not get shattered when ripples hit each oth=\r\ner and stays the same. But bodies, minds and other perishable objects arisi=\r\nng in atma are like waves and ripples arising and moving in ocean. They inc=\r\nrease, decrease, get shattered etc. One identifying with the ocean of atma =\r\nis beyond happiness and sadness. One identifying with the ripple of a body =\r\nwill experience happiness, sadness etc.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Suppose one is watching a =\r\nmovie and knows that it is not real and just a movie. Still, when a really =\r\nscary scene comes, one may be startled. Mere intellectual understanding tha=\r\nt it is not real and just a movie, is not enough. It has to be ingrained fu=\r\nlly in one&#39;s instincts. Similarly, intellectually knowing that all this is =\r\na play and not real, is not enough. When some really\n pleasurable and painf=\r\nul event happens, one WILL identify with the body and experience something.=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If Shankara was fully enlightened before that episode (we don&#39;t k=\r\nnow that for sure), then the action would not have bound him. Otherwise, it=\r\n would&#39;ve created a rina. If he experienced some pleasure, he would create =\r\na new rina to the queen, to various deities (!) who live within one&#39;s consc=\r\niousness and operate various parts of one&#39;s body and mind, and to various b=\r\neings in his virya who may have been significantly affected. He would have =\r\nto pay those debts back later.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;There is n=\r\nothing absolutely sacred or dirty about any action. It is the intent and at=\r\ntitude of the actor that makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered act=\r\nions are more dirty than selfless actions geared at others. More so, the de=\r\nnser and more selfish one&#39;s\n conditioning. \n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; but knowing this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he d=\r\no\n&gt;&gt; this for love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?\n&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;Only still ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly on=\r\nly ummanifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/c=\r\nreation) does not have any objects and actions within it. Atma during a sri=\r\nshti cycle does have many objects within it and many actions between them.\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Thus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and d=\r\noing nothing. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized person =\r\nidentifies with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like his=\r\n/her actions. One does not particularly identify with what one&#39;s old body s=\r\npecifically does (based on previous momentum).\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Nature uses\n such r=\r\nealized people to set good examples for the world. So they do engage in som=\r\ne actions. They have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do what=\r\never spontaneously occurs to them.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Shankara performing last rites =\r\nfor mother would&#39;ve made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an example fo=\r\nr future. One&#39;s interaction with the world is give & take. We give things t=\r\no others and take things from them. True renunciation is in renouncing what=\r\n we take. There is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant notion of san=\r\nnyasa was to cut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated giving others (e=\r\n.g. mother) sannyasa.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Swami Vivekananda and Swami Sivananda took t=\r\nhis further. They engaged in a lot of service for the society, unlike other=\r\n sannyasis who lock themselves in isolation.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Of course, if the act=\r\n of &quot;giving&quot; increases pride (i.e. you are &quot;taking&quot; something in return of =\r\nwhat you are giving!!!), then a sannyasi\n better isolate oneself from the w=\r\norld and neither give nor take (except absolute essentials for survival). B=\r\nut, when one progresses beyond some level, it is a good idea to &quot;give&quot; what=\r\n one is in a position to give others.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The purpose of life is to gi=\r\nve and not to take, though some taking is unavoidable in the process of giv=\r\ning. Focus on what you give and not on what you take.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 * \n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; can one achieve moksha still in family life\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Yes.=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;You are still not old enough.

It is called &quot;mental conditioning=\r\n&quot;.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Can it be controlled?

I am doing it wit=\r\nhout revealing your identity.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n if he didnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt indulge=\r\n himself&lt;br&gt;&gt; mindfully in the deed?&amp;enjoy it,he went only for a rea=\r\nson he is not the karman,atma&lt;br&gt;&gt; cannot be polluted,realising this san=\r\nkara went to the queen&amp;thus he is still as sacred&lt;br&gt;&gt; as ever?&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;Though correct, this is a dangerous notion for most people. True, =\r\natma cannot be poluted and is beyond desires and actions. But most people d=\r\no not identify with atma. They\n identify with a perishable body. So all the=\r\n talk of &quot;all is atma and atma is pure&quot; is just theory.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Atma i=\r\ns like an ocean in which waves and rippes arise and move. Ocean does not ge=\r\nt shattered when ripples hit each other and stays the same. But bodies, min=\r\nds and other perishable objects arising in atma are like waves and ripples =\r\narising and moving in ocean. They increase, decrease, get shattered etc. On=\r\ne identifying with the ocean of atma is beyond happiness and sadness. One i=\r\ndentifying with the ripple of a body will experience happiness, sadness etc=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Suppose one is watching a movie and knows that it is not rea=\r\nl and just a movie. Still, when a really scary scene comes, one may be star=\r\ntled. Mere intellectual understanding that it is not real and just a movie,=\r\n is not enough. It has to be ingrained fully in one&#39;s instincts. Similarly,=\r\n intellectually knowing that all this is a play and not real, is not enough=\r\n. When some really\n pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL identif=\r\ny with the body and experience something.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If Shankara was full=\r\ny enlightened before that episode (we don&#39;t know that for sure), then the a=\r\nction would not have bound him. Otherwise, it would&#39;ve created a rina. If h=\r\ne experienced some pleasure, he would create a new rina to the queen, to va=\r\nrious deities (!) who live within one&#39;s consciousness and operate various p=\r\narts of one&#39;s body and mind, and to various beings in his virya who may hav=\r\ne been significantly affected. He would have to pay those debts back later.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;There is nothing absolutely sacre=\r\nd or dirty about any action. It is the intent and attitude of the actor tha=\r\nt makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actions are more dirty tha=\r\nn selfless actions geared at others. More so, the denser and more selfish o=\r\nne&#39;s\n conditioning. &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; but know=\r\ning this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do&lt;br&gt;&gt; th=\r\nis for love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On=\r\nly still ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly only =\r\nummanifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/crea=\r\ntion) does not have any objects and actions within it. Atma during a srisht=\r\ni cycle does have many objects within it and many actions between them.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Thus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and =\r\ndoing nothing. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized person=\r\n identifies with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like hi=\r\ns/her actions. One does not particularly identify with what one&#39;s old body =\r\nspecifically does (based on previous momentum).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Nature uses\n s=\r\nuch realized people to set good examples for the world. So they do engage i=\r\nn some actions. They have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do=\r\n whatever spontaneously occurs to them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Shankara performing la=\r\nst rites for mother would&#39;ve made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an e=\r\nxample for future. One&#39;s interaction with the world is give &amp; take. We =\r\ngive things to others and take things from them. True renunciation is in re=\r\nnouncing what we take. There is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant =\r\nnotion of sannyasa was to cut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated giv=\r\ning others (e.g. mother) sannyasa.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda and Swami=\r\n Sivananda took this further. They engaged in a lot of service for the soci=\r\nety, unlike other sannyasis who lock themselves in isolation.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nOf course, if the act of &quot;giving&quot; increases pride (i.e. you are &quot;taking&quot; so=\r\nmething in return of what you are giving!!!), then a sannyasi\n better isola=\r\nte oneself from the world and neither give nor take (except absolute essent=\r\nials for survival). But, when one progresses beyond some level, it is a goo=\r\nd idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a position to give others.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The=\r\n purpose of life is to give and not to take, though some taking is unavoida=\r\nble in the process of giving. Focus on what you give and not on what you ta=\r\nke.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; can one achieve moksha s=\r\ntill in family life&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Yes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You are still not old en=\r\nough. Focus on your studies for the next 3-4 years. But, eventually, you ca=\r\nn read &quot;Yoga Vasishtham&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; st=\r\nill iam in silly thoughts....ya can man controll his thoughts100%?]&lt;br&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;Various good and bad thoughts come to mind\n continuously, for it is t=\r\nhe nature of mind! As long as one is alive, the force that runs one&#39;s exist=\r\nence creates thoughts in the mind. This force is based on the momentum from=\r\n various notions one was exposed to and various desires one entertained, du=\r\nring various lives. It is called &quot;mental conditioning&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Can it=\r\n be controlled? Yes, in the sense that one can add new notions and new desi=\r\nres to this driving force and the its direction can be slowly refined over =\r\ntime.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Mind is the problem and mind is the key to the solution =\r\nas well. Use mind to change the direction of mind.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw about 100%, but I do not know one can modify one&#39;s thinking over time.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirit=\r\nuality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&g=\r\nt;,&lt;br&gt;if atma is in us and atma is the part of akhanda jyoti swaroop[the g=\r\nod-all in one fire form] and the man knew\n that pleasure of the realization=\r\n like sankara did....&lt;br&gt;if he didnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of =\r\nsex ,if he didnt indulge himself mindfully in the deed?&amp;enjoy it,he wen=\r\nt only for a reason he is not the karman,atma cannot be polluted,realising =\r\nthis sankara went to the queen&amp;thus he is still as sacred as ever?&lt;br&gt;b=\r\nut knowing this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do thi=\r\ns for love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?&lt;br&gt;i have read&#39;&#39;=\r\nruaanubandha ruupena pasu patni sutaalayah&quot;did he want to balance his runa?=\r\nor..but still he is a sarvasanghaparityagi...why may he have done it?what m=\r\nay he be telling us through this deed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;deleted&g=\r\nt; can one achieve moksha still in family life if he really realises atman =\r\nif the above assumption is true..then how can one realise atman?is it a fee=\r\nling or a substratum?what is it made upof?&lt;br&gt;still iam in silly thoughts..=\r\n..ya can man controll his\n thoughts100%?]&lt;br&gt;iam extremely sorry...but...i =\r\ncouldnt resist asking you for &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;really sorry for bothering=\r\n...&lt;br&gt;namaskaram....&lt;br&gt;good night...&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/=\r\ntr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; =\r\n&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div=\r\n&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1175152630-1683919759-1338280042=:68750--\r\n\n"}}
