If one can imagine an action in the mind with the=\r\n same level of intense self-identification with the action as when it is do=\r\nne externally, it gives the same effect then.

(Even if at the \n&gt; different pla=\r\nne of existence) or the people\n&gt; &gt; who criticize are right when they say th=\r\nat \n&gt; yours is a full of stories which are\n&gt; &gt; only mythological and you pr=\r\nay those imaginary \n&gt; Gods which are nothing\n&gt; &gt; but characters of Stories =\r\nof some \n&gt; writer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I could not answer the question as i was not \n&gt;=\r\n sure.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This somehow reminds of a question posed by Balaram Basu to \n&gt;=\r\n Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. According to Ramakrishna&#39;s divine vision, Balaram=\r\n Basu \n&gt; belonged in a previous birth to the inner circle of Chaitanya Maha=\r\nprabhu! \n&gt; Balaram Basu was very devout and pious, did many \n&gt; austerities =\r\nand spent many years serving saints at Puri, away from his hometown \n&gt; of C=\r\nalcutta. Yet, he had his doubts on the existence of god.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When he met =\r\nRamakrishna for the first time, he sat \n&gt; in a corner and listened to Ramak=\r\nrishna&#39;s words. When other people in the room \n&gt; left, Ramakrishna turned t=\r\no Balaram and asked him, &quot;Is there anything you want \n&gt; to ask me?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; B=\r\nalaram asked, &quot;Yes, sir. Does God really exist?&quot; \n&gt; Ramakrishna answered, &quot;=\r\nCertainly He does.&quot; Balaram asked, &quot;Can a person see Him?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakrishn=\r\na said, &quot;Yes, He reveals Himself to the \n&gt; devotee who thinks of Him as his=\r\n nearest and dearest. Because you do not get any \n&gt; response by praying to =\r\nHim once, you must not conclude that He does not \n&gt; exist.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Balaram a=\r\nsked, &quot;But why can&#39;t I see Him when I pray \n&gt; to Him so much?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakr=\r\nishna smiled and asked, &quot;Do you really \n&gt; consider Him to be as dear to you=\r\nr heart as your own children?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;No, sir&quot;, Balaram candidly answered, =\r\n&quot;I never felt \n&gt; that strongly for Him.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakrishna then said in a s=\r\nweet, convincing voice: \n&gt; &quot;Pray to God, thinking of Him as dearer than you=\r\nr own self. Truly I tell you, He \n&gt; is extremely fond of His devotees. He c=\r\nannot but reveal Himself to them. He \n&gt; comes to a person even before He is=\r\n sought. If a person comes one step towards \n&gt; God, God comes ten steps tow=\r\nards that person. There is none more intimate and \n&gt; more affectionate than=\r\n God.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; As Ramakrishna once said, one nee=\r\nds to think of god \n&gt; more than one thinks about parents, wife, children an=\r\nd about oneself, all put \n&gt; together. Try to do that. Then you will find th=\r\ne answer to your question \n&gt; yourself. A theoretical answer is useless. The=\r\n proof of the pudding is in *your* \n&gt; eating it. If somebody else tells you=\r\n that the pudding exists and one can eat \n&gt; it, that information has very l=\r\nimited use. In order to convince yourself fully, \n&gt; you need to taste the p=\r\nudding yourself!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though all gods and their stories are maya from a \n&gt;=\r\n strictly vedantic point of view, they are as much real as your own mind. I=\r\nf your \n&gt; mind is real, all gods and their stories are real. When mind is i=\r\nn various \n&gt; planes of awareness, it is possible for the mind to become awa=\r\nre of gods and \n&gt; their plays.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; In this c=\r\nontext, I want to mention a small story. \n&gt; Manish was approached by a Chri=\r\nstian missionary in UK once. He asked Manish if \n&gt; he was a Hindu. Then he =\r\ntold Manish about how Jesus Christ is the son of the \n&gt; real god, how Hindu=\r\ns are praying to unreal and wrong gods and hence doomed and \n&gt; how follower=\r\ns of Jesus Christ will go o heaven, etc. Manish asked the person, \n&gt; &quot;have =\r\nyou seen god or Jesus Christ&quot;. The person was perplexed and said no. \n&gt; Man=\r\nish asked him &quot;how do you then know that what you say is true? Are you sure=\r\n \n&gt; that you guys have understood Jesus Christ correctly and not misreprese=\r\nnting his \n&gt; teachings now?&quot; Then he mentioned calmly and confidently, &quot;Act=\r\nually, I \n&gt; have seen Jesus Christ. If you want, I can show him to you too.=\r\n Do you \n&gt; want to see him?&quot; The missionary looked at him like a crazy pers=\r\non and simply \n&gt; ran away.\n&gt;  \n&gt; See, one who is waxing eloquent about real=\r\n god, son \n&gt; of god and heaven does not even think that it is possible for =\r\nsomeone \n&gt; to see Jesus Christ. When he was told that somebody saw Jesus an=\r\nd asked if he \n&gt; was interested in seeing, he thought the other person must=\r\n be crazy and \n&gt; just ran away! He wasn&#39;t even curious to pursue further an=\r\nd see what the \n&gt; other person was upto. He simply concluded the other pers=\r\non is \n&gt; crazy!\n&gt;  \n&gt; People these days, in many religions, have no \n&gt; fait=\r\nh. Even things that are quite possible seem impossible to people of \n&gt; this=\r\n age.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Those who have seen the movie &quot;Lag=\r\ne Raho Munnabhai&quot; \n&gt; may recall how Sanjay Dutt starts getting visions of G=\r\nandhi. He sees and hears \n&gt; Gandhi while others cannot. It is concluded at =\r\nthe end that the visions of \n&gt; Gandhi were hallucinations caused by the att=\r\nachment of the stressed out mind to \n&gt; Gandhi and resulting chemical imbala=\r\nnce in the brain.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Loosely speaking, one may say that seeing gods is \n=\r\n&gt; similar. But the difference is that it is far more blissful. For another =\r\n\n&gt; big difference, see the example:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom/message/951\n&gt;  \n&gt; God can be experienced as light, as sound or as=\r\n a \n&gt; specific form similar to a human form, etc. In the above example, one=\r\n goddess \n&gt; was experienced as sound. It can certainly be a hallucination, =\r\nbut the \n&gt; interesting thing is that another person had the same experience=\r\n and he knew \n&gt; that this first person had that experience!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        =\r\n\n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I will give another similar example. One person who \n&gt; =\r\ndoes Chandi homam everyday called Lord Rama in fire after Chandi homam on a=\r\n Sri \n&gt; Rama Navami morning and did a homam to Lord Rama. In the night, he =\r\nmade some \n&gt; preparations for the next day&#39;s homam (like he would do every =\r\nnight) and laid \n&gt; out some dried coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of =\r\nprevious day&#39;s burnt \n&gt; ashes, for starting fire on the next morning. He th=\r\nen went to sleep. In the \n&gt; middle of the night, he woke up. He became awar=\r\ne of his body lying on the bed. \n&gt; He then became aware of the homa kundam =\r\nwhich was a few feet away on another \n&gt; floor. It felt like his body and ho=\r\nma kundam were linked. Then it felt like \n&gt; suddenly there was fire in homa=\r\n kundam and, at the same time, his energy rose. \n&gt; As soon as that happened=\r\n, he lost regular awareness of his body. He no \n&gt; longer felt his body or h=\r\noma kundam or energy in the body. He first felt like he \n&gt; lied with head d=\r\nown and legs up and then he became absolutely weightless. Then \n&gt; he felt l=\r\nike he was a small point, a small particle. It felt like Lord Hanuman \n&gt; pu=\r\nlled him up and he went very fast into a region filled with bright light. H=\r\ne \n&gt; was a weightless particle floating in that light along with Lord Hanum=\r\nan and \n&gt; nobody else. He, the small particle, started praying to Lord Hanu=\r\nman and \n&gt; remained in a blissful state for a while.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suddenly, from s=\r\nomewhere, a thought came about his \n&gt; body being in a bedroom and fire in h=\r\noma kundam. He wondered, &quot;was there fire in \n&gt; homa kundam really?&quot; This di=\r\nsturbed his state and his regular self-awareness \n&gt; (i.e.. being aware of s=\r\nelf as a body) returned.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The interesting thing is this. When he went =\r\nto his \n&gt; homa kundam to do homam next morning, he saw that the dried cocon=\r\nut pieces \n&gt; placed there on the ashes previous night were burnt and comple=\r\ntely black. \n&gt; It means there was indeed a fire in the homa kundam. He used=\r\n the same \n&gt; procedure everyday and placed coconut pieces on the ashes for =\r\nthe next day&#39;s \n&gt; homam before sleeping, but such a thing never happened. B=\r\nasically, there must \n&gt; have been some ember left still from the previous m=\r\norning, though he did not see \n&gt; any ember in the night and thought the fir=\r\ne went out completely. For some \n&gt; reason, that unseen ember started up a s=\r\nmall fire in the night and the coconut \n&gt; pieces caught fire. Though there =\r\nis no way to know when that happened, it is \n&gt; consistent with what he felt=\r\n during the mystical experience! After daily homam \n&gt; for a long time, a re=\r\nlationship formed between him and the homa kundam. \n&gt; Moreover, the ember l=\r\neft in homa kundam continued to be linked to his internal \n&gt; fire and devel=\r\nopments related to it still affected his internal fire and \n&gt; consciousness=\r\n!\n&gt;  \n&gt; When you do homam for a long time with the mental \n&gt; visualization =\r\nlinking that external fire to your internal fire, the relationship \n&gt; is fo=\r\nrmed over the time! What happens in that external fire does then \n&gt; affect =\r\nyour consciousness. Even if the fire goes and ember is left buried under \n&gt;=\r\n the ash, that ember is still linked to your internal fire!! When something=\r\n \n&gt; happens in your internal fire, the same thing happens to the ember too.=\r\n And vice \n&gt; versa.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Dear Utpal, one can =\r\nsee God for sure. One can \n&gt; experience God in many forms. One can see god =\r\nexternally, in a limited form like \n&gt; a human form. One can see god interna=\r\nlly, when shakti (energy of self-awareness) \n&gt; rises to a specific place an=\r\nd becomes aware of beings in that place. One can \n&gt; experience god as an al=\r\nl-pervading light or sound and experience oneself as a \n&gt; small part of tha=\r\nt light or sound. There are many ways to perceive god, but the \n&gt; bottomlin=\r\ne is that god does exist and one can perceive god. I \n&gt; cannot show you god=\r\n, but I can guarantee you that god exists and can be \n&gt; perceived in variou=\r\ns forms.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do homam everyday with sincerity. That will burn \n&gt; the bloc=\r\nking karmas. Eventually you will be able to love god more than anything, \n&gt;=\r\n including yourself. That is when the final screen will start to disappear.=\r\n \n&gt; Nothing can be a substitute for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best \n&gt; regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n\n\n"}}
