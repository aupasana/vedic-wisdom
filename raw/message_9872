Instead of explicitly admitting a body (whethe=\r\nr it is subtle or gross) that survives upon death, haven&#39;t you just created=\r\n an \nimplicit body bound to your concept of a soul?&gt;&gt;\n\nI am not sure that I=\r\n understood your question correctly. \n\n\nKarma &quot;attaches&quot; itself by setting =\r\ncertain preconditions/circumstances based on the desires of the soul and le=\r\nssons the egosense must learn for manifesting the soul. This process is tak=\r\nen care of by Nature&#39;s laws. These two - desire and need - are slightly dif=\r\nferent. At the moment of death the soul has a specific ability to internali=\r\nze and project what it needs/wants to experience in the next birth. That ge=\r\nts set firmly. That counts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reaction =\r\nprocess of actions performed is the need or the consequence to be faced in =\r\norder that the egosense can learn to be more responsible in its actions.. A=\r\nnd, here is the catch in the theory of Karma that I believe in, the reactio=\r\nn process again is exact and divided into a reaction to the body or to the =\r\nmind or to the life based on the instrument which was used to perform/engag=\r\ne in a specific karma. Now since our ego-sense will identify with these to =\r\nhold them together, so the\n egosense will experience the reaction. We mostl=\r\ny live from our egosense. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much dee=\r\nper. Now assuming suddenly that the individual in the next birth has a tota=\r\nl spiritual transformation and is able to manifest the soul and live life f=\r\nrom it, the reactions may not come or if they do may be highly reduced in n=\r\nature such as not to be of any real consequences. When the soul starts gove=\r\nrning an individual instead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an in=\r\ndividual becomes different from others. \n\n\nIn another model of reality, it =\r\nis the karana sharir will hold the seeds of the karma. which is never destr=\r\noyed. But the karana sharir is very different from the normal mind or life =\r\nor body. It is more like a super subtle background process in all individua=\r\nls. To be able to reach consciousness the karana sharir, is a very very hig=\r\nh spiritual achievement. Our karmas are mostly and almost always in the rea=\r\nlm of body, life and mind. Karana is way beyond this. A typal repository of=\r\n various things. It is infact only when a person can experience the karana =\r\nsharir that he/she can really enter into the realm of the Great Gods. They =\r\nare Beings of this karana jagat, typal and fixed in essence, never changing=\r\n, like the individual karana sharir. Now one can logically ask, so if the k=\r\narana sharir is recording karma, is it not getting fatter? This is a proble=\r\nm of our logical mind which may not hold true in that realm. If=C2=A0 we ke=\r\nep adding jugs of water to the ocean,\n will it overflow? No. This is quite =\r\nbeyond the normal mind which is limited by its own regimented logic.\n\n\nEach=\r\n of the sharir is not only an individual&#39;s own but is also effectively and =\r\nfluidly connected to the whole world of that realm. So with the physical we=\r\n interact and live in the physical world, with the sukshma we interact and =\r\nbe a part of the sukshma jagat, same with the karan. Only difference being =\r\nthe depth, intensity and the nature of these three. The Karana is very fixe=\r\nd and supremely subtle. Like a seed. While the sthula is the maximum change=\r\nable of the three. Everything that is there in the sthula jagat is born out=\r\n of a seed from the karana. As such, nothing in the sthula can go beyond th=\r\ne potentialities held by its most fundamental essence that lies in the Kara=\r\nna. Hence great Yogis, those who can access this realm at will, can know th=\r\ne most essential nature of a thing by experiencing what a thing is in its d=\r\neepest essence in this Karana jagat, and thus get to know all its possibili=\r\nties without ever trying to explore them in the physical realm\n or the subt=\r\nle realm. Quite off limits for most of us.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in=\r\n, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee lik=\r\ne a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n\n\n\nOn Monday, 28 October 2013 11=\r\n:44 PM, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n \n=C2=A0 \nDear Naras=\r\nimha,\n\n&gt;=C2=A0Most of the past life regression therapies ... are just gimmi=\r\ncs and/or hallucinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoesn&#39;t all sadhana belong in the same bucke=\r\nt?

Everyone,\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;I just thou=\r\nght of adding some clarifications.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;First of all, when I mentione=\r\nd about the utility of techniques of &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regressi=\r\non&quot; for handling the problem of spirit attachments as well as many other pr=\r\noblems for which we do not have reasonable explanation, my assertions were =\r\nlimited to the utility part only and not beyond that. I have no knowledge a=\r\nbout whether past life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledge a=\r\nbout anything whatsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowledge=\r\n of the THAT...The Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the pro=\r\nper sense of the term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still=\r\n continue with life irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge o=\r\nr not. Though we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the ear=\r\nth but it is the other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises=\r\n=C2=A0in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in the west&quot; etc. To keep life goin=\r\ng, we keep on continuing with activities which\n helps in keeping life go on=\r\n...It is in this sense that I&#39;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Li=\r\nfe Regression&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;One should not comment about the wealth inside a=\r\n sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibilities.=\r\n When we say that the God is infinite, we just can not say that the univers=\r\ne can behave in any particular limited ways. Before anyone comments about t=\r\nhe utility of any branch of knowledge one=C2=A0must first take a sincere di=\r\np into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if=C2=A0one really=\r\n takes a sincere dip into any subject one would definitely be convinced abo=\r\nut the same.=C2=A0By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before taking =\r\na sincere dip, I just mean to say that=C2=A0by doing so one would prevent o=\r\nneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=C2=A0blind belief in religion =\r\nand religious practices=C2=A0can be termed as dogmatic but also in science =\r\nif one loses the scientific temper.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Proof of pudding is in eatin=\r\ng it, all that I can say to the persons willing to address any of their pro=\r\nblems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for=\r\n=C2=A0those who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind=\r\n.

Jaina=\r\ns used this technique of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; to reinforce renunciation in the fo=\r\nllowers.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that=C2=A0so fa=\r\nr as my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over phon=\r\ne, but however, there are so many problems which can be handled even over p=\r\nhone. To cite one example - One girl was having=C2=A0one recurrent bad horr=\r\nifying dream for past 4/5 years and she=C2=A0approached me for the treatmen=\r\nt.=C2=A0But due to my=C2=A0official engagements I was camping at a far off =\r\nplace for around 2 months.=C2=A0Her problem was getting worsened as it=C2=\r\n=A0had=C2=A0 started affecting her professional career adversely. So having=\r\n left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone. The phone =\r\nsession continued for around one and half an hour and she got relieved from=\r\n her that recurrent dream and also started improving her professional life.=\r\n Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;It all =\r\ndepends on the openness of the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome=\r\n etc. The universe is much more than what we see,what we can see and what w=\r\ne can believe to see.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Regards\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On Saturday, O=\r\nctober 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To add to the complexity of the problem, I belie=\r\nve our understanding of the reincarnation is over simplified and that cause=\r\ns more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall tho=\r\nse specific moments from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the=\r\n external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a life where there ne=\r\nver was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birt=\r\nh it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life =\r\nall get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The Buddhist=\r\ns do not believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which=\r\n is similar to our idea of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n =\r\nis very different. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that c=\r\noalesces together\n to give the impression of an individual being, which upo=\r\nn death get disintegrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. N=\r\now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation at a later date, an=\r\nd some other parts can simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce in=\r\nto a different part. =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctr=\r\nine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into=\r\n one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into another body *s=\r\nimultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in on=\r\ne person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his en=\r\nergy of body incarnating in another person and all these happening simultan=\r\neously! It fits with their philosophy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Those philosophies which believ=\r\ned in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a constan=\r\nt flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. H=\r\nence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. The final ai=\r\nm of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme=\r\n Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of any final impo=\r\nrtance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciation of life a=\r\nnd its processes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a=\r\n soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried f=\r\norward from one life to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to=\r\n assist and develop this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits a=\r\nnd uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that=\r\n this individual and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in s=\r\nome birth finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual human =\r\nvehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot th=\r\ne ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 mov=\r\ning into a state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and =\r\ninevitable aim, then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and per=\r\nform complex life-actions. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not rest=\r\nricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the ide=\r\na of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the s=\r\noul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes th=\r\ne karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and=\r\n real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have kille=\r\nd hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did no=\r\nt have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of t=\r\nhose he had killed]. Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no p=\r\nlay or no scope of play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - =\r\na mechanical give and take of energy. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Now since the soul is what r=\r\nemembers and everything else being perishable, the only indestructible link=\r\n between past life and present life, it is only the soul-moments which will=\r\n be recalled, and never a complete cinematic biography recollection. That i=\r\ns fantasizing. Now if there have been lives when the soul had little or no =\r\nfrontal role to play at all, then those are dead and gone and buried six fe=\r\net under with no trace. For Nature, those lives serve no purpose at all. \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Moreover all these are possible ONLY if and when an individual st=\r\narts living in and through the soul in a very very strong manner. That is n=\r\not easy. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I have a hundr=\r\ned lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I wi=\r\nll with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Au=\r\nrobindo\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

I am sure there too o=\r\nne can find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have v=\r\nery little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have =\r\nnever ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However=\r\n, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be o=\r\nf excellent potency for these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a =\r\nsmall child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also ref=\r\nerred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this f=\r\norm can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayam=\r\nala. This child Bhairava has been\n invoked for centuries\n by\n followers of =\r\nShakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spirits, and specially durin=\r\ng rituals\n of cremation ground. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard mantra is (there a=\r\nre many variations of this mantra too, all are good):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem =\r\nVatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;General=\r\nly, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting. And thi=\r\ns should be continued daily till such time that there is some visible relie=\r\nf. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit =\r\npossession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the =\r\nproblem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no one has that =\r\nkind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physi=\r\ncal presence in front of the victim is a must for the one trying to help.=\r\n=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl will have to do the s=\r\nadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will =\r\nfind methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreig=\r\nn land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the family visits India, t=\r\nhen I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and t=\r\nhen go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside th=\r\ne temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these two tem=\r\nples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in r=\r\nemoving any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fee for t=\r\nhe ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some specific =\r\nsamagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their r=\r\nituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure =\r\ntheir maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Hope\n this\n helps.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me ye=\r\nt/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatia=\r\nte/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste.

For there are var=\r\nious classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individua=\r\nl and some of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As s=\r\no many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theore=\r\ntically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case =\r\nor not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any=\r\n method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed th=\r\ne individual and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has =\r\nto find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to ente=\r\nr into the person.\n Sometimes it can be\n something\n as simple as spitting s=\r\nomewhere (where this being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into their ter=\r\nritory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the =\r\nmind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send t=\r\no cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no=\r\n sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It al=\r\nl depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those =\r\ntrying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover,=\r\n if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless th=\r\ne person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to seriou=\r\ns harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These things like removing possession are specialization=\r\ns. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows we=\r\nll what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would=\r\n do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know =\r\nwell how to\n handle the same too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force be=\r\nfore the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in=\r\n possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain whic=\r\nh will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried t=\r\no remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a=\r\n particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism.=\r\n But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about=\r\n the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in po=\r\nssession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim.=\r\n Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the b=\r\nody of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Ne=\r\nver trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases wher=\r\ne the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best thing to do is a) find someone\n who knows exactly how to deal with=\r\n spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not =\r\npossible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferab=\r\nly Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms=\r\n are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and t=\r\nime. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depend=\r\ns on the degree of possession.

I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear =\r\nstrange noises -  creaking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sens=\r\nitive to different energies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether some=\r\nthing divine or rather evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;=\r\nt feel good to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and eve=\r\nry night I would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I=\r\n could see them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometim=\r\nes I would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could =\r\ndefinitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashl=\r\night to see nothing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysi=\r\ns to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There=\r\n were a few more people staying at that place and everybody had severe prob=\r\nlems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I =\r\nchanted Sri Rudram at that place before going to sleep and this was the onl=\r\ny night I was able to sleep properly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back hom=\r\ne from that place I started waking up at home, feeling some strong presence=\r\n - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before =\r\nhere though); Once the sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and=\r\n I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will pro=\r\ntect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? Something that I can chan=\r\nt before going to sleep.

This process is taken care of by Natu=\r\nre&#39;s\n laws. These two - desire and need - are slightly different. At the mo=\r\nment of death the soul has a specific ability to internalize and project wh=\r\nat it needs/wants to experience in the next birth. That gets set firmly. Th=\r\nat counts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reaction process of action=\r\ns performed is the need or the consequence to be faced in order that the eg=\r\nosense can learn to be more responsible in its actions.. And, here is the c=\r\natch in the theory of Karma that I believe in, the reaction process again i=\r\ns exact and divided into a reaction to the body or to the mind or to the li=\r\nfe based on the instrument which was used to perform/engage in a specific k=\r\narma. Now since our ego-sense will identify with these to hold them togethe=\r\nr, so the egosense will experience the reaction. We mostly live from our eg=\r\nosense. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much deeper. Now assuming =\r\nsuddenly that the individual in the next birth has a total spiritual\n trans=\r\nformation and is able to manifest the soul and live life from it, the react=\r\nions may not come or if they do may be highly reduced in nature such as not=\r\n to be of any real consequences. When the soul starts governing an individu=\r\nal instead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an individual becomes =\r\ndifferent from others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-si=\r\nze: 16px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; background-col=\r\nor: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0,=\r\n 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif;=\r\n background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;In another model of re=\r\nality, it is the karana sharir will hold the seeds of the karma. which is n=\r\never destroyed. But the karana sharir is very different from the normal min=\r\nd or life or body. It is more like a super subtle background process in all=\r\n individuals. To be able to reach consciousness the karana sharir,\n is a ve=\r\nry very high spiritual achievement. Our karmas are mostly and almost always=\r\n in the realm of body, life and mind. Karana is way beyond this. A typal re=\r\npository of various things. It is infact only when a person can experience =\r\nthe karana sharir that he/she can really enter into the realm of the Great =\r\nGods. They are Beings of this karana jagat, typal and fixed in essence, nev=\r\ner changing, like the individual karana sharir. Now one can logically ask, =\r\nso if the karana sharir is recording karma, is it not getting fatter? This =\r\nis a problem of our logical mind which may not hold true in that realm. If&=\r\nnbsp; we keep adding jugs of water to the ocean, will it overflow? No. This=\r\n is quite beyond the normal mind which is limited by its own regimented log=\r\nic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-famil=\r\ny: times new roman,new york,times,serif; background-color: transparent; fon=\r\nt-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\n font-size: =\r\n16px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; background-color: =\r\ntransparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Each of the sharir is not only an individ=\r\nual&#39;s own but is also effectively and fluidly connected to the whole world =\r\nof that realm. So with the physical we interact and live in the physical wo=\r\nrld, with the sukshma we interact and be a part of the sukshma jagat, same =\r\nwith the karan. Only difference being the depth, intensity and the nature o=\r\nf these three. The Karana is very fixed and supremely subtle. Like a seed. =\r\nWhile the sthula is the maximum changeable of the three. Everything that is=\r\n there in the sthula jagat is born out of a seed from the karana. As such, =\r\nnothing in the sthula can go beyond the potentialities held by its most fun=\r\ndamental essence that lies in the Karana. Hence great Yogis, those who can =\r\naccess this realm at will, can know the most essential nature of a thing by=\r\n experiencing what a thing is in its deepest essence in\n this Karana jagat,=\r\n and thus get to know all its possibilities without ever trying to explore =\r\nthem in the physical realm or the subtle realm.

I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or no=\r\nt, in fact I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I beli=\r\neve, any knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is h=\r\nalf knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in =\r\nour this empirical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of=\r\n the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that=\r\n the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, =\r\nstill we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises&nbsp;in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun&nbsp;sets&nb=\r\nsp;in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with activit=\r\nies which helps in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I&#39;d mentio=\r\nned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;One should not comment about the wealth in=\r\nside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibil=\r\nities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just can not say that the u=\r\nniverse can behave in any particular limited ways. Before anyone comments a=\r\nbout the utility of any branch of knowledge one&nbsp;must first take a sinc=\r\nere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if&nbsp;one =\r\nreally takes a sincere dip into any subject one would definitely be convinc=\r\ned about the same.&nbsp;By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before t=\r\naking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that&nbsp;by doing so one would pre=\r\nvent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only&nbsp;blind belief in rel=\r\nigion and religious practices&nbsp;can be termed as dogmatic but also in\n s=\r\ncience if one loses the scientific temper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proof of pudding is in eating it, all that I can say t=\r\no the persons willing to address any of their problems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and =\r\n&quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for&nbsp;those who are desirous=\r\n of addressing their problems with an open mind. Those who are interested c=\r\nan read &quot; Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss&quot; to start with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;To respected Narasimha sir, I=\r\n would like to inform that these are not &quot;new age ideas&quot;.

To cite o=\r\nne example - One girl was having&nbsp;one recurrent bad horrifying dream fo=\r\nr past 4/5 years and she&nbsp;approached me for the treatment.&nbsp;But due=\r\n to my&nbsp;official engagements I was camping at a far off place for aroun=\r\nd 2 months.&nbsp;Her problem was getting worsened as it&nbsp;had&nbsp; star=\r\nted affecting her professional career adversely. So having left with no cho=\r\nice, I agreed to give her a session over phone. The phone session continued=\r\n for around one and half an hour and she got relieved from her that recurre=\r\nnt dream\n and also started improving her\n professional life. Since that day=\r\n the dream has not yet visited her again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;It all depends on the openness of the mind, the strengt=\r\nh of the desire to overcome etc. The universe is much more than what we see=\r\n,what we can see and what we can believe to see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt; &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family=\r\n:HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-s=\r\nerif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n\n &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetic=\r\na Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; On Saturday, October 26, 20=\r\n13 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; shape=3D&quot;rect&quot; ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarsh=\r\ni14@...&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n=\r\n &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    =\r\n&lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times n=\r\new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste,&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;To add to the c\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
