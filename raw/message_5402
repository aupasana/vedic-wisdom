Would that such a thing could be done, and such a trail take\np=\r\nlace,  then I for one would rather play the part of advocate on its\nbehalf =\r\nthan juror  and judge of it. That is to say that I would rather\nfight the c=\r\nause for the  plaintiff than sit in judgment of it, for\nwithout that action=\r\n there could be no  trial; and no judgment made.  And\nwhom I  wonder would =\r\nbe the advocates for its guilt and unreliability,\nor even non  existence.  =\r\nBut what is it which would be  sitting in the\ncourtroom dock?  It would  be=\r\n that entity by the first name of AS IS SO.\n\n\n\nThe prosecutors case would b=\r\ne that there is no  such thing as truth;\nwhereas my advocacy would be that =\r\nthere is nothing extant  which is not\ntrue; and that everything which exist=\r\ns IS true. The jurors position \nwould have to, by needs must, take the stan=\r\nce that some things may be\ntrue and  others may not be true, and therefore =\r\nfind out as to which was\nwhat; and if  indeed anything was true; and by the=\r\n process of the\ncourtroom digging out  whatever evidence could be found for=\r\n either.\n\n\n\nTruth, however, has a number of faces, facets.  There is that w=\r\nhich is\nfound to be true with regards to extant phenomena AS IS,  and also =\r\nthe\nvarious truths of the facts which make it so and bring it about by  way=\r\n\nof its structure and workings. Then we also have the face or facet of\nhuma=\r\nn  pronouncements upon those phenomena. Does this witness speak the\ntruth o=\r\nr not?  Then there is the face or facet of as to how much can a\nhuman being=\r\n know of what  is true and what is not true beyond the range\nand spectrum o=\r\nf human experience.  How is truth recognised as being\ntrue? This was a dial=\r\nectical process which I  myself went through at\nquite a young age. My stanc=\r\ne was that nothing would be  true, or said to\nbe true, unless it could prov=\r\ne to me that it was true. I had no  vested\ninterest in its veracity and int=\r\negrity; but simply curiosity.  But how\ncan truth prove itself in order to  =\r\njustify itself? And thence be said\nto BE SO by observers of it.\n\n\n\nIt is mo=\r\nst empathically NOT arrived at by a  democratic vote due to\nopinions and be=\r\nliefs. Let us envisage a scenario that  every human being\nwas born blind bu=\r\nt then one day a baby was born who had vision  and\ncould see. The democrati=\r\nc vote would be that it is true that there is no\nsuch thing as vision. But =\r\nthe one instant of a child with sight would\nprove that  judgment to be wron=\r\ng, and even though it were true that the\nrest if them were  blind and witho=\r\nut sight. But how would the sighted\nchild prove to the others  that he or s=\r\nhe had vision? That would be a\nvery difficult undertaking. But that  child =\r\nwould have the fact of sight\nas its witness and proof, whereas the  consens=\r\nus would have no poof of\nit not being the case; other than their own  blind=\r\nness. Could a thousand\nblind people prove that one claiming sight could not=\r\n  see?  Another\nfacet to this of course is  that the sighted child would no=\r\nt be made\nblind by their insistence that he or  she could not see. And even=\r\n if the\ncase was found it their favour. The child  would still have vision,=\r\n\nwhether they said so or not. Therefore their judgement  and\npronunciation =\r\nis irrelevant to the truth of it. The child can see, and\nthat  is true. AS =\r\nIS SO.\n\n\n\nBy what criteria then can a thing be said to be  true? Insofar as=\r\n I\nfound out at least, then my own criteria was in that of  throwing\neveryt=\r\nhing at it to see what could not be smashed and destroyed in so \ndoing. By =\r\nthis I do not mean throwing sticks and stones at it but simply\nthat of  arg=\r\nument. It was not a case of my finding things so bad that I\ndid not wish to=\r\n  accept them as being true, for they were easy to\naccept;  but rather that=\r\n I found such things to be so  good that I found\nit difficult to accept the=\r\nm as being true (it is all in the  book). But\nwhy should this be the case I=\r\n wonder. Why is it easier to accept not \ngood things as being so and yet no=\r\nt its opposite pole?  I don&#39;t\nreally know why, but maybe it has  something =\r\nto do with conditioning and\nnurture when young.\n\n\n\nPut it to the test today=\r\n for yourself. Tell a  thousand folks about\nsomething horrible which has ha=\r\nppened to you, and then go  elsewhere and\ntell a thousand folks something e=\r\nxtremely good which has happened  to\nyou. And watch the feed-back. In the c=\r\nase of the former it will be\nsympathy  and aid; for the large part. But in =\r\nthe case of the latter\nthen for the large  part it will be hostility and so=\r\nur grapes. Why?\n\n\n\nTime and time again in society, and generation  after ge=\r\nneration, we\ncome up against the comment, `I am seeking truth&#39;. But the \ntr=\r\nuth and truths of what? Ask them that question, and see what they say.\nAs f=\r\nor  myself then I certainly did not go in search of truth when\nyoung, but r=\r\nather  that which was not true. Thus an attack on the\nnegative in order to =\r\nsee what  could not be destroyed in that battle.\nFind out as to what is NOT=\r\n SO in order to  find out what IS SO. That\nprocess, which took twenty years=\r\n, is far too long and  involved for an\nemail, or even a book. So, I offer i=\r\nt instead as merely food for \nthought. Is not a lie truly a lie?  Is  not a=\r\n mistake truly not a\nmistake?  Does  anything exist, at any level of existe=\r\nnce, which is not\nso?  Find me something which does not  exist. Even now, a=\r\nfter all these\nyears, I  still demand proof of every phenomenon which I enc=\r\nounter, and\nthe claims which  people make about phenomena; and never ever, =\r\nfor as\nlong as I exist, would I  ever take something as being true on faith=\r\n.\nFaith has nothing to offer me.  Albeit that it seems to make life easy\nfo=\r\nr  some.\n\n\n\nTo what degree this or that person has found  things, or even s=\r\nearched\nfor things, then that is another question. As for me  than I am not=\r\n in\nlove with truth. I just admire it; and would uphold it.  If Johnny sits=\r\n\nin a dark room all his life  and complaining that there is nothing to\nfind=\r\n, then, well, what can one expect.
