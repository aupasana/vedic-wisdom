He that dwells immovably in that supreme state, free from d=\r\nelusion,\nis the =E2=80=98Awakened One=E2=80=99 [Prabuddha].\n\nThe significan=\r\nce of the last-mentioned term will appear when we come to\nstudy the contras=\r\nt between the three states of life in bondage with the\nso-called fourth sta=\r\nte, which is beyond. The natural state is so called\nbecause it transcends t=\r\nhe three states, namely waking, dream and deep sleep.\n\nThe term =E2=80=98Pr=\r\nabuddha=E2=80=99 is the same as the term =E2=80=98Buddha=E2=80=99, which me=\r\nans =E2=80=98a sage=E2=80=99.\n\nThe physical body may and often does survive=\r\n the attainment of the supreme\nstate. How this can be is explained next.\n\n2=\r\n0 The sage who has attained the supreme state is free, even though his body=\r\n\nsurvives, [because] he does not look upon it as himself nor as belonging t=\r\no\nhimself. Therefore, that sage is really bodiless.\n\nBeing embodied or bodi=\r\nless is due to the attachment or non-attachment to the\nbody. In ignorance t=\r\nhere is the sense of =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 or of =E2=80=98This bo=\r\ndy is\nmine=E2=80=99, that is, the body is either =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 or =E2=\r\n=80=98mine=E2=80=99. When this attachment\nceases, bondage is at an end.This=\r\n is an intricate point, which will become\nclearer as we proceed. This survi=\r\nval of the body of the sage is very\nimportant because without it he cannot =\r\nfulfil his mission, which is to\nuplift his disciples.\n\n=E2=80=98Is that sta=\r\nte desirable?=E2=80=99 is a question that is asked. The answer to it is\nnow=\r\n given.\n\n21 The mind-free state stated above is itself complete and endless=\r\n\nhappiness, since it is the mind itself that covers up [or overpowers] the\n=\r\n[natural] happiness [of the real Self] and unfolds suffering for every\ncrea=\r\nture.\n\nThe desire for happiness, says Bhagavan, is natural, but it is not t=\r\no be had\nin its perfection in the world, where the mind is dominant, but on=\r\nly in the\nmind-free state. It should be noted that happiness, which is natu=\r\nral to the\nreal Self, is not to be confounded with pleasure, which belongs =\r\nto the\nworld-order, along with its opposite, suffering. True happiness is j=\r\nust\npeace.\n\nThe qualifications of the aspirant for the supreme state are ne=\r\nxt stated.\n\n22 The lover of deliverance who is straightforward, pure, truth=\r\nful,\nunassuming, valiant, profoundly devoted to the Guru, and endowed with =\r\nthe\nsix perfections, namely serenity of mind and the rest, will attain that=\r\n\nsupreme state without delay.\n\nThe unqualified one will be hindered in his =\r\nefforts to attain that state by\nthe defects of character that are the oppos=\r\nites of those specified here. The\nqualified one will succeed in reaching th=\r\nat state soon and with great ease.\nDefects arise from the ego, while the qu=\r\nalifications arise by the weakening\nof the ego.\n\nThe term =E2=80=98valiant=\r\n=E2=80=99 used in the previous verse is explained next.\n\n23 The =E2=80=98va=\r\nlour=E2=80=99 enjoined here is just the concentration of the mind that the\n=\r\naspirant [sadhaka] achieves by restraining its vagaries in the pursuit of\nt=\r\nhe quest of the Self, since no other valour is needed here.\n\nThe word =E2=\r\n=80=98dhira=E2=80=99 in Sanksrit consists of the two letters =E2=80=98dhi=\r\n=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98ra=E2=80=99. The\nformer means the series of thoughts=\r\n that arise and pass through the mind.\nThe latter is taken as a symbol for =\r\n=E2=80=98raksha=E2=80=99 (rakshanam), meaning control.\nThrough this one ach=\r\nieves the mental strength necessary for pursuing the\nquest of the Self.\n\nDe=\r\nvotion to the Guru is another qualification that needs to be clarified. In\n=\r\nthe first place, there is the question, =E2=80=98What sort of person should=\r\n be taken\nas the Guru?=E2=80=99 This question is first answered.\n\n24 The as=\r\npirant to deliverance must resort to a sage as his Guru, that is,\none who h=\r\nas awakened from the sleep of ignorance of the Self and is\ntherefore free f=\r\nrom delusion. How can one who has not awakened from that\nsleep awaken other=\r\ns who are in the same state?\n\nThis will be self-evident. Here there is a pu=\r\nn on the word =E2=80=98prabuddha=E2=80=99,\nwhich has two meanings: it means=\r\n =E2=80=98a sage=E2=80=99 and it also means =E2=80=98one who has\nawakened=\r\n=E2=80=99. Awakening implies a sleep from which one has to awake. Here the\n=\r\nsleep is the ignorance of the Self in which the dream of worldly living goe=\r\ns\non. This description of =E2=80=98samsara=E2=80=99 as a dream in the sleep=\r\n of ignorance\noccurs in the ancient lore.\n\nThe nature of the devotion to th=\r\ne Guru is explained next.\n\n25 Only that devotion to the Guru is good which =\r\nis rendered to a sage-Guru,\nand which regards him as identical with God. On=\r\nly by such devotion does one\nattain freedom from delusion. Truly the sage i=\r\ns not other than God.\n\nThe sage who is accepted as one=E2=80=99s Guru must =\r\nnot be regarded as just a human\nbeing, a person, but as an incarnation of G=\r\nod Himself, because that is the\ntruth of the sage, and because, if the Guru=\r\n be so regarded, the goal will be\nreached soon. This point will be explaine=\r\nd in detail later.\n\nThe six-fold endowment mentioned in verse 22 is next en=\r\numerated.\n\n26 Mental calm, sense-control, withdrawal from worldly pursuits,=\r\n fortitude,\nfaith in the words of Guru, steadiness in sadhana =E2=80=93 the=\r\nse six are prescribed\nfor the aspirant, and through these his mind will rem=\r\nain firm in the quest.\n\nThese will come and ripen if the aspirant persists =\r\nin efforts to make the\nquest. Faith, of course, must be present from the ve=\r\nry beginning. Faith\nshould be understood as adherence to conclusions arrive=\r\nd at rationally, not\nblindly.\n\nAll items of this endowment, especially the =\r\nfirst two, depend upon the\npractice of abstemiousness in eating, a discipli=\r\nne that is usually\nneglected. Bhagavan has said that eating the minimum of =\r\nwholesome food =E2=80=93\nfood of the sattvika quality =E2=80=93 is necessar=\r\ny for sadhakas. The policy of\nliving to eat was expressly condemned by him =\r\nin a Tamil verse, of which the\nfollowing is a rendering in Sanskrit. The st=\r\nomach is represented as accusing\nthe eater, the soul, as a violator of the =\r\nlaw of fairness to the digestive\norgans:\n\nYou do not allow me, your stomach=\r\n, rest for even one half hour; nor do you\nrefrain from eating for even half=\r\n an hour at a time; you do not care to take\nnote of the suffering you infli=\r\nct on me, which is beyond bearing.\n[Understand] O Unrighteous man! It will =\r\nbe hereafter impossible for me to\nlive with you in this body.\n\nEating just =\r\nenough for health is the means of maintaining vital economy, as\nmuch for th=\r\ne spiritual life as for the worldly. Health of mind is very much\ndependent =\r\nupon the health of the body as a whole, and especially of the\nnervous syste=\r\nm. It must be noted that in the West gluttony is listed as the\nworst of the=\r\n seven deadly sins. Self-control will be easy for him who eats\nrighteously,=\r\n not for him who is wanting in fairness to the stomach. A\ncontented and che=\r\nerful mind should be maintained all the time, and this will\nbe possible onl=\r\ny by respecting the divinely ordained laws of health, for\nwhich right eatin=\r\ng is by no means the least important.\n\nThe truth of the natural state, to b=\r\ne won by the pursuit of suitable\nsadhana, is then indicated, not directly, =\r\nbut indirectly, as follows. The\nnext verse, which is introductory, explains=\r\n that no direct description of\nthe state is possible.\n\n27 That state is kno=\r\nwable only by actual experience of the truth of the real\nSelf. It is indica=\r\nted [in the sacred lore] only by negations, =E2=80=98Not so, not\nso=E2=80=\r\n=99. It is not described by speech or thought of by the mind. [Even] the\npr=\r\nimal Guru [Dakshinamurti] taught it only by silence.\n\nThe primal Guru was G=\r\nod Himself as Dakshinamurti, who taught the four sages,\nSanaka and the rest=\r\n, by silence alone. The real Self, Bhagavan has\nrepeatedly said, is the ete=\r\nrnal subject, who cannot be objectified, being\nthe Self of him that seeks t=\r\no objectify him.\n\nThis supreme state is therefore indirectly taught by cont=\r\nrasting it with the\nthree states of life that are experienced in the life o=\r\nf the world, while\nsubject to ignorance.\n\n28 Since that state is changeless=\r\n, worldless and calm, beyond the states of\nwaking and the rest, it is calle=\r\nd the fourth state. Such is the teaching of\nthe Mandukya Upanishad.\n\nThis i=\r\ns the shortest of all the chief Upanishads, but in it is given the\nessence =\r\nof all of them. Life in the world is a continuous cycle, consisting\nof thre=\r\ne distinct states, namely, waking, dream and deep sleep.\n\nThese three state=\r\ns are a vicious circle, because all three are sustained by\nan underlying co=\r\nmmon cause, the nature of which is next explained.\n\n29 For every creature t=\r\nhere are three states: waking, dream and deep sleep.\nSustaining these three=\r\n there is another sleep, the sleep of ignorance.\n\nThis ignorance of the Sel=\r\nf is the common factor in all the three, without\nwhich the vicious circle o=\r\nf the three states would come to an end. This\nmeans that for the one who ha=\r\ns transcended the ignorance, the three states\ndo not exist. This basic slee=\r\np explains another fact, which will be stated\nlater.\n\n30 The whole of this =\r\nworld is contained within this trinity of states. The\nreality of the fourth=\r\n state, which is worldless, transcends these three\nstates.\n\nThis is why the=\r\nre is no peace in the realm of ignorance. Peace prevails only\nin the transc=\r\nendental state, which is the true state of the Self.\n\nAmong the three state=\r\ns there is a distinction, which is stated next.\n\n31 Deep sleep is just drea=\r\nmless sleep; the other two are sleep with dream.\nThe fourth state, being wi=\r\nthout sleep and without dream, is the abode of\ndeliverance.\n\nThus it is sta=\r\nted that, because of the underlying sleep of ignorance, the\nso-called wakin=\r\ng is really a state of dream. This will be elaborated later,\nwhen the quest=\r\nion of the reality of the world is discussed.\n\nThe fourth state is in perfe=\r\nct contrast with the other three, being\nsleepless, dreamless and therefore =\r\nworldless. It is the abode of freedom.\nFreedom cannot be had in any of the =\r\nthree states. This is one of the\nfundamentals of the transcendental metaphy=\r\nsics as taught by the sages.\n\n32 If that mind-free consciousness, which is =\r\nat the meeting point of deep\nsleep and waking, somehow becomes continuous, =\r\nthen the state that then dawns\nis declared by the sages to be the state of =\r\ndeliverance.\n\nConsciousness without thoughts, called pure consciousness, tr=\r\nanscends time,\nand hence it persists as the substratum even when the three =\r\nstates prevail. At\nthe minute point of time when one of these two states gi=\r\nves place to the\nother, consciousness is without thought. If this transitio=\r\nnal state is\nsufficiently prolonged, then deliverance dawns say these sages=\r\n. In the Yoga\nVasishta there is the following verse: =E2=80=98If one medita=\r\ntes keenly on the state\nthat prevails at the end of waking and just before =\r\nsleep, one attains\nunending happiness.=E2=80=99\n\nThe world-appearance, ther=\r\nefore, is just a dream. In fact, it often assumes\nthe quality of a nightmar=\r\ne. It arises in the sleep that is ignorance of the\nreal Self. This is state=\r\nd next.\n\n33 Those that are overwhelmed by this sleep of ignorance are the s=\r\neers of\nthis bad dream, the world. And so long as this ignorance does not c=\r\nease by\nthe right awareness of the real Self, the souls have to wander in t=\r\nhis maze\nof the three states.\n\nThe only way to escape from this bad dream i=\r\ns to become fully aware of the\nreal Self. He may be called, for the moment,=\r\n =E2=80=98 the dweller in the supreme\nstate=E2=80=99.\n\nThus it happens that=\r\n all creatures =E2=80=93 both men and the so-called inferior\ncreatures =E2=\r\n=80=93 are really asleep all the time, alternately dreaming and\nsleeping dr=\r\neamlessly. Deep, dreamless sleep is just like an oasis in a\ndesert route.\n\n=\r\n34 Thus, every creature is asleep: none in this world of souls is awake.\nOn=\r\nly the sage, who, being firmly established in the fourth state, having\ntran=\r\nscended the three states, and who is free from ignorance, is awake.\n\nBeing =\r\nawake here means being aware of the real Self as it really is. Because\nof t=\r\nhis awakening, he [the sage] is no more troubled by the dream called the\nwo=\r\nrld.\n\nThis uniqueness of the sage is explained in the next two verses.\n\nSou=\r\nrce: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=\r\n=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae26eee3049ea7178a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n19 That state, in which one remains immovable in one=E2=80=99s t=\r\nrue nature [as the real Self] is [itself called] right awareness, deliveran=\r\nce and the natural state.

The natural state is so called becau=\r\nse it transcends the three states, namely waking, dream and deep sleep.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;The term =E2=80=98Prabuddha=E2=80=99 is the same as the term =E2=80=\r\n=98Buddha=E2=80=99, which means =E2=80=98a sage=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The physic=\r\nal body may and often does survive the attainment of the supreme state. How=\r\n this can be is explained next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;20 The sage who has attained the sup=\r\nreme state is free, even though his body survives, [because] he does not lo=\r\nok upon it as himself nor as belonging to himself. Therefore, that sage is =\r\nreally bodiless.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Being embodied or bodiless is due to the attachme=\r\nnt or non-attachment to the body.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In =\r\nignorance there is the sense of =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 or of =E2=\r\n=80=98This body is mine=E2=80=99, that is, the body is either =E2=80=98I=E2=\r\n=80=99 or =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99. When this attachment ceases, bondage is a=\r\nt an end.&lt;/span&gt;This is an intricate point, which will become clearer as we=\r\n proceed. This survival of the body of the sage is very important because w=\r\nithout it he cannot fulfil his mission, which is to uplift his disciples.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98Is that state desirable?=E2=80=99 is a question that is as=\r\nked. The answer to it is now given.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;21 The mind-free state stated ab=\r\nove is itself complete and endless happiness, since it is the mind itself t=\r\nhat covers up [or overpowers] the [natural] happiness [of the real Self] an=\r\nd unfolds suffering for every creature.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold&quot;&gt;The desire for happiness, says Bhagavan, is natural, but it is not t=\r\no be had in its perfection in the world, where the mind is dominant, but on=\r\nly in the mind-free state. It should be noted that happiness, which is natu=\r\nral to the real Self, is not to be confounded with pleasure, which belongs =\r\nto the world-order, along with its opposite, suffering. True happiness is j=\r\nust peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The qualifications of the aspirant for the supre=\r\nme state are next stated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;22 The lover of deliverance who is straigh=\r\ntforward, pure, truthful, unassuming, valiant, profoundly devoted to the Gu=\r\nru, and endowed with the six perfections, namely serenity of mind and the r=\r\nest, will attain that supreme state without delay.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The unqualified=\r\n one will be hindered in his efforts to attain that state by the defects of=\r\n character that are the opposites of those specified here. The qualified on=\r\ne will succeed in reaching that state soon and with great ease. Defects ari=\r\nse from the ego, while the qualifications arise by the weakening of the ego=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The term =E2=80=98valiant=E2=80=99 used in the previous verse is=\r\n explained next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;23 The =E2=80=98valour=E2=80=99 enjoined here is ju=\r\nst the concentration of the mind that the aspirant [sadhaka] achieves by re=\r\nstraining its vagaries in the pursuit of the quest of the Self, since no ot=\r\nher valour is needed here.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The word =E2=80=98dhira=E2=80=99 in San=\r\nksrit consists of the two letters =E2=80=98dhi=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98ra=E2=\r\n=80=99. The former means the series of thoughts that arise and pass through=\r\n the mind. The latter is taken as a symbol for =E2=80=98raksha=E2=80=99 (ra=\r\nkshanam), meaning control. Through this one achieves the mental strength ne=\r\ncessary for pursuing the quest of the Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Devotion to the Guru i=\r\ns another qualification that needs to be clarified. In the first place, the=\r\nre is the question, =E2=80=98What sort of person should be taken as the Gur=\r\nu?=E2=80=99 This question is first answered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;24 The aspirant to deli=\r\nverance must resort to a sage as his Guru, that is, one who has awakened fr=\r\nom the sleep of ignorance of the Self and is therefore free from delusion. =\r\nHow can one who has not awakened from that sleep awaken others who are in t=\r\nhe same state?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This will be self-evident. Here there is a pun on t=\r\nhe word =E2=80=98prabuddha=E2=80=99, which has two meanings: it means =E2=\r\n=80=98a sage=E2=80=99 and it also means =E2=80=98one who has awakened=E2=80=\r\n=99. Awakening implies a sleep from which one has to awake. Here the sleep =\r\nis the ignorance of the Self in which the dream of worldly living goes on. =\r\nThis description of =E2=80=98samsara=E2=80=99 as a dream in the sleep of ig=\r\nnorance occurs in the ancient lore.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The nature of the devotion to =\r\nthe Guru is explained next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;25 Only that devotion to the Guru is goo=\r\nd which is rendered to a sage-Guru, and which regards him as identical with=\r\n God. Only by such devotion does one attain freedom from delusion. Truly th=\r\ne sage is not other than God.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The sage who is accepted as one=E2=\r\n=80=99s Guru must not be regarded as just a human being, a person, but as a=\r\nn incarnation of God Himself, because that is the truth of the sage, and be=\r\ncause, if the Guru be so regarded, the goal will be reached soon. This poin=\r\nt will be explained in detail later.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The six-fold endowment mentio=\r\nned in verse 22 is next enumerated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;26 Mental calm, sense-control, w=\r\nithdrawal from worldly pursuits, fortitude, faith in the words of Guru, ste=\r\nadiness in sadhana =E2=80=93 these six are prescribed for the aspirant, and=\r\n through these his mind will remain firm in the quest.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;These will =\r\ncome and ripen if the aspirant persists in efforts to make the quest. Faith=\r\n, of course, must be present from the very beginning. Faith should be under=\r\nstood as adherence to conclusions arrived at rationally, not blindly.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;All items of this endowment, especially the first two, depend upon the =\r\npractice of abstemiousness in eating, a discipline that is usually neglecte=\r\nd. Bhagavan has said that eating the minimum of wholesome food =E2=80=93 fo=\r\nod of the sattvika quality =E2=80=93 is necessary for sadhakas. The policy =\r\nof living to eat was expressly condemned by him in a Tamil verse, of which =\r\nthe following is a rendering in Sanskrit. The stomach is represented as acc=\r\nusing the eater, the soul, as a violator of the law of fairness to the dige=\r\nstive organs:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;You do not allow me, your stomach, rest for even one=\r\n half hour; nor do you refrain from eating for even half an hour at a time;=\r\n you do not care to take note of the suffering you inflict on me, which is =\r\nbeyond bearing. [Understand] O Unrighteous man! It will be hereafter imposs=\r\nible for me to live with you in this body.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Eating just enough for =\r\nhealth is the means of maintaining vital economy, as much for the spiritual=\r\n life as for the worldly. Health of mind is very much dependent upon the he=\r\nalth of the body as a whole, and especially of the nervous system. It must =\r\nbe noted that in the West gluttony is listed as the worst of the seven dead=\r\nly sins. Self-control will be easy for him who eats righteously, not for hi=\r\nm who is wanting in fairness to the stomach. A contented and cheerful mind =\r\nshould be maintained all the time, and this will be possible only by respec=\r\nting the divinely ordained laws of health, for which right eating is by no =\r\nmeans the least important.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The truth of the natural state, to be w=\r\non by the pursuit of suitable sadhana, is then indicated, not directly, but=\r\n indirectly, as follows. The next verse, which is introductory, explains th=\r\nat no direct description of the state is possible.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;27 That state is knowable only by actual experience of th=\r\ne truth of the real Self. It is indicated [in the sacred lore] only by nega=\r\ntions, =E2=80=98Not so, not so=E2=80=99. It is not described by speech or t=\r\nhought of by the mind. [Even] the primal Guru [Dakshinamurti] taught it onl=\r\ny by silence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The primal Guru was God Himself as Dakshinamu=\r\nrti, who taught the four sages, Sanaka and the rest, by silence alone. The =\r\nreal Self, Bhagavan has repeatedly said, is the eternal subject, who cannot=\r\n be objectified, being the Self of him that seeks to objectify him.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;This supreme state is therefore indirectly taught by contrasting it with =\r\nthe three states of life that are experienced in the life of the world, whi=\r\nle subject to ignorance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;28 Since that state is changeless, worldles=\r\ns and calm, beyond the states of waking and the rest, it is called the four=\r\nth state. Such is the teaching of the Mandukya Upanishad.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is =\r\nthe shortest of all the chief Upanishads, but in it is given the essence of=\r\n all of them. Life in the world is a continuous cycle, consisting of three =\r\ndistinct states, namely, waking, dream and deep sleep.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThese three=\r\n states are a vicious circle, because all three are sustained by an underly=\r\ning common cause, the nature of which is next explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;29 For ever=\r\ny creature there are three states: waking, dream and deep sleep. Sustaining=\r\n these three there is another sleep, the sleep of ignorance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This =\r\nignorance of the Self is the common factor in all the three, without which =\r\nthe vicious circle of the three states would come to an end. This means tha=\r\nt for the one who has transcended the ignorance, the three states do not ex=\r\nist. This basic sleep explains another fact, which will be stated later.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;30 The whole of this world is contained within this trinity of state=\r\ns. The reality of the fourth state, which is worldless, transcends these th=\r\nree states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is why there is no peace in the realm of ignorance.=\r\n Peace prevails only in the transcendental state, which is the true state o=\r\nf the Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Among the three states there is a distinction, which i=\r\ns stated next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;31 Deep sleep is jus=\r\nt dreamless sleep; the other two are sleep with dream. The fourth state, be=\r\ning without sleep and without dream, is the abode of deliverance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Thus it is stated that, because of the underlying sleep of ignorance=\r\n, the so-called waking is really a state of dream. This will be elaborated =\r\nlater, when the question of the reality of the world is discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\nThe fourth state is in perfect contrast with the other three, being sleepl=\r\ness, dreamless and therefore worldless. It is the abode of freedom. Freedom=\r\n cannot be had in any of the three states. This is one of the fundamentals =\r\nof the transcendental metaphysics as taught by the sages.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;32 If th=\r\nat mind-free consciousness, which is at the meeting point of deep sleep and=\r\n waking, somehow becomes continuous, then the state that then dawns is decl=\r\nared by the sages to be the state of deliverance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Consciousness without thoughts, called pure consciousness, t=\r\nranscends time, and hence it persists as the substratum even when the three=\r\n states prevail.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0At the minute point of time when one of these =\r\ntwo states gives place to the other, consciousness is without thought. If t=\r\nhis transitional state is sufficiently prolonged, then deliverance dawns sa=\r\ny these sages.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In the Yoga Vasishta t=\r\nhere is the following verse: =E2=80=98If one meditates keenly on the state =\r\nthat prevails at the end of waking and just before sleep, one attains unend=\r\ning happiness.=E2=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The world-appearance, therefore, is=\r\n just a dream. In fact, it often assumes the quality of a nightmare. It ari=\r\nses in the sleep that is ignorance of the real Self. This is stated next.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;33 Those that are overwhelmed by this sleep of ignorance are the seer=\r\ns of this bad dream, the world. And so long as this ignorance does not ceas=\r\ne by the right awareness of the real Self, the souls have to wander in this=\r\n maze of the three states.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The only way to escape from this bad dr=\r\neam is to become fully aware of the real Self. He may be called, for the mo=\r\nment, =E2=80=98 the dweller in the supreme state=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus it h=\r\nappens that all creatures =E2=80=93 both men and the so-called inferior cre=\r\natures =E2=80=93 are really asleep all the time, alternately dreaming and s=\r\nleeping dreamlessly. Deep, dreamless sleep is just like an oasis in a deser=\r\nt route.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;34 Thus, every creature =\r\nis asleep: none in this world of souls is awake. Only the sage, who, being =\r\nfirmly established in the fourth state, having transcended the three states=\r\n, and who is free from ignorance, is awake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Being awake her=\r\ne means being aware of the real Self as it really is. Because of this awake=\r\nning, he [the sage] is no more troubled by the dream called the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;This uniqueness of the sage is explained in the next two verses.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.dav=\r\nidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodm=\r\nan.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;ma=\r\nrgin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;=\r\nmargin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=\r\n=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae26eee3049ea7178a--\r\n\n"}}
