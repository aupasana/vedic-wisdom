Yes t=\r\nhere are short and supershort procedures but what I notice is that I spend =\r\nmore time in preparing for Homam, than the actual homam itself. Is it the s=\r\name with everyone else? Arranging for Alumium Wrap around the homa kundam, =\r\nand within the fire-place, and outside of it, Melting the ghee, arranging f=\r\nor water, Akshatas, flowers, incense sticks, camphor, oil lamp, wicks, fire=\r\nwood, dry coconuts, Havan Samagri, water, preparation of Kalasam etc., take=\r\ns at least about 15 minutes prior to starting of the homam. Also, preparati=\r\non of maha naivedyam (either ravva kesari or sweet rice pudding [payasam]),=\r\n which I normally do, takes another 20 minutes at the minimum. For these re=\r\nasons, I am unable to do it other than weekends. So, generally I end up doi=\r\nng a Ganapati homam on Sundays. Any ideas as to how to make it faster for a=\r\n daily ganapati homam? Also I generally make offerings with Gayatri Mantra =\r\nin every homam, I want to know if there is an exclusive Gayatri Homam with =\r\nGayatri being the main deity, with prana pratishtapana mantra etc., or can =\r\nwe just do the  Gayatri Avahana (that we do in Sandhyavandanam) at the homa=\r\nm? The reason I ask this is, I sometimes do Purascharanas of Gayatri (curre=\r\nntly doing one), usually about 24,000 over a period of 40 days and then off=\r\ner 10% of the same in Homam. Those 2,400 I make an offering into the fire w=\r\nithout any exclusive prana pratishtapana of Gayatri, but generally as part =\r\nof Ganapati Homam itself, because I don&#39;t know any other way to do this. An=\r\ny advice?\n\nAlso as I understand Adi Sankaracharya has established six order=\r\ns of religion (Ganapatyas, Koumararas, Vaishnava, Shaiva, ShAktEya and Sour=\r\na orders). I wonder if there is a homam for Kumara Swamy. For the rest, the=\r\nre is one, if I am right, although I am not sure if there is one exclusivel=\r\ny for Lord Surya. I heard of Navagraha homams though. \n\nAlso Kumaraswamy is=\r\n not part of Pachayatana pooja, which is also established by the Jagat Guru=\r\n. Why?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
