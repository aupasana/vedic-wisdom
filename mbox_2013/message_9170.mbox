Namaste
Here I would like to tell you one Shiva Saivite Nayanar devotee of Shiva in
the year 1100 AD by name Poosalar built a temple for Shiva in his heart and
the king of that time for that area also built similar temple physically.
Both fixed the date for consecration of temples on the same day. Shiva in
the dream of king told him that he would be attending the function of his
devotee who had built a temple for him than built by the King.
Later King realised the power of mental/Manasa Pooja and worshipped the
devotee and gave him lot of land and money to take care of temple built by
king.
I think this will give you the answer you expected in the forum

Namaste,
 
Correct, if the mind involved is highly purified and has a good level of
shama and dama (equanimity and self-restraint).
 
When we make offerings externally (e.g. to an idol), mind is distracted by
so many external things and unlikely to be fully focused on the act. When a
highly purified mind makes offerings internally, it is possible for it to be
highly focused on the visualization. That can indeed be more effective.
 
However, until one reaches such a stage, it is quite useful (and often
unavoidable) to engage in external and material offerings. A mind that is
unfocused and distracted needs some objects and actions to anchor it and
make it somewhat focused and disciplined.

 
Best regards,
Narasimha

	Namaste to All,
	
	I have recently heard it said that offerings made 'mentally' can be
superior/more effective in manifesting desired results than actual material
offerings. Any thoughts or opinions on this?
	
	Peace!
