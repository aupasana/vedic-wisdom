Dear Priyank and Ranga,

The mantra given in the "knowityourway" link has s=
ome simple errors. I
don't know this mantra, and don't want to attempt any =
correction.

I checked a reference book for the Kerala Namboothiri traditio=
n, and saw a
"Lakshmi Vinayaka" mantra. It is very similar to the standard =
mahaganapati
mantra (it has the same number of syllables, but includes only=
 the lakshmi
and ganesha bijas). It is given below:

o=E1=B9=81 =C5=9Br=C4=
=AB=E1=B9=81 ga=E1=B9=81 saumy=C4=81ya ga=E1=B9=87apataye varavarada sarvaj=
anam me va=C5=9Bam =C4=81naya sv=C4=81h=C4=81
..

sasneham,

   ajit

That was my doubt, =
too. One version is already in the manual by Shree PVR and there are other =
