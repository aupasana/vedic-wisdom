Dear Aparna ji, namaste

Please forgive me for intruding in this conversati=
on. Ironically, when
reading your link about Papa Ramdas, I remembered that=
 the Rama Taraka
mantra "om sri ram jai ram jai jai ram" might be of help i=
n controlling
your migraine problem when chanted 108 times morning and even=
ing. Have you
tried this remedy?

best regards
Hari

Dear all,<br>
<br>
I am coming to the end of my purascharana practice of th=
e ashtakshari mantra-
will finish next week on Oct 9. I thought I would sha=
re some thoughts with you
about my perception of the effects of my practice=
.<br>
<br>
I would say the biggest effect (that I can perceive) is on my ph=
ysical self. In
simple terms, I find that if I flout Nature's rules, sp=
ecifically regarding
proper sleep and food, without fail I get an awful mig=
raine. This never used to
be the case. I have had dreadful working hours in=
 the past (before starting the
purascharana) and could get away with skippi=
ng meals and sleeping erratically
if work demanded it. <br>
<br>
However I =
simply cannot do this anymore. I have had a ridiculous number of
migraines =
in the last two years, which coincides with starting the purascharana
two y=
ears ago. It may just be happening because I'm getting older, but befor=
e I
started this practice, I could generally get away with going to bed lat=
e and
waking late. I know this is not the habit of a true sadhak, but when =
you get
home from work late, sometimes going to bed straightaway can be fru=
strating
(because it feels like you did nothing all day but work). I always=
 wanted to be
more disciplined but found it difficult especially after a lo=
ng day at work.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I now have no choice but to get to sleep l=
atest by 10.30 pm, or I can
expect a migraine the next day. Needless to say=
, sleeping early means I wake up
early, and end up doing sadhana early- a h=
abit I struggled to cultivate due to
erratic working hours. Thanks to Mothe=
r Nature, I am now pretty much forced to
obey what I call basic 'yoga r=
ules' - not skipping meals (disturbs my vata
dosha!), sleeping on time-=
 basically being more disciplined. I feel that She is
standing over me with=
 a stick, forcing me to get to bed on time and eat
sensibly!<br>
<br>
Regar=
ding the effects on the practice on my mind, the old enemies (anger, envy,
=
etc) still rear their ugly heads, but I am more aware of them- and am now a=
 bit
better at keeping them in control. Still have plenty of work to do bef=
ore they
are completely eliminated.<br>
<br>
I am happy that (by coincidenc=
e) the finishing date of the purascharana happens
to be mid-Navaratri. I am=
 planning to start an anushthana of the Navarna mantra
tomorrow. I plan to =
do japa of the Navarna mantra- three malas a day- for just
over a year to c=
omplete 125,000 repetitions (supposedly the minimum for any
anusthana). I p=
lan to keep up the Ashtakshari mantra too at 7 malas a day.<br>
<br>
I am n=
ow on a tridosha pacifying diet in the hope that the migraines will improve=
.
I am also going to try to sleep even earlier (by 10 pm) in the hope that =
this
will enable me to wake up in brahma muhurtha daily (luckily sunrise in=
 the UK
is at 7 am at present!). <br>
<br>
A happy Navaratri to all of you.=
<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
