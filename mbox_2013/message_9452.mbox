Sivananda on Japa:

"If you do Japa of a Mantra 13 crores of times you will=
 have Darshan of your Ishta Devata in physical form. If you are sincere and=
 earnest you can do this in four years' time."

Very interesting idea. Don'=
t think it's possible for me to do it in four years, but maybe in 60 years-=
  being a slow chanter with worldly commitments (so by the time I hit 90, a=
ssuming I live that long, it maybe, just maybe possible, God willing.)
