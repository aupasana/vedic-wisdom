I just found this. Does it explain the difference correctly?

Why do in som=
e months the Hindu birthday falls before the birthday according to Georgian=
 calendar, and some year after?

Thanks again
Ranga

The Gregorian calendar=
 is based upon the solar system and hence it has 365 days. The Hindu calend=
ar is based upon the lunar and solar systems. With the new moon appearing a=
fter every 27.1/2 days, the 12 lunar months take 354 days. The difference o=
f 11 days is adjusted every three years when an additional month called adh=
ik-mas is added. The difference between the two calendars explains why the =
dates of Hindu festivals vary every year.
