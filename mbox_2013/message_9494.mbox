** When the student is ready the teacher will appear ** All one can do is p=

I may have a desire to learn tennis from Rafal Nadal and=

 that direction then my chances are limited.  Desiring a specific guru may =
have some sense of I ness associated with it also. 

Continuing the tennis =
analogy, In this case I would have to be a child tennis prodigy, be born in=
to a family or circumstances where elders would have invested in my tennis =
talent and developed my skills, have the right set of early coaches (early =
gurus), go to the right tennis schools, have the right attitude towards Raf=

the initiation under the right muhurata so that our association grew over t=
ime or was stable etc. then perhaps my desire to be coached by him so that =
i myself may win championships one day could have met with success. 

If so=
meone gives me the address where Rafal Nadal lives then there is no guarant=

 I had "Krupa" from god and there was past karma (say Rafal was my coach in=
 last life and we had some unfinished karma together and he was waiting for=
 me in this life with tears in his eyes - things would be different when I =

Shishyas are waiting for gurus just as gurus are wait=
