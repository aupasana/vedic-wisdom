Dear Shri Prasad Ji,

Namasthe

 

1.       I am very pleased to read your =
write-up. You have finally reached close to the point of real wisdom in you=
r very first line. Don=E2=80=99t you think that if some logic goes absurd, =
then the very premise/assumption from where we started must be wrong? In ma=
thematics, there is a technique of proof called =E2=80=9Cproof by contradic=
tion=E2=80=9D. In that, we first assume the given hypothesis to be true; an=
d then we continue with deductive/inductive reasoning and analysis till we =
reach a point of absurdity. After reaching the point of absurdity, we deny =
the hypothesis to be true; and hence prove that its contradiction must be t=
rue; that is the hypothesis itself must be false.

 

2.       So I am very=
 glad that you reached a point of absurdity. So the time now is to identify=
 your assumption/premise/hypothesis from where you started; and then deny t=
hat hypothesis to be true.

 

3.       The moment you do this, the truth w=
ill dawn on you. And the only thing that you would like thereafter is to be=
 quiet, because, there is no inclination to indulge in chatter at the cost =
of that supreme bliss.

 

4.       If you would permit, I would take delig=
ht in expounding on this with a better clarity for the welfare of all earne=
st seekers.

 

Warm Regards,

Kannan

Sir 

 

       Also something has gone seriously wrong with =
the process of evolution. If we are trying to break free of karmic cycle so=
 hard why we got into this in the first place. It seems like humanity made =
a wrong move when it got attached to thought and the action got corrupted. =
We got entangled with the thought and it created a self for us and a self d=
riven activity that is narrow in scope. Karma is the result of self driven =
activity as against the well being of the whole. Incomplete action is karma=
. 

 

In a ideal situation the human being is aware and so may not be enta=
ngled with involuntary thought process and the action is rational. The thou=
ght process which started out as a tool for survival might have taken a lif=
e of its own, created a self and self driven activity thus completing a hug=
e edifice  perceptual error. One has to see this error and be free of it...=
.but unfortunately it is not so easy.

Sir 

 

       Thanks for your response and=
 the beautiful explanation you have given of all the four paths of self rea=
lization. Let me try to put all this into a perspective here. 

 

Now my u=
nderstanding is that all these four different path lead to the same point o=
r the end result and that is self realization. No matter what path or appro=
ach you take the end result or the truth has to be the same. It cannot be t=
wo different thing for two different people and in that case it is not the =
Truth. The path one adopts may be of hindu persuasion or some other religio=
us persuasion the end result has to be the same. Not only the end result on=
e has to come to a point where one has an insight or a perception that fini=
shes the ego or self directed activity. 

 

Karma is a natural result of t=
he freedom that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning without =
freedom to act. I do mistakes and create imbalance only when I have freedom=
 to act and as such I have pay it back and restore balance in Nature. To ha=
ve the freedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect sens=
e to me. 

 

Now due to karmic overload it may become very hard for large =
numbers of people to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if Nature allows =
one to be free of this attachment without a payback. Now there is a train o=
f thought which says that one can look into the whole nature of this attach=
ment at one shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one thing after a=
nother look at this whole thing to the root , have a perception and get out=
 of it. In a sense our ancestors were intelligent that they devised some wa=
y to clear this Karma but it seems like for large numbers of people these w=
ill become crutches rather than help to get out of the karmic cycle and lea=
d an existence where one is free to act. If my previous karma is influencin=
g my action then I am not free. 

 

Is it possible for someone to look int=
o this whole process of attachment and have an insight and be free of it ri=
ght now....

Namaste Sir,

 

> Dont you think all these yogas are NOT an end in it=
self but to prepare the mind for awakening??

 

Correct. These paths get o=
ne started in the walk towards the same end point - Self-realization.

 

>=
 To be free is to be awakened.

 

Not exactly. Awakening is just a step to=
wards freedom. Freedom comes in the end after walking a path for enough tim=
e after awakening.

 

An unawakened sadhaka practicing jnana yoga reads bo=
oks and talks eloquently about how everything is god, but looks at differen=
t people, objects and experiences with a different attitude. He becomes hap=
py (if not externally, atleast internally) when people praise him and becom=
es upset when people criticize him, and so on. An awakened sadhaka practici=
ng jnana yoga starts to honestly contemplate one's actions, words, thoughts=
 (and even instincts finally) and slowly weeds out conditioning that makes =
one look at different transient things differently. As his equanimity incre=
ases, still there will be episodes of getting carried away. As he employs c=
ontemplation and self-correction more and more, such episodes will become l=
ess and less frequent and one will become liberated in the end.

 

An unaw=
akened sadhaka practicing karma yoga passionately engages in dharmik action=
s for the benefit of others. He gets elated and feels proud when good resul=
ts come and becomes upset when bad results come. An awakened sadhaka practi=
cing karma yoga starts to have detachment to results. When something happen=
s which makes him elated, proud, ashamed or upset, he will not think much a=
bout it, take it as god's prasad and think about what is the right action f=
or him right now. As his detachment increases, still there will be episodes=
 of getting carried away. As one becomes more and more detached (to results=
 of actions), such episodes will become less and less frequent and one will=
 become liberated in the end.

 

An unawakened sadhaka practicing raja yog=
a goes through yama, niyama, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana etc. His psychic l=
ife force may even arise and ascend. He may have various experiences and ma=
y feel proud or become attached to them. An awakened sadhaka practicing raj=
a yoga will not not lose self-control in the face of anything and will keep=
 the focus on samadhi. He will not be distracted by anything that comes on =
the way and keep perfecting concentration and self-control so that samadhi =
(deep concentration on the unconditioned Self) comes. In the beginning, one=
 may be in samadhi state now and then. As practice is perfected, one can be=
 in it all the time and become liberated.

 

An unawkened sadhaka practici=
ng bhakti yoga is devoted to god and worships him/her as much as one can, b=
ut will project his ego, conditioning and desires onto his worship and henc=
e onto the god he worships. For example, he may think "I worship the highes=
t god while that person worships a lower god. I am better" or "I am worship=
ping god everyday. I will get so and so result" or "I worship god more than=
 that person. I am better". An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga has l=
ittle expectation, pride etc. Worship becomes not about him but about god! =
He worships god and marvels at the power that holds this cosmos together - =
the power that runs things infinitismally smaller than a boson and infinite=
ly larger than a galaxy. He will look at himself as a fully insignificant p=
article in front a supreme power. His desires, likes, dislikes, conditionin=
g and agendas start to seem too insignificant in front of contemplating abo=
ut that supreme power. Even as that devotional spirit increases, there will=
 be episodes when one becomes self-centered in one's worship. But with prac=
tice, one loses oneself completely and surrenders completely to the supreme=
 power and become liberated in the end.
 
In each path, one may walk the pa=
th without making any significant progress for a long time. As one starts t=
o imbibe the inherent qualities of the path, some internal transformation w=
ill kick in. Yet, the force of prior conditioning, coming from many lives, =
is too strong to overcome. One keeps walking..

Narasimha

Narasimha 

 

 =
                I agree with your explanation of all four different types o=
f yoga and also bhakti yoga being the safest of all kinds. Dont you think a=
ll these yogas are NOT an end in itself but to prepare the mind for awakeni=
ng?? The purpose behind all this should be to free oneself from karmic bind=
ings and be free of the  bondage. That has to be the core purpose of any ty=
pe of yoga. To be free is to be awakened. 

 

No matter what path you foll=
ow ultimately there should be a perception where one sees the thought for w=
hat it is and there is a cleansing of the action. And there will be no karm=
a when you are NOT bound to the action. Now does these four types of yogas =
prepare one for this perception or at least create more probability or ment=
al states where such a thing is possible. I am not sure. 

 

Your movie an=

ity is creating more karma while trying to liberate extricate itself out of=
 it....the whole thing is moving in a circular way. 

 

Just put my line o=

Namaste friends,
 
I am cc'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup=
 because of the spiritual content.
 
I agree with Vishnu ji's comment on a =
specific point in Maja ji's nice write-up:
 
> > *Also, one is supposed to =
choose only one ayana for one lifetime and
> > master it to as perfect as p=
ossible. *
> 
>  I am not entirely sure if the above statement is correct. =

> possible and in fact is a measure of self realized people=
.
 
Indeed, one can carve one's own niche by combining multiple paths. They=
 are not meant to be mutually exclusive.
 
I'll quote Swami Vivekananda fro=
m his book "Raja Yoga" where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:
 
"Each sou=
l is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by co=
ntrolling nature: external and internal. Do this either by work or worship =
or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and =
be free."
 
Here are my 2 cents.
 
Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophizatio=
n and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga empha=
sizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion =
and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try t=
o develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and =
surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualit=
ies develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally,=
 a realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qual=
ities fully blossomed.
 
Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshat=
ramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for=
 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised against it. Controlling body and=
 mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requires stri=
ct yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and =
food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be d=
angerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught =
in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He d=
iscouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to =
Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.
 
Jnana yoga is=
 brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the delusional t=
rap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/smart enoug=
h for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever=
 I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion anyway" without ful=
ly overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in consciousn=
ess every instant. Kind of like declaring wisely in a movie that "it's just=
 a movie and not reality", but flinching in every scary scene, crying in ev=
ery sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jna=
na yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant contemplation and s=
elf-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the end.
 
IMHo=
, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most suit=
able and safest.

Narasimha

in dharmik=
 actions for the benefit of others. He gets elated and feels proud
when goo=

sadhaka=
 practicing karma yoga starts to have detachment to results. When
something=
 happens which makes him elated, proud, ashamed or upset, he will not

friends,<br>
 <br>
I am cc'ing this to vedic-wisdo=
m yahoogroup because of the spiritual content.<br>
 <br>
I agree with =
Vishnu ji's comment on a specific point in Maja ji's nice
write-up:<br>
&nb=
sp;<br>
> > *Also, one is supposed to choose only one ayana for one l=
ifetime and<br>

eople.<br>
 <br>
Indeed, one can carve one's own niche by combining mu=
ltiple paths. They are not
meant to be mutually exclusive.<br>
 <br>
I=
'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where he ma=
kes
a comment on the 4 paths:<br>
 <br>
"Each soul is potentially=
 divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity
within by controlling nature=
: external and internal. Do this either by work or
worship or psychic contr=
ol, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these -
and be free."<b=
r>
 <br>
Here are my 2 cents.<br>
 <br>
Jnana yoga emphasizes on =
philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on
work and detachment. =
Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery.
Bhakti yoga emphasiz=
es on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick
whatever is natural t=
o one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom,
detached action, se=
lf-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually
exclusive. As one =
of these qualities develops nicely in one, others will
automatically develo=
p too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in
"Yoga" or oneness)=
 will have all these qualities fully blossomed.<br>
 <br>
Forget about=
 horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of
that, I st=
rongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even
Ramakrishna ad=
vised against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the
psychic life fo=
rce to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and
clean nadis. I=
n this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate
great amounts =
of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just
my view, b=
ut what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel of
Ramakrishna" =
(one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged
several of his s=
ishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda,
but did not en=
courage even him to practice it.<br>
 <br>
Jnana yoga is brilliant, bu=
t there is a distinct danger of falling into the
delusional trap of pseudo-=
wisdom. People of this age are not
sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It i=
s easy to delude that "all is
Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it=
's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a
delusion anyway" without fully o=
vercoming all innate conditioning that
reinforces duality in consciousness =
every instant. Kind of like declaring
wisely in a movie that "it's jus=
t a movie and not reality", but
flinching in every scary scene, crying=
 in every sad scene etc. Without absolute
honesty, sincerely and earnestnes=
s, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long
path of constant contemplation=
 and self-correction can be reduced to a quick
delusional jump to the end.<=
br>
 <br>
IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yog=
a are the most
suitable and safest.<br>
 <br>
