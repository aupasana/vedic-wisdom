Student =
: You know I have read a lot, comprehended a lot, I think I have
understood=
 a lot, but yet I feel lost. I still don't feel any thing or
any different =
or whatever.

Teacher : That's good.

Student : How exactly is that good?

=
Teacher : Hang on to that thought, and remind me to get back to it. *
Sips =
his scotch*, Have you ever gone to the gym?

Student : Yes, I had a very ve=
ry good physique back in the day.

Teacher : Kaka ji , you are 23 right now=
, what the hell do you mean back
in the day?

Student: Oho, I meant when i =
used to work out.

Teacher : Looking at those arms of yours, I am guessing =
you used to work
out pretty regularly?

Student : Yes, and as If you don't =
know.

Teacher : Tameez, ullu ke pathe, tameez.

Student : Sorry.

Teacher =
: Apology not accepted, i am going to kick your ass pretty soon
for your ga=
rbled use of speech lately, but anyways, so you used to work
out regularly,=
 what is the name of the gym that you used to go?

Student: F and F.

Teach=
er : errrrr????

Student : Figure and fitness.

Teacher : ooohhh nice name,=
 I think its better you go back to a gym, but
a new gym now.

Student : Any=
thing you say.

Teacher : Its called the SFS Gym.

Student : errrrrrr??????=


Teacher : The sleep, food, sex Gym, I am the head trainer there and I
wil=
l make your ass is kicked so hard, that before sitting on a sofa,
instead o=
f the "soft pudgy warmish feel", you will get the=A0 " don't
feel like sitt=
ing down , because it will hurt" feeling.

Student : Please elaborate.

Tea=
cher : Teri tirchi nazar ne dil ko kar diya penchar.

Student : Nakkadwale =
disco , udhaar wale khisco?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DOFbCDaPKOFM

T=
eacher : Exactly.

Student : Hey ram, we were on SFS.

Teacher : We are sti=
ll there. So you have done a lot of reading.

Student : Yes.

Teacher : And=
 now you are raring to go, to proceed higher eh?

Student : Yes.

Teacher :=
 oohhh Fascinating, Then welcome to the SFS gym. Well here you
go, You have=
 to be a strict celibate, for the next 6 months, Have to
control your food =
intake, and cut your sleep to 6 hours.

Student : *Stunned Silence* * Looks=
 at the teacher*

Teacher :=A0 hai meri jaan, Teri tirchhi nazar ne dil ko =
kar diya
pancher.

Student : You serious?

Teacher : You must feel so this =
--
"tumko dekha to kho gaya
main fell in love sa ho gaya
socha tumne bhi hi=
nt diya
lekin sandal ka print diya
dil tukde tukde ho gaya
us din main jald=
i so gaya
ghumaya tune left right and center
oye sandal sandal sandal sanda=
l sandal"

LOL

Student : But hang on a second.

Teacher : Yes, please elab=
orate.

Student : I can't stay celibate for than 5 days, sleep for around 1=
1
hours daily, and have all the food in the world, how will I do what you
h=
ave asked me to do?

Teacher :=A0

Student=
: You really can come up with a song for any situation na?

Teacher : Comin=
g back to you , are you up to go upar in the air?

Student :=A0 Yes, but ho=
w?

Teacher : You have to be a strict celibate, for the next 6 months, Have=

to control your food intake, and cut your sleep to 6 hours. Combine that
w=
ith the mantra you have been given , top it off with homams, and you my
fri=
end I will speak with once this is done.

Student : No.

Teacher : Yes or f=
orget it, waste your life finding porn on the
internet, enjoying your organ=
, and giving lectures to others on
"spirituality" while searching for hot w=
omen on the internet and
enjoying yourself at night, and then feeling pathe=
tic.

Student : HELP!

Teacher : Am I raping you that you are screaming for=
 help?

Student : No but why this all, I mean didn't they say that you only=
 had
to chant, or be in love with god or something like that?

Teacher : Wh=
o said that?

Student : I read it, and based on elderly advice.

Teacher : =
Then chant for births combined, nothing is going to happen,
and whatever yo=
u have heard or read is just excuses from people not
willing to go onto thi=
s path, and to top it off, you misconstrued it
too.

Student : Eeekksss=85.=
. HELP!!

Teacher : They also said skip everything , just remember god for =
two
minutes, sincerely, and god will just be there and listen.

Student : N=
ot exactly, but similar stuff.

Teacher : Well, my first question is, when =
was the last time somebody
did this?

Student : What?

Teacher : Remembered=
 god sincerely for two minute straight, without the
mind interfering and ru=
nning a background commentary?

Student : Why the hell do you have to prove=
 me wrong every damn time?

Teacher : point is , neither does anyone unders=
tand the real essence of
that advice and neither can you follow that advice=
, so you better stick
to what i am telling you.

Student : Okay, but first =
answer my questions.

Teacher : Shoot, you have 10 minutes, and then the pr=
ess conference
ends.

Student : Why celibacy?

Teacher : Let us say, you ar=
e standing at the lavatory of an airbus A380
( in flight ), and your destin=
ation is to reach the cockpit. And you
start walking towards it, and mind y=
ou walking is hard, because you are
bound by tight huge rubber bands from t=
he back of the airplane.

Student : Okay.

Teacher : And off you go towards=
 the cockpit, and as soon as you walk
like 20 steps, you encounter an open =
exit, the one on the side. What
will happen?

Student : I will be sucked ou=
t of the plane, due to the immense air
pressure of it.

Teacher : And to ad=
d to that, you will re spawn at the back of the
plane, and you are back to =
square one. Mind you even those 20 steps are
hellishly difficult.

Student =
: And then start all over again?

Teacher : Yep.

Student : no progress til=
l the door closes?

Teacher : Nope, every time you will be sucked out, why =
waste all the
effort? If you don't feel like closing the door , why not mak=
e love with
an air hostess and join the mile high club?

Student : oho!!

T=
eacher : The back of the plane is akin to your widely read mooldhara,
and t=
he cockpit is akin to your much publicized sahasrara, the exit on
the side =
is your gentile thus you have a choice.

Student : What that might=A0 be?

=
Teacher : Its your either your cock or the cockpit. LOL

Student : You dirt=
y old man.

Teacher : Gande video tum dekho, dirty old man main banoon, kya=
 insaaf
hai.

Student : What are all those rubber bands for in that analogy=
?

Teacher : Your attachments, your conditioning, vaasnas, habits, etc.

St=
udent : And since they are pulling me back, their akin to rubber
bands.

Te=
acher : Now you realized that? What a dodo.

Student: So closing the air do=
or is important.

Teacher : Yes, and top it off there will be many times, w=
hen you are not
processing straight to the cockpit, the forces format he ba=
ck will be so
strong, that you will be handgun not he economy class seats. =
And if you
add an open exit to all these forces, what will happen?

Student=
 : I'll be landing on my face in the lavatory.

Teacher : Precisely.

Stude=
nt : Ouch.

Teacher : Precisely x 2

Student : Got it, but what when I am m=
arried?

Teacher : Holy crap!! You are 21, what is the need to think, I mea=
n you
could die like tomorrow , you are atleast 5 years from marriage, and =
it
is also quite possible that=A0 you remain unmarried.

Student : WHAT??? =
No but i want to get married.

Teacher : What, "what"? We'll cross that bri=
dge when we get to it,=A0
but for any married person, celibacy is equivalen=
t to sticking to one
partner, physically as well as mentally and if your pa=
rtner demands sex,
it is your duty to fulfill it. What good is a man who ca=
n't be of any
sexual use to his own wife? You can remain completely celibat=
e in a
marriage during the time that you need to stay celibate. And you are=
 21,
you should be worried about a lot more things than marriage.

P.S. And=
 if you are into all this god shod business, it is not necessary
that your =
spouse be also into this, and by denying them this basic right
( Sex shex a=
nd all that jazz ), you might be inducing them to curse you
and god , thus =
creating more karma's.

Student : Eeekss=85 Okay. Why sleep?

Teacher : You=
 understood celibacy?

Student : I think.

Teacher : Yay!! Lets celebrate!!=

*Sings it aloud*=A0 http://youtu.be/hV8l59pxfho?t=3D1m20s
Yes yes i want i=
t more
Aaj na chalega zor
Khulegi daaro machega shor
Aajao saare on the flo=
or
Bus isi baat pe botal kholo
Kiye jo saare paap woh dholo
Aao mere saath =
me holo
Put your hand's up zor se bolo

Main Sharabi!!
Main Sharabi!!
Main =
Sharabi!!
Main Sharabi!!

Teacher : But I really haven't told you about oja=
s and other stuff
pertaining to celibacy, I will tell you when I think you =
are ready.

Student : Okay Sharabi ji.

Teacher : Celibacy builds up ojas, =
one of the elementary things to make
you approachable by a deity. Without o=
jas , you are like a person who
smells like a sewer rat, with ojas you are =
like the axe deodrant guy,
everybody (ethereal) just wants you!!

Student :=
 Go on

Teacher : Nope, not right now, other wise your over intellectual mi=
nd
will gallop to conclusions and block you from actually doing some thing.=


Student : Now what about sleep?

Teacher : "You" are already sleeping.

S=
tudent : You mean "you" like the "battery" analogy,

Teacher : yes, and whe=
n you add physical sleep to it, you are sleeping
twice over.

Student : ouc=
h.

Teacher : When you are trying to wake up to god, you think excessive
sl=
eeping which dulls the mind actually helps your case or the deters it?

Stu=
dent : Deters it.

Teacher : To add to that, what about all the sexy dreams=
 you can get?
You don't want the exit door in the airplane opening without =
warning
now, do you?

Student : No, no.

Teacher : Any questions on sleep?
=

Student: Even if i had any, i ma sure you will answer automatically like
i=
t is your habit, but I don't know what to say, its overwhelming, thus,
you =
decide.

Teacher : There are more things, but will tell you later, rather y=
ou
will tell me yourself. So We are done with sleep.

Student: Yes.

Teache=
r :
Bus isi baat pe botal kholo
Kiye jo saare paap woh dholo
Aao mere saath=
 me holo
Put your hand's up zor se bolo

Student :
Main Sharabi!!
Main Shar=
abi!!
Main Sharabi!!
Main Sharabi!!

Teacher : And we are back.

Student :=
=A0 Food.

Teacher : Simple Answer is Fire.

Student : Agni dev? But how?

=
Teacher : Bhoot agni and jathara agni.

Student : HOW?

Teacher : Inverse r=
elationship.

Student: Like in ratios? I sucks at maths.

Teacher : Yep.

S=
tudent: Not understanding

Teacher : You ever heard of a vrata katha?

Stud=
ent : Yes.

Teacher : What exactly happens in a fast?

Student : People don=
't eat?

Teacher : Why?

Student: because its a fucking fast.

Teacher : Sl=
ow down Rambo, why do not eat?

Student : God knows.

Teacher : Fast -- no =
food -- increases bhoot agni, since jathara agni
isn't being fed, then read=
 a katha or a story , so that the "image" of
the story has a better chance =
of being generated inside another form of
the person's body on the inside a=
nd help him/ her out by creating a
remedial "image".

Student : holy crap

=
Teacher : Now you tell me why food?

Student : because less the food or rat=
her the more managed it is , less
jathara agni can get inflamed and more bh=
oot agni can be managed and
thus any recitation of any text, homam or tarpa=
n can have a better
impact on the other forms of the body thus actually hel=
ping the real
"me" out.

Teacher : Where do i bow down , wash your feet and=
 drink the water kind
sir?
*Blushes*

Student : I think is should do that f=
or you.

Teacher : Never me, only god.

Teacher : So you understood food to=
o?

Student : I am guessing, yes. And to add to that, the heavier the food,=

the more digestive fire is needed, thus less spiritual fire, exactly in
th=
e case of meat and chicken. Holy shit!!

Teacher :
Kismat meri jaga do
Musi=
c thoda bada do
Ik patiyala or pila do
Iss party mein aag laga do

http://y=
outu.be/hV8l59pxfho?t=3D1m6s

Student :
Main Sharabi!!
Main Sharabi!!
Main =
Sharabi!!
Main Sharabi!!

Teacher : And from this date, you are also banned=
 from alcohol.

Student : WHAT??? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BUT WHY YOU HAVE BEEN DAN=
CING AND
DRINK SO MUCH.

Teacher : Simply . because you are not me.

Studen=
t : no, no, no, no. I demand an explanation.

Teacher : You already know it=
.

Student : You tell, i don't know anything

Teacher : You just told me wi=
th that meat explanation.

Student : So i keep pouring it int he digestive =
fire and oh well=85=85.
crap.

Teacher : Precisely.

Student : that implies=
 you are not offering it into the digestive fire.

Teacher : And now we mov=
e on to matters of serious contemplation.

Student : You haven't answered m=
e.

Teacher : Tell me about the first day the figure and fitness gym.

Stud=
ent : It was good, but days after it were hell.

Teacher : felt like a bull=
dozer rolled over you?

Student : Pretty much, my muscles were hurting.

Te=
acher : And how long did it take you to actually build some visible
muscle?=


Student : a good 8 months, with gym 4 to 5 days a week that too for 1 to
=
two hours.

Teacher : Same case with god.

Student : How?

Teacher : What w=
as the dumbbell size you started out with?

Student : 4 kgs

Teacher : And =
today?

Student : 15 kgs seems light.

Teacher : Same case here, the more y=
ou practice/perform , the better you
will get. With god, no visible muscles=
 will be there, and nobody will
appreciate except the people who are much s=
tronger than you, but this
desire to get recognized should also go away the=
 more you progress.

Student : So this is like a gym?

Teacher : yes, repet=
ition of a mantra is akin to reps in a set, the more
you do, the closer you=
 are. Lets say a text like durga saptashati, which
you have never read, you=
 start reading, you will make a 1000 errors, but
if you actually start rect=
ifying a couple of errors by marking the words
down and making an effort to=
 correct, after some time you will be able
to recite it perfectly. lets you=
 make 1000 errors, and lets you recite
it 1000 times, each time focusing on=
 5 words, in 500 recitations I think
you will be much better than off than =
you started.

Student : So it is all effort.

Teacher : Knowledge without e=
ffort and without love is actually poison,
and useless. Don't be scared of =
errors and take it as an excuse to run
away and not do anything at all. You=
 have to start out with a 4kg
dumbbell only,don't compete with any one else=
 or feel embarrassed that
they can pick up 20 kg ones and you can't. They m=
ust have given at least
2 years of regular EFFORT to be where they are.

St=
udent : Correct. Actually this gym example makes it quite clear to me.

Tea=
cher : Good. And don't you ever dare to forget, what you are in this
for an=
d why you started out, to eliminate yourself and only for god and
god alone=
. no special hocus pocus powers, no siddhi, no showing off your
knowledge c=
rap, no progress no nothing, only god. The more homams, the
more tarpans, t=
he more chanting , you will do, the more time you will
spend there, the bet=
ter you will get. its pretty simple. But in the
beginning errors will be th=
ere, ask for forgiveness and move on. If you
try to pick up a 20 kg dumbbel=
l in the beginning obviously your hand
will break.

Student : Just like my =
back used to ache severely even after 20 minutes
of siting straight, but no=
w it is much better, i can sit still for
around 2 hours without it ruining =
my attempt at chanting.

Teacher : And never ever think you are not going t=
o fail. You wont be
able to keep your celibacy straightaway, but lets say s=
tart out with 10
days, then progressively increase it. You will fall down, =
but do get up,
for the sake of god, get back up and start all over again. S=
ame with
sleep, same with food. Inch by inch move towards the target and yo=
u will
get there, nature's eternal promise. The more you will work out in
s=
piritual terms, the more you spiritual muscles will grow. and the
better yo=
u will look ;) the guys who are already good at the stuff,
please consider =
how much time and effort and has gone into their
practice. And please stick=
 to one thing, or one form , or method, excel
at it, stop being a prostitut=
e and develop a relationship with a form to
go closer with him/ her it. No =
3 or 4 mantras, only one at a time.

Student : Practice and more practice i=
t is then, but still I can have
one drink, no?

Teacher : Till I don't allo=
w, nope. But here is one for now.

Student :
aapke waaste gunaah sahi
hum p=
iye to saab banti hai
sau ( 100 ) gamon ko nichodne ke baad
ek katra sharab=
 banti hai

Teacher : Oh teri bhen ki, kya baat hai, I bow down to god, wit=
hout whom
those lines are impossible to come out. LOL , now give me back my=
 glass,
and go do homam. Go.

ver you have heard or read is just excuses from people not willing to go on=
to this path, and to top it off, you misconstrued it too.<br><br>Student : =
Eeekksss=85.. HELP!!<br><br>Teacher : They also said skip everything , just=
 remember god for two minutes, sincerely, and god will just be there and li=
sten.<br><br>Student : Not exactly, but similar stuff.<br><br>Teacher : Wel=
l, my first question is, when was the last time somebody did this?<br><br>S=
tudent : What?<br><br>Teacher : Remembered god sincerely for two minute str=
aight, without the mind interfering and running a background commentary?<br=
><br>Student : Why the hell do you have to prove me wrong every damn time?<=
br><br>Teacher : point is , neither does anyone understand the real essence=
 of that advice and neither can you follow that advice, so you better stick=
 to what i am telling you.<br><br>Student : Okay, but first answer my quest=
ions.<br><br>Teacher : Shoot, you have 10 minutes, and then the press confe=
rence ends.<br><br>Student : Why celibacy?<br><br>Teacher : Let us say, you=
 are standing at the lavatory of an airbus A380 ( in flight ), and your des=
tination is to reach the cockpit. And you start walking towards it, and min=
d you walking is hard, because you are bound by tight huge rubber bands fro=
m the back of the airplane.<br><br>Student : Okay.<br><br>Teacher : And off=
 you go towards the cockpit, and as soon as you walk like 20 steps, you enc=
ounter an open exit, the one on the side. What will happen?<br><br>Student =
: I will be sucked out of the plane, due to the immense air pressure of it.=
<br><br>Teacher : And to add to that, you will re spawn at the back of the =
plane, and you are back to square one. Mind you even those 20 steps are hel=
lishly difficult.<br><br>Student : And then start all over again?<br><br>Te=
acher : Yep.<br><br>Student : no progress till the door closes?<br><br>Teac=
her : Nope, every time you will be sucked out, why waste all the effort? If=
 you don't feel like closing the door , why not make love with an air hoste=
ss and join the mile high club?<br><br>Student : oho!!<br><br>Teacher : The=
 back of the plane is akin to your widely read mooldhara, and the cockpit i=
s akin to your much publicized sahasrara, the exit on the side is your gent=
ile thus you have a choice.<br><br>Student : What that might=A0 be?<br><br>=
Teacher : Its your either your cock or the cockpit. LOL<br><br>Student : Yo=
u dirty old man.<br><br>Teacher : Gande video tum dekho, dirty old man main=
 banoon, kya insaaf hai.<br><br>Student : What are all those rubber bands f=
or in that analogy?<br><br>Teacher : Your attachments, your conditioning, v=
aasnas, habits, etc.<br><br>Student : And since they are pulling me back, t=
heir akin to rubber bands.<br><br>Teacher : Now you realized that? What a d=
odo.<br><br>Student: So closing the air door is important.<br><br>Teacher :=
 Yes, and top it off there will be many times, when you are not processing =
straight to the cockpit, the forces format he back will be so strong, that =
you will be handgun not he economy class seats. And if you add an open exit=
 to all these forces, what will happen?<br><br>Student : I'll be landing on=
 my face in the lavatory.<br><br>Teacher : Precisely.<br><br>Student : Ouch=
.<br><br>Teacher : Precisely x 2<br><br>Student : Got it, but what when I a=
m married?<br><br>Teacher : Holy crap!! You are 21, what is the need to thi=
nk, I mean you could die like tomorrow , you are atleast 5 years from marri=
age, and it is also quite possible that=A0 you remain unmarried.<br><br>Stu=
dent : WHAT??? No but i want to get married.<br><br>Teacher : What, "what"?=
 We'll cross that bridge when we get to it,=A0 but for any married person, =
celibacy is equivalent to sticking to one partner, physically as well as me=
ntally and if your partner demands sex, it is your duty to fulfill it. What=
 good is a man who can't be of any sexual use to his own wife? You can rema=
in completely celibate in a marriage during the time that you need to stay =
celibate. And you are 21, you should be worried about a lot more things tha=
n marriage.<br><br>P.S. And if you are into all this god shod business, it =
is not necessary that your spouse be also into this, and by denying them th=
is basic right ( Sex shex and all that jazz ), you might be inducing them t=
o curse you and god , thus creating more karma's.<br><br>Student : Eeekss=

y haven't told you about ojas and other stuff pertaining to celibacy, I wil=

><br>Teacher : Celibacy builds up ojas, one of the elementary things to mak=

y (ethereal) just wants you!!<br><br>Student : Go on<br><br>Teacher : Nope,=
 not right now, other wise your over intellectual mind will gallop to concl=

t : You mean "you" like the "battery" analogy,<br><br>Teacher : yes, and wh=

 excessive sleeping which dulls the mind actually helps your case or the de=

about all the sexy dreams you can get? You don't want the exit door in the =

r><br>Student : God knows.<br><br>Teacher : Fast -- no food -- increases bh=
oot agni, since jathara agni isn't being fed, then read a katha or a story =
, so that the "image" of the story has a better chance of being generated i=
nside another form of the person's body on the inside and help him/ her out=
 by creating a remedial "image".<br><br>Student : holy crap<br><br>Teacher =
: Now you tell me why food?<br><br>Student : because less the food or rathe=
r the more managed it is , less jathara agni can get inflamed and more bhoo=
t agni can be managed and thus any recitation of any text, homam or tarpan =
can have a better impact on the other forms of the body thus actually helpi=

 So you understood food too?<br><br>Student : I am guessing, yes. And to ad=

br><br>Teacher : Tell me about the first day the figure and fitness gym.<br=
><br>Student : It was good, but days after it were hell.<br><br>Teacher : f=
elt like a bulldozer rolled over you?<br><br>Student : Pretty much, my musc=
les were hurting.<br><br>Teacher : And how long did it take you to actually=
 build some visible muscle?<br><br>Student : a good 8 months, with gym 4 to=
 5 days a week that too for 1 to two hours.<br><br>Teacher : Same case with=
 god.<br><br>Student : How?<br><br>Teacher : What was the dumbbell size you=
 started out with?<br><br>Student : 4 kgs<br><br>Teacher : And today?<br><b=
r>Student : 15 kgs seems light.<br><br>Teacher : Same case here, the more y=
ou practice/perform , the better you will get. With god, no visible muscles=
 will be there, and nobody will appreciate except the people who are much s=
tronger than you, but this desire to get recognized should also go away the=
 more you progress.<br><br>Student : So this is like a gym?<br><br>Teacher =
: yes, repetition of a mantra is akin to reps in a set, the more you do, th=
e closer you are. Lets say a text like durga saptashati, which you have nev=
er read, you start reading, you will make a 1000 errors, but if you actuall=
y start rectifying a couple of errors by marking the words down and making =
an effort to correct, after some time you will be able to recite it perfect=
ly. lets you make 1000 errors, and lets you recite it 1000 times, each time=
 focusing on 5 words, in 500 recitations I think you will be much better th=
an off than you started. <br><br>Student : So it is all effort.<br><br>Teac=
her : Knowledge without effort and without love is actually poison, and use=
less. Don't be scared of errors and take it as an excuse to run away and no=
t do anything at all. You have to start out with a 4kg dumbbell only,don't =
compete with any one else or feel embarrassed that they can pick up 20 kg o=
nes and you can't. They must have given at least 2 years of regular EFFORT =
to be where they are.<br><br>Student : Correct. Actually this gym example m=
akes it quite clear to me.<br><br>Teacher : Good. And don't you ever dare t=
o forget, what you are in this for and why you started out, to eliminate yo=
urself and only for god and god alone. no special hocus pocus powers, no si=
ddhi, no showing off your knowledge crap, no progress no nothing, only god.=
 The more homams, the more tarpans, the more chanting , you will do, the mo=
re time you will spend there, the better you will get. its pretty simple. B=
ut in the beginning errors will be there, ask for forgiveness and move on. =
If you try to pick up a 20 kg dumbbell in the beginning obviously your hand=
 will break.<br><br>Student : Just like my back used to ache severely even =
after 20 minutes of siting straight, but now it is much better, i can sit s=
till for around 2 hours without it ruining my attempt at chanting.<br><br>T=
eacher : And never ever think you are not going to fail. You wont be able t=
o keep your celibacy straightaway, but lets say start out with 10 days, the=
n progressively increase it. You will fall down, but do get up, for the sak=
e of god, get back up and start all over again. Same with sleep, same with =
food. Inch by inch move towards the target and you will get there, nature's=
 eternal promise. The more you will work out in spiritual terms, the more y=
ou spiritual muscles will grow. and the better you will look ;) the guys wh=
o are already good at the stuff, please consider how much time and effort a=
nd has gone into their practice. And please stick to one thing, or one form=
 , or method, excel at it, stop being a prostitute and develop a relationsh=
ip with a form to go closer with him/ her it. No 3 or 4 mantras, only one a=
t a time.<br><br>Student : Practice and more practice it is then, but still=
 I can have one drink, no?<br><br>Teacher : Till I don't allow, nope. But h=
ere is one for now.<br><br>Student : <br>aapke waaste gunaah sahi<br>hum pi=
ye to saab banti hai<br>sau ( 100 ) gamon ko nichodne ke baad<br>ek katra s=

 me back my glass, and go do homam. Go.<br>
