 a place for
people to do homam outside their apartments.  After doing homa=
m in
apartment as well as in Homa kunda outside (we built one at my native

village), I felt big limitation when we do homam in an apartment. One,
ther=
e are limited items one can offer in fire due to its size. Two, long
durati=
on homam invariably generates soot which eventually goes all over
the place=
. General disturbance if you want to do extended sadhana with
Homam. People=
 staying abroad will have more issues due to fire safety
system also. Since=
 I don't have any means of creating such a facility at
my current place in =
Bangalore, I thought I'll share this with other
folks. If someone feels it =
is worth pursuing and has ability (anywhere
in world), they are welcome to =
do so.

 11
or 21 or 51 Homa Kunda (whatever practically possible). Anyone
interest=
ed to do homam can come to this place anytime 24x7x365 days, do
extended ho=
urs of homam or do 1-3-5-7 days sadhana. Bring your own
stuff; spend as muc=
h as time day/night, evenings/mornings, whatever
suits you. The owner of th=
e place may provide some basic needs if the
site is next to his house.
> >O=
ff course all this should not involve any money and should be done
with the=
 sankalpa of one's spiritual progress or restoring Dharma in
world (as Nara=
simha had told many times). Also, in my opinion the place
should not be in =
temple premises as invariably people come with
materials wishes and pray. W=
ell this is just a thought/wish; feel free
to give your opinion. This conce=
pt could be helpful for people staying
abroad too.
