Dear Friends,

Yesterday I did chandi homam as per the procedure given Narsimhaji's
website. In the main homam part, I did Kavach, Keelak, Argala. Then I went
on to Saptashati. I have hindi version of Saptashati which is quite long.
It was close to 2 hrs and I was not able to finish saptashati and the homam
fire extinguished at 4th chapter.

If I had to finish saptashati, it would have taken another hour or so.

So I was just wondering, how people perform chandi homam daily.

Is there any short procedure to it ?

Thanks and Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
