Bhupendra Ji

I am really sorry to hear about the ordeal of this little gi=
rl. Rajarishi ji's advice is very good and I can probably add something whi=
ch might give much sooner releif. It would be great if the family can trave=
l to Kasi.

However right in Rochester(near to New york and Boston ) there =
is a very powerful devi temple and the goddess is in the form of Sahasraksh=
i . Haran Aiya who is the main priest of the temple is a disciple of Amrita=
nanda natha saraswati and is he is very well versed in srividya upasana and=
 tantra. 

Narasimha Ji visited this temple a couple of years back and he p=
osted his thoughts.Though the original message was about something else.

h=
ttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/4624

"I truly appreciate=
 the sincerity of Haran aiya, his disciples and his lineage.
I visited that=
 temple once and was impressed with the attitude of people running
it."

On=
e good example of the shakti of the sadhakas running the temple is this. Ev=
ery year they do a homa for Pratyangira Devi ( Atharvana Bhadrakali ) and t=
hey use tons of chillies in the homa. Even though tons of chillies are used=
 in the homa people's eyes do not burn while standing since the tattwa of t=
he offering has been changed due to her grace.

The Sri Chakra Journal they=
 publish detailed it ...

12-Blossom-16-Petal-2.pdf

"All in all, the entire homam took about 3 hours=
 to complete, with
several kilograms of red chilli peppers being offered in=
to the
flames in the process. However, not one person felt the effect of th=
e
chilli smoke, as everything was accepted by the Devi.
After the main homa=
m,Bhairava bali was offered
outside the temple and everyone was given the r=
emaining (unburned)
prasadam to take home."

The goddess in the form of Pra=
tyangira devi is famous for turning back black magic and protecting her dev=
otees. This is the link and address to the temple.

The temple also houses =
a Bhairava Murthy and Aiya is well versed with Pratyangira sadhana.

Please take the child to the shrine and meet Haran Aiya an=
d he will definetly suggest something more quicker.

Regards
Vemparla Ram K=
ishore
