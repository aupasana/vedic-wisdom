Hello! Everyone,
=A0
I just thought of adding some clarifications.
=A0
Fi=
rst of all, when I mentioned about the utility of techniques of "Hypnothera=
py" and "Past Life Regression" for handling the problem of spirit attachmen=
ts as well as many other problems for which we do not have reasonable expla=
nation, my assertions were limited to the utility part only and not beyond =
that. I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or not, in fact I =
do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, any know=
ledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half knowledge=
 or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in our this empi=
rical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of the fact of =
having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that the Sun does=
 not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, still we use =
sentences like "Sun rises=A0in the east", "Sun=A0sets=A0in the west" etc. T=
o keep life going, we keep on continuing with activities which helps
 in ke=
eping life go on...It is in this sense that I'd mentioned about "Hypnothera=
py" and "Past Life Regression".
=A0
One should not comment about the wealth=
 inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full of infinite possi=
bilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just can not say that th=
e universe can behave in any particular limited ways. Before anyone comment=
s about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=A0must first take a sinc=
ere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if=A0one rea=
lly takes a sincere dip into any subject one would definitely be convinced =
about the utility of the same.=A0By saying that one shouldn't make comments=
 before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=A0by doing so one wou=
ld prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=A0blind belief in =
religion and religious practices=A0can be termed as dogmatic but also in sc=
ience, if one loses the scientific temper.
=A0
Proof of pudding lies=A0in e=
ating it, all that I can say to the persons willing to address any of their=
 problems. "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression" have immense utility f=
or=A0those who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind.=
 Those who are interested can read " Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weis=
s" to start with.
=A0
To respected Narasimha sir, I would like to inform th=
at these are not "new age ideas". These were there much before in India. To=
 cite one example, concept of "Jaati Smaran" of Jainism is one among them. =
Jainas used this technique of "Jaati Smaran" to reinforce renunciation in t=
he followers.
=A0
To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that=A0so far as =
my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over phone, bu=
t however, there are so many other problems which can be handled even over =
phone. To cite one example - One girl was having=A0one recurrent bad horrif=
ying dream for past 4/5 years and she=A0approached me for the treatment.=A0=
But due to my=A0official engagements I was camping at a far off place for a=
round 2 months, I couldn't manage to meet her for doing the session.=A0Her =
problem was getting worsened as it=A0had=A0 started affecting her professio=
nal career adversely. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a=
 session over phone. The phone session continued for around one and half an=
 hour and she got relieved from her that recurrent dream and also started i=
mproving her professional life. Since that day the dream has not yet visite=
d her again.
=A0
It all depends on the openness of the mind, the strength o=
f the desire to overcome etc. The universe is much more than what we see,wh=
at we can see and what we can believe to see.
=A0
Regards

Tanmoya=A0
