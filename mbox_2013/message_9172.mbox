Both fixe=

 had built a temple for him than built by the King.
Later King realised the=

king.

Namas=
te,
 
Correct, if the mind involved is highly purified and has a good level=
 of
shama and dama (equanimity and self-restraint).
 
When we make offering=
s externally (e.g. to an idol), mind is distracted by
so many external thin=
gs and unlikely to be fully focused on the act. When a
highly purified mind=
 makes offerings internally, it is possible for it to be
highly focused on =
the visualization. That can indeed be more effective.
 
However, until one =
reaches such a stage, it is quite useful (and often
unavoidable) to engage =
in external and material offerings. A mind that is
unfocused and distracted=
 needs some objects and actions to anchor it and
make it somewhat focused a=
nd disciplined.

 
Best regards,
Narasimha

	Namaste to All,

superior/more effective in manifesting desired results than a=

offerings. Any thoughts or opinions on this?
