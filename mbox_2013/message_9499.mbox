Hello,

Thanks to Narasimhaji's tutorials I'm now performing a daily Shiva =
homam. I'm in my Shani antar-dasha and having problems with discipline, thu=
s I'm also interested in performing a daily Shani homam.

What's the proces=
s for performing two full homas at once?
The sankalpas, prana pratishthapan=
as (invocations), parivara devata ahutis (offerings to associates) are all =
different. Purnahuti mantras are also a little bit different.

Do I have to=
 offer bali twice to Shiva and Shani? Same question concerning purnahuti - =
can I offer only one purnahuti?

In what order do I do the sankalpas? Is it=
 possible to combine two sankalpa mantras into a single one and chant it in=
 the beginning?

Please give me some guidance in what order should I do the=
 parts of the homas.

Thank you in advance.
