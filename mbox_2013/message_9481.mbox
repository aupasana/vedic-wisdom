A terrible tragedy. Twenty two children dying from poisoned free food at a =
local school....no proper medical care...headteacher and her husband (who a=
pparently sold the food) abscond...no justice for the families.

To those w=
ho would like to support the people of Bihar, have a look at this excellent=
 organisation run by nuns, monks and yogis (Bihar Yoga). They are based in =
Munger and Rikhia and run free schools and clinics, provide clothes and hel=
p build wells and do various other practical things in these villages and t=
he surrounding areas.

I personally know a doctor who worked at their clini=
c for a year who confirmed that they are genuine and well worth supporting.=


It is not possible to donate via their website, but you can email and ask=
 for their account details which they will then provide if you wish to make=
 an online transfer from your bank to theirs.

We are very fortunate that o=
ur children/nieces/nephews will never face such a horrible ordeal- it's wel=
l worth supporting these people who face such tragedies every day.
