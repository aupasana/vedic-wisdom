sex with them, that they have come to the planet Earth with a spe=
cific 
and great mission etc>>

All these can happen, not always due to a s=
udden unrpovoked Kundalini experience in an person who has not been suffici=
ently prepared and cushioned by the psychological processes inherent in Ind=
ian spiritual tradition. Yes, trying to delink the kundalini experience and=
 defining it in terms modern has serious problems because the modern wester=
n thought structure is NOT build to tackle this is all its manifestations a=
nd subtlety. There are deep fundamental differences which cannot be bridged=
. 


I knew an person who had a similar experience graph. First he sees a h=
uge allconsuimg light, a feeling of endless love and joy and beauty, a nice=
 powerful state of mind and body, then a voice starts speaking and telling =
him how special he is, eventually the voice gives him sexual and/or murdero=
us instructions. His state deteriorated so badly that his folks at home too=
k him to a hundred doctors from US to UK to whatnot, he simply could not be=
 cured. I don't know what happened later on. They also went to many spiritu=
al God-men yet nothing happened.


The problem is when due to sudden life e=
xperiences the ordinary mind calms down, and some form of shakti awakens, i=
t also opens up some part of the human mind-body complex to ALL influences.=
 Herein lies the catch. The person is as much opened up to positive influen=
ces as s/he is to negative influences. The subtle world is as good or as ba=
d as our physical world. It will require some deep maturity to understand t=
eh right from teh wrong in this world. As such this plane has no Light (pra=
kash) of the Supreme. Each, when they enter, must bring in his/her own Ligh=
t. Many over ages have lost their path in this world. Beyond the astral lie=
s teh causal world. Accessing this is MUCH more difficult and rarely will a=
 person experience a Kundalini awakening which takes him/her to this plane =
directly. Here, nothing even remotely negative in nature can survive, not e=
ven the mightest Asura.

Coming to teh world of the sukshma jagat, to survi=
ve such a sudden opening into this mixed world the consciousness has to be =
prepared deeply with pre-fed conducive ideals of love, peace, purity, equan=
amity, non-attachment, greater reverence for a Devata, humility etc etc. Th=
e spiritual-cultural cushioning has to be ready and well integrated to surv=
ive this. This is sadhana or bhuta-suddhi, constant self-purification. The =
best protection, if such a thing is possible, is to open up the heart compl=
etely by going deeper in meditation behind the vishnu granthi. There is an =
inherent Light inside it. IF this process is done properly, then this inher=
ent Light of the Divine accompanies the sadhaka at all times and there is n=
o chance of delusion ever. Unlike the mind, which knows very little and get=
s swayed by appearances, the true heart can never be deluded. Of course, ev=
en getting to this opening of the heart is not easy at all and may take lif=
etimes of
 efforts.=C2=A0 

=C2=A0
Typically when self-importance increases=
 due to an unprovoked K experience, it is because the manipura chakra - and=
 the individuals sense of power and control and authority has not yet been =
made to submit to the Divine. Sexual thoughts awaken because the instict of=
 lust has not yet been submited to the Divine. ETC ETC. 

The human self is=
 not one but a composite of many things. Each part has to be controlled and=
 offered to the Supreme. THAT is the highest sadhana. Our Rishis understood=
 the complex nature of the human mind-body far far better than what western=
 medicine understands today.

 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements=
 that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this
 transla=
tes into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control o=
f anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening=
 happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. =
Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of =
the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and wh=
en it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other =
things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of =
them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual fo=
r its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and natur=
e and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more=

>> vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience=
 of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycholog=
y are because of this. The human psychology as
 understood by west today is=
 puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible =
sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various su=
btle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "rup=
tured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, t=
rauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind a=
nd they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very com=
plex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down ev=
ery option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few =
can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they =
can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.
>> =
Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved=
, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks=
 used to say - Mens sana in corpore
 sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi

doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of so=

 kund=

 of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of =
kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. W=

the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength =
to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her=

>>In Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 -=
 Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements tha=
t compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this
 translates =
into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of an=
ger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening hap=
pens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devo=
tion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the =
journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when i=
t really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other thin=
gs and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them=
 are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for it=
s own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature an=
d miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more<br>=
> vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experienc=
e of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycholo=
gy are because of this. The human psychology as
 understood by west today i=
s puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible=
 sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various s=
ubtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ru=
ptured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, =
trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind =
and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very co=
mplex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down e=
very option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few=
 can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they=
 can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.<br=

gt;>>>  <br>> >>>>Dear all, Just wanted to war=
n people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient o=
f mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in t=
he care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening o=
f their
 kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experienc=
es and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had ne=
ver heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an e=
xplanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with he=
r (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini=
. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritua=
l crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered i=
nterest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunatel=
y these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we hav=
e no treatments for deranged<br>> kundalini, we struggle to help them. M=
any yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady=
 confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This w=
oman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deranged=

 energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she =
cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem.=
 The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kun=
dalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give=
 her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans amon=
g you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- thei=
r suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as =
not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti m=
arga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrument"=
 and leave the kundalini<br>> rising bit to God's will. Om Dum Durgayai =
