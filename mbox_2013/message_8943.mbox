      Namaste,



Making offerings to pitris in fire in a homam =
does not replace pitri 

tarpana. They serve different purposes.



You may=
 recall from Jyotisha that horas (halves of zodiacal signs) are 

owned by =
Sun and Moon and respectively ruled by devas (gods) and pitris 

(ancestral=
 manes). You may also recall from Jyotisha that lagna, Moon 

and Sun shows=
 physical body, mind and soul respectively. Human beings 

identify more wi=
th their body; pitris identify more with their mind and 

its desires; and,=
 devas identify more with their individual soul.



Offerings in fire reach=
/affect the soul more (Sun). Offerings through 

water reach/affect the min=
d more (Moon). So homam is best for devas and 

tarpana is best for pitris.=




However, though a deva may identify more with soul than mind, there wil=
l 

be SOME identification with mind and desires too. So, tarpana can be 

=
given to devas too (actually, pitri tarpana manual includes deva tarpana 

=
too). Similarly, though pitris identify more with mind and its desires, 

t=
here will be SOME identification with soul too. So offerings can be 

made =
in fire.



BTW, someone asked about Jayaadi homam that is sometimes done a=
t the 

start of uttarangam of any homam. Offerings to pitris with a Veda m=
antra 

are included in that procedure!



To answer your last question, I =
am not aware of any restrctions.



Best regards,

Narasimha
