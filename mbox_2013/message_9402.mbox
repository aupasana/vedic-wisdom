Respected sir,<br>With due regards I request you to she=
d some light upon the recent Uttarakhand tragedy. After the tragedy it is n=
ow believed that the tragedy was due to shifting of Dhari devi temple at Al=
aknanda river. I read some post by shri Manish ji and blog of shri sanjay r=
ath ji.  <br>My doubt is that, in present context how much it is relevant t=
hat such tragedies do happen by a Devi wrath. As per our believe God is mer=
ciful and even in some of your post previously you have said that it is not=
 worthwhile to connect tragedies with God or faith for Him?<br>Hope you can=
 elaborate this.<br><br>Best Regards<br>Ashish K.agarwal<div>Sent from my B=

 Hindu philosophy taught by many m=
odern gurus, especially of the Vedantic bent, is based on the final target =
rather than the path(s) one needs to walk, to get to the target. It assumes=
 that you are already close to the target. It ends up misleading and creati=
ng wrong notions in unprepared sadhakas like "all is delusion", &=
quot;everything is the same", "what you do does not matter".=
 The greatness of Bhagavad Gita is that it talks about the path(s) as well =
as the target and has something relevant to everyone.<br></div><div style=
