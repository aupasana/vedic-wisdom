Shri Ramakrishna Ji

Namasthay

 

1.       Om Gung Ganapathiyay Namah.

2.=
       I can render clarity in this regard in a series of mails as it is ve=
ry prolonged due to systematic progression from fundamentals. First I expou=
nd slowly on the basic ideas, then slowly migrate to the jyotisha then tell=
 you how to look this in chart; and this will take a series of mails.

 

3=
.       Spirituality is called moksha-maarga in Sanskrit. It is one of the =
four and the last of the four purushaartha(fundamental purposes of a human =
birth).

4.       Chathurtha, asthama and dwa-dasha bhaava (4,8,12) of a ja=
ataka chakra indicates this moksha-karma(spiritual activities).

5.       I=
t is to be understood that being spiritual is different from being religiou=
s.

6.       Chaturtha bhaava gives gati, asthama gives tapasya and dwa-das=
ha gives mukti. So to sum up we have, gati-tapasya-moksha =3D spirituality.=


7.       Now the D1 chakra pertains to physical body; and physical body i=
s nothing to do with moksha, so we never look at D1 for spirituality. But m=
oksha means freedom from bondage and illusion. So the question is, who is b=
onded? And from where is this illusion coming from? Aatma is never bonded n=
or under illusion. The shadow version of aatma(surya) is called ahankaara(s=
haneeswara)(ahankaara is the identification of Self with something else oth=
er than its true nature or form); the identity of aatma with name and form(=
naama-roopa) is the bondage which causes it to feel that =E2=80=9CI am this=
 name and form=E2=80=9D; =E2=80=9CI am the doer=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CI want t=
his.=E2=80=9D So who is suffering here? It is the ahankaara which is suffer=
ing and experiencing the pleasure and pain through manas(Chandra). Ahankaar=
a is borne out of avidhya or ignorance. Aatma-gnyaana(Self-realisation) is =
the state which is destruction of this ignorance; which happens through a s=
pecial grace-light from Ishwara(Arul-perum-jyothi); and this grace-light is=
 ever-compassionate(thani-perum-karunai); and this magnificent white compas=
sionate grace-light is called Guru. Guru is a special form of Ishwara who i=
s compassionate and destroys our avidhya or ignorance.

 

Shaneeswara is t=
he kaaraka for ahankaara. As long as the aatma has ahankaara, it keeps taki=
ng birth and re-birth to experience various desires or tasks related to the=
 ahankaara. Ahankaara or shaneeswara exerts his existence separately from A=
atma or Surya; and obviously does not like to be friendly with aatma, as sh=
aneeswara is shatru of surya; so is ahankaara is shatru of aatma.

 

You c=
an ponder over this for a while with patience. You must be knowing this alr=
eady, but still I wish you to go slowly meditating slowly on each aspect, t=
ill you finally get the kernel.

 

I wish to stop here with your kind perm=
ission. I intend to continue in my next mail, after you have achieved clari=
ty so far, after clearances of any sanshaya if any.

 

 I request group me=
mbers to please enhance the understanding by sharing  their experiences, qu=
ery or inputs please.

 

Om Shri Ganesha Charanam Samarpayaami.

Om Shaant=
ih Shaantih Shaantih

 

Thnaks and Warm Regards,

Kannan

Namasthay Shri Ramakrishna Ji,=


 

1.       Raaja Yoga graha yuthi in a jaataka chakra is for all dimensi=
ons of human existence including spirituality (moksha purushaartha).

 

2.=
       The term =E2=80=9Craa-ja=E2=80=9D is to be clearly understood with i=
ts implications. Often it is understood to be something related to enjoying=
 pleasures and bhoga samruddhi or material abundance or prosperity.

 

3. =
      Raa is related to Surya, fire, Agni. Ja  is related to =E2=80=9Cone w=
ho is created, born=E2=80=9D like ja-nma, ja-nani, dwi-ja, pra-jaa etc. And=
 obviously you need a mother or Moon for that. So clearly the word Raaja in=
dicates Sun who sustains all that is born like a father, along with Mother =
Moon who sustains or support those who are born. So we have a trigger or en=
ergy or effort coming from sun, and support or sustenance or nourishment co=
ming from moon to administer their pra-jaa or people. So, for a raajaa or a=
 king to rule his prajaa or people, he not only needs =E2=80=9Cefforts or e=
xecutive authority=E2=80=9D but also =E2=80=9Csustenance or support=E2=80=
=9D. This sustenance is called as =E2=80=9CLakshmi=E2=80=9D. A government c=
annot exert its executive authority without tax, so a Raaja or Sun cannot e=
xert his Kingly authority without treasury or lakshmi.

 

In other words, =
wherever the authority and support merges, that is, wherever Naaraayana and=
 Lakshmi merges together is said to create a situation or condition like a =
King. And this gives you a rulership over that area. In other words, in tha=
t particular area or aspect or dimension of your life, your disposition wil=
l be like a King; with authority and support; so that none can challenge yo=
u or prevent you in achieving anything in that area. Thus a king in essence=
 is like Shri Lakshmi-Naaraayana or vice versa.

 

In jaataka-chakra, the =
kendra denote naaraayana and trikona denote lakshmi. So wherever you have t=
he yuthi of kendreyshaa and trikoneysha in any particular bhaava, there is =
said to be =E2=80=9Craaja yoga=E2=80=9D or conjunction for king-like condit=
ion.

 

Having said this, it  is easy to understand that not all kings are=
 worthy or capable or influential. For example, The  King of Hastinapura wa=
s formidable and could not be challenged because he had a Parama-Prataapi(e=
ver-valorous) Bheeshma pitaamaha as Senaapathi, Dronaachaarya , and Mahaatm=
a Vidura as an advisor or amatyaachaarya or mahaa-mantri etc etc. Hence , h=
ow far the king will be successful depends on his amatyaachaarya(mahaa-,man=
tri) or senaapathi and so on.

 

So also in a jaataka chakra, how far the =
raaja yoga will be effective depends on other kaarakas supporting it. For e=
ffecting prediction, our fundamentals need to be very strong, instead of si=
mply quoting scriptures and copy-pasting. The concepts must be clearly unde=
rstood. Instead of looking at =E2=80=9Cwhat is written=E2=80=9D, we must po=
nder =E2=80=9Cwhy it is written=E2=80=9D in the scriptures, to be really ab=
le to understand the scriptures in the true perspective, as you must know t=
hat scriptures are often written in a symbolic or cryptic pattern so that o=
nly genuine student can learn or understand them; for others it is just a m=
erry-go-round.

 

I seek to stop here with your kind permission please.

Kannan

 Though this is a public forum, yet I am addressing to you as an individual=

Dear Kanna=
n Iyengar, 

 

This is a public forum and you like me is a member here. So=
 there is no need to ask my permission to write whatever you want. 

 

But=
 since you ask my permission, I think I am entitled to comment on it (or ma=
y be you wanted me to). 

 

We are not discussing Raja yoga as per Pathanj=
ali Yoga marga. One can read any number of books on such matters and write =
a few things as if he knows every thing about such matters. Words like Mukt=
i / Moksha are something that no one understands in REALITY but speaks abou=
t it in plenty. 

 

We can conjure many stories that are mesterious by nat=
ure, that is sure to pop the eyes balls out of their sockets and drop the j=
aw, dripping the saliva as bonus. But the truth is Dattatreya lived a life =
he liked. He like many others has presented some or other versions of life.=
 If he says it was mahalaxmi in his lap. It is maha laxmi. That is what his=
 mind tells him. Some may believe him or not. My wife shall always be my ma=
halaxmi.  

 

What I simply saying is, there is no point in writing about =
things that one seldom understands. The big question is have you really und=
erstood what you wrote about? Or is that an Illusion. 

 

Now about Raj Yo=
ga in Astrology, There are many variants described in astrology. We ca see =
flavors or Satwika Raja yoga, Rajasica Raja Yoga, Tamasica Raja yoga, Vipar=
eetha Raja Yoga,Neecha Bhanga Raja yoga and so on. 

 

No where it is stat=
ed that Raj Yoga is something to do with laxmi & vishnu or their blessings.=
 

 

Raj Yoga bluntly put is yoga of rajya - Leader of the pack. How the l=
eadership functions depend on the kind of influence - Gunas defined by the =
pancha bhootas too. 

 

It simply points to the status of the individual w=
ith respect to the society - community to which he belongs. 

 

Even a cob=
bler could be said to have raja yoga if he is considered to be the presiden=
t of cobblers association.

Dear Shri Swami Neela kantha Ji,

Please acce=
pt my humble pranaam.

 

1.       I seek your kind permission to express m=
y anubhava regarding the points raised by your noble self.

2.       The As=
htaanga Yoga-Vidhaana as laid by Maharishi Patanjali is called Raaja Yoga M=
aarga or the royal path.

3.       We can be a Yogi and Bhogi both at the s=
ame time. When we are Yogi we are in Krishna Paksha and when we are Bhogi w=
e are in Shukla Paksha. When we are Yogi we are in nivrutta-avastha; and wh=
en we are bhogi we are in a pravrutta-avastha. Stitha-pragnya remains in ni=
vrutti-pravrutti both at the same time; and is a jeevana-mukta. He remains =
aliptha(untouched) by bandhana(bondages). Shri Gurudeva Dattatreya was a yo=
gi and a bhogi at the same time. He drank liquor and had a beautiful maiden=
 in his lap; which made many disciples to consider him patha-brashtha(way-w=
ard); and many left him. Shri Gurudeva Dattatreya laughed heartily, and one=
 sincere disciple who remained realized that the maiden was Maata Mahaalaks=
hmi. Parameshwara Sadashiva is a yogi-bhogi to an extent that we worship hi=
s bhogi mudra of copulation in a linga form. The bhogi if is in bandhana, s=
o are all spiritualists in bandhana. One is desirous of material pleasure, =
and the other desirous of non-material pleasure. It is only when you have l=
ove then you get out of both these bandhana, and become a jeevana-mukta. Wh=
en you are a jeevana-mukta, bhoga-avastha and yoga-avastha both are same fo=
r you, as you remain aliptha.

4.       As far as jyotisha is concerned, ra=
ja yoga means the royal combination when Maathaa Lakshmi and Pithaa Vishnu =
exist together. Maathaa Lakshmi denotes blessing and pithaa Vishnu denotes =
efforts or karma, so Raja Yoga indicates the fulfillment of an effort by be=
ing blessed with appropriate results for that efforts.

5.       I mistook =
raja yoga to be the saadhana one. But no problem I guess, it is worth readi=
ng.

 

Seeking Blessings,

Kannan

What exactly d=
oes it mean by Raja Yoga? 

 

Does Raja Yoga mean that there is will not b=
e problems? 

 

Does Raja Yoga mean that one enjoys life, drinking, partyi=
ng, flirting etc. That should be more like Sukha - Bhoga yoga. 

 

Problem=
s, challenges, difficulties, tests, competition are part of that "Raja", wi=
thout which one cannot be called a King. Raja yoga simply means that the pe=
rson IS CAPABLE of handling all those situations and stay ahead of others o=
r be their leader. Just like a king need not intelligent always (which is w=
hy he as ministers to think), raja yoga also need not always mean that the =
person is intelligent - again it could simply mean that he is powerful / ag=
gressive - just like that King. 

 

 

The person who does not have such r=
aja yoga and are too weak, under the same circumstances, feel insecure, bea=
ten, failed, stomped and filled with inferiority complex.

 

The average p=
erson who does not have raja yoga, but are not weak, may stand aside and le=
t those with raj yogas march ahead. 

 

The point is the problems are more=
 or less similar, but men with different astro combinations approaches them=
 differently. 

 

 

Secondly, the msg was to look / focus NOT ONLY on the=
 Native but on the surroundings (related with him). 

 

Just think for a m=
oment: How times have we seen, queries by natives on loosing job DUE TO THE=
 COMPANY IN WHICH THEY WERE WORKING CLOSED?

 

Whose problem is that ? is =
it the affliction in the chart of the native that the company in which he w=
as working had to close? 

 

The fact is that the affliction only shows wh=
at happened to something he was related at that time. Due to raja yoga, he =
may get another job very soon. But doesn't erase that fact that the company=
 he was working lost. 

 

just a thought : The theories given by classical=
s are not wrong. But our understanding on how they work COULD BE WRONG and =
how we apply them.

y 4th lord as father-in-law as opposed to 3rd (9th from 7th). I realize tha=
t BPHS indicates both 9th and 10th as representing father (10th being 7th f=
rom 4th!), but why were you using 9th as father of nativity but 10th (from =
7th) as wife's father.

 

And what is the connection with "custody of nati=
ve's wealth" coming from?

 

 

Thanks for your time and effort in helping=
 us understand this otherwise very systematic presentation of these fundame=

Dear All, 

 

I think the following though is commo=
n concept, shall help many to understand astrologer a little better. 

 

R=
ecently I had an oppurtunity to look into the chart in which father, sister=
 and mother was afflicted - 9th, 3rd and 4th house. If we consider the fund=
amental principles, we can see that 9th, 10th & 3rd house is a common facto=
r as far as the above 3 bhavas are concerned. This is what prompted me to t=
abulate the following Inimical bhavas for each bhavas. 

 

It is taken as =


Trik Sthana : 8,12,6 

Nidhana : 3

Maraka : 2,7 

First being the most p=
otent. 

 

Bhava =3D8 =3D12 =3D6 =3D3 =3D2 =3D7

2 =3D9 =3D1 =3D7 =3D4 =3D3 =3D8

3 =3D10 =3D2 =3D8 =3D5 =3D=

8 =

9 =3D4 =3D8 =3D2 =3D11 =3D10 =3D3

10 =3D5 =

11 =3D6 =3D10 =3D4 =3D1 =3D12 =3D5

12 =3D7 =3D=
11 =3D5 =3D2 =3D1 =3D6

 

I am not sure how the above shall look in your b=
rowser. Hope it looks right. 

 

For each of the bhava, the lords of the c=
orresponding bhava, planets occupying them, planets aspecting them afflicts=
 the said bahva in a negative manner at one time or another. 

 

This is m=
ore so when 

The dasa lord is 

A) debilated

B) Combust

C) Seated in its=
 Shatru Rashi

D) is a natural Malafic

E) associated with Gulika

F) assoc=
iated with Mars, Saturn , Rahu & Ketu (Mars is karaka for 6th, Saturn is ka=
raka for 8th & 12). 

G) If the anthardasa lord is a an enemy of the dasa l=
ord. 

 

 

to have a better understanding of which all bhavas relates to =
whom, let me present a verse

putreshe strigrihe putrii bhaginii sahajeshva=
re

maatriShvasaa maatuleshe pitrivyeshe pitriShvasaa

janakeshe shvashruha=
ste shvashuro vaa griheshvare

laabheshe shaalakiihaste dhanam vaachyamasha=
mkinaH

 

if the lords of the bhavas are in the stree rashi

5th  lord =3D=
 daughter

3rd  lord =3D sister

6th  lord =3D mothers' sister

9th  lord =
=3D father's sister

10th lord =3D mother-in-law

11th lord =3D wife's sist=
er

 

4th lord=3D father-in-law

 

 

[these are the relatives under whos=
e custody, the natives wealth shall be] 

 

if the above planets are in pu=
rusha rashi, change the gender tp male ie: daughter will become Son and so =
on. 

 

The above indicates that every bhava is related to one or other re=
lative of the native. 4th in particular indicates one's close friend too. 
=

 

So the dasa shall afflict the native - by actually afflicting the said =
relative.  

 

hope this helps

p.n.n

  Swami, you understood
that I am writing without understanding. And I=
 understand that I am writing
with understanding. So let our understanding =
decide who is right; instead of we
both deciding. If you understand better,=
 please disprove my understanding with
your understanding; or else just kee=

say.</span><span style=3D'color=

about=
 raja yoga, because I can easily see that your understanding about raja

my shishya or to a humble seeker or to a well-mannered scholar seeking
enri=
