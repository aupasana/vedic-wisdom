Namaste,

=A0
(1) If one is uncomfortable with such metaphorical interpreta=
tions, one may ignore them.
=A0
(2) When it comes to subtle meanings, use y=
our discretion. I have seen some really sublime ones and nonsensical ones (=
as judged by my own conditioned intelligence). Use your discretion in accep=
ting/rejecting something.
=A0
(3) For why higher wisdom is expressed by ris=
his in stories/imageries with layered meanings, please read a nice expositi=
on by Sri Aurobindo at the beginning of "Secret of Veda".

A couple more comments I made on the=
 same facebook page later on:
=A0
Each individual is a microcosm for the ma=
crocosm.
=A0

*Real* stories to unfold in the outer world (macrocosm) at di=
fferent 
times can be metaphors for what transpires in the inner world 
(mi=
crocosm) of an individual at different times. When inward-looking, it may b=
e an abstract notion about internal transformation. When 
outward-looking, =
it may be a concrete story of something external and 
beautiful. Both are e=
qually real.

=A0
Well, whe=
ther one 
understands subtle inner meanings or not is not that important. W=
hat is 
important is whether one manifests the essence of scriptures practi=
cally
 in one's attitude and thinking when faced with tricky life situation=
s!

Neither reading beautiful stories of Lord nor understanding their subtl=
e inner 
meanings, is either necessary or sufficient for progressing, thoug=
h both activities CAN help one transform oneself in the long run..

Keep re=
ading stories if you are so inclined and/or keep understanding their 
inner=
 meaning if you are so inclined. Oneday you will hit upon a story 
or an in=
ner imagery/dynamic, that will resonate within and "click" for 
you..=A0
