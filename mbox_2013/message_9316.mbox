Namaskaar, Narasimhajee!

It is always a pleasure to read your posts and I =
was wondering why I was missing your write-ups in the JHora Section of Yaho=
o Groups, until I realized the obvious!

As the previous writer has rightly=
 stated, there exist many different ways of reciting mantras and unfortunat=
ely, no single 'way' can be claimed as THE right one. All one needs to do i=
s to look around at the different 'slokas' [vs. Vedic mantras] people chant=
 and yet seem to achieve success -whether peace of mind, or material, or bo=
th. However, it is my opinion that there is an unkown quality or power to t=
he Vedic mantras, probably because of the way they are chanted, or, simply =
because they were not handed down to us by mere mortals!

You get to gauge =
a comparison of differences in the chantings of Vedic mantras, when you lis=
ten to priests chanting the Rig-Vedas, Krishna Yajur Vedas [KY Vedas], Shuk=
la Yajur [SY] Vedas and the Sama Vedas. Those who follow [or can trace thei=
r lineage to] the KY Rishis and chant mantras the KY way [if I may even inc=
orrectly use this phrase], should listen to the fantastic recitations of Ve=
dic Mantras chanted by Shishyas and learned priests [or 'Vadhyaars', as the=
y popularly termed in the South], whose recordings are available for sale o=
n CDs on Pt. S.P. Tata's website "astrojyoti.com". Please note that I am NO=
T a salesperson for Pt. SPT, but having personally experienced the unusual =
vibrations of KY Vedas, I can vouch for the 'priestly' recitations containe=
d in the CDs, because they are not by laypersons, but traditional, EXPERT P=
ANDITs. 

Unfortunately, the recordings may NOT be of the best quality, esp=
. the Rig Veda chantings, but when the KYV chantings are heard with rapt at=
tention, the combination of the hoary voices of the Senior Vadhyaars stir u=
p the deespest recesses of your soul and help you understand why several ma=
ntras have been termed 'Veda Mantras' -precisely because they have been ext=
racted from the Vedas! 

Examples include the famous "Rudram, Chamakam, Uda=
ka Shanthi Mantras including Nakshatra Sukthams, Vishnu Stuthis and Narayan=
a Sukthams, Aruna Prasnam, Mahanyasam, Taitreeya Seekshavalli, Bhriguvalli =
and Bhramanandavalli, Mahanarayana", etc. each of which I was able to trace=
 by listening to the 85 different Chapters of KY Vedas!

One particular KY =
Veda chapter titled "02-KY-AST1-P02" -3 chapters after which the Nakshatram=
alika is recited -is imply hair-raising. It starts with salutations to Devi=
 [Shanno-Devi Rabhisthaye -the Shani-devata mantra] and around the 19th min=
tue, beseeches "HEY GAYATHREE"...you've got to listen to this, to believe w=
hat I am saying! The experience is simply cosmic, surreal...well, the Engli=
sh language is too poor and fails you, when you need to translate Sanskrit =
and cosmic experiences!!!.

If Narasimhajee, or anyone else is really inter=
ested in listening to the Rudram-Chamakam, Udaka Shanthi Mantras and Mahany=
asa chants of truly astounding quality, please buy the CDs from Giri Stores=
 -the Vadhyaars are Sri Swaminatha Ganapadigal and Srinivasa Sastrigal. I d=
oubt whether you can find other recitations of comparable quality anywhere =
else. I am not referring merely to the audio quality, but even to the ABSOL=
UTELY FANTASTIC experience one gets hearing the expert Vadhyaars, transferr=
ing as they are their cosmic benefit to the listener.

Enough said, I wante=
d to actually post another request to PVRN to understand why Ketu's presenc=
e in Meena Rashi in the 8th house should be responsible for mystical experi=
ences as mine, but will do so in the other discussion Group, "vedic-astrolo=
gy".

May Lord & Guru Brahma's light shine on us all, through the able pen =
of Shri Narasimhajee. Om Namah Shivaya; Om Namo Narayanaaya!!!
Venkat
