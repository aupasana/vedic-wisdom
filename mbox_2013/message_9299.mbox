and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Vaishn=

es on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna a=
s the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a meas=
ure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and t=
he SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,

ties of Maya". In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clou=
ds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them=
, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is th=

I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on their fancie=

 descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Kris=

of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to be separated in=
to another world, but is a progressive realization of the various manifesta=

e soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can=

> >>>>>>=C2=A05. Of these, n=
aturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of=
 evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of muc=
h easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mi=
nd. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the an=
imal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force fo=
r a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there ca=
n be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature a=
nd will change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Rama=
yana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did=
 have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelle=
d by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the =
end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, t=
hat he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it
>  was the Dharma to do so, =
and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when h=
e lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly =
to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as=
 a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to=
 it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminat=
ed into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, =
such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn th=
e Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, O=
TOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=
=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant det=
achment from situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances =
that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for=
 Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,
>  his village-folks who so =
loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave th=
e shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head int=
o an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, the=
n he understood that they won't understand, he promised he will return back=
 once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, wh=
en the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he oblig=
ed. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of K=
rshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to=
 everyone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupal=
a abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smili=
ng and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Sh=
ishupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly =
accused Krshna of being a revolutionist
>  and charlatan, Krshna did not ki=
ll him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magic=
ian, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly=
 of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he w=
as back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there o=
ne instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equ=
ivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what other=
s say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he =
had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy.=
 That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karm=
a-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the a=
ction nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away from the =
battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apa=
rt Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema
>  to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or=
 getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, =
knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the dest=
ruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational=
 thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to =
the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the=
 Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the =
Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a diff=
erent picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attackin=
g Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demo=
lishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the=
 Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama=
 is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great cha=
racteristics of satwa, chief
>  of which is self-control, as well as the oc=
casional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least=
 until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a tru=
e saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna=
 was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, women,=
 deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trac=
e of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying si=
tuations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not s=
ee him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one =
he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clearly de=
nying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with what eithe=
r Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If negation of =
this world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at cruc=
ial stages of
>  evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact on masse=
s is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathru=
sta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the sche=
me of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most l=
ogical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do =
not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holis=
tic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of =
life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy=
, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and r=
ealization. 7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 =
chakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the human b=
ody and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is =
my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to th=
e full
>  power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 graha=
s, or that which can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to exp=
lore and express itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna=
 is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who repr=
esent the parable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the seq=
uence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which graha would typically re=
present which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my beli=
ef - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted=
 corruption of understanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga=
] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalk=
i, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the st=
ainless one. There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atma=
h .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and complete
>=
  purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint o=
f his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this world =
and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various=
 points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won=
't even need that. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be=
 the only one capable enough to rectify the various errors and corruptions =
that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It i=
s perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now=
 that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi
