Namaste,

Are you doing any form of spiritual practice?

If yes, the best w=
ay to find answers to your questions (according to those people who have fo=
und answers), is to carry on doing whatever spiritual practice that appeals=
 to you with faith and enthusiasm, without expecting anything in return. Tr=
icky to do, but it has worked time and again with many people.

Asking ques=
tions is a useful function of the intellect, but it has to lead to actually=
 doing some form of spiritual practice to actually find the answers.

There=
's an interesting parable from Sri Ramakrishna in this regard...

http://ww=
w.rkmission.org.my/ramakrishna.html

"Two friends went into an orchard. One=
 of them possessing much worldly wisdom immediately began to count the mang=
o trees there and the number of mangoes each tree bore, and to estimate wha=
t might be the value of the whole orchard. 

His companion went to the owne=
r, made friends with him, and then, quietly going to a tree, pluck the frui=
ts and eat them. 

Whom do you consider to be the wiser of the two? Eat man=
goes. It will satisfy your hunger. 

What is the good of counting the trees=
 and leaves and making calculation? The vain man of intellect busies himsel=
f uselessly with finding out the `why' and `wherefore' of creation, while t=
he humble man of wisdom makes friends with the Creator and enjoys His gift =
of supreme bliss."

It's nice to know the whys and wherefores of creation b=
ut the human intellect is a frail instrument with limited capacity and will=
 not be able to find the answers. Peace of mind and the answers, according =
to the Teachers, comes through Intuition, direct experience of reality. Thi=
s in turn comes from spiritual practice. 

All the best with your spiritual=
 practice....no doubt it will help you find the answers you are looking for=
.

Salutations and prostrations to the sari-clad Lady on the Tiger....
Om S=
ri Durgayai Namaha...may She help us all find the answers.... ;)

Aparna
