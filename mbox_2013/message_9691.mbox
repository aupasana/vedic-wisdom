There are 74 lakhs Yonis as per our vedic text meaning 74 lakhs=
 species live in this world and their population we don't know. So you cann=
ot judge by human population alone for rebirth calculations according to Ka=
rma. And as Mr.Narasimha says the birth cycle is reversible from human to o=
ther species and vice versa.

Nama=
ste Sir,

 
Where and how one is born is based on one's desires, whether on=
e has sufficient good karma to fulfil those desires and who one has rina wi=
th. It is not only what you did to others, but also what others did to you =
that matters.
 
Suppose a dog served a family well. Suppose it saw its mast=
er while dying and thought of being a human being at the last moment, it ma=
y be born as a human being and that family may have to serve that dog in ne=
w life as a human being.
 
If a cow being killed by butcher wept at the las=
t moment at its helplessness and wished it was a strong human being instead=
, it may be born as a human being (provided it has enough good karmas and/o=
r karmik debts with humans - which is possible if several people enjoyed it=
s milk for a long time and finally its flesh).
 
It is possible that many p=
eople in the world today are first time human beings. They may not be guara=
nteed a human birth in the next life.
 

Best regards,
Narasimha

	Dear all gurus,
	    I heard that the souls which have the good kar=
ma in past lives will be born as human beings. But if you observe the world=
 past few years, very less people are doing the good karma(may be i don't t=
he what good or bad is but here what i thought good means which supports th=
e dharma). So the people with good dharmic karma are being lessened. But if=
 you see the world population, It is getting increased day by day. These tw=
o are contradicting. So all respected gurus please clarify my doubt. Please=
 forgive me if something wrong in ideas and narration.

	Thanks in advance,=

	Regards,
	Ravi Kiran Jana
