Namaste friends,
=A0
A couple of my write-ups related to Vedanta on a limit=
ed access Facebook forum may be of interest to some people here. I am quoti=
ng just my comments. One should be able to follow them despite the missing =
context.

I have no aversion for Vedanta at all, but many Vedantins today only s=
peak pseudo-Vedanta that is devoid of a respect for what binds us in the fi=
rst place and a genuine appreciation of the difficulty of overcoming the bo=
ndage. Let us dissect this "acceptance" thing for example. Yes, it is very =
easy to theoretically understand that "acceptance of everything" will liber=
ate one. But what does it mean practically?

For example, I read your note =
and my instinct was to respond. Should I "accept" the instinct and type thi=
s response? Or should I "accept" the other instinct to not waste time and c=
ontinue with some Jyotish research work I was doing? Which acceptance is be=
tter?

We are constantly pulled in different directions by our dharma towar=
ds different beings/entities and it is not easy to pick the right thing to =
do.

We can use an easy abstraction. Let us call our actions towards the re=
st of the world as "karma" and the actions of the rest of the world towards=
 us as "karmaphala". A simple thumb rule can be (1) to accept all "karmapha=
la" and not analyze it much and (2) to stick to our dharma in picking the "=
karma". But there are 3 fundamental issues with this:

(1) It is not easy t=
o know one's dharma. One is often pulled in different directions by one's d=
harma towards different beings/entities. After all, we are suspended in thi=
s world by a complex web of rinas!
(2) As we evaluate various dharmas and p=
ick current karma, some understanding of which karma is likely to result in=
 which karmaphala is needed. Thus, feedback from previous karmas, in the fo=
rm of "karmaphala", is of interest. But there is no certainty and we can on=
ly have a vague understanding.
(3) Firmness in doing one's karma in the int=
erest of one's highest dharma (based on one's best understanding at the tim=
e - could be faulty) and detachment to the corresponding karmaphala when it=
 finally arrives, is what we have to do. But they are kind of opposite goal=
s. Without some attachment, most people cannot engage in firm actions.

Man=
y Vedantins make 2 mistakes - (1) they trivialize the field of duality as s=
omething that is delusional and can simply be wished away and (2) instead o=
f seeing jnana and karma as two sides of the coin, they see them as alterna=
tives. They look down upon karma as something lowly and value bookish & int=
ellectual understanding of jnana more. Without firm & dharmik karmas, that =
intellectual understanding of jnana will not infuse one's thinking and inst=
incts deep enough to liberate one eventually.

I can see that "sun of knowl=
edge is so powerful that we cant even grasp the edge of it's toes with our =
indriyas (sense-organs), hence you have to use some other faculty and remem=
ber that you cant also express it to others with your sense organs." But it=
 is very easy for one to delude oneself that one is now grasping that Sun w=
ith "some other faculty". The proof of the pudding is that theoretical unde=
rstanding is accompanied by an internal transformation that expresses exter=
nally as firm dharmik karmas with detachment to karmaphala!!

To anyone who=
 lectures that all is Self/God, I just have one rude reply. Suppose one's h=
ands and legs are cut off. Can one say that the cut off limbs and the strea=
m of blood flowing are also Self/God and be in the same blissful state? I k=
now the answer in my case. Any truthful person will know the answer in one'=
s own case. It is so easy to repeat Vedanta like a parrot, but Shakti is to=
o powerful. Unless MANY deeply ingrained instincts are overcome through pra=
ctice & grace, one cannot be liberated. Until one overcomes ALL instincts, =
"all is Self" is just theory.

Regarding Rajarshi's comment on there being =
something higher than the upper bird in Mundakpanishad story, I don't have =
much to say. It is quite possible. However, whether or what is above that b=
ird is not that interesting to me. When my personality is represented by th=
e lower bird, my goal is to first make the lower bird climb and reach the u=
pper bird. Whether it stays there then or flies away further up is an issue=
 for future.

I do not want to "put down" Vedanta. I only want to put it in pers=
pective. It is the "anta" (end) of "veda" (knowledge). If one at the *begin=
ning* or *middle* of the path ignores/puts down the whole path and talks ex=
cessively of the "end", it does not necessarily take him to the end. It tak=
es a loooong time to travel the path. Vedanta is just the end and not a pat=
h to the end. IMHO, Vedanta is not only useless but quite misleading for 99=
.9999% of humanity, though it is the inevitable final liberating reality fo=
r the rest who already travelled *a* path and reached *the* end.

Take the =
simple notion of acceptance. Rama, after Self-realization, killed Ravana an=
d others. Of course, he had no "dvesha" for Ravana. But would you normally =
label killing someone as "acceptance"? Understanding "acceptance" referred =
to in scriptures is no easy task!!!! In fact, people talk about "acceptance=
" without even fully understanding what it actually entails.

We perceive e=
verything through the lens of conditioning/vasanas and rinas. For example, =
my words may make you think that I am agitated, even if I am quite "chilled=
" in reality. Before talking about "accepting" something, shouldn't we firs=
t improve one's perceptions? Can't questioning & contemplating help in clar=
ifying our perceptions?

Is "accepting" faulty/conditioned notions in our m=
inds any useful? Isn't it better to resist, reject and eject faulty/conditi=
oned notions than to "accept" them? Wouldn't progress from a state of ignor=
ance into that of wisdom naturally need a fine balance between friction/res=
istance and acceptance?

A prematurely adopted stretegy of "accepting" ever=
ything with no "raaga" or "dvesha" can lead to a confused and indecisive pe=
rson who shuns his dharma and gets *stuck* in the middle of path despite sp=
eaking the language of someone who is at the end of the path. For someone w=
ho is still stuck in Maayaa, it is better to do somewhat selfless dharma ev=
en with some raaga and dvesha. Overcoming of raaga and dvesha naturally and=
 organically occurs from within, as one engages in more and more dharma and=
 pays off more and more rinas.

Detachment (disappearance of raaga and dves=
ha) comes with the maturing of jnana. Selfless dharmik actions that pay off=
 outstanding debts occur with the maturing of karma. These two sides should=
 mature together, as they balance one. If one goes to an extreme, either to=
wards karma or jnana, without corresponding progress in the other, one will=
 very likely get stuck.

Narasimha
