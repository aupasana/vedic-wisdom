Dear learned members

According to timeanddate.com sunrise and sunset for m=
y location are 6:00am and 20:23pm.

I find it difficult to observe these ti=
mings, especially during the week. I want to be able to finish dinner by 20=
:00 but the sunset is at 20:23. In the mornings I am up early but need time=
 for my yoga routine etc, so 6:00 is out of the question.

May be our ances=
tors had thought of all such worldly limitations and that is why they inclu=
ded a short verse for prayaschitta in the sandhyavandanam procedure itself.=
 This would help me do Sandhyavandanam EVERYDAY, at least once a day.

Is i=
t justified to routinely use this (not as an exception)?
