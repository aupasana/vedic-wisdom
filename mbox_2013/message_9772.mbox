=C2=A0
=C2=A0 
Dear all,
=

I am coming to the end of my purascharana practice of the ashtakshari mant=
ra-
will finish next week on Oct 9. I thought I would share some thoughts w=
ith you
about my perception of the effects of my practice.

I would say the=
 biggest effect (that I can perceive) is on my physical self. In
simple ter=
ms, I find that if I flout Nature's rules, specifically regarding
proper sl=
eep and food, without fail I get an awful migraine. This never used to
be t=
he case. I have had dreadful working hours in the past (before starting the=

purascharana) and could get away with skipping meals and sleeping erratica=
lly
if work demanded it. 

However I simply cannot do this anymore. I have =
had a ridiculous number of
migraines in the last two years, which coincides=
 with starting the purascharana
two years ago. It may just be happening bec=
ause I'm getting older, but before I
started this practice, I could general=
ly get away with going to bed late and
waking late. I know this is not the =
habit of a true sadhak, but when you get
home from work late, sometimes goi=
ng to bed straightaway can be frustrating
(because it feels like you did no=
thing all day but work). I always wanted to be
more disciplined but found i=
t difficult especially after a long day at work.

Anyway, I now have no cho=
ice but to get to sleep latest by 10.30 pm, or I can
expect a migraine the =
next day. Needless to say, sleeping early means I wake up
early, and end up=
 doing sadhana early- a habit I struggled to cultivate due to
erratic worki=
ng hours. Thanks to Mother Nature, I am now pretty much forced to
obey what=
 I call basic 'yoga rules' - not skipping meals (disturbs my vata
dosha!), =
sleeping on time- basically being more disciplined. I feel that She is
stan=
ding over me with a stick, forcing me to get to bed on time and eat
sensibl=
y!

Regarding the effects on the practice on my mind, the old enemies (ange=
r, envy,
etc) still rear their ugly heads, but I am more aware of them- and=
 am now a bit
better at keeping them in control. Still have plenty of work =
to do before they
are completely eliminated.

I am happy that (by coinciden=
ce) the finishing date of the purascharana happens
to be mid-Navaratri. I a=
m planning to start an anushthana of the Navarna mantra
tomorrow. I plan to=
 do japa of the Navarna mantra- three malas a day- for just
over a year to =
complete 125,000 repetitions (supposedly the minimum for any
anusthana). I =
plan to keep up the Ashtakshari mantra too at 7 malas a day.

I am now on a=
 tridosha pacifying diet in the hope that the migraines will improve.
I am =
also going to try to sleep even earlier (by 10 pm) in the hope that this
wi=
ll enable me to wake up in brahma muhurtha daily (luckily sunrise in the UK=

is at 7 am at present!). 

A happy Navaratri to all of you.

Best wishes,
=

Aparna

nd of my purascharana practice of the ashtakshari mantra-
will finish next =
week on Oct 9. I thought I would share some thoughts with you
about my perc=
eption of the effects of my practice.<br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=3D"none"=
>
I would say the biggest effect (that I can perceive) is on my physical se=
lf. In
simple terms, I find that if I flout Nature's rules, specifically re=
garding
proper sleep and food, without fail I get an awful migraine. This n=
ever used to
be the case. I have had dreadful working hours in the past (be=
fore starting the
purascharana) and could get away with skipping meals and =
sleeping erratically
if work demanded it. <br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=3D"=
none">
However I simply cannot do this anymore. I have had a ridiculous num=
ber of
migraines in the last two years, which coincides with starting the p=
urascharana
two years ago. It may just be happening because I'm getting old=
er, but before I
started this practice, I could generally get away with goi=
ng to bed late and
waking late. I know this is not the habit of a true sadh=
ak, but when you get
home from work late, sometimes going to bed straightaw=
ay can be frustrating
(because it feels like you did nothing all day but wo=
rk). I always wanted to be
more disciplined but found it difficult especial=
ly after a long day at work.<br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=3D"none">
Anyway,=
 I now have no choice but to get to sleep latest by 10.30 pm, or I can
expe=
ct a migraine the next day. Needless to say, sleeping early means I wake up=

early, and end up doing sadhana early- a habit I struggled to cultivate du=
e to
erratic working hours. Thanks to Mother Nature, I am now pretty much f=
orced to
obey what I call basic 'yoga rules' - not skipping meals (disturbs=
 my vata
dosha!), sleeping on time- basically being more disciplined. I fee=
l that She is
standing over me with a stick, forcing me to get to bed on ti=
me and eat
sensibly!<br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=3D"none">
Regarding the e=
ffects on the practice on my mind, the old enemies (anger, envy,
etc) still=
 rear their ugly heads, but I am more aware of them- and am now a bit
bette=
r at keeping them in control. Still have plenty of work to do before they
a=
re completely eliminated.<br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=3D"none">
I am happy=
 that (by coincidence) the finishing date of the purascharana happens
to be=
 mid-Navaratri. I am planning to start an anushthana of the Navarna mantra
=
tomorrow. I plan to do japa of the Navarna mantra- three malas a day- for j=
ust
over a year to complete 125,000 repetitions (supposedly the minimum for=
 any
anusthana). I plan to keep up the Ashtakshari mantra too at 7 malas a =
day.<br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=3D"none">
I am now on a tridosha pacifyin=
g diet in the hope that the migraines will improve.
I am also going to try =
to sleep even earlier (by 10 pm) in the hope that this
will enable me to wa=
ke up in brahma muhurtha daily (luckily sunrise in the UK
is at 7 am at pre=
sent!). <br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=3D"none">
A happy Navaratri to all of=
 you.<br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=3D"none">
Best wishes,<br clear=3D"none"=
