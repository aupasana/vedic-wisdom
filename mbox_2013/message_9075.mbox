Namaste,

I agree that Ayurveda would very likely be more effective than al=
lopathic medicine in the case of mental disorders. 

Allopathic medicine is=
 great in an acute emergency, such as massive bleeding after an accident, o=
r to deal with strokes and heart attacks, or when you've got a fast-growing=
 tumour somewhere. But Ayurveda excels at preventative medicine, and is als=
o pretty good in treatment of many non-acute chronic conditions.

Unfortuna=
tely there is very little emphasis on the science of eating in allopathic m=
edicine- something that has always surprised me. I've educated myself on th=
e basics of Ayurveda and have some understanding of the importance of the d=
igestive agni, the doshas, and the influence of different foods on the body=
 and mind. I've had a few ayurvedic treatments myself, and intend to study =
this subject further once I've completed my allopathic medical training.

I=
n the West (and certainly among Allopathic doctors, although Ayurveda is gr=
adually attracting interest, it is not yet as widely accepted as Acupunctur=
e (the efficacy of which has apparantly been proved by various studies). So=
 I can't really advice my patients to take Triphala or consult an Ayurvedic=
 doctor, much as I would like to- I'm simply not allowed to as Ayurveda is =
not yet "evidence-based medicine". I'm sure the time will come when studies=
 will prove the efficacy of Ayurvedic remedies and this science will become=
 more mainstream. In the meantime, what I can do, is emphasise some Ayurved=
ic principles to my patients- such as the importance of regular meal times,=
 freshly prepared food, and adequate sleep. I'm sure this would prevent a l=
ot of diseases from developing the first place. 

Thanks for the advice, it=
 is much appreciated. 

Om Dum Durgayai Namaha

Aparna

Forget about one with Kundalini experiences that one could not handle/diges=

to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Cons=
tant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the human=
 mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment=
, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc=
 etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now=
 self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more i=
ntense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good =
guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it c=
an also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, som=
e of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and gi=
ven half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They tak=
e hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the =
same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more
> >>  vital. 4 - While =
someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti =
awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this=
. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insuffici=

lps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various =
reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can al=
low free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances o=

blities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, =
even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right kno=

ing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of some=
one who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundali=

 energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kun=
dalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We h=
ave not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests nor=
mal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we=

 and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really =
is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in th=

 It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the kund=
