In this continual chain of karmic events (thru thought, word and action), h=
ow does one know what is cause vs. effect? How can one know if we are initi=
ating a new karmic chain vs. merely experiencing the effect of a previous k=
armic event? Whether we are creating a new "rnanubandha/karmic debt" vs. pa=
ying off a previous karmic debt?
