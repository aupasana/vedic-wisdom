Namaste,
My friend's=C2=A0 daughter ( aged 23 yrs) sometimes screams, cries=
 and wakes up suddenly from dreams in which she is chased, troubled ,beaten=
, shouted at or tortured. She also dreams of white and light - coloured =C2=
=A0snakes going round her.
This happens irrespective of the place where she=
 sleeps.
May I request the learned scholars to suggest a solution to this p=
roblem?
Regards,
Narayanarao

namaste,

There have a been a lot of replies to this question. I wa=
nted to share a suggestion that works along with any of these.

In all vaid=
ika karmas, there is a procedure called "pratisara-bandha". This is a raksh=
a bandhana where a cotton thread (optimally made of 9 strands) is energized=
 with mantras and then worn around the wrist so that a little of the mantra=
 shakti stays with you. A kalasha is established, with some vibhuti and a c=
otton thread placed to it's north. Then, Varuna is invoked in the kalasha, =
and then a number of vedic mantras are recited. At the end, we pray to Varu=
na once again, and then sprinkle the water from the kalasha on the yajamana=
 and the cotton thread. The cotton thread is then worn on the wrist (right =
hand for men, left hand for women) as an amulet, and the vibhuti is worn on=
 the forehead. 

The vaidika procedure specifies particular sets of mantras=
. In the bodhayana tradition, this starts with the rAkshoghnam (something t=
o destroy rAkshasas). However, you may use some other mantra in it's place.=
 If you are using the hanuman chalisa, as Narasimha suggested, you can chan=
t that mantra a number of times, and then wear the thread and vibhuti. Or, =
you could follow the Satayanarayana puja manual with the cotton thread and =
vibhuti near by, and then sprinkle the thread with water and then wear it a=
nd the vibhuti. You could even put a pot of water, think of Varuna, then do=
 a bunch of bhajans, and then wear the thread and sprinkle the water on the=
 area where you will be sleeping. The principle is the same.=C2=A0 

The pr=
ocedure for "pratisarabandha" specifically mentions disturbed sleep as an a=
pplication.

sasneham,

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 ajit
