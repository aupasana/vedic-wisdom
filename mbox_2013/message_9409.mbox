Durgesh  ji,

This is more or less the correct perspective.

There is a poe=

Vidhiyam Varum Kalam Thadupporarumilla
Kutamattavar Arum Il=

No human power can resist Fate
No man is freed from Nega=
tivity or Sin !

          Respected sir,
          With due regards I request yo=
u to shed some light upon the recent Uttarakhand tragedy. After the tragedy=
 it is now believed that the tragedy was due to shifting of Dhari devi temp=
le at Alaknanda river. I read some post by shri Manish ji and blog of shri =
sanjay rath ji. 
          My doubt is that, in present context how much it=
 is relevant that such tragedies do happen by a Devi wrath. As per our beli=
eve God is merciful and even in some of your post previously you have said =
that it is not worthwhile to connect tragedies with God or faith for Him?

         Hope you can elaborate this.

[vedic-wisdom] Re: doubt about svadharma


          Namaste Sir,

        =
  That is a variation satisfying the metre. But it is less apt, for the fol=
lowing reasons:

          (1) The word "tu" indicates some irony or contra=
st. If you say "He rules the bridge of dharma. Then again, he destroys the =
path of adharma", there is no such contrast. Basically, I see "tu" as a mis=
fit there.
          (2) Bhairava is not necessarily a deity destroying adh=
arma. In fact, he stands more for liberation and for destroying the distinc=
tion in one's mind between dharma and adharma. For example, he is depicted =
as roaming around naked drinking wine.

          BTW, observe the imagery.=
 Line before says "dharma setu pAlakaM" - the ruler of the bridge of dharma=
. Dharma is merely seen as a bridge here. Bridge to what? Obviously bridge =
over the sea of samsara and into infinite freedom. Bhairava not only contro=
ls the bridge, but his main purpose is to take one into infinite freedom fr=
om that bridge. Thus, swadharma mArga nAshakaM fits nicely following that l=
ine.

          BTW, some people may be tempted to worship and Bhairava and=
 emulate him by drinking wine or roaming naked in a smashan. That may not n=
ecessarily liberate one. Please note that Bhairava is not free because he d=
rinks wine and roams naked. He is already free and does those things becaus=
e he is free. In any case, even Bhairava, the deity of destroying right-wro=
ng distinctions in mind and ringing in liberation is described as "dharma s=
etu palaka"! Dharma is very important. Until you reach the shore of infinit=
e freedom, you HAVE to stay afloat of the ocean of samsara, by getting atop=
 the bridge of dharma! Otherwise you will sink in the ocean of samara, topp=
led by the waves of delusion. Though one needs to jump off the bridge in th=
e end, "the end" is not anywhere near for most people on earth and they bet=
ter realize it!


          This is why I (@homam108) tweeted a few weeks b=
ack that moksha is irrelevant to 99.9999% people. Instead of reading and th=
inking about moksha, think about dharma and do your dharma.


          Bes=
t regards,
          Narasimha

            Great question! Hoping you don't mind, I am forwarding this rep=
ly to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.

                    Yes, Sri Krishna did ad=
vise following swadharma (one's own dharma) at the beginning of Bhagavad Gi=
ta. But he also said in the last chapter "Roundly give up all dharmas and s=
urrender unto Me". When Bhairavashtakam says "swadharma maarga naashakam", =
it is getting at the same idea!

                    Based on who we are, o=
ur background, our deep desires and debts from the past (which we may not e=
ven remember now), and our current skills and resources, we all have our ow=
n personal (individual) dharmas (duties). We must fulfill those.

         =
           But performing swadharma is the start of sadhana. Eventually, on=
e should be able to perform swadharma without attachment to its fruits and =
later without even the sense of doership! Then comes a stage when one is no=
t even attached to the idea that "this is my dharma. I must do this". Whate=
ver Nature has placed one in a position to do, one does it detachedly, with=
 neither sadness/disappointment nor with happiness/excitement, but with the=
 spirit of "this is what Supreme Lord is doing through me at this instant".=
 One overcomes the notions that "I am so and so. I need to do so and so", g=
ives up one's own will and flows like a light leaf in the wind of samsara. =
Wherever one flows and whatever objects one touches, one sees it as the wil=
l of Supreme Lord and has no notions of one's own will or one's own duties.=
 That is the state of liberated enlightenment.


                    Bhaira=
va is extolled in Bhairavashtakam as the one who brings that state. Krishna=
 also teaches to get to that state, but he does so in the last chapter of B=
hagavad Gita. Before you get there, however, you may have to follow the ins=
tructions in previous chapters!

                    A lot of modern Hindu =
philosophy taught by many modern gurus, especially of the Vedantic bent, is=
 based on the final target rather than the path(s) one needs to walk, to ge=
t to the target. It assumes that you are already close to the target. It en=
ds up misleading and creating wrong notions in unprepared sadhakas like "al=
l is delusion", "everything is the same", "what you do does not matter". Th=
e greatness of Bhagavad Gita is that it talks about the path(s) as well as =
the target and has something relevant to everyone.



                    B=

          <P>Respected sir,<=
BR>With due regards I request you to shed some light 
          upon the re=
cent Uttarakhand tragedy. After the tragedy it is now 
          believed t=
hat the tragedy was due to shifting of Dhari devi temple at 
          Alak=
nanda river. I read some post by shri Manish ji and blog of shri 
         =
 sanjay rath ji. <BR>My doubt is that, in present context how much it 
    =
      is relevant that such tragedies do happen by a Devi wrath. As per our=
 
          believe God is merciful and even in some of your post previousl=
y you 
          have said that it is not worthwhile to connect tragedies w=
ith God or 
          faith for Him?<BR>Hope you can elaborate this.<BR><BR=
