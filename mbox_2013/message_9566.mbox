Dear Mr. Ajit,
=C2=A0
Just managed to locat=
e and study the page using the "Ramakrishna sacred thread" link that you me=
ntioned. Thanks a ton. It has served my purpose adequately - more than any =
intellectual internet banter. I don't see any further point in discussing t=
his topic.
=C2=A0
God bless.
K. Ramakrishnan

Dear Ramakrishnan,

>=C2=A0=
I have been feeling hindered in my spiritual progress due to the feel of th=
e sacred thread on my body during my sadhana.

 
If you feel that the sacre=
d thread hinders you, your clothes and underclothes must really, really hin=
der you. I'm partly joking, and partly serious.

Search google for "ramakri=
shna sacred thread", and click on the book result for "ramakrishna and his =
disciples". Don't just read the first 1 or 2 paragraphs. Keep reading to un=
derstand this episode in context. 

Narasimha has previously written on thi=
s topic (see the link below). If you search the archives, you will definite=
ly find other discussions as well.

sasneham,
