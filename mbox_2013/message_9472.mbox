What an outstanding email !!!

I second your thoughts.

I had thoughts very=
 similar to you. Later in life, pain and suffering became so intense that i=
 wanted God to be true even if it is someone else's idea. =C2=A0

re going with the idea that some kind of primordial consciousness expressed=
 duality....and projected ...created...or manifested what we know of as rea=
lity....and we presume a spark of it is us...so to speak....and it goes thr=
ough a long process to merge back with the whole...and its like the journey=
 never took place.....call it the cosmic dream if u will...

so we conceive=
 of duality as shiva and or sakthi..or yin and yang if u will....and at a c=
ertain moment in our existence...we feel some kind of urge to transcend....=
.and we try all methods to get there....

now all I know is.....something e=
xists...I cant say within or without me...I don't know even what me denotes=
..there is a body....and what could be labelled a mind....something that pr=
oceses thoughts and emotions...but all if it is running bye itself....there=
 doesn't seem to be an entity or what not in charge.....observe closely and=
 u will get what I,m saying.......

now I guess the question is...what is t=
he gist of this so called spiritual path???......could it not be that like =
snowflakes of nature...each one of us is no more than a momentary expressio=
n of consciousness?....why do we assume reincarnation to be true???

to who=
m do we worship???and what exactly does worship mean???and who is doing the=
 worship?.....

repeating some mystical mantra or name of something that ob=
viously cant be encapsulated in sound is considered by many to be spiritual=
ity..when obviously the mind that is repeating and running around at the sa=
me time is both one and the same...the whole process seems to me like a min=
d game....and we feel good about theses games....like we have done somethin=
g to get 1 step closer to divinity..can we get closer????isn't the cesspool=
 of sludge we make in the morning just as divine....and all the time in the=
 colon with us???....those who get the last statement would get it...the re=
st plse ignore...

and how come we have this idea that by japa,ing a gazill=
ion times some sari clad woman on a tiger is going to appear in a vision or=
 in front of us and make our existence free of suffering..and basically mak=
e everything O.K.?....

too many tamil movies perhaps?...u can also substit=
ute the sari clad woman for a man in blue with 4 arms...or a young stud on =
a peacock...ur preference....

and all for what?most of us are truly at the=
 end of the day motivated by some kind of gain...touch ur heart and tell me=
 it is not so???no carrot in front of the donkey it wont move......

tell m=
e honestly....how can u have love for something u don't know and have not e=
xperienced in any way???your bakthi is probably something u conjured up in =
ur head....and at best....an expression of ur existantial longings....

we =
are all lonely and miserable at heart....and add to that the suffering of b=
eing human.....

so shall end this rant...with the question I began with...=
.what the f is going on guys???who what and where r we?????????????????????=
???????????????that is the question isn't it....and maybe also why......the=
 day we stop asking,and accept someone elses idea as truth.....we stopped s=

the search isn't over till the fat cosmic lady sings........god bl=
