Namaste Narasimha,

"Have a great solar eclipse! This is a really nice oc=
casion for extra 
meditation or extra homam or extra contemplation or extra=
 
philosophization."

Do you have do anything different in the homam during=
 an eclipse? e.g.

1) Do you offer naivedyam? If yes, should one cook/prepa=
re that before the eclipse starts and consume it after the eclipse is over?=

2) Do you use a murti/idol to invoke the deity or should one just invoke t=
he deity in the fire?

Thanks,
Chandraprakash

=C2=A0
There may be some confusion regarding "=
poornavatara".
=C2=A0
As Parasara used it, the term "poornavatara" does NOT=
 mean "the most complete or perfect avatara". It means a completely divine =
avatara with no jivamsa. There can be more than one poornavataras. They are=
 not necessarily "equal".
=C2=A0
To give a simplisitc analogy, some jewller=
y may be gold mixed with some amount of copper. If one jewllery is 100% pur=
e gold, it does not mean it contains all the gold in the
 world. It only me=
ans it has nothing other than gold. Similarly, the four poornavataras menti=
oned by Parasara are 100% divine and do not contain jivamsa. It does not me=
an they contain "all the divinity" in cosmos.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

=C2=A0
=
In fact, the very notion that any one form can be "the most complete or per=
fect avatara" or "one that personifies entire divinity of Supreme Being" or=
 "one equal to Supreme Being" is unacceptable and inconsistent with SB 1.3.=
30-31, which says that ANY form of Supreme Being is like a cloud in the sky=
, while Supreme Being is like the sky containing all possible clouds.
=C2=
=A0
Supreme Being is endowed with infinite qualities. Any form contains a f=
inite number of those qualities. So no form can be "equal to" Supreme Being=
. SB 1.3.30-31 is clear in that regard.
=C2=A0
If one form is "equal to" su=
preme being and others are
 not, you can conclude that that form is "the be=
st". If neither form is "equal to" supreme being, how can you really compar=
e the different qualities of two forms?

=C2=A0
Anyway=
, this renders your (3) a meaningless issue. Whether that line refers to Kr=
ishna alone or not is irrelevant, for, in either case, "swayam bhagavan" ca=
nnot mean "a personification of the entirety of supreme being". Before you =
wonder whether it refers to Krishna alone or not, first figure out what "sw=
ayam bhagavan" actually means, in a way that is not inconsistent with verse=
s that follow! If no form is "equal to" supreme being and every form is a "=
subset" of supreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of "swa=
yam bhagavan"???

=C2=A0
Regarding (4), Parasara
 iden=
tified 4 avataras as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, and identified the sourc=
e of divinity in each of them. He only gave objective information and did n=
ot give any subjective judgment on who is the best, which Suta apparently d=
id.
=C2=A0
I have not read BV Purana. If you can quote some verses before a=
nd after, I can comment. Any comparison between avataras WILL have to be un=
der some subjective context. I don't know the context of Suta's statement y=
ou allude to.
=C2=A0
Though any comparison is subjective, I will be surpris=
ed if someone considers the other two poornavataras of Vishnu as the "best"=
 avataras. But, I will not be surprised if different people consider Rama a=
nd Krishna as the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon are the luminaries an=
d show soul and mind, which clearly have a primary significance compared to=
 other aspects of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna are bound to be seen a=
s the best by different people. However, what Suta
 apparently said can onl=
y be a subjective view under some context.

Reg=
arding (2): Kala means a part or a phase. Moon has 16 phases (representing =
16 tithis, including Amavasya and Pournima), but Sun has only one phase - h=
e is always full and bright!
=C2=A0
Just like Moon, mind has many moods, ev=
en a perfected one. A perfected mind goes through those moods with full awa=
reness of underlying reality, whereas an imperfect mind experiences them un=
der delusion. But it is the nature of Moon/mind to have variations. Sun/sou=
l OTOH has no such variations.
=C2=A0
Krishna may show Vishwaroopa oneday, =
run away from battlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandha), do amazing miracle=
s oneday and play clever tricks another day. There is a lot more variety to=
 his personality than Rama's. Now, does that make him better or worse than =
Rama? Well, that is
 a *subjective* matter.

=
Regarding (1): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is present in several beings=
 such a planets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the wor=
ld appearance in consciousness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So they =
stand for different qualities of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance. =
So Vishnu's avataras are associated with grahas. But Pararsara said that av=
ataras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings (e=
.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre und=
erstanding what various deities stand for, what forces play a role in creat=
ing, sustaining and destroying the world appearance in consciousness. Peopl=
e talk too much about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there is hardly any underst=
anding of Veda. When it comes to Puranic stories, we think in terms of
 sup=
erficial stories and not in terms of how it maps to what happens in conscio=
usness.
=C2=A0
Mohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Maheshwari. Nara & Narayan=
a were incarnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu + Shiva). I don't kno=
w about Dhanvantari and will pass for today. Dattatreya again was an incarn=
ation of Shiva + Vishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incarnation of great serpe=
nt Adi Sesha (like Lakshmana).
=C2=A0
We need to go deeper into what they a=
ll stand for esoterically and what role they play in the functioning of con=
sciousness, to understand this more. Hopefully another day..

=C2=A0
Adwaitins who are skeptical about notions taught by Parasar=
a (paramatmamsa, jivatmamsa, different sources of paramtmamsa etc) should r=
ealize one thing. Though all is Brahman, all did not come from Brahman in o=
ne step. It all evolved in many steps
 and correspondingly there are some s=
teps in the process of liberation!
=C2=A0
If a character in my dream tonigh=
t overcomes its conditioning in the dream, it will simply merge back into m=
y mind and not into Brahman yet. Of course, it cannot do even that until I =
actually will it. It is after all a character created and sustained in my m=
ind!
=C2=A0
Same thing applies to us!
=C2=A0
Vedanta is not wrong. But it i=
s relevant and applicable at "anta", i.e. the end. Most of us may not yet b=
e anywhere near "the end".

BTW, I distinguish=
ed between Vishnu and 
Narayana above. If you study Narayana sooktam and Vi=
shnu Sooktam, you 
can understand the difference. In Vaishnava traditions, =
they are 
considered one, but, strictly speaking, that is inaccurate. Of co=
urse, 
you can reach Narayana through Vishnu. But then, you can reach Naray=
ana 
through Rudra or Bhairava as well!

World accepts 10 avataras whe=

 of evolution). Even those who are uncomfortable with Buddha replace him wi=

>>>=C2=A0
>>>Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquia=

y beyond what any normal human being can achieve, came into existence from =
the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate Go=
d=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity betwe=
en terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the G=
ita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Va=
ishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, =
Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest =
known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differing n=
uances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krsh=
na as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a =
measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana a=
nd the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,
 like the Gaudiya Vais=
hnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and decl=
ared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as N=
arayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately =
linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshn=
a, not as a separate Divity in himself.
>>>=C2=A0
>>>Whatever the case mayb=
e, each school had its own set of established saints and scholars to vouch =
for their views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which is often, as yo=
u rightly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.

consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya". In t=
he next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt =
in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *c=

>>>>>3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. M=
atysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha=
) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence =
of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic=
, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the=
 dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of this =
earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashur=
ama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the N=
irguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to =
be separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the va=
rious manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness a=
nd its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth=
 and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature's grand design for life on
 =
earth.

worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation o=
f the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata=

>>>>>=C2=A05. Of these, naturally=
, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of evoluti=
on, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier=
, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A sa=
twic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the animal ten=
dencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a grea=
ter purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be ins=
tances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will =
change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Ra=
ma did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a =
moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Ags=
atha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of t=
he final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he k=
illed Ravana not to rescue her, but it
 was the Dharma to do so, and to unh=
old his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, f=
amily honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the gen=
ius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe,=
 as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhe=
re, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into hi=
s killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that =
no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadhar=
ma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had t=
his immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 super=
natural feats into account. It is his singular and constant detachment from=
 situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances that mark hi=
s life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. Al=
l his friends, his foster parents,
 his village-folks who so loved him, ple=
aded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, lov=
e and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into an unknown d=
estiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understoo=
d that they won't understand, he promised he will return back once his work=
 in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis c=
ame to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the mo=
ment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he remo=
ved himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equa=
lly and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshn=
a, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and countin=
g. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's hea=
d and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna=
 of being a revolutionist
 and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Dur=
yodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to a=
rrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet h=
e did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his=
 own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of h=
is going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or la=
ck of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others say or think o=
f him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect =
equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his=
 life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by defini=
tion can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the re=
sults belong to the instrument. When running away from the battle-field and=
 killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, o=
r gesturing Bheema
 to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi=
 to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how t=
he situations must be lined up which would cause the destruction of these p=
eople. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But hap=
pens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Universal Forc=
e. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at =
least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or=
 such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In =
the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he ki=
lls Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 he=
aded demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the =
Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment=
 of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of sa=
twa, chief
 of which is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness cau=
sed due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was de=
stroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can als=
o cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He ha=
d no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, frien=
d, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotio=
n. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha =
was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the sc=
heme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a s=
tatic realization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality=
 of this earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna esp=
oused. None of them negated this world. If negation of this world and life =
is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of
 evolu=
tionary development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Bu=
ddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less=
 impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line t=
hat these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As =
such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to=
 be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both stat=
ic and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the =
Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body=
 of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The ori=
ginal literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are cen=
ters of psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, =
or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of=
 the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full
 power and forc=
e of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can mod=
ify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself =
is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point an=
d not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evo=
lution are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8.=
 I cannot comment on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I=
 know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagr=
ee with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understan=
ding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among=
 the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda see=
ms to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is on=
ly one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunat=
ita awastha comes living in the full and complete
 purity and might and for=
ce and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avat=
ara will burn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of=
 evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life =
to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won't even need that. The whi=
te horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enou=
gh to rectify the various errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, =
this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agre=
e with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is clos=
er to truth. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi
