that is the view of the bhakti scholars. but that is only one of the views. for me this was ma kali unleashing her destructive power. this is srishti sthiti (pra)laya kreeda. responsible for ending life on earth is no more than a play for her. one would think why punish innocents and those who were her bhaktas but that is pure destruction. if a 15ft wall of water washed over kedarnath it was pure destruction and even though i am extremely sorrowful for the tragedy and immense personal losses i cannot help but stand in awe of ma kali. what has been done has been done. lately our government has been meddling too much including opening of padmanabhaswamy cellars, destroying dhari devi temple and what not. those who do not know kalika well enough should not even approach her. these temples were estblished to bring prosperity one cannot try to kill his or her mother and expect she wont get angry because she loves you. she loves you not your ego and material
 greed.
