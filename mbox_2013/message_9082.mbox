 then how do we change what's fundamentally in this pool? How will one's pr=
ayer of "Destroy my dushkarma" to their beloved deity manifest? Does it man=
ifest by reducing one's propensity to dushta karma from that moment on, or =
does it manifest by actually removing dushta karma from the existing pool? =
If there was no way to remove dushta karma from the existing karma pool (as=
 you seem to indicate below), then what's the meaning of Prayashchita?

47> Prarabda karma is which was already done and sanchitha and agami a=
re what we going to do  . Prarabda karma need not be the karma wh=
ich was done yesterday or some 10 days or months back . A   =
soul goes through millions of births and deaths and in  each =
; birth   goes through millions  of experiences . In that so=
journ there could be many good and bad deeds . The nature's law  is no=
thing goes waste . Each and every  thing  ,whether by words or th=
oughts or by actions is recorded  and has to be accounted for .Soul is=
 immortal and imperishable .So it has to repay for its doings ,and thus the=
 karmic debts have to be paid and in some areas karmic credits have to be r=
eceived . A chain is a chain whether it is of gold or of iron .Hence we
 ar=
e  bound by our deeds  some in the form of punishments ,some in t=
he form of rewards .In astrology these traits are shown in good periods and=
 bad periods .  So after doing remedial  measures we can reduce t=
o certain extent the intensity of the effect of bad karma ,but totally we c=
an't get rid of the bad effect in case of prarabda karma . But for every th=
ing there is an exception and we are not taking the case of exceptions . In=
 so far as sanchitha and agami karmas are concerned ,that is what we a=
re accumulating and going to accumulate ,our Ishtadevatha , stands by =
us and our intense trust and faith in her and the sadhana we do  ,will=
 burn away the seeds of vasanas. What we do day become vasana at a later da=
te. Vasanas lead to samskarams ,samskarams lead to actions again actions be=
come vasanas ,thus this is all an endless circle .If we are in deep debts a=
nd while repaying the debts ,if we donot incur further debts we
 become fin=
ally  free of debts . Alternatively in some extraordinary cases we may=
 get a help from known or unknown quarters which helps us to get rid of our=
 debts .That is possible ,though  the chances are very rare . Ishtadev=
atha stands by us in doing this ,by burning the vasanas ,by making not to c=
ommit mistake further and by giving strebgth in facing the ordeals  an=
d  by going in the righteous path against all odds .  regards&nbs=
