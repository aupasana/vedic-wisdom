The question has 3 parts:
1. If the walls turn black due to doing homam, do=
es it amount in Vastu Dosha?
2. In the place doing homam, can we have instr=
uments that use lot of water? (like washing machine)
3. How do we reduce th=
e smoke?

Let me answer based on my judgement/limited knowledge:
1. No. In =
olden days, kitchen walls were always black! If that was not a problem, thi=
s would not be a problem as well. Only thing you may want to check out is w=
hich portion of the house you are doing homam? If that place is suitable fo=
r cooking/puja, don't bother about what others say.
Not to undermine the pe=
rson who told you, but these days, we get lot of people with half-knowledge=
/no knowledge giving out their expert opinions.
These days you never find a=
 flat that is actually compliant to the vastu principles. An attached bath =
room/toilet is not allowed as per strict vastu rules. So, every thing is re=
lative and you should learn to ignore some of the so called claims of breac=
h of Vastu.

2. I trust this is not a problem either. In fact, doing Homam =
close to water bodies is good.So, having a machine that uses water is not g=
oing to be a problem either.

3. Using more ghee will actually cause more s=
moke - smoke comes more when the fire is going off. When you put more ghee,=
 the material burns fast and fire will be ready to go-off fast. Then you wi=
ll have to put more ghee. This way your concentration will be affected. Eas=
y way is to use stuff that burn with out much oil like dry-coconut, marmara=
, til, ensure that the fire is of decent size and then give as little ghee =
as possible to let the fire continue. Then in the end once you are done, mo=
ve the homa kundam to a place that can handle smoke better.

Best regards,
