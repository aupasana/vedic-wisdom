Alongside homam at home, I was interested in a learning a a simple techniqu=
e for puja at home and came across an author A.V. Srinivasan while searchin=
g online. I purchased his books on Krishna and Durga puja recently and was =
quite happy with the straightforward instructions and explanation of variou=
s mantras. 

Overall I have a good impression of his books and would reccom=
end them to anyone who wants to learn how to do a simple yet complete puja.=
 I actually downloaded them via the itunes store and literally read off my =
ipad as I haven't memorised all the mantras yet- this works quite well. 

T=
his site contains an extract of the Krishna puja book 
http://www.hindubook=
s.org/religious/pujatokrishna/index.html

If anyone has recommendations for=
 other books, or websites on puja at home, please let me know. 

Hope the n=
ew year has started well everybody. Hope 2013 brings spirtual progress to e=
ach one of us. Personally, I'm going to try and make this a year of action =
i.e. spending more time doing homam/japa/puja and less time reading spiritu=
al books (though this is also important). 

Best wishes,

Aparna
