Dear Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
Thank you for "slightly disagreeing with the statemen=
t on RajaYoga" and helping me fine-tune something I may not have expressed =
well!
=C2=A0
The basics of Raja yoga such as good focus, self-control (firs=
t over the body, through controlling food, posture, sitting still with an e=
rect back etc and then over mind) do help one in any path. There is nothing=
 risky in them per se. In fact, homam manuals do emphasize some of the Raja=
 yoga basics.
=C2=A0
What I was trying to caution against was to rely on Ra=
ja yoga all the way for realization.
=C2=A0
In any case, there ARE bound to=
 be some who succeed mainly through Raja Yoga even in this age. I am only s=
uggesting that Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga are suitable for many more people=
. Those who are attracted to Raja Yoga and Jnana Yoga and are comfortable/c=
onfident enough may of course proceed.
=C2=A0
Yes, Swami Vivekananda was a =
great Raja Yogi. So was Swami Sivananda of Hrishikesh, though he is also kn=
own as a great Jnani, Karmuka and Bhakta!
=C2=A0Best regards,

Narasimha

 nature: external and internal. Do this=

>=C2=A0
>Here are my 2 cents.
>=C2=A0
=
>Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasize=
s on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mas=
tery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can =
pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However, w=
isdom, detached action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not m=
utually exclusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, others=
 will automatically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in "Y=
oga" or oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.
>=C2=A0
>Fo=
rget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of =
that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Rama=
krishna advised
 against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psyc=
hic life force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and cle=
an nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate gre=
at amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just=
 my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna"=
 (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his =
sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not e=
ncourage even him to practice it.
>=C2=A0
>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but the=
re is a distinct danger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdo=
m. People of this age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is eas=
y to delude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it=
 doesn't matter. It's all a delusion anyway" without fully overcoming all i=
nnate conditioning that reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. =
Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a movie that "it's just a movie and not r=
eality", but flinching in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc.=
 Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be pro=
blematic too. A long path of constant contemplation and self-correction can=
 be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the end.

people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and sa=

v>Many great spiritual commentators, who are also founders of various sects=
 within hinduism have commented and written purports on the Gita. And each =
of these celebrated commentators have strongly disagreed with each other on=
 various crucial points of interpretation of what the text says. Some have =
read it to conclude that "X" yoga is better or higher than "Y" yoga, or A p=
hilosophy is the right way to look at reality instead of Y philosophy, or
 =
interpreted words/phrases in a sense that,sometimes does not make sense. An=

ing all this can be confusing. Rather IMHO the Gita looks more like a book =
of progressive arguments. Each section builds up into the next. It is not o=

realized people.<br> <br>Indeed, one can carve one's own niche by comb=
ining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.<br> =
;<br>I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where he makes =
a comment on the 4 paths:<br> <br>"Each soul is potentially divine. Th=
e goal is to manifest this divinity within by controlling
 nature: external=
 and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or phi=
losophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free."<br> <br>Her=
e are my 2 cents.<br> <br>Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization an=
d wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasize=
s on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and =
surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to de=
velop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and surr=
ender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities =
develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a r=
ealized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualitie=
s fully blossomed.<br> <br>Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, =
nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja y=
oga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controlling =
body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requi=
res strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, wa=
ter and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga =
can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly=
 taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMH=
O). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taugh=
t it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.<br>&nbs=
p;<br>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling in=
to the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere=
/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I a=
m Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion =
anyway" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces du=
ality in consciousness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a m=
ovie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in every scary=
 scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely =
and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant=
 contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jum=
p to the end.<br> <br>IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga a=
