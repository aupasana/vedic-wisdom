namaste,


> how to perform a simple purification of landed property?


A couple of traditions prescribe how to do the "griha pravesha". Here is a
simple description of what's involved.

First, approach the house with auspicious items, and enter it with a lit
fire (eg. lamp). This fire is then established in the house. Next, a big
pot of water is filled with water, and a vastu homam is performed. After
the homam, the house is sprinkled inside and out with the water from the
pot.

In South India, after entering the house, the first thing that is done is
to boil some milk on the stove. Some people specifically ensure that the
milk boils over and a little falls out of the pot. One of the books I
consulted has a nice prescription -- "anyasmAt pachanAt pUrvam gRhamadhye
carum pacet". Before any normal cooking happens in the house, first cook
the 'caru' in the homa fire, and offer it to the fire. In olden days, there
was no stove, and all cooking was also done on a fire. Some people had a
separate fire for cooking and homam. Others had a single fire in which they
cooked and did homam. As part of the griha pravesha homa, they cooked
something first in the homa fire (same as cooking fire), and offered some
of it into the fire. It is entirely possible that this became simplified
and the tradition of cooking the caru and offering it into the fire turned
into heating some milk on the stove and then letting it spill on top of the
stove !

Here is a simple procedure that tries to retain the spirit of the "rules".
Enter the house with a lamp. Put it where you want to do your regular
homam, and establish a kalasha nearby. As part of your naivedya, keep some
milk in a small pot as close to the homa kunda as possible (so that it can
absorb the heat and get "cooked"). Do your regular homa. If you know how,
offer some ahutis with the mantras for vatoshpati. When you do the
naivedya, offer a little of the milk into the fire (if and only if your
fire is big enough so that it won't get extinguished). After the homam is
over, take the water and sprinkle it all over the house. Drink the milk as
the prasadam.

sasneham,
