Dear Shri Vishnu Ji,

Namasthe

 

1.       I am pleased to read your write-up. If you kindly permit me, I
would like to share my understanding for your kind perusal please. Though it
is said that wise people never speak unless prompted for, yet I would like
to indulge in breaking that adage for the general welfare and clarity of
understandings of your noble self and other noble members of this blessed
group.

 

2.       I feel humility is a word referred to a particular symptoms or
observation made on a person with a particular "state of existence". In
other words, a particular state of existence can create some visible
symptoms/actions/behavior which we compactly refer to as "humility". This
state of existence = respect for each and every entity.

 

3.       So here comes another vocabulary - "respect". I feel "respect" is a
word similar to humility. When you respect each entity, you are being
humble.

 

4.       Now respect for each entity is the appreciation, understanding of
the inherent value/significance of each entity, and acting in accordance
with it in an appropriate manner. Now this surely means you must have the
"knowledge" about each entity. Knowledge in simple terms means clarity or
clear vision, wherein you can see the exact or true nature of that entity.
Now, clear vision is obtained when we have eyes and light both. Absence of
even one will cause blindness or blindness-like darkness. So it is very
clear that eye of knowledge(gnyaana chakshu) with the light of the eternal
surya Brahman will enable you to see and hence appreciate and hence respect
and hence accord appropriate actions towards that entity which is referred
to compactly as "humility".

 

5.       Having shared my understanding so far, Can I humbly request you to
explain to me how karma yoga(a process) can yield "humility"(an end
product), as per your understanding? When Krishna and Arjuna were waging
wars, slaying the opponent, very surely both were involved in karma yoga,
but definitely not being humble. Do you mean to say that when I slay my
opponent-it is a humility?

 

6.       I would like-wise request your noble self to kindly have a re-look
at your other understandings, and kindly try to have a better perspective of
the truth.

 

7.       If you are a true-seeker of truth, I would take delight in sharing
my understandings. If you are just happy with what you have now, I would
just say thanks and Namasthe.

 

8.       If you get hurt by this, I would beg your kind pardon, and request
you to stop the debate here itself, because I am not interested in getting
personal.

 

Warm Regards,

Kannan

 

.
