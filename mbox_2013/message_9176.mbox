Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
One already on the top of a mountain may tell you, =
"the best way to enjoy the scenery below is to sit still and watch it". If =
you are already atop the hill, that may indeed be the right advice for you.=
 But, if you are at the bottom of the hill, sitting still may not work for =
you. There is no scenery to be seen. The best thing for you may be to run/c=
limb as fast as you can.
=C2=A0
A lot of statements by masters and scriptur=
es meant for specific situations are often misunderstood by people who miss=
 the context.
=C2=A0
"shama damaadi saMskR^itaM manaH", i.e. a mind refined=
 by equanimity and self-restraint, is the pre-requisite for a lot of things=
 higher scriptures mention. For most people, external rituals, elaborate pr=
actices etc are unavoidable in order to develop that. Exactly what one need=
s to do depends on where one is. There are many paths to climb the mountain=
 and some may be too far for you (i.e. on the other side of the mountain) a=
nd some may be nearer. But there is no question that you have to pick some =
path and start walking. No matter how much you read, even if it is written =
by someone who was on the top of the mountain for a long time, you will rem=
ain at the base of the mountain if you don't walk yourself.

=C2=A0Best reg=
ards,

Narasimha

 my most humble opinion, there is no universal better or lesser path of wor=
ship. It all depends on the soul doing it. Since the reality is Infinite in=
 nature, the number, manner and mechanism of approach is also equally vast =
and infinite. It all depends on that specific soul who is doing the act of =
worship, be it dhyan, or chanting mantras or worship of idols. Even the ver=
y act of living life as we know can, for the right kind of soul, make it ap=
proach closer to the Reality without using any special mechanism, like sitt=
ing and meditating or doing puja or chanting mantra. All depends on the sou=
l. So best is to find out what works best for oneself. What may work for on=
e may not work for another.

Here I would like to tell=
 you one Shiva Saivite Nayanar devotee of Shiva in<br>
the year 1100 AD by =
name Poosalar built a temple for Shiva in his heart and<br>
the king of tha=
t time for that area also built similar temple physically.<br>
Both fixed t=
he date for consecration of temples on the same day. Shiva in<br>
the dream=
 of king told him that he would be attending the function of his<br>
devote=
e who had built a temple for him than built by the King.<br>

king.<br>=

Correct, if the mind involved is highly purified and=
 has a good level of<br>
shama and dama (equanimity and self-restraint).<br=
>
 <br>
When we make offerings externally (e.g. to an idol), mind is distra=
cted by<br>
so many external things and unlikely to be fully focused on the=
 act. When a<br>
highly purified mind makes offerings internally, it is pos=
sible for it to be<br>
highly focused on the visualization. That can indeed=
 be more effective.<br>
 <br>
However, until one reaches such a stage, it i=
s quite useful (and often<br>
unavoidable) to engage in external and materi=
al offerings. A mind that is<br>
unfocused and distracted needs some object=
s and actions to anchor it and<br>
make it somewhat focused and disciplined=
.<br>
