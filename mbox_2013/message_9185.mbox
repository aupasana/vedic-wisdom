Namaste

Can anyone let me know that reading Sri Devi Khadgamala Stotra has=
 any restrictions of age, sex ( M/F)?

I am reading it for couple of days a=
nd didn't had any difference as because in return I am not expecting any ma=
gic from the mother except her acceptance of my little prayer to her. But s=
omeone told me that I should not read it as I am still young and married pe=
ople should not read it as it has many beej mantras in it and reading it wi=
ll gather me many doshas.


Please let me the truth behind as I really like=
 the Stotram and would like to continue it.


Regards
Shreya
