Namaste Madam,
=C2=A0
Avoiding anger by suppressing it or keeping maun is o=
k in the short term, but mind remembers things, contemplates them and ratio=
nalizes them later (sometimes much later). It, of course, always looks at t=
hings from its own angle. If one forms a balanced understanding based on a =
compassionate understanding of the picture from various angles, one will di=
gest the experience better and it is unlikely to cause troubles later. Just=
 undigested or ill-digested food becomes toxic and causes problems to physi=
cal health, undigested and ill-digested emotions and experiences become tox=
ic and cause problems to mind.
=C2=A0
Succumbing to a temptation or weaknes=
s is a problem. But what makes it worse and long-lasting in effect is refle=
cting on it all the time with shame or revulsion. Pride and shame are 2 sid=
es of the same coin and destabilize the mind. Do your best beforehand to av=
oid an undesirable action. If you fail anyway, acknowledge it and move on. =
Don't relive that action in the mind all the time, for it serves no purpose=
. Just resolve (and hope) to handle the same situation better next time and=
 move on. We are after all human and may need a long time to overcome weakn=
esses.
=C2=A0
Yes, cooking fresh food everyday is the best thing to do. How=
ever, I had to prioritize various tasks that demand my time and make some c=
ompromises. I cook once every 3 days or so, reheat it and eat it. Moreover,=
 even vegetables etc lose their prana due to cold storage in this country (=
even before you buy them). If one has a chance, growing ingredients fresh a=
nd cooking and eating without ever refrigerating is ideal.

=C2=A0
I used t=
o sleep for just 3-4 hours everyday for several years. For the last year or=
 two, I increased it to 5-6 hours. This works fine for me. However, recomme=
nded sleep is 4-5/6-7/7-8 hours for kapha/pitta/vata persons.

=C2=A0
Best =
regards,
Narasimha
