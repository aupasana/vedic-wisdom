Couple of weeks ago 34 people died in Indonesia in a mine. The mine-roof co=

What is the reason behind it?

For hurrican=

For Uttarakhand tragedy, people came up with theory that some temple (=

PVR Ji came up with the theory of "wall has been moved"=

=C2=A0 
Respected PVR ji,
Namaste and thanks for an e=
ye-opener again from you.
Some where, some what we all are responsible and =
adding towards the dis-balance of 'prakrati'. I can say that prakrati retal=
iates if things go much beyond control, for example even our body retaliate=
s (by causing disease) towards our misdoing (may be in form of bad eating o=
r any other action).
I suppose there is a physical as well as a cosmic equi=
librium. the physical equilibrium is sustained by some cosmic forces (or fo=
rces of nature, we can name them whatever we like to). Once these forces ar=
e being challenged or disturbed then the physical equilibrium is also distu=
rbed or a dis-balance is created. such dis-balances can result into various=
 painful events or tragedies.=C2=A0
what i understood from this tragedy is =
that, in India there is a serious infiltration to some major shrines and pl=
aces with high cosmic vibrations. For example if we check the recent stats =
the increase in visitors to major shrines rises drastically. and many of us=
, just visit these shrines for enjoyment/holiday and not for the actual pur=
pose. Almost every month we have one or two deaths at Banke Bihari temple (=
Vrindavan) due to stampede or choking in crowd but these are neglected by t=
he authorities there. Not only Vrindavan or Mathura, but many other such pl=
aces in India become famous picnic/holiday spots.
I am not sure about the p=
resent Kaali phase, but what ever is going on will bring more pain to us in=
 some form or the other.
I hope more light will be shown to us from people =
like you to sustain this phase.

Best Regards
Ashish K.Agarwal

Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
A 2 cents on a few different points related to th=
is topic.

=C2=A0
(1) Suppose some of my children are living in a house tha=
t is right next to a big river and a big wall with my picture painted on it=
 is protecting the=C2=A0
house from the river water. Suppose they become st=
upid and decide to 
"move" that wall somewhere else. Suppose the house is t=
hen ruined by the river.
=C2=A0
Is it that I became wrathful because a wall=
 with "my 
picture" painted on it was moved (suggesting that I am so attach=
ed to that picture)? Or is it that I loved them, but they 
were stupid enou=
gh to remove their protection and paid for it?
=C2=A0
(2)
The word "dhArI" =
is from the root "dhR", which means to hold, maintain, preserve. The word "=
dhArI" literally means one who holds things together. Dhaari Devi stands fo=
r the
 protective force that holds various complex forces in a delicate 
eq=
uilibrium. Because this temple contains the upper half of the torso 
and th=
e bottom half is worshipped at another location as "Kaali", people may thin=
k of her as Kaali. But the goddess who was moved is the goddess of protecti=
on and balance. This is a case of withdrawal of protection in a delicate eq=
uilibrium rather than wrath, thought it may seem like the latter.
=C2=A0
(3=
) Some deities like Kaali, Bhairavi, Dhoomavati etc may indeed by associate=
d with fierce destruction. However, the stereotypical image some people may=
 have of such deities as wrathful, out-of-control, irritable persons is ina=
ccurate.
=C2=A0
Everyday billions of cells in our bodies become useless. Th=
ey block other good cells from functioning. Body has an elaborate system to=
 "kill" them, flush them out of the system and recycle the elements in them=
, i.e. create new cells. This is a natural process and one without which li=
fe is will be far less pleasant/sustainable. The force behind this natural =
process is not irritable or angry. It is just
 something very thoughtful, w=
ise and elaborate. But, if we personify that force, its actions of killing =
billions of cells and flushing them out may indeed make it look like an ang=
ry and irritable person!
=C2=A0
Deities such as Kaali and Bhairavi are pers=
onifications of the forces behind this natural process of destruction, elim=
ination and recycling, within the "macrocosm". Remove the stereotypes from =
your mind to gain a better understanding of these deities and genuine love =
for them (and not fake love out of necessity and fear).
=C2=A0
(4) First of=
 all, let us accept that shifting a temple that was established specificall=
y for protecting this region was an unwise and bad karma. Yet, it is not 10=
0% clear whether what happened is a direct consequence. In this case, it ma=
y very well be. But the bigger point I want to make is that we do not reall=
y know which karmaphala is arising from which karma. We often draw convenie=
nt conclusions based on our
 beliefs, agendas and conditioning.
=C2=A0
For =
example, when hurricane Sandy happened in northeast US, some Christian cons=
ervative commentators in US said that states that were legalizing gay marri=
age were facing the wrath of God! They probably believed it genuinely. It w=
as perhaps perfectly logical for the image of "god" constructed in their ow=
n minds to do it!! But, it may be a silly idea given the image of god const=
ructed in the mind of someone else.
=C2=A0
God is infinite and un-knowable.=
 We all have an *evolving* finite image of god in our finite and conditione=
d minds based on our own *evolving* sense of good and bad, strong and weak,=
 desirable and undesirable, etc. It is wise not to second guess god and ass=
ociate specific karmas with specific karmaphalas, for we can never know wit=
h certainty.
=C2=A0
Having said that, a bad karma can be avoided whether or=
 not it caused a specific karma phala or not!
=C2=A0
(5) Though everyday
 b=
illions of new cells are created in our bodies, billions of old cells are k=
illed and flushed out and trillions of cells sustained, some periods before=
 periodic rejuvenation bring more destruction than usual.
=C2=A0
I do belie=
ve that the world is going through such a "Kaali phase" right now. It proba=
bly will continue for another decade or less. However, relocation of a temp=
le is very small problem compared to bigger problems that the Mother of fin=
e balance must handle in this world right now, to come up with a more susta=
inable equilibrium!
=C2=A0
Human beings are arrogantly and foolishly ruinin=
g their own environment, under the delusion that it is ok. A powerful minor=
ity is spreading unnatural and unsustainable lifestyles everywhere in the w=
orld, under the delusion of speading "civilization" and "development". The =
food
 people eat, the drinks people dump in their bodies and the air people=
 breathe, are increasingly polluted with dangerous chemicals.
=C2=A0
In the=
 interest of the sustenance of earth and life on it, some drastic changes M=
UST be made. The changes kicked off by the force of Kaali will continue to =
unravel over the years. It may be painful, but it may in the long run resul=
t in a more sustainable equilibrium.
=C2=A0
During this phase, it may not b=
e helpful or useful to put the microscope on specific events. It is better =
to develop a balanced attitude of compassionate detachment and just pray fo=
r peace. Also, as more and more sadhakas do intense sadhana, it may smooth =
out some of the painful changes.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

>That is a variation satisfying=
 the metre. But it is less apt, for the following reasons:
>=C2=A0
>(1) The=
 word "tu" indicates some irony or contrast. If you say "He rules the bridg=
e of dharma. Then again, he destroys the path of adharma", there is no such=
 contrast. Basically, I see "tu" as a misfit there.
>(2) Bhairava is not ne=
cessarily a deity destroying adharma. In fact, he stands more for liberatio=
n and for destroying the distinction in one's mind between dharma and adhar=
ma. For example, he is depicted as roaming around naked drinking wine.
>=C2=
=A0
>BTW, observe the imagery. Line before says "dharma setu pAlakaM" - the=
 ruler of the bridge of dharma. Dharma is merely seen as a bridge here. Bri=
dge to what? Obviously bridge over the sea of samsara and into infinite fre=
edom. Bhairava not only controls the bridge, but his main purpose is to tak=
e one into infinite freedom from that bridge. Thus, swadharma mArga nAshaka=
M fits nicely following that line.
>=C2=A0
>BTW, some people may be tempted=
 to worship and Bhairava and emulate him by drinking wine or roaming naked =
in a smashan. That may not necessarily liberate one. Please note that Bhair=
ava is not free becausehe drinks wine and roams naked. He is already free a=
nd does those things becausehe is free. In any case, even Bhairava, the dei=
ty of destroying right-wrong distinctions in mind and ringing in liberation=
 is described as "dharma setu palaka"! Dharma is very important. Until you =
reach the shore of infinite freedom, you HAVE to stay afloat of the ocean o=
f samsara, by getting atop the bridge of dharma! Otherwise you will sink in=
 the ocean of samara, toppled by the waves of delusion. Though one needs to=
 jump off the bridge in the end, "the end" is not anywhere near for most pe=
ople on earth and they better realize it!

 S=
uppose some of my children are living in a house that is right next to
 a b=
ig river and a big wall with my picture painted on it is protecting the&nbs=
p;
house from the river water. Suppose they become stupid and decide to 
"m=
ove" that wall somewhere else. Suppose the house is then ruined by the
 riv=
er.<br> <br>Is it that I became wrathful because a wall with "my 
pict=
ure" painted on it was moved (suggesting that I am so attached to that pict=
ure)? Or is it that I loved them, but they 
were stupid enough to remove th=
eir protection and paid for it?<br> <br>(2)
The word "dhArI" is from t=
he root "dhR", which means to hold, maintain, preserve. The word "dhArI" li=
terally means one who holds things together. Dhaari Devi stands for the
 pr=
otective force that holds various complex forces in a delicate 
equilibrium=
. Because this temple contains the upper half of the torso 
and the bottom =
half is worshipped at another location as "Kaali", people may think of her =
as Kaali. But the goddess who was moved is the goddess of protection and ba=
lance. This is a case of withdrawal of protection in a delicate equilibrium=
 rather than wrath, thought it may seem like the latter.<br> <br>(3) S=
ome deities like Kaali, Bhairavi, Dhoomavati etc may indeed by associated w=
ith fierce destruction. However, the stereotypical image some people may ha=
ve of such deities as wrathful, out-of-control, irritable persons is inaccu=
rate.<br> <br>Everyday billions of cells in our bodies become useless.=
 They block other good cells from functioning. Body has an elaborate system=
 to "kill" them, flush them out of the system and recycle the elements in t=
hem, i.e. create new cells. This is a natural process and one without which=
 life is will be far less pleasant/sustainable. The force behind this natur=
al process is not irritable or angry. It is just
 something very thoughtful=
, wise and elaborate. But, if we personify that force, its actions of killi=
ng billions of cells and flushing them out may indeed make it look like an =
angry and irritable person!<br> <br>Deities such as Kaali and Bhairavi=
 are personifications of the forces behind this natural process of destruct=
ion, elimination and recycling, within the "macrocosm". Remove the stereoty=
pes from your mind to gain a better understanding of these deities and genu=
ine love for them (and not fake love out of necessity and fear).<br> <=
br>(4) First of all, let us accept that shifting a temple that was establis=
hed specifically for protecting this region was an unwise and bad karma. Ye=
t, it is not 100% clear whether what happened is a direct consequence. In t=
his case, it may very well be. But the bigger point I want to make is that =
we do not really know which karmaphala is arising from which karma. We ofte=
n draw convenient conclusions based on our
 beliefs, agendas and conditioni=
ng.<br> <br>For example, when hurricane Sandy happened in northeast US=
, some Christian conservative commentators in US said that states that were=
 legalizing gay marriage were facing the wrath of God! They probably believ=
ed it genuinely. It was perhaps perfectly logical for the image of "god" co=
nstructed in their own minds to do it!! But, it may be a silly idea given t=
he image of god constructed in the mind of someone else.<br> <br>God i=
s infinite and un-knowable. We all have an *evolving* finite image of god i=
n our finite and conditioned minds based on our own *evolving* sense of goo=
d and bad, strong and weak, desirable and undesirable, etc. It is wise not =
to second guess god and associate specific karmas with specific karmaphalas=
, for we can never know with certainty.<br> <br>Having said that, a ba=
d karma can be avoided whether or not it caused a specific karma phala or n=
ot!<br> <br>(5) Though everyday
 billions of new cells are created in =
our bodies, billions of old cells are killed and flushed out and trillions =
of cells sustained, some periods </span><span id=3D"yiv3790609522yui_3_7_2_=

Respected sir,<br>With due regards I request you to shed some l=
ight upon the recent Uttarakhand tragedy. After the tragedy it is now belie=
ved that the tragedy was due to shifting of Dhari devi temple at Alaknanda =
river. I read some post by shri Manish ji and blog of shri sanjay rath ji. =
 <br>My doubt is that, in present context how much it is relevant that such=
 tragedies do happen by a Devi wrath. As per our believe God is merciful an=
d even in some of your post previously you have said that it is not worthwh=
ile to connect tragedies with God or faith for Him?<br>Hope you can elabora=
te this.<br><br>Best Regards<br>Ashish K.agarwal</div><div>Sent from my Bla=

 "dharma setu pAlakaM" - the =

dom. Bhairava not only controls the bridge, but his main purpose is to take=
 one into infinite freedom from that bridge. Thus, swadharma mArga nAshakaM=
 fits nicely following that line.</span></div><div style=3D"color: rgb(0, 0=

<span>BTW, some people may be tempted to worship and Bhairava and emulate h=

 liberate one. Please note that Bhairava is not free <span style=3D"font-st=

 wine
 and roams naked. He is a=

ity of destroying right-wrong distinctions in mind and ringing in liberatio=
n is described as "dharma setu palaka"! Dharma is very important. Until you=
 reach the shore of infinite freedom, you HAVE to stay afloat of the ocean =
of samsara, by getting atop the bridge of dharma! Otherwise you will sink i=
n the ocean of samara, toppled by the waves of delusion. Though one needs t=
