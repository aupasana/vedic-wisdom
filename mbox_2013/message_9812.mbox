Thank you , Narasimhaji for your kind reply.

Had one more question:

In ca=
se the fire extinguishes during the homam, is it permissible to
take a burn=
ing match and sprinkle some camphor to 'revive' the agni?

Because I have s=
een priests blowing air on indirectly and putting camphor,
not putting anot=
her external burning match/stick

Thanks!

ut being first time, I did have some problems with maintaining the fire.<br=
>
Overall, very very good.<br><br>I know I made a few mistakes, and had a q=
uestion:<br><br>Is it okay to move the wooden sticks which are burning on o=
ne corner of kundam, to the other side , using another stick...??<br><br>
i=
 thought it wasnt so good, because deity is in the fire and by shifting sti=
cks, i might make a mess of the offerings already put in the kundam.<br><br=
>So, what i was trying to do was to make the whole kundam burn , rather tha=
n only one side burning....so that you have a bigger fire....<br>
<br>Whats=
 a better way of doing that?<br><br>( i used a combo of both wood and dried=
 coconut.)<br><br>but because it was my first time, i was a little distract=
ed from time to time....because of 'burning wood ' issues....:)<br>=

<br>Thanks!<u></u><u></u></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></=
