Namaste Sir,

I don't know about foreign countries. I am sure there too one=
 can find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. 

I have very little k=
nowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever t=
ried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.

However, there is a particula=
r mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency fo=
r these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as =
Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one wh=
ose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in th=
e Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhaira=
va has been invoked for centuries by followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions f=
or protection against spirits, and specially during rituals of cremation gr=
ound. 

The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this mantra to=
o, all are good):

"Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay=
 Hreem Om"

Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in o=
ne sitting. And this should be continued daily till such time that there is=
 some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine =
instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite imp=
ossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almo=
st no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession fro=
m a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the on=
e trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl will=
 have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Nar=
asimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess =
being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.

If the family visits I=
ndia, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kash=
i and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once in=
side the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these =
two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adep=
ts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fe=
e for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some sp=
ecific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform =
their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I a=
m sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. 

=
Hope this helps.

-Regards

Namaste. Rajarshri,

Thank you for your detaile=
d response. I did post a request a few weeks ago asking if people around Bo=
ston area in US knew of any exorcist. But unfortunately received no respons=
e. So again I ask if someone knows of a good priest around Boston area, ple=
ase let me know. Until then, I have to go with. The diagnosis of 2 independ=
ent remote healers in India who came to the same conclusion,using that this=
 was a case of possession. =C2=A0But none of the two have been able to do a=
nything about it so far. They both say that this is an entity that keeps re=
visiting the little girl.

The doctors themselves are treating this as psyc=
hiatric case. Don't know what is true and what is not as no one has been ab=
le to help including the doctors.

Do you know of any particular Kali, Bhai=
rav or Panchmukhi Hanuman mantra which they could recite? I could advice th=
at they learn this and recite as u have advised.


Thanks, 
Bhupendra

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir,

A possession by a for=
eign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For there are var=
ious classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individua=
l and some of them can be downright nasty.

Upayas are many. As so many dif=
ferent people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, b=
ut whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not dep=
ends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. I=
t all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individu=
al and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find ou=
t the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the=
 person. Sometimes it can be something as simple as spitting somewhere (whe=
re this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their territory and be=
ing susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body=
, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm =
to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot on=
e stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on =
the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to hel=
p are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spiri=
t of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person tryi=
ng to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.

Thes=
e things like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall un=
der the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting =
into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. =
Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to handle the =
same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which=
, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the indiv=
idual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not =
so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It =
is all a complex chain.

[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some=
 years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism =
he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time fr=
ame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmi=
c link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals =
daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promisin=
g good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. =
Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent =
nature, force had to be applied.]

Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who=
 knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the best. b)=
 In the event the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sadhana=
/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,pancham=
ukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with =
sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanum=
an chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may h=
ave to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/=
will/determination to see this through to the very end. While doing the sad=
hana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the possess=
ed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard a=
s possible. 

Best of luck and may God help the family.

-Regards

Dear Bhupendraji,

I feel the family should recite if possible whole Chandi-Path for few days=
 or at least the Chandi-Kavach everyday (its better if they take sankalpa e=

 Until then, I have to go with. The diagnosis of 2 independent remote heale=

ossession.  But none of the two have been able to do anything about it=
 so far. They both say that this is an entity that keeps revisiting the lit=

 as psychiatric case. Don't know what is true and what is not as no one has=
 been able to help including the doctors.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you k=
now of any particular Kali, Bhairav or Panchmukhi Hanuman mantra which they=

f;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size=
:12pt;">Namaste Sir,<br><br>A possession by a foreign entity, IF genuine, i=
s always a very serious matter. For there are various classes and kinds and=
 types of entities which can possess an individual and some of them can be =
downright nasty.<br><br>Upayas are many. As so many different people have a=
dvised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one o=
f them will actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple fac=
tors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on wha=
t kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their li=
nk for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or sourc=
e of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes i=
t can be something as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) res=
ide), or
 causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to s=
uch possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases w=
here such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ET=
C ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of rem=
oving and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the sp=
irit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to genera=
te in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and e=
xtremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is a=
n adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.<br><br>These things like =
removing possession are specializations. These do not fall under the ambit =
of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, any sadh=
aka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every action h=
as its repercussion and one must know well how to handle the same too. Agai=
n
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which, based on pre=
vious karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individual, then th=
at too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pleasant co=
nsequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is all a compl=
ex chain.<br><br>[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some years a=
go who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would=
 ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame for =
which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmic link b=
etween the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to=
 entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promising good d=
eeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cas=
es it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, =
force had to be applied.]<br><br>Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who k=
nows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the best. b) I=
n the event the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/m=
antra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamuk=
hi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with su=
fficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman=
 chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may hav=
e to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/wi=
ll/determination to see this through to the very end. While doing the sadha=
na keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the possessed=
 individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as =
possible. <br><br>Best of luck and may God help the family.<br><br>-Regards=

      <div>Thanks, I will g=
ive it a try!<br>
<br>
What about Kala Bhairava mantra? Can it be more effi=
cient for a long-time Shiva devotee? I've heard that it can repel spirits a=
nd ghosts. Can I chant these mantras at night before going to sleep?<br>
