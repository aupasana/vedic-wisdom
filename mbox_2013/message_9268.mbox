Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
Jai Ma!


Just to clarify, I may have a special liki=
ng for Krshna, but my aim is obvious not to demean Rama, or any other speci=
al form of God.=C2=A0Just clarifying incase someone gets the wrong impressi=
on. I respect Rama, but I worship Krshna.
=C2=A0
<<More importantly, if you=
r understanding is correct, why isn't perfection occurring in the FINAL inc=
arnation but occurring well before?>>

Good=C2=A0question!=C2=A0=C2=A0
=C2=
=A0
That is because, SB is not concerned with the dasavatara. It lists 22 A=
vataras! It=C2=A0deals with the idea of Avataran, but not with the idea of =
9/10 fixed Avataras.=C2=A0It also=C2=A0lists Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avat=
ara, and Matsya as the 10 in its list of 22. It is only in other puranas, t=
hat we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and the term becomes popular. 
=C2=A0
A=
nd ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avataras, in a fixed sequence=C2=A0of appea=
rence, that we get the popular concept of Dasavatara. Else no. I find the e=
volutionary link in this concept of 9/10 Avataras too compelling to be igno=
red.=C2=A0=C2=A0
=C2=A0
<<After all, "entire divinity" cannot be encapsulat=
ed by any form>>


This, I am in total agreement with. Infact, in the 10th =
Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various vibhutis, this One is=
 not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitation of conception. Hence=
, the One says, among those who weild weapons, it is Rama, and among the Vr=
ishnis it is Krshna! Etc..
=C2=A0
<<First, he IS mentioned in SB list of av=
ataras as well as Parasara's list. If he does not "fit" in your "scheme of =
evolutionary Avatars", then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are=
 perhaps not "evolutionary" as you theorize.>>

As I said, the SB list cont=
ains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is m=
y point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not of any =
use. For these nine grahas, individually or in combination, will represent =
all Avataras, or for that matter everything else in this Universe.
=C2=A0
S=
econdly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then what=
 must Kalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is not a graha.
=C2=A0
Or, just surmi=
sing, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends on the ear=
th, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, but once he=
 does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know after the=
 last Avatara comes.
=C2=A0
Anyway, I am not looking at this main Avatars f=
rom the point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that matter, some traditions co=
nsider Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Buddha.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
The conc=
ept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from the Gita. These two are slightly dif=
ferent. Avatara is a special descent of God, Paramatma, which appears on th=
is world=C2=A0during times of severe crisis to=C2=A0cause a drastic and fun=
damental=C2=A0transition. A Vibhuti is a limited force of God which can app=
ear to help out, directly or indirectly, in any transition. A Vibuti need n=
ot be spiritual. It could be in any field of work.=C2=A0Sometimes a Vibhuti=
 may not even be aware of its purpose, unlike an Avatara.
=C2=A0

 whenever we see excellence in any form, in any field, it is always the ene=

Namaste Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
Very n=
ice to hear from you!
=C2=A0
The "unmistakeable" link to the *physical* evo=
lution of life on earth does not imply an increasing sequence of *spiritual=
* perfection, as you cannot directly map the physical to the spiritual. Mor=
e importantly, if your understanding is correct, why isn't perfection occur=

=C2=A0
First, regarding Krishna being a "poornavatara", SrimadBhagava=
tam (SB) does not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vy=
asa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are "poo=
rnavataras" (used that exact expression) while other avataras have some amo=
unt of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).
=C2=A0
Se=
condly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innum=
erable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avatara=
s of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to sa=
y "these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself." I question i=
f the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is acc=
urate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are =
partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Kris=
hna are poornavataras.
=C2=A0
Third, let us ask a very fundamental question=
: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is "Lord Himself"?
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

=C2=A0
While SB talks of Krishna being "Lord Himself" in 1.3.28, i=
t also says in 1.3.30: "forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality formless (=
arUpa) and of the nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufacture=
d by the qualities of Maya". In the next verse, it further compares forms o=
f Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and =
is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, aga=
in, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being "L=
ord Himself"? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based o=
n their fancies and conditioning..
=C2=A0
All beings are made up of paramat=
ma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter=
 portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Grea=
t avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras=
 descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Kris=
hna are specific examples given by Parasara.
=C2=A0
They are entirely divin=
e, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After all, "entire d=
ivinity" cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contain th=
e entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing the divine =
will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.

First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara's =
list. If he does not "fit" in your "scheme of evolutionary Avatars", then y=
our concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not "evolutionary" a=
s you theorize.
=C2=A0
Secondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mer=
cury, who personifies logical mind and the spirit of investigation and comp=
rehension. Logical mind and its spirit of comprehension are inherently fall=
ible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping t=
he Absolute Reality completely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wond=
er it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is =
what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the=
 Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great s=
piritual force in this world in this age.

=C2=A0
If =
you dismiss Parasara's linking of planets to avataras as a possible corrupt=
ion, are you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are p=
erfect? (In any case, it's a different matter that you are only taking some=
 SB verses and ignoring some as I showed!.)
=C2=A0
The bottomline as far as=
 I am concerned is that Pararsara's list actually makes amazingly coherent =
esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - s=
pirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - =
spirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a=
 highly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterical=
ly is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions i=
n them.
=C2=A0
If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided co=
nclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the "supreme" one and other de=
ities are "inferior"; some would conclude that Surya is the "supreme" one a=
nd other deities are "inferior"; and so on.

=C2=A0
=
On a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior=
 to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to =
be essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating=
 between them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for e=
ven rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some significant difference=
 between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. S=
ame in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfectly detached and=
 fully divine karma yogis.
=C2=A0
If we think about it, perfected mind (par=
amatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represented b=
y Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are n=
ot that different, though the specifics of their stories may be different.
=
=C2=A0
One last word though. If someone truly believes that Krishna is supe=
rior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for suc=
h a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledg=
e and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the long run, than changin=
g the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone of us will hav=
e to go through one's own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik s=
tages of evolution before one starts grasping some fistfuls of Reality. The=
se concepts are too subtle for anyone to convince others or be absolutely c=
onfident oneself!

>1.=
 In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this=
 list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avat=
ara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and the=
n the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are inn=
umerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable =
others, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."
>=

>
>2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, ar=
e/have been accorded special mention and significance across various Hindu =
spiritual literature, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga,=
 namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physic=
al presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Ka=
li started in full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these =
are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]
>
>
>3. These 10/9 Avatara=
s have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Va=
mana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakea=
ble connection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evol=
ution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-ani=
mal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form w=
ho immediately takes possession of this earth represented by Vamana's 3 ste=
ps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to t=
he Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, thi=
s indicates that spirituality is not to be separated into another world, bu=
t is a progressive realization of the various manifestation and potentials =
that lie inherent in the consciousness and its development through various =
life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. Tha=
t is Nature's grand design for life on earth.
>
>
>4. In this specifc conte=
xt, I am only focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not=
 my contention that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain=
 to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmol=
ogy in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. =
And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way an=
d can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.
>
>
>
>=C2=A05. Of these=
, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage=
 of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of =
much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic=
 mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the=
 animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force=
 for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there=
 can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in natur=
e and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki R=
amayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He =
did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispe=
lled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At t=
he end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner=
, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was
 the Dharma to do so,=
 and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when =
he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly=
 to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, a=
s a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences t=
o it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culmina=
ted into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader,=
 such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn t=
he Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be!Krshna, O=
TOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=
=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant det=
achment from situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances =
that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for=
 Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his
 village-folks who so lo=
ved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the =
shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into =
an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then =
he understood that they won't understand, he promised he will return back o=
nce his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when=
 the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged=
. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krs=
hna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to e=
veryone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala =
abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling=
 and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shis=
hupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly ac=
cused Krshna of being a revolutionist and
 charlatan, Krshna did not kill h=
im. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician,=
 wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of =
kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was b=
ack into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one i=
nstance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivoc=
ation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others sa=
y or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had =
the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. Tha=
t is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yo=
gi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the actio=
n nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away from the batt=
le-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart J=
arashanda, or gesturing Bheema to
 hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getti=
ng Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew e=
xactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the destructio=
n of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational think=
ing. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Un=
iversal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama =
Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut=
 Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different =
picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama=
 after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes=
 the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramay=
ana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is th=
e embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great character=
istics of satwa, chief of
 which is self-control, as well as the occasional=
 sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until R=
avana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint,=
 but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gun=
atita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, d=
anava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace of neg=
ative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations=
.6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him fi=
t in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advoca=
ted, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of =
the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or=
 Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If negation of this worl=
d and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stage=
s of evolutionary
 development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the re=
ason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They =
are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiri=
tual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical mann=
er? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not conside=
r Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must b=
e both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That =
is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the wo=
rld as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and realization.=
7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. The=
se are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 to=
o subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief th=
at each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full power=
 and force
 of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that whi=
ch can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and expre=
ss itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a referenc=
e point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the para=
ble of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet t=
o come.8. I cannot comment on which graha would typically represent which A=
vatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free =
to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of =
understanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the At=
mah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimala=
nanda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. Th=
ere is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirg=
una/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and complete purity and might=
 and
 force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the =
last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill the p=
urpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his ad=
ult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won't even need that=
. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one cap=
able enough to rectify the various errors and corruptions that beset our ag=
e. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok no=
t to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is wha=
t is closer to truth.-Regards=C2=A0Rajarshi

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us,=
 mind in us, energy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness i=
n us, discipline/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of=
 the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it=
 has different qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison =
between them.=C2=A0We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect it and t=
hen
 perfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all asp=
ects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are in=
comparable and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.=C2=A0*=C2=

ama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of go=
d in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and =
has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.=C2=A0Once mind fancies a separate exi=
stence with some agendas/desires, soul supports the
 individualized conscio=
usness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strengt=
h and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mi=
nd, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It sup=
ports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! =
It impassionately witnesses and records all of one's agendas and karmas so =
that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite f=
ull awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruit=
s. As mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain =
the notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul suppor=
ts them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassio=
nately.=C2=A0Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functi=
onality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem intere=
sting enough to some.=C2=A0On the other hand, mind
 has likes, dislikes and=
 agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achie=
ving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! =
Though soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consci=
ousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that=
 keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and ev=
en decides/affects every entity's dharma. That way, mind is really the "bos=
s" of the individualization. No wonder Krishna's life appeals more to one w=
ho may be excited by this description!=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

a is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama's life in perspective.=C2=
=A0Rama's life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received =
Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was h=
is "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingd=
om. At the last moment, his father
 banished him to forest at the behest of=
 his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had no compl=
aints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to vario=
us degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed his dh=
arma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshma=
na and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassio=
nately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched fo=
r her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave=
 her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life sit=
uation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he=
 killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate =
dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned s=
ome subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana!=C2=A0Rama is a perfe=
ct example of a liberated man
 with no desires or agendas who impassionatel=
y discharges one's dharma arising from the momentum of karmas before libera=
tion. THAT is basically what soul does!=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0As anoth=
er example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstrati=
on of how wisdom/discrimination operates.=C2=A0He was born as a learned pyg=
my. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king wit=
h many great qualities.=C2=A0Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and una=
ssuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.=
g. pride or attachment), one's discrimination is not pleased until that pri=
de is suppressed. When wisdom fills one's entire consciousness, then demoni=
c qualities are completely suppressed.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

 Maharshi Parasara.=C2=A0Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebra=

them, please think about that avatara more and develop devotion. They are A=

rshi,<BR> <BR>Very nice to hear from you!<BR> <BR>The "unmistakea=
ble" link to the *physical* evolution of life on earth does not imply an in=
creasing sequence of *spiritual* perfection, as you cannot directly map the=
 physical to the spiritual. More importantly, if your understanding is corr=
ect, why isn't perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring =
well before?<BR> <BR>*        *&nbs=
p;       *<BR> <BR>First, regarding Kris=
hna being a "poornavatara", SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama is=
 not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Ram=
a, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are "poornavataras" (used that exact expre=
ssion) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too
 (though par=
amatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).<BR> <BR>Secondly, after describing th=
e avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and that al=
l rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is un=
der THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say "these avataras are parti=
al, while Krishna is Lord Himself." I question if the deduction that Krishn=
a *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to say=
 that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above, P=
ararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.<BR>&=
nbsp;<BR>Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does i=
t mean if an avatara is "Lord Himself"?<BR> <BR>*   &nb=
sp;    *        *<BR>&nbs=
p;<BR>While SB talks of Krishna being "Lord Himself" in 1.3.28, it also say=
s in 1.3.30: "forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality
 formless (arUpa) an=
d of the nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the =
qualities of Maya". In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to=
 clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond=
 them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what =
is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being "Lord Himse=
lf"? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on their f=
ancies and conditioning..<BR> <BR>All beings are made up of paramatma =
(supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter po=
rtion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great a=
vataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras de=
scend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna=
 are specific examples given by Parasara.<BR> <BR>They are entirely di=
vine, but they do not encapsulate the entire
 divinity!!!! After all, "enti=
re divinity" cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contai=
n the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing the div=
ine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.<BR>&=

 "scheme of evolutionary Avatars", then your concept is possibly wrong and =
avataras are perhaps not "evolutionary" as you theorize.<BR> <BR>Secon=

 a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha wa=

p;   *<BR> <BR>If you dismiss Parasara's linking of planets =
to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure that the vers=
es of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it's a different mat=
ter that you are only taking some SB
 verses and ignoring some as I showed!=

 list actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each =
aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - sp=
irit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and th=

esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really need to un=

note, someone may think that
 Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and l=

ik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Ava=
tara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that s=
pirituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a
 progressiv=
