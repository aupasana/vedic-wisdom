>Good Morning!Crystal Medi=
tation and the Full Snow MoonEmbracing the energies of the moon can be a gr=
eat tool when you are doing any kind of empowerment work. The moon has a po=
werful relationship to our lives. The moon's influence can be seen by its c=
onnection to the Earth's tides. There is a connection to the moon and the i=
ntuitive aspect of one's nature. The phases of the moon relate to seasons, =
color, menstrual cycles, life cycles and along withthe sun, the moon's ener=
gy is a higher conductor and amplifier of our moods and emotions.The Full S=
now Moon - February - Since the heaviest snow usually falls during this mon=
th, native tribes of the north and east most often called February's Storm =
Moon or Full Snow Moon. Some tribes also referred to this Moon as the Full =
Hunger Moon, since harsh weather conditions in their areas made hunting ver=
y difficult. Also known to the Celts as the Moon of Ice and the Chinese as =
the Budding Moon. February 1 is the
 Imbolc, or fire festival celebrating m=
id point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. A day also ded=
icated to the Celtic goddess, Brigid. Imbolic means "in the belly" and is a=
 time honoring creativity, fertility and receptive, feminine energy. Candle=
s are often tools used to celebrate this Celtic holiday. It is also a time =
we celebrate love! The reflective light of the full moon gives a wonderful =
and magical sense of harmony and peacefulness. Meditating in its light give=
s an etheric and positively enchanting feeling of oneness and unity with na=
ture and sky. Meditating With A CrystalWhen you sitin your meditation pose,=
cross your legs and place your hands on your knees. You can sit with your p=
alms open and place a crystal in both of them.Consider these stones:Moonsto=

 means. Pearl:In tune with emotions, water, and women, especially p=

 pearl, it will hold that energy until it is cleansed. Remember, Pearl is t=

and discovering our congenital past. These clear quartz balls are amazing i=
n their clarity on the inside and covered with a beautiful white frost on t=

 tra=
nslucent center. These "picture window" crystals are originally from the ri=
verbeds of Brazil. The crystals are washed down out of the mountains and tu=
mbled over and over by violent surging waters. This natural process gives t=
he crystals their frosted look. They are the "gazing" stone. Also found in =
quartz points, even though each crystal has the basic six-sided crystal sha=
pe and may be terminated, there is an additional flat plane or window, usua=
lly diamond-shaped, that gives a view of the inner chamber of the crystal p=
oint. It teaches the importance of looking within ourselves, even if the vi=
ew into our own soul is clouded and imperfect. MeditationSlowly take three =
deep breaths. With each one consciously release the mental, emotional and p=
hysical tensions. Visualize our radiant light reaching out and connecting w=
ith every other focus under the light of the full moon. Know that we are co=
nnected with individuals and groups everywhere throughout the
 world who ar=
e contemplating on the unity of all life and who are working, each in their=
 own way, for the expansion of love and awareness on our planet. Visualize =
our radiant light reaching out even further as we realize that we are also =

few days new ideas will appear to you. Assume that some kind of impression =
has been received in your higher mind and it is circling overhead waiting f=
or a place to land. Develop the ability to listen
 within as you go about y=
our expansive meditation. This is a similar process as remembering an impor=
tant dream. The frequencies of dream realities are different than the ratio=
nal concrete mind. This transference process requires stillness and patienc=
e, along with an optimistic attitude. Once your conscious brain can align w=

 picture symbols. Feel the light bathe your physical body as you allow it t=

of the Universal Flow that brings Peace, Compassion, Love, Humility, and Gr=
