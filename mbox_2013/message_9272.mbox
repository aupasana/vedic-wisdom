Dear Narasimha,
=C2=A0
Jai Ma!
=C2=A0
Some freeflowing thoughts that struck=
 me while thinking about some of points you have raised. I am just doing a =
thinking aloud here. Feel free to disagree :)
=C2=A0
Firstly, I feel, the c=
onception of colloquially used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with u=
nlimited potentials way beyond what any normal human being can achieve, cam=
e into existence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krs=
hna as the ultimate God=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=
=C2=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata relig=
ion started from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All th=
e major purely=C2=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Val=
lavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhanesh=
wari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - conside=
red, (with differing nuances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, =
moksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This w=
as aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, t=
hat is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,
=
 like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal v=
iew of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless P=
aramatma, as well as Narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama=
 was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the =
earlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.
=C2=A0
Whatev=
er the case maybe, each school had its own set of established saints and sc=
holars to vouch for their views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which=
 is often, as you rightly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.=

=C2=A0
We=C2=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an Avat=
ar appears on the earth,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after t=
he Avatara, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatara=
=C2=A0because invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those tim=
es, the life of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way beyo=
nd=C2=A0imagination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the=
 next Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and befor=
e Krshna, of which we have very little written record, the world at large r=
emained entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.
=C2=A0
In this light Krshna is t=
he Poorna-Avatara. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible ac=
companied by a set of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coteri=
e of Rishis who explain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to t=
he general masses - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be l=
ooked at as the crest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *
=C2=A0
I believe in the evolutionary parable of these 9 Avatara becau=
se I find no other reason why these set of Avatara, from the whole list of =
possible=C2=A0Avataras, have captured the popular imagination. I mean Datta=
treya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality is no less than that of=
 any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9/10 Avataras. 
=C2=A0
Th=
e=C2=A0original Nath Yogis used to consider=C2=A0Nine Chakras in the Human =
Body. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also came from them, which was basically e=
xploring=C2=A0cronologically all these nine chakras one after the other by =
flooding them with Chit-Shakti.
=C2=A0
There are 9 basic grahas in jyotish.=
 Each graha could very well=C2=A0represent the essential nature of each cha=
kra. All these make me more sanguine that there must be Nine Evolutionary A=
vataras, not ten. In which case Kalki must be the Ninth Avatara.
=C2=A0
Bud=
dha, as you rightly pointed out,=C2=A0has a tremendous logical appeal in Ka=
li Yuga. But if logic is the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not=
 agree to=C2=A0his philosophy as it comes down to us from his followers, bu=
t it cannot be denied that=C2=A0Adi Shankara was=C2=A0arguable one of the s=
harpest and most logical of spiritual philosphers. His intellectual and log=
ical mind=C2=A0is beyond doubt.=C2=A0Just that Shankara=C2=A0never claimed =
himself to be an Avatara. Neither did=C2=A0Siddhartha. Only that the later =
came 3000 years ago, and the former came possibly in the last 1000 years.=
=C2=A0Shankara's spiritual impact on the world is no less than that of the=
=C2=A0Buddha. What mainstream=C2=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, =
had it not been for the invaluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Bud=
dha was truly=C2=A0the awaited=C2=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would n=
ot have been able to absorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus=
 make it lose its grip on India. Buddhism
 barely exists in land of its bir=
th.
=C2=A0
All this taken together, make me more and more convinced that th=
ere are 9 evolutionary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.

A little bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire R=
ama, it is not a lip-service. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I f=
ind extremely inspiring, educative and uplifting. Like the incident where R=
ama was to cross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one m=
oment he could have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield wa=
y to his army. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that the=
 ocean allow his army safe passage. When all else failed, when genuine good=
will was not recirpocated, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the oce=
an,=C2=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama took up weapons to get the job done.=C2=A0A powerfu=
l warrior,=C2=A0who knows=C2=A0very well how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself =
is, not letting that sense of power pervert his mind even for a moment is a=
n amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comte=
mplation, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has =
some form of power or influence in
 this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had=
 no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He =
was the very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cu=
nningness are impossible.
=C2=A0
Recently, a friend of mine told me that he=
 has learnt all his life that one must listen to Krshna's advice, but only =
follow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehemen=
tly. If one reads entire Krshna's life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna =
of Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Gur=
u who speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in t=
he Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all th=
rough his life at every instance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under a=
ll circumstances of life, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes=
 me wonder, was this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do something l=
ike this? It is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate from=
 everything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He =
had not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his w=
ife abducted for him to start a war against Ravana.
 But Krshna had zero=C2=
=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents fro=
m Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he=
 forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a gr=
eat war to cleanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed R=
ama all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0=
Balarama in his next incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshn=
a. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they d=
oing with all these kings, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their v=
illage in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will =
understand everything. But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, =
with perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false prais=
es, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I=
 am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I
 wo=
rship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single =
sadhaka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kin=
d of perfected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from =
the world or actively performing a larger dharma.
=C2=A0
I started apprecia=
ting Swami Vivekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara. =
That was the last known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a=
 circus-stoplight of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and=
 on the other bitter enemies accusing him of=C2=A0being a heretic=C2=A0righ=
t upto the=C2=A0very end of his brief life,=C2=A0and yet none of that affec=
ted him to any great degree. He faced terrific racism in the America, yet n=
ot a single speech of his reflects the slightest trace of bitterness, anger=
, or negativity. That is such a fantastic achievement, IMHO.
=C2=A0
I agree=
 with you, Narasimha, for most of us it is better to=C2=A0try to=C2=A0mould=
 ones life=C2=A0with the same kind of supreme selflessness that Rama showed=
 all along.=C2=A0Not just worship Rama=C2=A0but more importantly study=C2=
=A0his life and imbibe,=C2=A0to whatever degree possible, the quality he re=
presented.=C2=A0Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifested Reality - Shiva - =
will fix the mind so firmly on that Reality, that in some future life, in s=
ome later birth, one will be able to live life like Krshna showed, unattach=
ed and unaffected by any dirt that the world throws up. And then the=C2=A0U=
niversal=C2=A0Chit-Shakti (Adya Shakti)=C2=A0will flood such an individual =
with oppulence unimaginable, of this world and also of=C2=A0what lies in ot=

mparing Dasavataras!

=C2=A0 
Dear Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
Even Parasara did not s=
ay there are just 9 or 10 avataras or that there is a one-to-one correspond=
ence to grahas. He too said there are innumerable avataras. Avataras can co=
me with a combination of paramatmamsas (supreme/absolute being portions) an=
d jivatmamsas (living/relative being portions) taken from grahas in any com=
bination. Though 9 main avataras of Vishnu came from paramatmamsas of 9 gra=
has, many many other avataras also descended on earth due to various other =
combinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas of the same 9 grahas! There a=
re obviously many possibilities.
=C2=A0
In fact, Parasara says that ALL bei=
ngs contain some paramatmamsa and some jivatmamsa, coming from grahas. But =
jivatmamsa is predominant in most of us.
=C2=A0
When one leaves earth, para=
matmamsas in one return to respective grahas and jivatmamsas take birth aga=
in based on desires. In the 'end', even the jivatmamsas return to respectiv=
e grahas. At the time of Mahapralaya, grahas also merge back in Supreme Lor=
d.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
As for Kalki, Parasara did not clarify an=
d we can only speculate. Though some people associate him with lagna, that =
makes no sense to me either. That is inconsistent with the overall framewor=
k laid by Parasara (i.e. beings born with combinations of paramatmamsas and=
 jivatmamsas from *grahas*).
=C2=A0
Kalki will probably come with paramatma=
msas of both Sun and Moon. After all, Kalki shows Shiva and Shakti (Sun and=
 Moon - soul and mind) coming together finally!! Just a speculation..

Whether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avataras, the th=
eory of evolutionary spiritual perfection does not add up because "perfecti=
on" occurred before the last avatara, unless you break away from main scrip=
tures and throw away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not come yet).

=C2=A0
Rather than "evolution", it is a matter of w=
hat the world needs at that time. If people at the beginning of Satya yuga =
are established in Self always and the only issue is that a small attachmen=
t may develop now and then, disturbing that state of being established in S=
elf (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness that is rele=
vant is "spirit of detachment" (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachme=
nt and takes one back to being established in Self. So an avatara correspon=
ding to Ketu occurred.
=C2=A0
As collective consciousness became denser, be=
ing established in Self became less natural and more effort was needed. So =
the "spirit of patience, persistence and hard-work" (Saturn) became relevan=
t and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.
=C2=A0
In the=
 dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn't accept anything that didn'=
t "make sense". Being established in Self became an unnatural, ridiculous a=
nd incomprehensible notion. So the "spirit of comprehension" (Mercury) beca=
me relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tried to expl=
ain being established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so that rational =
minds of that age would accept it to an extent and attempt it.
=C2=A0
Avata=
ras occur based on the needs of collective consciousness. Of course, if one=
's consciousness is in a different state from the collective consciousness =
of that time, the current avatara may not be relevant to one.

I am awes=

=C2=A0=

Though I said Rama and Krishna are almost the same, there is a difference =
between soul and perfected mind. Soul is a spark of Shiva and a perfected m=
ind is a spark of Chit Shakti (whereas an imperfect mind is a spark of Maya=
 shakti).

>>Namaste,
>>
>>=

>>Jai Ma!
>>
>>
>>
>>I have a different view point. Let me write down as I=
 see it, in point by point manner.
>>
>>
>>1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there=
 are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is=
 the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana=
,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes on=
tu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, V=
yasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supre=
me Being while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."
>>
>>
>>2. Of these various pos=
sible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded specia=
l mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, speci=
ally those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When K=
rshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed t=
he full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. Al=
l Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-=
Yuga, as are Tantras]
>>
>>
>>3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence =
of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama,=
 Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the fo=
rm and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. =
>From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-=
half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes pos=
session of this earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajashik ava=
tara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara o=
f Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spiritu=
ality is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressive reali=
zation of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the=
 consciousness and its development through various life-forms. Larger spiri=
tuality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature's grand desi=
gn for life on earth.
>>
>>
>>4. In this specifc context, I am only focusin=
g on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that i=
f one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of libera=
tion of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any =
Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the A=
vatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider sup=
er-massive spiritual dynamos.
>>
>>
>>
>>=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama=
 and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, bo=
th inside as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in t=
his age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic m=
ind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencie=
s within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater pu=
rpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances=
, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change=
 only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did=
 feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moment=
s fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha w=
hen the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the fin=
al battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed =
Ravana not to rescue her, but it was
 the Dharma to do so, and to unhold hi=
s family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family =
honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of=
 Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a =
poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in=
 the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his kill=
ing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no per=
sonal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. Hi=
s life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this im=
maculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatura=
l feats into account. It is his singular and constant detachment from situa=
tions, from people, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life=
. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his =
friends, his foster parents, his
 village-folks who so loved him, pleaded w=
ith him that it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and =
comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny=
 and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that=
 they won't understand, he promised he will return back once his work in Ma=
thura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to=
 him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment s=
ome of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed hi=
mself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally an=
d no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the=
 later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The=
 moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and =
was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of be=
ing a revolutionist and
 charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhan=
a, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest =
him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did =
not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own p=
oised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his goi=
ng overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of =
confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him.=
 And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipo=
ise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life =
remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition c=
an never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results =
belong to the instrument. When running away from the battle-field and killi=
ng Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gest=
uring Bheema to
 hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to fa=
ce Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the sit=
uations must be lined up which would cause the destruction of these people.=
 This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens w=
hen one is constantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We =
do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least =
in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such =
other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Ad=
bhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ra=
vana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed d=
emon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabh=
arata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sa=
ttwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, c=
hief of
 which is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused du=
e to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroye=
d, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also caus=
e some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no a=
ttachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, ene=
my - and therefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His=
 Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was gr=
eat spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme o=
f evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static =
realization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of th=
is earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused.=
 None of them negated this world. If negation of this world and life is the=
 final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary=

 development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha b=
eing an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impac=
tful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that th=
ese 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such m=
any vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an=
 avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and=
 dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantra=
s formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Sh=
akti and therefore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original =
literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers o=
f psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non=
-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9=
 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full power and force
 of o=
ne of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify co=
nsciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself is var=
ious possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not =
a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution=
 are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I can=
not comment on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know =
of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree wit=
h it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding o=
r textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the A=
vataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to =
say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one=
 thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita aw=
astha comes living in the full and complete purity and might
 and force and=
 strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara wi=
ll burn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolu=
tion. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to ach=
ieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won't even need that. The white hor=
se and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to =
rectify the various errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this i=
s how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with=
 my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to =
truth. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi

lly used term Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials wa=
y beyond what any normal human being can achieve, came into existence from =
the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate Go=
d on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic similarity betwe=
en terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the G=
ita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely Va=
ishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, =
Sri Chaitanya as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest =
known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differing n=
uances on the relation between jiva,
 paramatma, moksha etc), Krs=
hna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a=
 measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana =
and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some, like the Gaudiya Vais=
hnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and decl=
ared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as N=
arayana, as merely the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately =
linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshn=
a, not as a separate Divity in himself.</SPAN></div>

ot a lip-service. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremel=
y inspiring, educative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to c=
ross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he cou=
ld have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his arm=
y. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow=
 his army safe passage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not=
 recirpocated, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean, THE=
N Rama took up weapons to get the job done. A powerful warrior,&n=
bsp;who knows very well how powerful he himself is, not lett=
ing that sense of power pervert his mind even
 for a moment is an amazing p=
henomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comtemplation, s=
pecially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has some form o=
f power or influence in this world in any sphere. Rama had no malice f=
or anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He was the very=
 personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningness ar=
e impossible.</div>

 Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks =
the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Gita, =
;Krshna the Divine Worker himself followed it all through his lif=

is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate
 from everything,=

 for him to start a war against Ravana. But Krshna had zero personal s=

 the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as Balarama in h=

so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with all=

 his dharma, with perfect=
