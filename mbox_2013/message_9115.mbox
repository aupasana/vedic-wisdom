Our Religion is Sanatana Dharma

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

Sanatana=
 Dharma is the Eternal Natural Way. Sanatana Dharma is singularly unique an=
d different from all other existing spiritual paths and world religions. Sa=
natana Dharma is the most ancient spiritual tradition in creation, while si=
multaneously being on the very cutting-edge of present-day global change. S=
anatana Dharma represents the very greatest spiritual and cultural achievem=
ent of the past, the present, and the future of Man. 

Our religion is Sana=
tana Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way. We are Dharmis, followers of the path=
 of Sanatana Dharma.

The practice of all followers of Sanatana Dharma is t=
o conduct our lives in accordance with those natural laws (Dharma) that hav=
e been instituted by God Himself, that have been revealed in the Vedic scri=
ptures, and that are designed to guarantee us maximal health, peace, joy, p=
rosperity, enlightenment and total liberation. The ultimate goal of all Dha=
rmis (followers of Sanatana Dharma) is to free ourselves of all illusion, a=
nd to reawaken our innate God-consciousness. This is achieved via the Yoga =
of devotional meditation (bhakti) upon the Divine.

1) Every aspect of the =
life of a Dharmi, both spiritual and secular, is guided by the eternal and =
perfect wisdom of the divinely revealed Vedic scriptures (shastras). We acc=
ept the eternal Vedic scriptures as our infallible guide. By definition, a =
person is considered to be a follower of Sanatana Dharma only if they accep=
t in full the validity of the scriptures of Sanatana Dharma. 

2) Followers=
 of Sanatana Dharma accept the dual principle of karma and punar-janma (rei=
ncarnation) as one of the laws of nature. 

3) Dharmis aspire to be ethical=
ly virtuous individuals, following the ten principles known as the Yamas an=
d Niyamas to the best of our ability, in addition to the many other ethical=
 guidelines of the Vedic scriptures. We reject ethical relativism. To know =
God means to be good.

4) Dharmis aspire always to be noble (arya) in every=
thing that we think, say and do. 

5) Dharmis do not consume animals, and a=
re strict lacto-vegetarians (avoiding all meat, fish and eggs).

6) Sanatan=
a Dharmis are guided by, and offer all our most reverential respect to, the=
 authentic and qualified spiritual teachers (sad-gurus) of our tradition.

=
7) Individual Dharmis practice a consistent program of spiritual discipline=
 (sadhana) given to us by our guru, guided by the Vedic scripture (shastra)=
, and continuously confirmed by our own individual intellectual discernment=
 (viveka) and inner experience (anubhava). 

Our chosen spiritual path is S=
anatana Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way.
