Namaste,
I have been following this forum for a while and reading the posts=
 in
reverse chronological order. I am also reading the vedic wisdom gist
(p=
df). Thanks to all (Narasimha ji in particular) for providing a lot of
illu=
minating thoughts which have refined my understanding.
Here is my question:=

Recently I read this post
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/mess=
age/6718>  . In that
Narasimha ji wrote, "Dharma, artha, kama and moksha ar=
e associated with
ring, middle, little and index fingers.......When we medi=
tate or hold a
mala or make offerings in homam, thumb (ahamkara) is associa=
ted with one
or more of purusharthas. The most popular mudra is tips of thu=
mb and
index finger touching each other. It increase  knowledge and
detachm=
ent."
I was under the impression that, in Chin mudra (to which he was
refer=
ring to, I guess) the index finger represents Individual
Consciousness - Ji=
vatma/ahamkara, while the thumb represents Supreme
Consciousness - paramatm=
a/moksha. The index finger touching the thumb
meaning the 'Atman' merges in=
to the 'Paramatman' leading to the
culmination of Yoga. This is how I under=
stood the chin mudra as shown by
Guru Dakshinamurthi and Sri Ayyappa. (of c=
ourse, my sources are from the
net and other texts which I came across)
How=
ever in the quoted text, index finger and thumb have been assigned
moksha a=
nd ahamkara respectively. Then Chin mudra would mean that
moksha/paramata b=
ending towards ahamkara/jivatma. I could not reconcile
between this apparen=
t contradiction.  I searched in this forum for chin
mudra and read this pos=
t
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/167>  , but it
wasn't=
 mentioning this aspect of mudra. Is this a case of variation in
interpreta=
tion or am I missing something here ? Kindly clarify.
thanksSankar
