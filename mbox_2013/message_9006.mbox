>From a writing of Sri Aurobindo on the Divine Mother.

"In proportion as th=
e surrender and self-consecration progress the Sadhaka becomes conscious of=
 the Divine Shakti doing the Sadhana, pouring into him more and more of her=
self, founding in him the freedom and perfection of the Divine Nature. The =
more this conscious process replaces his own effort, the more rapid and tru=
e becomes his progress. But it cannot completely replace the necessity of p=
ersonal effort until the surrender and consecration are pure and complete f=
rom top to bottom.

Note that a tamasic surrender refusing to fulfil the co=
nditions and calling on God to do everything and save one all the trouble a=
nd struggle is a deception and does not lead to freedom and perfection.

To=
 walk through life armoured against all fear, peril and disaster, only two =
things are needed, two that go always together -- the Grace of the Divine M=
other and on your side an inner state made up of faith, sincerity and surre=
nder. Let your faith be pure, candid and perfect. An egoistic faith in the =
mental and vital being tainted by ambition, pride, vanity, mental arrogance=
, vital self-will, personal demand, desire for the petty satisfactions of t=
he lower nature is a low and smoke-obscured flame that cannot burn upwards =
to heaven. Regard your life as given you only for the divine work and to he=
lp in the divine manifestation. Desire nothing but the purity, force, light=
, wideness, calm, ananda of the divine consciousness and its insistence to =
transform and perfect your mind, life and body. Ask for nothing but the div=
ine, spiritual and supramental Truth, its realisation on earth and in you a=
nd in all who are called and chosen and the conditions needed for its creat=
ion and its victory over all opposing forces.

Let your sincerity and surre=
nder be genuine and entire. When you give yourself, give completely, withou=
t demand, without condition, without reservation so that all in you shall b=
elong to the Divine Mother and nothing be left to the ego or given to any o=
ther power.

The more complete your faith, sincerity and surrender, the mor=
e will grace and protection be with you. And when the grace and protection =
of the Divine Mother are with you, what is there that can touch you or whom=
 need you fear? A little of it even will carry you through all difficulties=
, obstacles and dangers; surrounded by its full presence you can go securel=
y on your way because it is hers, careless of all menace, unaffected by any=
 hostility however powerful, whether from this world or from worlds invisib=
le. Its touch can turn difficulties into opportunities, failure into succes=
s and weakness into unfaltering strength. For the grace of the Divine Mothe=
r is the sanction of the Supreme and now or tomorrow its effect is sure, a =
thing decreed, inevitable and irresistible.

Until you are capable of this =
complete dynamic identification, you have to regard yourself as a soul and =
body created for her service, one who does all for her sake. Even if the id=
ea of the separate worker is strong in you and you feel that it is you who =
do the act, yet it must be done for her. All stress of egoistic choice, all=
 hankering after personal profit, all stipulation of self-regarding desire =
must be extirpated from the nature. There must be no demand for fruit and n=
o seeking for reward; the only fruit for you is the pleasure of the Divine =
Mother and the fulfilment of her work, your only reward a constant progress=
ion in divine consciousness and calm and strength and bliss. The joy of ser=
vice and the joy of inner growth through works is the sufficient recompense=
 of the selfless worker.

But a time will come when you will feel more and =
more that you are the instrument and not the worker. For first by the force=
 of your devotion your contact with the Divine Mother will become so intima=
te that at all times you will have only to concentrate and to put everythin=
g into her hands to have her present guidance, her direct command or impuls=
e, the sure indication of the thing to be done and the way to do it and the=
 result. And afterwards you will realise that the divine Shakti not only in=
spires and guides, but initiates and carries out your works; all your movem=
ents are originated by her, all your powers are hers, mind, life and body a=
re conscious and joyful instruments of her action, means for her play, moul=
ds for her manifestation in the physical universe. There can be no more hap=
py condition than this union and dependence; for this step carries you back=
 beyond the border-line from the life of stress and suffering in the ignora=
nce into the truth of your spiritual being, into its deep peace and its int=
ense Ananda.

While this transformation is being done it is more than ever =
necessary to keep yourself free from all taint of the perversions of the eg=
o. Let no demand or insistence creep in to stain the purity of the self-giv=
ing and the sacrifice. There must be no attachment to the work or the resul=
t, no laying down of conditions, no claim to possess the Power that should =
possess you, no pride of the instrument, no vanity or arrogance. Nothing in=
 the mind or in the vital or physical parts should be suffered to distort t=
o its own use or seize for its own personal and separate satisfaction the g=
reatness of the forces that are acting through you. Let your faith, your si=
ncerity, your purity of aspiration be absolute and pervasive of all the pla=
nes and layers of the being; then every disturbing element and distorting i=
nfluence will progressively fall away from your nature.

The last stage of =
this perfection will come when you are completely identified with the Divin=
e Mother and feel yourself to be no longer another and separate being, inst=
rument, servant or worker but truly a child and eternal portion of her cons=
ciousness and force. Always she will be in you and you in her; it will be y=
our constant, simple and natural experience that all your thought and seein=
g and action, your very breathing or moving come from her and are hers. You=
 will know and see and feel that you are a person and power formed by her o=
ut of herself, put out from her for the play and yet always safe in her, be=
ing of her being, consciousness of her consciousness, force of her force, a=
nanda of her Ananda. When this condition is entire and her supramental ener=
gies can freely move you, then you will be perfect in divine works; knowled=
ge, will, action will become sure, simple, luminous, spontaneous, flawless,=
 an outflow from the Supreme, a divine movement of the Eternal."
