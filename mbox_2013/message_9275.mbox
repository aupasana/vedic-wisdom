Dear Rajarshi,
=A0
<<I believe in the evolutionary parable of these 9 Avata=
ra because I find no other reason why these set of Avatara, from the whole =
list of possible Avataras, have captured the popular imagination.>>
=A0
If =
capturing the popular imagination is the criterion, then Narasimha, Rama an=
d Krishna are the most popular ones among the 9. Why are the *4th*, 7th and=
 8th avataras most popular if there is a nice "evolutionary" sequence among=
 the 9???
=A0
There is a very simple explanation, if one throws away the no=
tion of "evolutionary" sequence. These are *poornavataras*, completely divi=
ne and devoid of jeevatmamsa, as per Parasara. In contrast, the 5th and 6th=
 avataras did have some jeevatmamsa in them.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
<<I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB=
. His spirituality is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is no=
t in the list of 9/10 Avataras.>>
=A0
First of all, dasavataras are not a "=
top 10" short-list of SB's list. SB list gives the avataras of Supreme Bein=
g ("Purusha" as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are specifically of Vishnu, who=
 is the "sustaining principle" of Purusha. Dattatreya is an avatara of Brah=
ma, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and destructive pr=
inciples of Purusha combined together. That is why he is not among Dasavata=
ras. That does not make him any less or more. His purpose/functionality is =
simply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venkateswara. Ju=
st in terms of "popularity", he is actually more popular than some of the d=
asavataras.
=A0
Secondly, rather than *comparing* avataras in terms like "l=
ess" or more in "spirituality", try to *understand* avataras from the point=
 of view of what functionality and role they play in the functioning of col=
lective cosmic consciousness. THAT is the key to understanding them and the=
ir place in cosmos. And also to internalizing them eventually..
=A0
*=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Whether you call the Supreme B=
eing as Purusha or Krishna or Shiva or Surya or Narayana does not really ma=
tter, for Scriptures are clear that He is beyond names or descriptions.
=A0=

If your devotion to Him is steadfast, if your notion of Him expands with t=
ime beyond the initial notions you start off with, and if the paramatmamsa =
in you is able to resonate to Him and the conditioning of your jeevatmamsa =
is being overcome, that is all that matters!
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

>=A0
>Jai Ma!
=
>=A0
>Some freeflowing thoughts that struck me while thinking about some of=
 points you have raised. I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel free t=
o disagree :)
>=A0
>Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquially used=A0=
term=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials way beyond what any=
 normal human being can achieve, came into existence from the Vaishnava sch=
ools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate God=A0on earth. It =
is difficult to miss the phonetic=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata and =
Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the Gita and a contemplation=
 of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanuj=
acharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=A0as well as=
 the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translatio=
n of the Gita) - considered, (with differing nuances on the=A0relation betw=
een jiva, paramatma, moksha=A0etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of Go=
d on earth. This was aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of the e=
arliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a comple=
te Avatara. Some,
 like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and too=
k a very literal view of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, =
and the formless Paramatma, as well as Narayana,=A0as merely=A0the aura of =
Krshna. Rama was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looke=
d at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.
>=
=A0
>Whatever the case maybe, each school had its own set of established sa=
ints and scholars to vouch for their views. So it boiled down to interpreta=
tion, which is often, as you rightly pointed out, based on=A0various condit=
ionings.
>=A0
>We=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an =
Avatar appears on the earth,=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after =
the Avatara, remain=A0overawed by the=A0character of the last Avatara=A0bec=
ause invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those times, the l=
ife of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=A0way beyond=A0imagina=
tion for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avatara c=
omes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, of wh=
ich we have very little written record, the world at large remained entirel=
y overawed by Rama Avatara.
>=A0
>In this light Krshna is the Poorna-Avatar=
a. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible accompanied by a s=
et of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coterie of Rishis who =
explain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to the general masse=
s - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be looked at as the =
crest jewel=A0of the Avataras.

>=A0

 are 9 basic grahas in jyotish. Each graha could very well=A0represent the =
essential nature of each chakra. All these make me more sanguine that there=
 must be Nine Evolutionary Avataras, not ten. In which case Kalki must be t=
he Ninth Avatara.
>=A0
>Buddha, as you rightly pointed out,=A0has a tremend=

 Adi Shankara? I may not agree to=A0his philosophy as it comes down to us f=

Buddha. What mainstream=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, had it no=

ruly=A0the awaited=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not have been ab=

 barely exists in land of its birth.

>=A0
>A littl=
e bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-ser=
vice. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring,=
 educative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to cross the oce=
an. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he could have used=
 his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sa=
t in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow his army sa=
fe passage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocate=
d, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean,=A0THEN=A0Rama took u=
p weapons to get the job done.=A0A powerful warrior,=A0who knows=A0very wel=
l how=A0powerful he=A0himself is, not letting that sense of power pervert h=
is mind even for a moment is an amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-contr=
ol is rare and worthy of comtemplation, specially by anyone who feels, ever=
 so slightly, that he/she has some form of power or influence in
 this worl=
d in any sphere.=A0Rama had no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the e=
nd of the war at least. He was the very personification of Satwa. In Satwa,=
 conflict and malice and cunningness are impossible.
>=A0
>Recently, a frie=
nd of mine told me that he has learnt all his life that one must listen to =
Krshna's advice, but only follow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I =
disagree with this vehemently. If one reads entire Krshna's life=A0with an =
objective mind, Krshna of Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetr=
a, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshn=
a the Guru adviced in the Gita,=A0Krshna the=A0Divine Worker=A0himself foll=
owed it all through his life at every instance. It is his=A0perfect detachm=
ent under all circumstances of life, from childhood=A0to his death,=A0that =
makes me wonder, was this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do someth=
ing like this? It is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate=
 from everything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile=
. He had not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had =
his wife abducted for him to start a war against Ravana.
 But Krshna had ze=
ro=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=A0After liberating his parents from=
 Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he =
forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a gre=
at war to cleanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed Ra=
ma all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=A0Bala=
rama in his next incarnation=A0he could=A0hardly understand Krshna. There a=
re so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with =
all these kings, and=A0that they should=A0return to their village in Vrndav=
ana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will understand every=
thing. But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, with perfect det=
achement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false praises, nor wrong ac=
cusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I am not even cou=
nting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I
 worship Krshna, be=
cause I have not yet met or heard of read of=A0a single sadhaka or saint or=
 ordinary man or mahatma=A0who has displayed this kind of perfected detachm=
ent through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the world or actively =
performing a larger dharma.
>=A0
>I started appreciating Swami Vivekanada m=
ore after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara. That was the last known=
 saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a circus-stoplight of fa=
me and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and on the other bitter en=
emies accusing him of=A0being a heretic=A0right upto the=A0very end of his =
brief life,=A0and yet none of that affected him to any great degree. He fac=
ed terrific racism in the America, yet not a single speech of his reflects =
the slightest trace of bitterness, anger, or negativity. That is such a fan=
tastic achievement, IMHO.

 jivatmamsa).

while Krishna is Lord Himself." I question if the deduction that Krishna *a=

>>>
>>>1. In the Bhagwata Pu=
rana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha=
 Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Na=

f the Supreme Being while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."

>>>2. Of the=

ccorded special mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual lit=
erature, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the P=
uranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence h=
ad curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in=
 full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scripture=
s of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]
>>>
>>>
>>>3. These 10/9 Avataras have =
a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, P=
arashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable con=
nection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution o=
f life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to=
 the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who imme=
diately takes possession of this earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to=
 the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Satt=
wa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indic=
ates that spirituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a =
progressive realization of the various manifestation and potentials that li=
e inherent in the consciousness and its development through various life-fo=
rms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Na=
ture's grand design for life on earth.

t, I am only focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not =
my contention that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain =
to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmolo=
gy in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. A=
nd each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and=
 can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>=A05. Of t=
hese, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a s=
tage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate=
 of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most sa=
twic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform=
 the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive f=
orce for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, t=
here can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in n=
ature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmi=
ki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest.=
 He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was d=
ispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. =
At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate ma=
nner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it
 was the Dharma to do=
 so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age w=
hen he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow hu=
mbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they ar=
e, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferenc=
es to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which cul=
minated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate lea=
der, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overtu=
rn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krsh=
na, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking =
his=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant det=
achment from situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances =
that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for=
 Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,
 his village-folks who so lo=
ved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the =
shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into =
an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then =
he understood that they won't understand, he promised he will return back o=
nce his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when=
 the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged=
. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krs=
hna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to e=
veryone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala =
abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling=
 and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shis=
hupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly ac=
cused Krshna of being a revolutionist
 and charlatan, Krshna did not kill h=
im. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician,=
 wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of =
kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was b=
ack into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one i=
nstance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivoc=
ation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others sa=
y or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had =
the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. Tha=
t is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yo=
gi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the actio=
n nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away from the batt=
le-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart J=
arashanda, or gesturing Bheema
 to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getti=
ng Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew e=
xactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the destructio=
n of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational think=
ing. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Un=
iversal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama =
Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut=
 Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different =
picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama=
 after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes=
 the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramay=
ana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is th=
e embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great character=
istics of satwa, chief
 of which is self-control, as well as the occasional=
 sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until R=
avana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint,=
 but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gun=
atita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, d=
anava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace of neg=
ative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations=
. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him f=
it in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advoc=
ated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of=
 the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama o=
r Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If negation of this wor=
ld and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stag=
es of
 evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the r=
eason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They=
 are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spir=
itual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical man=
ner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not consid=
er Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must =
be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That=
 is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the w=
orld as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and realization=
. 7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. T=
hese are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 =
too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief =
that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full
 po=
wer and force of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that w=
hich can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and exp=
ress itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a refere=
nce point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the pa=
rable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet=
 to come. 8. I cannot comment on which graha would typically represent whic=
h Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel fr=
ee to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption =
of understanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the=
 Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vim=
alananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one.=
 There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a N=
irguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and complete
 purity and m=
ight and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity t=
he last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this world and fulfill th=
e purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his=
 adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won't even need t=
hat. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one =
capable enough to rectify the various errors and corruptions that beset our=
 age. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok=
 not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is =
what is closer to truth. -Regards =A0Rajarshi

in the evolutionary parable of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reas=
on why these set of Avatara, from the whole list of possible Avataras, have=
 captured the popular imagination.>><br> <br>If capturing the po=
pular imagination is the criterion, then Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are th=
e most popular ones among the 9. Why are the *4th*, 7th and 8th avataras mo=
st popular if there is a nice "evolutionary" sequence among the 9???<br>&nb=
sp;<br>There is a very simple explanation, if one throws away the notion of=
 "evolutionary" sequence. These are *poornavataras*, completely divine and =
devoid of jeevatmamsa, as per Parasara. In contrast, the 5th and 6th
 avata=
ras did have some jeevatmamsa in them.<br> <br>*   &nbs=

;<br><<I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spiritualit=
y is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of =
9/10 Avataras.>><br> <br>First of all, dasavataras are not a "to=
p 10" short-list of SB's list. SB list gives the avataras of Supreme Being =
("Purusha" as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are specifically of Vishnu, who i=
s the "sustaining principle" of Purusha. Dattatreya is an avatara of Brahma=
, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and destructive prin=
ciples of Purusha combined together. That is why he is not among Dasavatara=
s. That does not make him any less or more. His purpose/functionality is si=
mply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venkateswara. Just=
 in terms of "popularity", he is actually more popular than
 some of the da=
savataras.<br> <br>Secondly, rather than *comparing* avataras in terms=
 like "less" or more in "spirituality", try to *understand* avataras from t=
he point of view of what functionality and role they play in the functionin=
g of collective cosmic consciousness. THAT is the key to understanding them=
 and their place in cosmos. And also to internalizing them eventually..<br>=
 <br>*        *   &n=
bsp;    *<br> <br>Whether you call the Supreme Being as=
 Purusha or Krishna or Shiva or Surya or Narayana does not really matter, f=
or Scriptures are clear that He is beyond names or descriptions.<br> <=
br>If your devotion to Him is steadfast, if your notion of Him expands with=
 time beyond the initial notions you start off with, and if the paramatmams=
a in you is able to resonate to Him and the conditioning of your jeevatmams=
a is being overcome, that is all that
 matters!<br> <br>Best regards,<=

el, the conception of colloquially used term Bhagawan as a Superm=
an with unlimited potentials way beyond what any normal human being can ach=
ieve, came into existence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who look=
ed at Krshna as the ultimate God on earth. It is difficult to miss the=
 phonetic similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagaw=
ata religion started from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshn=
a. All the major purely Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavach=
arya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya as well as the nava-naths=
 (Dhaneshwari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) =
- considered, (with differing nuances on the relation between
 jiva,
 =
paramatma, moksha etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on ea=
rth. This was aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of the earliest=
 Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avat=
ara. Some, like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very=
 literal view of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the =
formless Paramatma, as well as Narayana, as merely the aura of Kr=
shna. Rama was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked =
at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.</sp=
