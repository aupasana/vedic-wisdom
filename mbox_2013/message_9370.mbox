Namaskar Narasimha Sir,

I am an elementary seeker in the field of spiritua=
l practice and a silent member of vedic-wisdom  group. I am striving hard t=
o continuing my excellence in spiritual saadhana. Apart from vedic-wisdom g=
roup I also read various websites regularly to full fill my quest and enhan=
ce understanding of Spiritual Dimension. Right now I am doing Chanting and =
Paath  and the total time I spend is around 3 hrs 30 minutes (1.5 for Chant=
 and 2 hrs for reading spiritual materials) in a day consistently.  I have =
immense desire to be in communion with almighty in all day with more deeper=
 level .


My query is about the Chanting I am practicing for 1 hrs and 30 =
minutes. Some time I feel that I should chant one deity name instead more t=
han one. I start my chant with Kuldevi thn Shree Gurudev Dutta thn Om hum h=
anumate namhe followed by Paath of Shree Vishnu Sahastranaam. I also chant =
Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaye before commencing the said Paath with small pr=
ayer to every deity I am chanting to. The Kuldevi and Dutta chant I do for =
Ancestors, the Hanmaan ji chant I am doing as per recommendation of my Astr=
ologer after seeing my horoscope and VS I am doing for overall well being o=
f my family and for my past bad karmas as well as for my future lives.


Wi=
th this letter I am seeking kind guidance for my dilemma as I always "Break=
" the rhythm of my mind when one chant over (I end tht as per my wish no co=
unting) and  begin with the next one. In totality I am giving and wanting t=
o increase the time frame for the chanting(s) but sub-consciously feel that=
 I am changing  pattern and holding back my mind submerging  in intense lev=
els.


I know this is personal query and a long letter and seek apology if =
any inconvenience caused to you sir.


Respectfully yours,
vishwas
