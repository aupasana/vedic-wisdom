Namaste,
=A0
You should learn from this discrepancy that there is no univer=
sally correct dharma. As Krishna says in Bhagad Gita, one must follow one's=
 own dharma and not someone else's dharma. Each person has a unique "own dh=
arma" that is decided by Nature based on what one did in the past, what deb=
ts one has from the past and what desires one harbored in the past. For one=
 person, serving guru may be the correct dharma. For one person, killing on=
e's gurus may be the correct dharma (e.g. Arjuna).
=A0
The universal thumbr=
ules of dharma shastras are for generic guidance until one knows one's own =
dharma with some level of confidence. They are neither perfect nor unbreaka=
ble.
=A0
One's conscience keeps telling one what one's dharma is. It keeps =
making a noise from within heart whenever one veers off from one's own dhar=
ma. However, our vision is clouded by our desires, likes, dislikes, conditi=
oning and agendas and we fail to see our dharma.
=A0
As we follow our dharm=
a more and more and as we become more and more detached to the good and bad=
 (!) consequences of following our dharma, the voice of our conscience beco=
mes louder and clearer and we can know our dharma with more and more confid=
ence. Doing dharma better makes it easier to be detached. Being detached ma=
kes it easier to know one's dharma better. Doing one's dharma (karma) and d=
etachment (jnana) feed and enhance each other. One needs to somehow or the =
other increase them beyond some threshold and fall into the groove.
=A0
I w=
ill write another mail later, on the meaning of Parashu Rama's story. As I =
said before, Parashu Rama is Venus. Venus shows the spirit of happiness wit=
hin us. So Parashu Rama's life teaches us various things about happiness in=
 general. I will throw light on it later.

=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

 & Shri rama went to forest to oblige pitru vakya paripalanam. But take the=

>Namaste friends, =A0 Ther=
e was a discussion on Lord Vishnu's Dasavataras on a limited access forum o=
n Facebook. A learned friend wrote that "Krshna is the God-man", "Previous =
Avatars are a build-up to this stage" and "Buddha after Krshna is like goin=
g back from the linear progression of spirituality that the Avatars manifes=
t one after the other upto Krshna". =A0 I want to emphatically disagree wit=
h this notion that Dasavatars of a "linear progression of spirituality..upt=
o Krshna". =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Each ava=
tara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. =A0 Maharshi Para=
sara equated dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Naras=
imha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively. =A0 We also know that Sun, Moon,=
 Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications =
of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discriminat=
ion, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline,
 spirit of innov=
ation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectively). =A0 Correspondingly,=
 each avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected for=
m. Each story is an example of how that aspect operates. =A0 Lord Rama's st=
ory is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna's story is a =
perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana's story is a perfected =
example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha's story is a =
perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Now, let us remember one basic th=
ing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in=
 us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these are different m=
anifestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these diffe=
rent aspects, it has different qualities and plays different roles. There i=
s no comparison between them. =A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us first,
 =
perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance =
between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supre=
me Being are incomparable and are in a balance working together in the Cosm=
os. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 One who is fasc=
inated by the qualities of soul may like the story that demonstrates how so=
ul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the st=
ory that demonstrates how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the q=
ualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstrates how wisdom operates=
. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and subjective preference. =
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Let us focus on Ram=
a and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god =
in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and ha=
s no agendas, no likes or dislikes. =A0 Once mind fancies a separate existe=
nce with some
 agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousn=
ess stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength a=
nd support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind,=
 energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It suppor=
ts them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It =
impassionately witnesses and records all of one's agendas and karmas so tha=
t Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite full=
 awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. =
As mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the=
 notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports =
them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionat=
ely. =A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functional=
ity of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interestin=
g enough
 to some. =A0 On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agen=
das. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achieving =
things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! Thoug=
h soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consciousne=
ss, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keep=
s the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and even de=
cides/affects every entity's dharma. That way, mind is really the "boss" of=
 the individualization. No wonder Krishna's life appeals more to one who ma=
y be excited by this description! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Ram=
a's life in perspective. =A0 Rama's life demonstrates how soul operates. At=
 a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. =
Yet, he did whatever was his "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after ma=
rriage, he was given
 kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him =
to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given t=
he throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-br=
other felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all=
 three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita =
in the forest with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause pr=
oblems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped=
 by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sit=
a for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. =
He accepted every life situation with no complaints and did the best possib=
le action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger=
, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him =
and respectfully learned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ra=
vana! =A0 Rama
 is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or =
agendas who impassionately discharges one's dharma arising from the momentu=
m of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does! =A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 As another example, let us =
look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/di=
scrimination operates. =A0 He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the en=
tire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qualiti=
es. =A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is =
doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachmen=
t), one's discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. Whe=
n wisdom fills one's entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are compl=
etely suppressed. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 P=
lease think about the other avataras. The stories can be understood as perf=
ect demonstrations of how various aspects of
 our consciousness operate, ba=
sed on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =A0 Let us not compare Dasavataras, bu=
t celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are more attracted t=
o one of them, please think about that avatara more and develop devotion. T=
hey are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 By the way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those =
who celebrate it today (there are different schools of thought). =A0 Best r=

 respectively.   We=
 also
 know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and=
 Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning=
 spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/d=
iscipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectiv=
ely).   Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect =
of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect=
 operates.   Lord Rama's story is a perfected example of how soul oper=
ates. Lord Krishna's story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lor=
d Vamana's story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operat=
es. Lord Narasimha's story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initi=
ative operates.   *        * &=
nbsp;      *   Now, let us remember one basic=
 thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in
 us,
 learning spirit in us, wisd=
om in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these are differ=
ent manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these =
different aspects, it has different qualities and plays different roles. Th=
ere is no comparison between them.   We MAY focus on one aspect of us =
first, perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we need b=
alance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects o=
f Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance working together in t=
he Cosmos.   *        *  =
      *   One who is fascinated by the qualit=
ies of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who=
 is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrate=
s how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom m=
ay like the
 story that
 demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But t=
his is just a matter of taste and subjective preference.   * &nbs=
p;      *       =
; *   Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is se=
en as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it=
. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.   On=
ce mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, soul suppor=
ts the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as=
 its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individu=
alized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoy=
ment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agenda=
s/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of=
 one's agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits
 later
=
 on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those=
 karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individu=
alized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and be=
getting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as =
its dharma and does it impassionately.   Now, does this sound exciting=
? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness support=
ing the play, may not seem interesting enough to some.   On the other =
hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those=
 agendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what kee=
ps the individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything=
 else in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dhar=
ma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and br=
ings in agendas and passion and even decides/affects
 every entity's dharma=
. That way, mind is really the "boss" of the individualization. No wonder K=
rishna's life appeals more to one who may be excited by this description! &=
nbsp; *        *    =
    *   Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but le=
t me put Rama's life in perspective.   Rama's life demonstrates how so=
ul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and be=
came realized. Yet, he did whatever was his "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra=
. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, his father=
 banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-broth=
er was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-moth=
er and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported an=
d consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew=
 leaving Sita in the
 forest
 with Lakshmana and going after the golden dee=
r would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When s=
he was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He n=
ever faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for lea=
ving her later. He accepted every life situation with no complaints and did=
 the best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without=
 hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying,=
 he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were going to d=
isappear with Ravana!   Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man w=
ith no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one's dharma arisin=
g from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what sou=
l does!   *        *  &nb=
sp;     *   As another example, let us look at
 Lo=
rd
 Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discriminat=
ion operates.   He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire c=
osmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qualities. &n=
bsp; Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is doi=
ng good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment),=
 one's discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When w=
isdom fills one's entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are complete=
ly suppressed.   *        * &n=
bsp;      *   Please think about the other av=
ataras. The stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of how vari=
ous aspects of our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Para=
sara.   Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them sep=
arately. Of course, if you are
 more
 attracted to one of them, please thin=
k about that avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of rel=
ieving us from samsara.   *        =
*        *   By the way, happy Hanu=
majjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools of =
thought).   Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spiritual=
