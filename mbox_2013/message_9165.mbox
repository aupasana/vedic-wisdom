Namaste
This is just my suggestion. In addition to doing Amavasya tarpanam,=
 if one has time(additional 20-25 minutes), can do Brahma Tarpanam or Brahm=
a yagnam as the case applies. This is different than amavasya tarpanam.
Bra=
hma tarpanam =3D offering oblations to Devas, and Rishis. (way of offering =
water to devas and Rishis).
Brahma Yagnam =3D offering oblations to Devas, =
Rishis, and pitris. 

They say men has three types of runas(debts) from Dev=
as, Rishis, and pitris. Onee has to pay back by offering oblations in the f=
orm of doing brahma yagnam. 

Some treat this as a part of nitya karma, but=
 I am not that knowledged and I do it on Amavaasya days only.  Ofcourse you=
 have gone through upanayanam, and are atleast doing daily sandhya vandanam=
. May be people like Narasimha or Ajith can throw more light on this. I wou=
ld like to get enlightened more on this subject.

You may find pdf, as well=
 as mp3 on google about Brahma yagnam/Tarpanam.

Thanks and with best regar=
ds,
 

Lakshman

Namaste Sir=
,
 
I am glad you had the opportunity to do it.
 
Lighting incense sticks a=
nd lamp is perfectly fine, though not required. In addition, in order to ma=
ximize the sense that the ancestor is there and satisfied, one may keep pho=
tos of any specific deceased persons one has in mind or prepare any food it=
em that the person used to like. Basically, do whatever maximizes your *fai=
th* that the person is there and being satisfied. Think of that person's ha=
ppiness from the bottom of your heart and focus on that person for a while.=

 Best regards,
Narasimha
