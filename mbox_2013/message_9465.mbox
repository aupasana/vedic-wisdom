Dear Durgesh,

You may be seeing smoke for different reasons.

If, in the homa kunda, you are seeing a nice clear flame, and no smoke ...
and the smoke is coming from the tips of the flame, then you will probably
have to change the ingredients and / or their relative proportions. Wood
will generate smoke. As several people have mentioned, dry copra and ghee,
in the right proportions is almost smoke free during the homa (once the
fire goes out, there will be some smoke).

If, in the homa kunda itself, you are seeing smoke rise directly from the
ash at the bottom, then something else is the  problem. Maybe you are
spreading your ahutis too far away from the flame, and it is not properly
catching fire. Or, maybe you are offering ahutis (eg sesame seeds) too
quickly and previous ahutis, which have not yet burnt fully, are being
covered by new ahutis ... i.e. the old ones are not getting enough oxygen
and will smoke. Or, maybe you offered too much ghee which was absorbed by
the ash in the kunda, and it is smoking. Or maybe you offered too little
ghee, and if you offer a little, it will catch fire nicely.

sasneham,

    ajit
