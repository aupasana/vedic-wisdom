Homam is the best practice, choose any form and it will balance all aspects=
. you can use simple request at begning "i am dogin this for your pleasure =
and seeking ur blessings in all aspects of my life, please guide an help me=
 fulfill all areas of my life (dharma, arth, kaam, moksha) and also make al=
l planets favourable" - otherwise also diety does the same but saying it ev=
erytime will keep ones monkey mind cool.
