 First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara's list. =
If he does not "fit" in your "scheme of evolutionary Avatars", then your co=

quence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama=
, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of=
 the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on =
earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-=
animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately ta=
kes possession of this earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajas=
hik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Av=
atara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that =
spirituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressiv=
e realization of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent=
 in the consciousness and its development through various life-forms. Large=
r spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature's gra=
nd design for life on earth.

ly focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my content=
ion that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state=
 of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hind=
uism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each on=
e of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be co=
nsider super-massive spiritual dynamos.
> >

> >
> >=A05. Of these, natu=
rally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of ev=
olution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of much e=
asier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind.=
 A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the anima=
l tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a=
 greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can b=
e instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and =
will change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayan=
a, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did ha=
ve a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled b=
y Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end=
 of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that=
 he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was
>  the Dharma to do so, and=
 to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he l=
ived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to =
the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a =
scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it=
 anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated =
into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, suc=
h that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn the R=
ajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be!
> >
> >Krshn=
a, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking h=
is=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant deta=
chment from situations, from people, from environment,
>  from circumstance=
s that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana f=
or Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his village-folks who so l=
oved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the=
 shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into=
 an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then=
 he understood that they won't understand, he promised he will return back =
once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, whe=
n the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he oblige=
d. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Kr=
shna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to =
everyone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala=
 abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smilin=
g and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was
>  over, he swiftly cut off =
Shishupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairl=
y accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and charlatan, Krshna did not kil=
l him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magici=
an, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly =
of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he wa=
s back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there on=
e instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equi=
vocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others=
 say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he h=
ad the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. =
That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma=
-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the ac=
tion nor the results belong to the
>  instrument. When running away from th=
e battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear a=
part Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or =
getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, k=
new exactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the destr=
uction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational =
thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to t=
he Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the =
Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the A=
dhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a diffe=
rent picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking=
 Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demol=
ishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the =
Ramayana and the Mahabharata,
>  the picture that emerges is very clear. Ra=
ma is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great c=
haracteristics of satwa, chief of which is self-control, as well as the occ=
asional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least =
until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true=
 saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna =
was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, =
deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace=
 of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying sit=
uations.
> >
> >6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do=
 not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, th=
e one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clea=

 either Rama or Krshna
>  espoused. None of them negated this world. If neg=
ation of this world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatar=
s at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact on=
 masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zo=
rathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in th=
e scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a =
most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of Indi=
a, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and=
 holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as insi=
de of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual phil=
osophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence=
 and realization.

to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 insid=

the full and complete purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah.=
 By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing f=

ssionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest

 going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately=
 when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her =
and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her o=
r faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation=
 with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he kille=

. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some su=
bjects that were going to disappear with Ravana!
