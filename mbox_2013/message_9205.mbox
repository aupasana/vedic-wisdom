Swami Sivananda- 

"There are people who have not been able to serve their =
preceptors, who have not done any selfless service, or any devotional pract=
ices, who have not had the heart to treat other children with the affection=
 they show to their own, who may not have had the heart to help others who =
were in severe distress. 

And yet, they sit and speak high philosophy, the=
y sit and speak of cosmic love, of cosmic vision, and of their own spiritua=
l experiences and realization - brahma jnana, they repeat the mantra shivoh=
am shivoham - 'i am siva' - or the mantra aham brahma asmi - 'i am the infi=
nite' - every few minutes, they wish to be in contact with great avataras (=
incarnations of God) - this very second. Place your foot, step by step, ver=
y cautiously, on the different rungs of the ladder of yoga. 

Ascend very g=
radually to the summit. Be earnest in your sadhana - practice. Equip yourse=
lf with the necessary qualifications. Do not waste your time in search of a=
 preceptor. When you are ready, you will enter the halls of wisdom. And the=
re, waiting on the threshold, you will find your preceptor."
