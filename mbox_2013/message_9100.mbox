Dear NarasimhaJi,

	Thank you for all the clarifications. With so much of=

. The verb "prArabh" means "to begin". Its noun form "prArambha" means "beg=

n". Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process of reaction has alre=
ady begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up karmas =
that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed indefinitely=
. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic Self witho=

 karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced even by a li=

All one needs to do is to stop engaging in problematic karmas to add to the=
 pile of such karmas from the past. More importantly, one needs to reach a =
calm and sustainable state of mind in which that can be maintained even in =
the middle of a tumultous hurricane caused in one's life due to serious bad=
 karmas from the past. Once serious troubles set in or mind focuses on sens=
e objects, material world and one's pleasures and pains, mind tends to lose=
 its balance and judgment, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas and =
starts performing even more bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and contemplat=
ing various ideals and qualities that God represents can give a shelter to =
the mind in which it can maintain some calmness, balance and judgment. If t=
hat is not the case for one, perhaps one needs to perfect it further.

sonable about the reaction you are getting, it means your action had a simi=

> =C2=A0Let me turn around your question on being =
"aware" and ask a simple question. When we cause loss or hurt to someone, d=

 someone to tell us before causing loss or hurt to us? If I caused terrible=
 strife to someone pious and pure for no reason, then Nature will use someo=
ne in future to cause terrible strife to me despite my piety and purity and=
 apparently for no reason.
> =C2=A0
> In fact, what will you achieve by kno=
wing exactly what was the action that caused what is happening to you right=
 now? Why is that useful? More useful is your conscience (a representation =
of God in each heart) that tells you right from wrong. It constantly gives =
guidance on which actions will give good reactions *in future*.

 Karmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of that karma alone. It =
is a function of that karma and one's current state of mind. If someone ser=
ves spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day or diaria for a=
 week. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same karmaphala set =
in motion by the same external agents of delivery (physical & subtle) can c=

d.
