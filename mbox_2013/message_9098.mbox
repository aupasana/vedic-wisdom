By the very act of repayment done in the mode of agitation and internal dis=
turbance, new karmas are created. Only way to escape is internal stillness =
and equanimity in the midst of anything. Until such is reached, every so ca=
ll repayment is but increasing another chain for future payment.

Namaste,
=C2=A0
Some quick miscellaneous replies to a few selected =
questions/comments that came in response to my writeup yesterday.
=C2=A0
*=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

Comment 1: "If the remedial measures can only push th=
e karma phala down to manifest 
at a later date/birth then isn't it a futil=
e=C2=A0exercise. Why not accept 
whatever comes our way as 'PRASAD' from Is=
vara and move on."
=C2=A0
My response: The final goal is indeed to reach a =
state of mind where one can accept the fruits of all karmas as prasad of Lo=
rd, with an equanimous mind. However, it is not easy. When we receive the f=
ruits of some really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agitated=
 that we lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This may resu=
lt in further bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused state.
=
=C2=A0
Thus, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really bad impending k=
armas when one is still in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer sta=
te of mind in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad fruits =
better. It is even possible theoretically that one pushes off a really bad =
karma, makes progress during that borrowed
 time, reaches an equanimous sta=
te of mind, becomes liberated and then faces the karma as a liberated being=
 with a totally equanimous mind that does not get agitated.

Comment 2: Prarabda karma is which was already done and san=
chitha and agami are what we going to do.
=C2=A0
My Response: Actually sanc=
hita karmas are also karmas already done. Sanchita means "piled up". Prarab=
dha karmas are different in the sense that their fructification has already=
 begun. The verb "prArabh" means "to begin". Its noun form "prArambha" mean=
s "beginning" and its gerund noun form "prArabdha" means "the [one that was=
] begun". Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process of reaction ha=
s already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up k=
armas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed indefi=
nitely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic Self=
 without experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fruits of pra=
rabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced even b=
y a liberated being.
=C2=A0
Though fruits of prarabdha karmas are already i=
n the pipeline, even they can actually be delayed or manipulated. Bottomlin=
e is that there are agents of delivery at the physical and subtle level eve=
n for things deep in the pipeline and hence some limited adjustment is poss=
ible.

Comment 3:How does nishkam karma works=
? In other words, when a doer detaches himself from an action, where does t=
he reaction goes?
=C2=A0
My Response: If one identifies with a body-mind co=
mplex and a limited sense of self-identification and pursues its selfish ag=
enda, one keeps accumulating karmas. But, if one has minimal identification=
 with a body-mind complex to just sustain it, pursues no agenda and engages=
 in whatever action is natural in the situation one is in (but not driven b=
y any conditioning, i.e. agendas or desires or likes/dislikes), then one is=
 untouched by karmas performed in that state.
=C2=A0
In the words of Swami =
Sivananda of Hrishikesh, "The accumulated and current actions of a Jnani ta=
ke shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti". In other words, Sanchita karmas (piled u=
p actions from past that have not yet begun fructifying) and aagami karmas =
(actions being performed right now) of a liberated being take shelted in
 C=
osmic Kinetic Consciousness (Brahmanda Prakriti).

Comment 4: If my destiny is to suffer, why should I pray to God? And=
 if i am being 
punished for some kind of bad karma from the past, why am i=
 not aware of it? It is like getting punishment without knowing your bad de=
eds.
=C2=A0
My Response: One need not pray to God.All one needs to do is to=
 stop engaging in problematic karmas to add to the pile of such karmas from=
 the past. More importantly, one needs to reach a calm and sustainable stat=
e of mind in which that can be maintained even in the middle of a tumultous=
 hurricane caused in one's life due to serious bad karmas from the past. On=
ce serious troubles set in or mind focuses on sense objects, material world=
 and one's pleasures and pains, mind tends to lose its balance and judgment=
, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas and starts performing even mo=
re bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and contemplating various ideals and qu=
alities that God represents can give a shelter to the mind in which it can =
maintain some calmness, balance and judgment. If that is not the case for o=
ne, perhaps one needs to perfect it further.
=C2=A0
God has no agenda to ei=
ther punish you or hide the reason. God is an impartial balancer of reactio=
ns to all actions. If there is something unreasonable about the reaction yo=
u are getting, it means your action had a similar unreasonableness.

=C2=A0=
Let me turn around your question on being "aware" and ask a simple question=
. When we cause loss or hurt to someone, do we always tell that person why =
we are doing it? If not, how can we expect someone to tell us before causin=
g loss or hurt to us? If I caused terrible strife to someone pious and pure=
 for no reason, then Nature will use someone in future to cause terrible st=
rife to me despite my piety and purity and apparently for no reason.
=C2=A0=

In fact, what will you achieve by knowing exactly what was the action that=
 caused what is happening to you right now? Why is that useful? More useful=
 is your conscience (a representation of God in each heart) that tells you =
right from wrong. It constantly gives guidance on which actions will give g=
ood reactions *in future*.

Comment 5: Vasana =
can be for wealth, fame, power, domination (a struggle for power!) etc. Man=
y ripus, many reasons...!
=C2=A0
My Response: Well-said. Though we are disc=
ussing karma and karma phala here, the root cause of karma is vasana in chi=
ttaakasha. (Chidaakaasha is the space of pure consciousness and chittaakaas=
ha is the space of conditioned consciousness that has likes, dislikes, desi=
res, agendas etc.) Vasishtha defined liberation as overcoming vasanas in Yo=
ga Vaasishtham and Patanjali defined yoga as "chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yogaH=
" (resisting the working of conditioning is oneness with Cosmic Self) in Yo=
ga Sutras. Until we overcome our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense and =
some are very subtle. But all of them bind us.

Comment 6:1. As per Shri Vimalananda, you may also offer all the karmas=
 as Homa to inner 
devas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is lesser =
of suffering if 
you do that. Who gets the remaining delta suffering?
=C2=
=A0
My Response: Karmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of that =
karma alone. It is a function of that karma and one's current state of mind=
. If someone serves spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day=
 or diaria for a week. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same=
 karmaphala set in motion by the same external agents of delivery (physical=
 & subtle) can cause different reaction inside one, depending on one's curr=
ent state of mind.
=C2=A0
An idle mind is devil's workshop. Our minds keep =
vibrating with various notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfish =
desires and unnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effects =
of one's environment (through which fruits of karmas are
 administered).
=
=C2=A0
If one thinks of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates variou=
s ideals and qualities of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik ener=
gy, it absorbs the negative effects of one's environment better or at least=
 does not amplify them.

phala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of deliv=

>=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses =
one, with sufficient mental force behind it (this is the key), the same thi=

the sense that their fructification has

prArambha" means "beginning" and its gerund noun form "prArabdha" means "th=
e [one that was] begun". Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process=
 of reaction has already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas=
 are piled up karmas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be=
 delayed indefinitely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge=
 in Cosmic Self without experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However=

Dear Narasimha Ji,<b=
r>
        I was pondering over few things we routinely=
 come across as a part of worship and how it manipulates karma pipe line,<b=
r>
(1) When someone gives a `curse' or does a prayoga such as `maran' or `u=
chhatan' what happens to a person who is at receiving end, does his bad kar=
ma comes forward or is it a new parabdha that is created. I vaguely remembe=
r Vimalananda mentioning something about a Saint's curse in Aghora trilogy.=
<br>


(2) On similar note, what happens when you get `blessings' say from =
a saint or elders? We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha,=
 Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 what do this items re=
ally do if they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for planets =
=E2=80=93 do they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?<br>


=
(3) I recollect an episode from famous "Gurucharitra" (well known in Mahara=
shtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru "If we cannot ch=
ange `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all". At that point Shri Gur=
u rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has onl=
y readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not ex=
act word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memory]=
. So question I have is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to a great exten=
t or it is just our perception that changes?<br>


Thanking you,<br>
