Hi Everyone,

I accidentally =
stumbled upon this page while searching for the meaning of the Lakshmi Nurs=
imha beeja mantra. I found a very mature and realistic treatment of ghosts,=
 paranormal beings and black magic.

http://www.veda.harekrsna.cz/encyclope=
dia/ghosts_FAQ.htm


The summary of the FAQ is:

=C2=A0 - There are number =
of mantra's suggested. One of them is the Nursimha beeja mantra

=C2=A0 =C2=
=A0 =C2=A0 om hrim kshraum=C2=A0ugram viram Maha-Vishnum=C2=A0jvalantam sar=
vatho mukham
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Nrisimham bhishanam bhadram=C2=A0mrityu-m=
rityum namamy aham

=C2=A0 - Playing Bhagvatgita in Sanskrit, keeping a Bha=
gvat Gita book in room helps
=C2=A0 - Doing some punya karya - e.g. chant B=
hagvat Gita and donate the result to the ghost, so that it has enough punya=
 to move on. This should be preferably done by the immediate family members=
.

It also suggests contacting the following for help. The extract from the=
 FAQ is: "There're many types of exorcism. It's officially performed e.g. b=
y Roman-Catholic Church. It's also done in Orthodox Church. The simplest Ca=
tholic exorcism is a so-called release/liberation prayer which helps in eas=
ier cases. Every priest knows it. When it fails, a professional exorcist ha=
s to be approached. Catholic exorcists are experienced and provide their se=
rvices free of charge. Every diocese has one and a local priest should be a=
ble to provide contact.".

On a personal note, my maternal grandmother was =
very attached to my mom and me. After death she used to possess my mother r=
egularly and occasionally me. She finally moved on after my parents, me and=
 my younger brother did Pitrudosha & Kalasarpa Dosha removal poojas at Trim=
bakeshwar.=C2=A0

Namaste Sir,

=C2=A0
I live in greater Bos=
ton. I am not aware of any priests in this area who can fix this. I know a =
priest who did these things before, but he is in India. I was unable to con=
tact another Boston priest related to him, who I suspected could take care =
of this.
=C2=A0
People may give you various mantras for this purpose. But t=
hey may or may not work. If Tendulkar or Dhoni tells you how you can play a=
 good shot on a particular kind of ball, you may not be able to play that s=
hot right away. Even if it is an easy shot, it may take a lot of practice f=
or you to get it right. Even with mantras, one needs enough focused practic=
e for them to work for one.
=C2=A0
In general, it is far easier (relatively=
) to fix weakness of mind and protect it, before it reaches a crisis point =
like this. Hanuman, Bhairava, Chandi, Narasimha - so many deities can be wo=
rshipped for this purpose. However, fixing it after it reaches a crisis poi=
nt requires someone who has enough shakti and knows how to direct it.
=C2=
=A0
Some replies referred to saints/swamis who are very pure/elevated etc. =
Even if one is pure or elevated, one may not necessarily be able to help. T=
his really requires some shakti and the ability to direct it for this speci=
fic task.

=C2=A0
Though I live in the area, I am not capable of doing anyt=
hing personally. However, if anybody in troubles like this is interested an=
d visits me, I can give some ash from my daily homam of divine Mother. They=
 can apply it on the forehead of the person everyday. Of course, I don't kn=
ow if it will help in any way.
=C2=A0
If interested, please send a private =
email to pvr108@....

=C2=A0Best regards,

Narasimha

 is (there are many variations of this mantra too, all are good):

=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl will have to do the s=

>>A possession by a=
 foreign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For there are=
 various classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess an indiv=

>>
>>Upayas are many. As so =
many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoreti=
cally, but whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case or=
 not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any m=
ethod. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the =
individual and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to=
 find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter =
into the person. Sometimes it can be something
 as simple as spitting somew=
here (where this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their territo=
ry and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind=
 and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to ca=
use harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sur=
e shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all de=
pends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those tryi=
ng to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if =
the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the pe=
rson trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious ha=
rm.
>>
>>These things like removing possession are specializations. These d=
o not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what on=
e is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best t=
o stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how t=
o
 handle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the t=
ime till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possessio=
n of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will inv=
olve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove t=
he spirit. It is all a complex chain.
>>
>>[Reminds me of a particular indi=
vidual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before star=
ting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as w=
ell as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per =
the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would s=
it and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own f=
ree will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to re=
move it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is =
of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]
>>
>>Best thing to do i=
s a) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and=
 hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family m=
embers to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Cha=
ndi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do =
it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10=
-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of pos=
session. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with th=
e mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very en=
d. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then e=
ither make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/h=
er. And pray as hard as possible.

I would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could def=

never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.<br clear=3D"none">=
<br clear=3D"none">However, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava w=
hich is considered to be of excellent potency for these kind of problems. T=
his form of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik=
 scriptures He is also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chan=
dika. References to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least som=
e versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been invoked for cen=
turies
 by
 followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spi=
rits, and specially during rituals
 of cremation ground. <br clear=3D"none"=
><br clear=3D"none">The standard mantra is (there are many variations of th=
is mantra too, all are good):<span style=3D"font-weight:normal;"><span styl=

ear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none"></span></span><span style=3D"font-weight:no=
rmal;"><span style=3D"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Generally, at leas=
t 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting. And this should be=
 continued daily till such time that there is some visible relief. One more=
 thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit possession,=
 as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by =
any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no one has that kind of ter=
rific shakti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physical presenc=
e in front of the victim is a must for
 the one trying to help. So clo=
se family members, who live with the girl
 will
 have to do the sadhana. If=
 you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find metho=
ds of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land hom=
as may not be that easy.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">If the family=
 visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to v=
isit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple=
. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Arou=
nd these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who=
 are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge a c=
ertain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come wit=
h some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then=
 perform their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one me=
thod. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my=
 mind. <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Hope

font-size: 12pt;">Namaste Sir,<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">A posse=
ssion by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For=
 there are various classes and kinds and types of entities which can posses=
s an individual and some of them can be downright nasty.<br clear=3D"none">=
<br clear=3D"none">Upayas are many. As so many different people have advise=
d, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of the=
m will actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors.=
 Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kin=
d of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link fo=
r the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of =
exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can=
 be
 something
 as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside=
), or
 causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to such=
 possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases wher=
e such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC E=
TC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removi=
ng and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spiri=
t, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate =
in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extr=
emely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an a=
dept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=
=3D"none">These things like removing possession are specializations. These =
do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what o=
ne is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best =
to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how =
to
 handle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the =
time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possessi=
on of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will in=
volve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove =
the spirit. It is all a complex chain.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none"=
>[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some years ago who was an ex=
pert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides =
to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit=
 would stay in possession as per the previous karmic link between the spiri=
t and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spir=
it to leave the body of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spi=
rit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work=
. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be =
applied.]<br
 clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Best thing to do is a) find=
 someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for=
 the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family members to=
 pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Nara=
simha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with s=
amkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins =
path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. =
Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental =
belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. While =
doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either mak=
e the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And p=
ray as hard as possible. <br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Best of luck=
