My two cents,

Two years back, I abolished using normal salt (sea salt) whi=
ch is
considered impure during fasts. Instead, I use sendha namak (rock sal=
t)
which has plenty of health benefits. It helps overcome anger hence benef=
its
spiritual progress.

Protein contained in soyabean is indigestible to h=
uman body. So it should
not be eaten as substitute of proteins from milk an=
d pulses.

Durgesh O Mishra
