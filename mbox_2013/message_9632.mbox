Namasteji,

Thank you for your insight, I'm scared because if I split the l=
ong words wrongly, it will mean entirely something else that is not good! I=
 remember that Lord Hanuman cleverly changed just one letter in Ravana's pr=
ayers that the priests were chanting which therefore had a very different e=
ffect. I forgot what that prayer was.

Going by this, although the prayasch=
itam prayer we do may ask for forgiveness regarding mantram, tantram etc bu=
t unwittingly by changing the meaning, God will be forced to allow the ill =
effects because we asked for it! So more than correct pronounciation, I am =
interested in avoiding changing the meaning when splitting long words in ea=
sily manageable continuous flow.

I have attached the document entitled "ma=
ha_ganapati_homam_sanskrit Highlight". Please help me split those long word=
s highlighted in yellow, correctly so I can get on with the homam soon.

Th=
anks,

Alamelu
