Subject: Questions regarding Pavamana Suktam...

Namaste,

I have a confusion regarding Pavamana Sukta. Which is real Pavama=
na Sukta? Is it the one which starts with "Hiranyavarnaaha Shuchayaha Pavak=
aaha..." which is also known as "Punyahvachan"? But when I downloaded a few=
 audio for the same - those are longer verses. So my questions are:
1. Whic=
h one is the correct Pavamana Sukta?
2. Where can I find the text of the sa=
me?
3. For which deity is it used?

regards,

Jagmohan
