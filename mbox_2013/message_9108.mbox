Some food for thought. It's good to undertake an honest self-analysis to se=
e where we are going. Towards real vedanta, or 'lip-vedanta'.

Swami Sivana=
nda Saraswati (of the Divine Life Society, Rishikesh):

"The practice of ka=
rma yoga prepares the aspirant for the reception of knowledge of the Self. =
It moulds him into a proper adhikari (eligible one) for the study of Vedant=
a." 

"Ignorant aspirants jump at once to jnana yoga without any preliminar=
y training in karma yoga. That is the reason why they fail miserably to rea=
lize the truth."

"The impurities still lurk in their minds. They only talk=
 of Brahman or God, indulging in useless discussions, vain debates and dry,=
 endless controversies. Their philosophy is on their lips only. In other wo=
rds, they are lip-Vedantins."

********

"WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED IS PRACTICA=
L VEDANTA THROUGH CEASELESS, SELFLESS SERVICE."
 
********

"A Karma-yogi i=
s either a Karma-bhakta yogi or Karmaa-gyana yogi. He works with either the=
 bhav of a Bhakta or Gyan."

"Certain qualities such as kindness, mercy, to=
lerance equal vision, humility which are aids to gyana, can be cultivated t=
hrough selfless service and service alone."

"Glory to Karma yoga ! Glory t=
o Karma Yogins ! The world is in dire need of Karma-gnana-yogins but not of=
 mere Mayavadins or lip vedantins who always indulge in vedantic gossipping=
 only but who do not turn out something very practical and useful to the wo=
rld at large."
