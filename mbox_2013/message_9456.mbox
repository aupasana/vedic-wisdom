Dear Friends,

I started daily Ganpati homam since last one month. I find it aiding in my
spiritual pursuit. I use wood, cow-dung slabs, havan samagri, grain
(depending on Varam) and til oil. However on practical side I find daily
exposure to smoke is causing trouble in my lungs. I don't have any chronic
disease related to breathing.

I want to continue my Sadhana using Homam. So I am looking for way to some
procedure with minimum smoke.

Please guide me.

Thanks
Durgesh O Mishra
