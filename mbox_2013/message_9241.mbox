Respected Narasimhaji,

In the homam, Satyanarayana pujan and tarpana manua=
ls, there are certain slokas such as the Vighneshwara Pooja after Aachamana=
m, which is essentially praying to Lord Ganesha to remove ay obstacles in t=
he pooja, as well as the conclusion at the end where one surrenders everyth=
ing done to Lord Krishna. Could you please enlighten with the meaning of th=
ese shlokas so I can connect with them even more:

1. Shukla aambardharam V=
ishnum....Sarva Kaaryashu Sarvadaa

2. Mantrahinam Kriyahinam Bhaktihinam..=
..Naaraayanaayeti Samarpayaami

Your posts on the Dasavataaras are so full =
of inner meaning, they arouse inner happiness and bliss just being able to =
understand the way you have explained. Thank you for such illuminating writ=
ings!

Thanks and best regards,
Manish
