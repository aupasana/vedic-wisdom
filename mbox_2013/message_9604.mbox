Atharva Shirsh is highest of mantra for Shri Ganesh. In general, it is
mean=
t to bestow knowledge and remove material obstacles. It is also very
useful=
 in removing mental obstacles for higher spiritual experience.
Additionally=
, It can also help with specific areas related to Ketu in your
horoscope.

=
Reciting it daily in the morning is beneficial.

A short homam along with A=
tharva Shirsh (4 or 8 times recitation), every
morning or evening is even b=
etter.

Durgesh O Mishra
