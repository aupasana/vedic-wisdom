h temperament due to whatever reasons which you are facing. =C2=A0-=C2=A0"O=
m shante parshante sarv karodh pashnon
swaha"
I have personally tried this =
mantra and observe much positive effects on mind and senses at once.
I thou=
ght that i should share it with you as you are engaged in a sacred and spir=
itual practice and at the same time you need some help.
Remember god always=
 help & assist those who strive and struggle for attainment of divine knowl=
edge, further as your intent is good have faith in yourself and in god's na=
me(mantra shakti).

Thanks & Regards,
Saurabh Kaushik
