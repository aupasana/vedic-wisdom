Namaste Rakesh ji,
Me not Narasimha, will try to write something which migh=
t interest you.

Anyone reading this , can play this in another tab, to soo=
the your mind.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9R4hMUaymgc

Sir, there is=
 something about these texts , that is imperative for these
texts to really=
 be of any meaning to anyone. That is the "story" or the
"myth" coming aliv=
e "inside" of "you".

Difficult concept to put into words, at least for me.=


Let us consider Ms DS for example, short for durga saptashati.

It is a f=
reaking long text!! at least for people who are initially
starting out reci=
ting it. But then this the path that is not easy to
begin with. And if it w=
ere easy, everybody would be very successful with
it, and not many are ( it=
 all depends on her and your madness)

The main point with recitation is , =
that Ms DS comes "alive" "inside" of
"you".
The hell does that mean? It mea=
ns that you visualize the chapters as
they are.
It means that your focus or=
 the mind is not with the sexy girl you saw
in the mall, the quickfire repl=
y you should have given to the turd that
slightly insulted you, or what pay=
ments you have to collect tomorrow
from the bank etc etc. And neither it sh=
ould be somewhere singing songs
and just waiting for this text (DS) to end.=


Believe you me , Rakesh ji it is tough. Insanely tough to get the mind
fi=
xed or visualizing the fight and all the carnage/beauty that is there
in DS=
. And what aids to the fun, is if you don't know sanskrit. Ha!!

You may kn=
ow how to read the devanagri script, but dont really know what
it means, th=
en the real fun starts. So you are reciting a text, but
can't really visual=
ize it because you just don't know what the hell it
means or what are you r=
eading!

There is a solution to that, you will need to read, re-read and re=
-read
one chapter at a time and tie in the hindi translation or an
interpre=
tation with the sanskrit text above. It will take time, an this
is not a on=
e day process. It might take years or days , and varies on a
case to case b=
asis.

I think the video would have ended in the other tab by now, you can =
play
this now.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHReN67juhCg

Let us take C=
hapter 10 for example,
in the beginning fo the chapter, once he sees that h=
is brother is dead
Gunda no 2 ( (Mr shumbh bhai) shouts at madameji for che=
ating and
relying on various other ladies  for killing his brother in crime=
 gunda
no 1 ( Nishumbh bhai ) and cheating, and madame-ji replies with aww,=

those all were actually me and merges all the forms back and shows him.

N=
ow , when you get to the tenth chapter, this visualization should be
there =
,when you read the specific verses about this incident and not be
thinking =
about oh my god when will this end I am tired and mere paise us
kutte haram=
i ke paas pare hain aur woh nahin de raha hai.

Over a period of time when =
you repeatedly visualize the entire story
along with the reading, then will=
 it one day come alive inside of you
and teach you further, because there a=
re layers upon layers upon layers
of meaning there and it will be slowly ta=
ught very serenely depending on
her wish and judgement.

Video must have en=
ded
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DKpGhw6bdmEQ

"If one has to do 108 tim=
es sapatshati reading then can u pls guide what
r rules in this time like "=


If you can manage one good reading with a nice visualization going on,
it=
 will be much better than 108 times of just rushing through with it.


1] d=
iet ,
You will want to keep it as light as possible, khichri does the trick=
,
you will need all the "inner fire" for your focus on the text and it is
a=
 limited resource, so the more heavier food you have the more it will
be us=
ed for digestion and potty preparation.

2] can it be recited in 2 or 3 sit=
tings in a day
No problems in that, but decide the routine before you commi=
tting to
madame- she just does not like people backing off.

3] if few word=
s are not properly recited then is there any harm , if
feelings r just for =
mothers love with nishkam bhav

Bhaisahab, kuch nahin hoga, you are not wor=
shipping a churail here,
eventually ma hain, tumko kategi bhi toh roegi bhi=
, pehle hi maafi maang
lo. bum nahin phootega/phootegi.

Plus you are sayin=
g harm with nishkam bhav, not sure those two fit in
the same sentence.

4] =
is 13 chap enough or any start addition is reqd if so then pls
suggest,
Bha=
iyo, 13 hi karlo theek thaak focus ke saath , go to bigger things
later.

5=
] any other advice
You try to improve your one reading and step by step get=
 it to a point
where the text is flowing inside of you and out, other wise =
108 will be
just a mental burden with you trying to hurriedly complete, wit=
h you
getting terribly bored while youa re at it.. Don't expect any fruits
=
post your 108 completion.

6]also as  u said that it is essence of vedas bu=
t how can it give moksha
as we r just reading but if one does recitation of=
 one mantra with
closed eyes then is mantra better.

Ooh the video must hav=
e ended, here another one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=3Dendscreen&=
NR=3D1&v=3DKEvKcdBfqtU

You make the entire text run inside of your head li=
ke a HD movie in
1080p resolution and you will yourself say that it is the =
essence of the
vedas.

""""but how can it give moksha as we r just reading"=
""""
You dont just have to read, hehe.

Regarding, moksha, all i can say us=
ed to be the name of very pretty girl
back in school, saali ki shaadi ho ga=
yi, god-damn it!!

Anyways if anyone expects any results , forget it. All s=
he will be doing
is smoking a cigarette and yawning, if you just go through=
 it
mindlessly.

But it always start mindlessly and if you keep at it, she =
eventually
decides to teach you. So start today ,and make small improvement=
s every
day.

Its all training and the amount of hard work that you put in,=
 in any
field of life, same here.

One good reading of only 13 chapters tak=
es about 1 hour 10 minutes or 20
depending on your speed and if you are rea=
lly comfortable it can go down
to about an 55 to sixty minutes for one read=
ing, that is if you have
really been living with Ms DS for years.

Bhagwan =
aapke saath rahe for 108 in a day.

Jai Radhika!

Video phir over - ek aur =
lo
