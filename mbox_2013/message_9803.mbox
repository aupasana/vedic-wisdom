Hello Friends,

I would like to thank Shri Narasimha Rao, for his really well written
manuals (and video)!!!

But being first time, I did have some problems with maintaining the fire.
Overall, very very good.

I know I made a few mistakes, and had a question:

Is it okay to move the wooden sticks which are burning on one corner of
kundam, to the other side , using another stick...??

i thought it wasnt so good, because deity is in the fire and by shifting
sticks, i might make a mess of the offerings already put in the kundam.

So, what i was trying to do was to make the whole kundam burn , rather than
only one side burning....so that you have a bigger fire....

Whats a better way of doing that?

( i used a combo of both wood and dried coconut.)

but because it was my first time, i was a little distracted from time to
time....because of 'burning wood ' issues....:)

Thanks!
