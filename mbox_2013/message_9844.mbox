Namaste,

Moon and Sun are mind and soul. Rahu shows the spirit of enjoy=
ment/fulfillment, even by devious/adharmik means, and Ketu shows the spirit=
 of detachment. When Rahu and Ketu eclipse Moon and Sun externally, it is c=
onducive, by resonance, to individual consciousness coming under the influe=
nce of the spirit of fulfilling desires or the spirit of abandoning desires=
.

=A0
On one end, eclip=
ses are favorable for sadhana to fulfill specific material goals (Rahu). On=
 the other end, eclipses are also favorable for sadhana for spiritual progr=
ess and can even give a samadhi (Ketu). After all, samadhi is nothing but i=
nternal Moon and internal Sun being overpowered by internal Ketu.
=A0
While=
 Sun and Moon show natural order and dharma, Rahu shows deviousness and ben=
ding rules and Ketu shows going beyond rules. In either case, elaborate rit=
uals or sadhanas with a lot of detailed rules are not ideal for such a time=
 when the aspects of our consciousness that allow us to observe such rules =
are weak.

In any c=
ase, this was a minor eclipse. It was not even partial. It was merely a pen=
umbral eclipse, i.e. a partial shadow covering a portion of Moon. Solar ecl=
ipse of Diwali (in 2 weeks) will be more important.

My father, who had not had a child for 10 =
years since marriage, meditated at a Rama temple at the time of an eclipse =
and wished for 3 children. He wrote down his wish on paper. He wanted the f=
irst child to be a son, who was devoted to God. He then wanted a daughter a=
nd then a son. He wrote the full names of all 3 children down. We were born=
 in the same order (son, daughter and son) and given the same names, in the=
 next 5 years.
=A0
During a lunar eclipse on 1995 April 15, I too meditated=
 and wrote down a wish. I wanted a child with a specific horoscope. I wrote=
 down the lagna sign, Moon sign and the houses occupied by all planets. Of =
course, I had a decent idea where planets would be 9-10 months from then an=
d so mentally picked a good rasi chart in that time period. It was a nice c=
hart with all planets placed between Guru in Dhanus in 4th house and Shukra=
 in Meena in 7th house. My daughter was born about 10 months later, with ex=
actly the same rasi chart, including lagna and Moon.
=A0
Of course, I was v=
ery young then and a little wiser now. When I meditate or do homam or anoth=
er ritual, at an eclipse time or another time, I do not wish for anything a=
nymore.
=A0
I can tell you one thing very very very confidently. NONE of us=
 know what is "good" for us! It is far better to not ask for anything and l=
et God mould one's life and transform one's personality.
