 awe. Not one instance. There was in Bengal a great sadhaka named Swami Nig=
amananda Saraswati about 150 years ago. He was a disciple of the great Agho=
ri Vamakhepa and by Vama's blessing he had realized the Goddess Smashan Tar=
a. One day the disciple insisted that he wanted to see the Universal form o=
f the Mother Tara. Vama his guru tried to dissuade him. But he was adamant =
and kept asking the form of Ma Tara that he could see and interact with, to=
 appear in the Universal form. The next thing he saw was just a face, whose=
 fierce blood-dripping fangs encompassed the whole sky and covered his enti=
re range of vision. Swami Nigamananda fainted immediately. Mind you, he had=

 the very same Devata whom he requested to appear before him in a Universal=

 what do we, as seekers, expect to happen IF a Devata chooses to manifest H=
imself/Herself on our consciousness? Unless we are very, very, very excepti=
onal, such that a Devata has pre-decided based on certain karmas and promis=
es from past existences to come and intervene in our lifepath - as it happe=
ned with Aghori Vimalananda - and pull our strings, chances are that we may=
 not derive much benefit from a casual meeting with a Devata, just like so =
many in the Kurukshetra never derived any benefit from meeting Krshna, who =
was a Devata no doubt.

> A Devata has various roopas depending on which =
instrument we are using to percieve Him/Her. The sthoola roopa - gross form=
 (rare but not impossible for a Devata). You need the gross phsyical sense =
to experience this. The sukshma roopa where we need subtle senses to percei=
ve the Devata. This is what mostly happens with people who "see" Devatas. S=
uch an interaction can very good, to just another day with nothing special.=
 It all depends on how much internal preparation has been done by the seeke=
r. As an analogy, you can, if lucky, go and meet Barrack Obama say hi and c=
ome back. Nothing much happens. Over time you forget it and life goes on. O=
r you can also meet Obama and then maybe impress him so much that he in tur=

he greater causal form. These are too rare. To have a "Darshan"/experience =
of a Devata in these forms, one will have to do solid work of self-transfor=
mation. That is detachment, control of internal enemies, etc etc, the stand=
ard advices which all scriptures and sadgurus tell us. One experience of an=
y Devata in the causal form is sufficient to leave a massive impact on a pe=
rson's life for ever. And the greater causal is mostly offlimits for just a=
