Dear Bhupendra Ji,
=C2=A0
Namaskar, pls be continew what u r doing right no=
w (homam, sadhna, finding suitable job). I had same problem for 29 months i=
n 2009 onwards. I am an ex-NRI with two master degree out of which one from=
 San Jose California USA. I have 13+ years of xperinc in=C2=A0 best MNCs wo=
rking around the globe. Right now=C2=A0I am in india and working as a Zonal=
 Manager in an organisaiton of repute after getting so much rejections even=
 for a "Sub-Standerd" jobs. At times when i was hunting jobs (merely-not a =
career ) I was told that I am good for nothing. By god grace right now I ha=
ve good profile in hand to die for and a handsome salary in pocket, in comp=
arison=C2=A0with the fellows who interviewed me in those time.
=C2=A0
Pleas=
e sit tightly on the driving seat of ur life and have patience do not add m=
ore sufferings. Unsuccess is inevitable, it will surely come to you whether=
.......how hard u hv tried but this case is not with success.

move financial/career obstacles

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir,

I am sorry to know y=
our situation and have no specific advice.

If there is a big pile of sand =
blocking one's path, all I know is that shoveling it away will unblock the =
path. I have no idea how long one needs to do it. It depends on how big the=
 pile is and how big one's shovel is. In other words, the heaviness of the =
karmas blocking one and the intensity of the remedial measures decide when =
one breaks through. It may be a day or a decade or whatever.

For material =
concerns related to finances, usually worship of Ganapathi or Lakshmi is re=
commended. Homam of Lakshmi with Kanaka Dhara Sotram (composed by Adi Shank=
ara) is a good option, but I was asked by my guru not to include it in Maha=
lakshmi homam manual as one of the options. But one can download the stotra=
m from the web and use it. One needs to just add swaahaa at the end of each=
 verse and make offerings.

There are billions of really really suffering h=
uman beings (and many many more other beings) on this earth. When I read ne=
ws sometimes, my heart gets wrenched. But, unfortunately, there is nothing =
I can do, except praying to Her to give conviction and direction to those s=
uffering, so that they can eventually find their way out of their misery.

=
I hope some divine force will show you the right direction. Doing some sadh=
ana sincerely for a while is a great thing in this age. I hope some benefit=
 accrues.

Best regards,
Narasimha
