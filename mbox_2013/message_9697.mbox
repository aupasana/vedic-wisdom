I have a question on "meaning behind the stories". Where in our scriptures =
does it say that every thing has 3 (adhi bhautic, adhidevik and aadhyatmic)=
 interpretations? Mahabharat is "history". How can we say that every thing =
mentioned therein can be, or must be, interpreted 3 ways. The notion that o=
ur scriptures have a hidden agenda which only pundits understand and can in=
terpret seems stretching the truth. A simple Krishn- Sandeepan story gets a=
 new twist! 

Shrimad Bhagvat is a detailed and voluminous book dealing wit=
h Shri Krishna's life. It gives the names of the entire clan of Gopis and y=
et does not mention Radha Rani even once! 

Durga Saptshati is included in =
Markandeya Puran. Where does it say that Mahishasur also represents our tam=
sic tendencies and Raktbeej represents our multitude of desires. 

So, the =
simple question: where is the authority for 3 way translations?
