there is something I would like to say regarding the recent post on the iss=
ue of suffering.....it is one of the most fundamental issue metaphysically.=
..and which ended up creating a Buddha....but suffering goes on none the le=
ss...

human logic and the mind that we have can only go that far with logi=
c as its tool...and this issue moves me very much as every other human to w=
alk this plane of existence...so here goes my 50 cents....

I think the who=
le problem lies with us looking at god,the creator,or divinity from a duali=
stic perspective which is pretty much in built into the way our minds work.=
...in other words...god or call it what u will...isn't a loving father,moth=
er,or what not....in fact it isn't or cannot even be given the quality of l=
ove....because love exists only in relation to its opposite...hate.

so the=
 only thing that makes sense....or at least to me...is that :when:...or whe=
never if u wish...the primordial,unified,singular consciousness...starts dr=
eaming,,creating or manifesting or projecting..or the start of time itself.=
...language goes nuts here..and I,m sure most of u are already familiar wit=
h all the scientific,vedic,and philosophical lingo...

duality happens...an=
d with it..by default..suffering...you and I start to exist....and so does =
light,dark,pain pleasure...and the whole drama....so is god love?NO..is god=
 hate? NO...is it both?YES...is it neither?YES.....DO I MAKE SENSE?....I,m =
as lost as the other guy.....

if karma makes sense to you....use it!!....i=
f rebirth and an endless process of evolution of consciousness makes sense =
to you!...use it..or if heaven and hell ,and fallen angels makes u happy!..=
.use it...or if it is all a cosmic dream,and u r just a momentary character=
,or prolection...use it..

because at the end of the day...there is no way =
we can truly understand this issue....and the funny thing is most of the so=
 called great rishis or mystics don't seem to concur....

vasistha called i=
t a great dream of one being...so if at the end of the day there is only on=
e guy...so where is injustice?...easy to say but hard to swallow when shit =
happens to you.....

so here is the bottom line....there can never be a sat=
isfactory answer to the problem of suffering!!ever since man could think he=
 has been trying but failing pathetically....

all we can do is accept it o=
r commit suicide....what else is there to do????

many times I have wanted =
to end it myself....what can I say...still human..right??
