Hi Eclipz,

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The ego doesn't break free=
 of karma. The ego is only a thought. It has no real existence. It is the A=
tma that seeks the paramatma eternally (not the ego). But its clouded by la=
yers and layers of mind. The Atma tries so hard to break free and is so anx=
ious. The moment it sees a channel it merges.

=C2=A0 
I gues=
s the understanding of destiny and rebirth is totally flawed. For the spiri=
t/atma there is no destination just an endless path from and to the univers=
al consiousness, also there is no differentiation of your spirit/atma or mi=
ne. Karma is bound only to the physical body through genes and totally play=
s only on your body and ego. Sadhana, bakthi etc. all tries to use the univ=
ersal force to help your ego to break free of karma and seek the paramatma.=
 The best of sadhanas and magic can only hasten/delay the things in your ka=
rma all the while making new karma. Thats why true gurus are needed to guid=
e on what sadhanas should and will be fruitful based on your karma. Swimmin=
g blindly in the ocean can probably take you somewhere but it is not always=
 the place you want to be.
