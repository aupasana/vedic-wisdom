ts, spirits, genes, fairies, yakshinis, yakshas and other mystical entities=
.


Some of these magical entities were believed to be benevolent; while ot=
her as evil and malefic. Every religion and culture; including Christianity=
, Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism has it own unique methods of dealing with su=
ch unseen entities. Indian culture has the largest and most diverse rites a=
nd rituals of exorcising these entities and energies from the being and aur=
a of a possessed person.
You can follow the instructions mentioned below an=
d also if you can help the needy by reciting the mantra in front of affecte=
d person as the mantras are in Sanskrit language =C2=A0for the easy of fami=
ly members.

The situation is very bad and the family is v=

Thanks,

Thanks, I will give it a try!

What about Kala Bhairava mantra? Can it be m=
ore efficient for a long-time Shiva devotee? I've heard that it can repel s=
pirits and ghosts. Can I chant these mantras at night before going to sleep=
?

What about Kala Bhairava mantra? Can it be more e=
fficient for a long-time Shiva devotee? I've heard that it can repel spirit=
