Subject: Difference between mantras in homas

Hi,

In the guides there seems to be some difference in the mantras:

1. Pr=
ana pratisthapana for mahaganapati:
Asya sri (mahaganapati) pranapratisthap=
ana mantrasya; ganaka rishihi nichrdgayatri chandaha sri mahaganapatir deva=
ta...

However Shiva pranapratisthapana goes like this:
Asya sri () pranapr=
atisthapana mantrasya; brahma vishnu maheshvara risheya; rgyajussamaatarvan=
i chandamsi; sri sadashivo devata...

My question is why there's nothing af=
ter "asya sri"? Doesn't it have to be "asya sri sadashivo"?

2. The most im=
portant question is why it says "brahma vishnu maheshvara risheya; rgyajuss=
amaatarvani chandamsi"? I've never heard of "rgyajussamaatarvani" chanda, w=
hat is this chanda exactly?

I'm doing Shiva homam using Rudram Namakam and=
 Chamakam. Can I say as in laghunyasa for rudram instead? That is:
"asya sh=
rI rudrAdyAya prashna mahAmantrasya
aghora RuShiH 
anuShTup ChandaH 
sa~gka=
rShaNamUrtisvarUpo yo&sAvAdityaH paramapuruShaH sa eSha rudro devatA ||

na=
maHshivAyeti bIjam |
shivatarAyeti shaktiH |
mahAdevAyeti kIlakam |
shrI sA=
MbasadAshiva prasAdasiddhyarthe jape viniyogaH ||"

Can the above nyasa be =
used in pranapratisthapana for homam or do I have to use the one given in t=
he guide instead?

3. Why there's no tarpana in Shiva homam? Can I adopt th=
e tarpana from mahaganapati homam and do it in Shiva homam?

4. In shuddhan=
na bali for mahaganapati homam it goes like this:
"om sri mahaganapati pars=
hadebhyo namah; balim samarpayami",
however in Shiva homam it goes like "om=
 parshadebhyo namah; balim samarpayami". Can I say something like "om sri s=
adashiva parshadebhyo namah; balim samarpayami"?

Please answer my question=
s, they have been puzzling me for a long time.
