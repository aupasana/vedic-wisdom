I'm confident that constant chanting of Sri Rudram will get rid of the prob=
lem, because Shiva is as well the lord of all such spirits and beings, and =
praying to him will remove the problem. I would chant Sri Rudram at least o=
nce a day (11 times is the best) in the affected person's presence.

What about Kala Bhairava mantra? Can it be more efficient for a long-time S=
hiva devotee? I've heard that it can repel spirits and ghosts. Can I chant =
these mantras at night before going to sleep?
