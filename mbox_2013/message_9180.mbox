Dear learned friends!

I would have thought that, being Bali, the rice is t=
o be offered directly IN the fire. 

Why do we have to "place bali in six d=
ifferent places outside the homa kundam"?

We offer everything else, such a=
s ghee, into the fire. 

I have many such questions.

Thanks for your help.=

Ranga
