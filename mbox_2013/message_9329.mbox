Thanks for such an extensive and insightful reply, Narasimhaji! It has many=
 elements I had not thought of before. How true it is that desire is accomp=
anied by mental agitation! I have to reflect on all the points you raised. =
:)

r this very valuable info and your concern for my welfare. Assuming Apsaras=
 cannot come to us in physical form at all, then how is it that our Puranas=
 are full of incidents like Rishis marrying Apsaras, Apsaras giving birth t=
o children due to their physical union with Rishis, etc.? Even some great k=
ings are known to have had the company of Apsaras. For example, Emperor Pur=
urava was seduced by Urvashi Apsara. She lived with him for one year, and t=
hen disappeared, leaving him distressed. How all this can be explained? Any=
 insightful ideas from you learned ones pertaining to these incidents would=
 be very helpful.
