Namaskar

As Sumeetji rightly said  This is suitable for those who do not h=
ave
children or a male child or those who know very well that their descend=
ants
will not do these ceremonies once they pass on.

Further once who does=
 this he will not be entitled to participated in
worldly ceremonies (as Hum=
an) such as marriage,  Inauguration, ceremonies,
Homam,.... etc. as one is =
changing his status to Pitru.

For us as human we should leave our desire a=
nd as mentioned in Gita turn to
be 'Stitahpragnay'  is way of Tarpan for ow=
n self.
