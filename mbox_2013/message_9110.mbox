Yes, who indeed. 

Swami Sivananda's instructions to himself during his sad=
hana period are given below (he used to write reminder notes to himself). T=
hey are most enlightening. Quite the opposite of the 'lip-vedanta' that mos=
t of us practice.

"Serve Bhangis, serve rogues, serve inferiors, remove fa=
ecal matter, clean clothes of Sadhus - take delight, carry water". 

"Do no=
t revenge, resist not evil, return good for evil, bear insult and injury". =


 "Forget like a child any injury done by somebody immediately. Never keep=
 it in the heart. It kindles hatred. Cultivate Maitri (friendship), Karuna =
(compassion), Daya (mercy), Prema (love), Kshama (forgiveness)". 

"Develop=
 good manners, extreme politeness, courtesy, etiquette, good demeanour, nob=
ility, gentleness, mildness. Never be rude, harsh, or cruel. There is nothi=
ng to be hated in the world. Hatred is ignorance. All contempt for anything=
 or being must be removed through love and Vichara (enquiry)".

e is available here:
