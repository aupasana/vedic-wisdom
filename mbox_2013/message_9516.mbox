There are two obstacles to your practice.

One, you are unable to concentra=
te. Another, you want to overcome your
anger. Prima facie, they look interr=
elated but it can be segregated at
spiritual level.

I hope you are doing M=
ahaganpati Homam before actual homam so that The
Vighnvinashak takes care o=
f obstacles during homam.

Another thing, before the Homam try to do jaap f=
or any mantra of your
choice 108X times like Om Namashivay, Om Hrim Namashi=
vay or Om Hrum Rum
Chaitanyay Namah.

This should help you concentrate your=
 mind during Homam.

Overcoming your Anger/emotions shall be long term goal=
 and will come
naturally when you perform Homam regularly over few years.

Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
