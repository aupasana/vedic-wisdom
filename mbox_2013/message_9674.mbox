The way=C2=A0Narasimha Ji explains the in depths of sp=

Inputs from=C2=A0Nandi Ji are also very important from Sadhana viewpoi=

=C2=A0 
Namaste,


I agree to this id=
ea totally that any or more of the paths can be mixed by an individual. And=
 I agree 200% with the statement that Jyana Yoga needs one to be brutally h=
onesty with our own selves. Which at various times we are not, because the =
ego (sense of I-ness) loves to shield our own vital flaws from ourselves to=
 provide ever so slightly an illusion of wellbeing, progress and knowledge.=


However, I slightly disagree with the statement on RajaYoga. IMHO, any ki=
nd of concentrated effort at calming the mind down, in a controlled posture=
, is a part of Rajayoga. And pretty much every seeker tries it to some exte=
nt. And it can work too depending on how much one is able to focus the mind=
. What we normally understand by the term meditation is part of RajaYoga.

=

What Sri Ramakrishna *may* (it looks more reasonable to me) have referred,=
 and advised against, was possibly HathaYoga. Now that is extremely dangero=
us=C2=A0 without the right environment, without the right food, right habit=
s, right control and most importantly the right mentor/guide/guru.

Hatha Y=
oga forces the Kundalini to awaken using a guided combination of physical p=
ostures. This automatically presumes that the Yogi must have a disease free=
 body and a very stable mind. Mistakes here can be extremely costly.


As s=
uch Swami Vivekananda was very adept in meditation practices. So that would=
 technically fall under RajaYoga.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Though I =
am not sure of the full context, yet could not resist the urge to make a sm=
all comment on a line from the emails below.

<<These 4 yogas are listed in=
 Bhagavat Gita, you can check it, I assure there are four of them.>>

Many =
great spiritual commentators, who are also founders of various sects within=
 hinduism have commented and written purports on the Gita. And each of thes=
e celebrated commentators have strongly disagreed with each other on variou=
s crucial points of interpretation of what the text says. Some have read it=
 to conclude that "X" yoga is better or higher than "Y" yoga, or A philosop=
hy is the right way to look at reality instead of Y philosophy, or interpre=
ted words/phrases in a sense that,sometimes does not make sense. And natura=
lly followers of each of these great Gurus believe that their interpretatio=
n is the final and maximum one.

Reading all this can be confusing. Rather =
IMHO the Gita looks more like a book of progressive arguments. Each section=
 builds up into the next. It is not one against the other, or one separate =
from the other. In that sense it is hardly a sectarian document, it does no=
t say one specific interpretation of the spiritual reality is higher or bet=
ter than another, but rather (probably because the reality is so complex)ac=
cepts that multiple views points are *simultaneously* true.



Though
we ha=
ve classified our understanding of the spiritual path today 
into some broa=
d exclusive basics like Jyana, Bhakti, Karma ETC ETC.. I am not sure if thi=
s is what the actual text intended to do.

Is it not interesting that every=
 chapter of the Gita is a Yoga? Arjuna's depression is also named as Yoga -=
 Arjunavishad Yoga. [So many people get depressed about so many things dail=
y, yet what exactly is special about Arjuna's depression, or what is that d=
epression which when it afflicts someone makes him/her=C2=A0 fit for receiv=
ing Divine knowledge?]

Therefore, IMO, one does not really go into Gyana Y=
oga by bypassing or staying away from Karma Yoga. As Karma Yoga gets perfec=
ted, automatically a higher Gyana comes into the seeker. And so
 on..

=C2=A0 
Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
I am cc'ing =
this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup because of the spiritual content.
=C2=A0
I =
agree with Vishnu ji's comment on a specific point in Maja ji's nice write-=
up:

=C2=A0
Indeed, one can carv=
e one's own niche by combining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mut=
ually exclusive.
=C2=A0
I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yo=
ga" where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:
=C2=A0
"Each soul is potential=
ly divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by controlling
 nat=
ure: external and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic co=
ntrol, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free."
=C2=
=A0
Here are my 2 cents.
=C2=A0
Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization a=
nd wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasiz=
es on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and=
 surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to d=
evelop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and sur=
render to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities=
 develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a =
realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualiti=
es fully blossomed.
=C2=A0
Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, naksh=
atramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga f=
or 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controlling body =
and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requires s=
trict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water a=
nd food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can b=
e dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taug=
ht in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). H=
e discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it =
to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.
=C2=A0
Jnana=
 yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the delu=
sional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/sma=
rt enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman. =
Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion anyway" wit=
hout fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in co=
nsciousness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a movie that "=
it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in every scary scene, cry=
ing in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earnest=
ness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant contemplat=
ion and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the en=
d.
=C2=A0
IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are=
 the most suitable and safest.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

purports on the Gita. And each of these celebrated commentators have strong=

 what the text says. Some have read it to conclude that "X" yoga is better =

 look at reali=

 interpreted words/phrases in a sense that,s=
ometimes does not make sense. And naturally followers of each of these grea=

onfusing. Rather IMHO the Gita looks more like a book of progressive argume=
nts. Each section builds up into the next. It is not one against the other,=
 or one separate from the other. In that sense it is hardly a sectarian doc=
ument, it does not say one specific interpretation of the spiritual reality=
 is higher or better than another, but rather (probably because the reality=
 is so complex)accepts that
 multiple
 views points are *simultaneously* tr=

this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup because of the spiritual content.<br> =

ayana for one lifetime and<br>> > master it to as perfect as possible=
. *<br>> <br>>  I am not entirely sure if the above statement is=
 correct. It is very much<br>> possible and in fact is a measure of self=
 realized people.<br> <br>Indeed, one can carve one's own niche by com=
bining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.<br>&nbs=
p;<br>I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where he makes=
 a comment on the 4 paths:<br> <br>"Each soul is potentially divine. T=
he goal is to manifest this divinity
 within by controlling
 nature: extern=
al and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or p=
hilosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free."<br> <br>H=
ere are my 2 cents.<br> <br>Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization =
and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasi=
zes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion an=
d surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to =
develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and su=
rrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualitie=
s develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a=
 realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualit=
ies fully blossomed.<br> <br>Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa=
, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja=
 yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controllin=
g body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend req=
uires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, =
water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yog=
a can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicit=
ly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts I=
MHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He tau=
ght it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.<br>&n=
bsp;<br>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling =
into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not since=
re/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I=
 am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusio=
n anyway" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces =
duality in consciousness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a=
 movie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in every sca=
ry scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerel=
y and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of consta=
nt contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional j=
ump to the end.<br> <br>IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga=
 and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.<br> <br>Best regards=
