Respected PVR ji,
Namaste and thanks for an eye-opener again from you.
Some=
 where, some what we all are responsible and adding towards the dis-balance=
 of 'prakrati'. I can say that prakrati retaliates if things go much beyond=
 control, for example even our body retaliates (by causing disease) towards=
 our misdoing (may be in form of bad eating or any other action).
I suppose=
 there is a physical as well as a cosmic equilibrium. the physical equilibr=
ium is sustained by some cosmic forces (or forces of nature, we can name th=
em whatever we like to). Once these forces are being challenged or disturbe=
d then the physical equilibrium is also disturbed or a dis-balance is creat=
ed. such dis-balances can result into various painful events or tragedies.=
=C2=A0
what i understood from this tragedy is that, in India there is a ser=
ious infiltration to some major shrines and places with high cosmic vibrati=
ons. For example if we check the recent stats the increase in visitors to m=
ajor shrines rises drastically. and many of us, just visit these shrines fo=
r enjoyment/holiday and not for the actual purpose. Almost every month we h=
ave one or two deaths at Banke Bihari temple (Vrindavan) due to stampede or=
 choking in crowd but these are neglected by the authorities there. Not onl=
y Vrindavan or Mathura, but many other such places in India become famous p=
icnic/holiday spots.
I am not sure about the present Kaali phase, but what =
ever is going on will bring more pain to us in some form or the other.
I ho=
pe more light will be shown to us from people like you to sustain this phas=
e.

Best Regards
Ashish K.Agarwal

Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
A=
 2 cents on a few different points related to this topic.

=C2=A0
(1) Suppo=
se some of my children are living in a house that is right next to a big ri=
ver and a big wall with my picture painted on it is protecting the=C2=A0
ho=
use from the river water. Suppose they become stupid and decide to 
"move" =
that wall somewhere else. Suppose the house is then ruined by the river.
=
=C2=A0
Is it that I became wrathful because a wall with "my 
picture" paint=
ed on it was moved (suggesting that I am so attached to that picture)? Or i=
s it that I loved them, but they 
were stupid enough to remove their protec=
tion and paid for it?
=C2=A0
(2)
The word "dhArI" is from the root "dhR", w=
hich means to hold, maintain, preserve. The word "dhArI" literally means on=
e who holds things together. Dhaari Devi stands for the
 protective force t=
hat holds various complex forces in a delicate 
equilibrium. Because this t=
emple contains the upper half of the torso 
and the bottom half is worshipp=
ed at another location as "Kaali", people may think of her as Kaali. But th=
e goddess who was moved is the goddess of protection and balance. This is a=
 case of withdrawal of protection in a delicate equilibrium rather than wra=
th, thought it may seem like the latter.
=C2=A0
(3) Some deities like Kaali=
, Bhairavi, Dhoomavati etc may indeed by associated with fierce destruction=
. However, the stereotypical image some people may have of such deities as =
wrathful, out-of-control, irritable persons is inaccurate.
=C2=A0
Everyday =
billions of cells in our bodies become useless. They block other good cells=
 from functioning. Body has an elaborate system to "kill" them, flush them =
out of the system and recycle the elements in them, i.e. create new cells. =
This is a natural process and one without which life is will be far less pl=
easant/sustainable. The force behind this natural process is not irritable =
or angry. It is just
 something very thoughtful, wise and elaborate. But, i=
f we personify that force, its actions of killing billions of cells and flu=
shing them out may indeed make it look like an angry and irritable person!
=
=C2=A0
Deities such as Kaali and Bhairavi are personifications of the force=
s behind this natural process of destruction, elimination and recycling, wi=
thin the "macrocosm". Remove the stereotypes from your mind to gain a bette=
r understanding of these deities and genuine love for them (and not fake lo=
ve out of necessity and fear).
=C2=A0
(4) First of all, let us accept that =
shifting a temple that was established specifically for protecting this reg=
ion was an unwise and bad karma. Yet, it is not 100% clear whether what hap=
pened is a direct consequence. In this case, it may very well be. But the b=
igger point I want to make is that we do not really know which karmaphala i=
s arising from which karma. We often draw convenient conclusions based on o=
ur
 beliefs, agendas and conditioning.
=C2=A0
For example, when hurricane S=
andy happened in northeast US, some Christian conservative commentators in =
US said that states that were legalizing gay marriage were facing the wrath=
 of God! They probably believed it genuinely. It was perhaps perfectly logi=
cal for the image of "god" constructed in their own minds to do it!! But, i=
t may be a silly idea given the image of god constructed in the mind of som=
eone else.
=C2=A0
God is infinite and un-knowable. We all have an *evolving=
* finite image of god in our finite and conditioned minds based on our own =
*evolving* sense of good and bad, strong and weak, desirable and undesirabl=
e, etc. It is wise not to second guess god and associate specific karmas wi=
th specific karmaphalas, for we can never know with certainty.
=C2=A0
Havin=
g said that, a bad karma can be avoided whether or not it caused a specific=
 karma phala or not!
=C2=A0
(5) Though everyday
 billions of new cells are =
created in our bodies, billions of old cells are killed and flushed out and=
 trillions of cells sustained, some periods before periodic rejuvenation br=
ing more destruction than usual.
=C2=A0
I do believe that the world is goin=
g through such a "Kaali phase" right now. It probably will continue for ano=
ther decade or less. However, relocation of a temple is very small problem =
compared to bigger problems that the Mother of fine balance must handle in =
this world right now, to come up with a more sustainable equilibrium!
=C2=
=A0
Human beings are arrogantly and foolishly ruining their own environment=
, under the delusion that it is ok. A powerful minority is spreading unnatu=
ral and unsustainable lifestyles everywhere in the world, under the delusio=
n of speading "civilization" and "development". The food
 people eat, the d=
rinks people dump in their bodies and the air people breathe, are increasin=
gly polluted with dangerous chemicals.
=C2=A0
In the interest of the susten=
ance of earth and life on it, some drastic changes MUST be made. The change=
s kicked off by the force of Kaali will continue to unravel over the years.=
 It may be painful, but it may in the long run result in a more sustainable=
 equilibrium.
=C2=A0
During this phase, it may not be helpful or useful to =
put the microscope on specific events. It is better to develop a balanced a=
ttitude of compassionate detachment and just pray for peace. Also, as more =
and more sadhakas do intense sadhana, it may smooth out some of the painful=
 changes.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

amaste Sir,
>=C2=A0
>That is a variation satisfying the metre. But it is le=
ss apt, for the following reasons:
>=C2=A0
>(1) The word "tu" indicates som=
e irony or contrast. If you say "He rules the bridge of dharma. Then again,=
 he destroys the path of adharma", there is no such contrast. Basically, I =
see "tu" as a misfit there.
>(2) Bhairava is not necessarily a deity destro=
ying adharma. In fact, he stands more for liberation and for destroying the=
 distinction in one's mind between dharma and adharma. For example, he is d=
epicted as roaming around naked drinking wine.
>=C2=A0
>BTW, observe the im=
agery. Line before says "dharma setu pAlakaM" - the ruler of the bridge of =
dharma. Dharma is merely seen as a bridge here. Bridge to what? Obviously b=
ridge over the sea of samsara and into infinite freedom. Bhairava not only =
controls the bridge, but his main purpose is to take one into infinite free=
dom from that bridge. Thus, swadharma mArga nAshakaM fits nicely following =
that line.
>=C2=A0
>BTW, some people may be tempted to worship and Bhairava=
 and emulate him by drinking wine or roaming naked in a smashan. That may n=
ot necessarily liberate one. Please note that Bhairava is not free becauseh=
e drinks wine and roams naked. He is already free and does those things bec=
ausehe is free. In any case, even Bhairava, the deity of destroying right-w=
rong distinctions in mind and ringing in liberation is described as "dharma=
 setu palaka"! Dharma is very important. Until you reach the shore of infin=
ite freedom, you HAVE to stay afloat of the ocean of samsara, by getting at=
op the bridge of dharma! Otherwise you will sink in the ocean of samara, to=
ppled by the waves of delusion. Though one needs to jump off the bridge in =
the end, "the end" is not anywhere near for most people on earth and they b=
etter realize it!

 Suppose some of my children are living in a house that is =
right next to
 a big river and a big wall with my picture painted on it is =
protecting the 
house from the river water. Suppose they become stupid=
 and decide to 
"move" that wall somewhere else. Suppose the house is then =
ruined by the
 river.<br> <br>Is it that I became wrathful because a w=
all with "my 
picture" painted on it was moved (suggesting that I am so att=
ached to that picture)? Or is it that I loved them, but they 
were stupid e=
nough to remove their protection and paid for it?<br> <br>(2)
The word=
 "dhArI" is from the root "dhR", which means to hold, maintain, preserve. T=
he word "dhArI" literally means one who holds things together. Dhaari Devi =
stands for the
 protective force that holds various complex forces in a del=
icate 
equilibrium. Because this temple contains the upper half of the tors=
o 
and the bottom half is worshipped at another location as "Kaali", people=
 may think of her as Kaali. But the goddess who was moved is the goddess of=
 protection and balance. This is a case of withdrawal of protection in a de=
licate equilibrium rather than wrath, thought it may seem like the latter.<=
br> <br>(3) Some deities like Kaali, Bhairavi, Dhoomavati etc may inde=
ed by associated with fierce destruction. However, the stereotypical image =
some people may have of such deities as wrathful, out-of-control, irritable=
 persons is inaccurate.<br> <br>Everyday billions of cells in our bodi=
es become useless. They block other good cells from functioning. Body has a=
n elaborate system to "kill" them, flush them out of the system and recycle=
 the elements in them, i.e. create new cells. This is a natural process and=
 one without which life is will be far less pleasant/sustainable. The force=
 behind this natural process is not irritable or angry. It is just
 somethi=
ng very thoughtful, wise and elaborate. But, if we personify that force, it=
s actions of killing billions of cells and flushing them out may indeed mak=
e it look like an angry and irritable person!<br> <br>Deities such as =
Kaali and Bhairavi are personifications of the forces behind this natural p=
rocess of destruction, elimination and recycling, within the "macrocosm". R=
emove the stereotypes from your mind to gain a better understanding of thes=
e deities and genuine love for them (and not fake love out of necessity and=
 fear).<br> <br>(4) First of all, let us accept that shifting a temple=
 that was established specifically for protecting this region was an unwise=
 and bad karma. Yet, it is not 100% clear whether what happened is a direct=
 consequence. In this case, it may very well be. But the bigger point I wan=
t to make is that we do not really know which karmaphala is arising from wh=
ich karma. We often draw convenient conclusions based on our
 beliefs, agen=
das and conditioning.<br> <br>For example, when hurricane Sandy happen=
ed in northeast US, some Christian conservative commentators in US said tha=
t states that were legalizing gay marriage were facing the wrath of God! Th=
ey probably believed it genuinely. It was perhaps perfectly logical for the=
 image of "god" constructed in their own minds to do it!! But, it may be a =
silly idea given the image of god constructed in the mind of someone else.<=
br> <br>God is infinite and un-knowable. We all have an *evolving* fin=
ite image of god in our finite and conditioned minds based on our own *evol=
ving* sense of good and bad, strong and weak, desirable and undesirable, et=
c. It is wise not to second guess god and associate specific karmas with sp=
ecific karmaphalas, for we can never know with certainty.<br> <br>Havi=
ng said that, a bad karma can be avoided whether or not it caused a specifi=
c karma phala or not!<br> <br>(5) Though everyday
 billions of new cel=
ls are created in our bodies, billions of old cells are killed and flushed =
out and trillions of cells sustained, some periods </span><span id=3D"yiv06=

Respected sir,<br>With due regards I request you t=
o shed some light upon the recent Uttarakhand tragedy. After the tragedy it=
 is now believed that the tragedy was due to shifting of Dhari devi temple =
at Alaknanda river. I read some post by shri Manish ji and blog of shri san=
jay rath ji.  <br>My doubt is that, in present context how much it is relev=
ant that such tragedies do happen by a Devi wrath. As per our believe God i=
s merciful and even in some of your post previously you have said that it i=
s not worthwhile to connect tragedies with God or faith for Him?<br>Hope yo=
u can elaborate this.<br><br>Best Regards<br>Ashish K.agarwal</div><div>Sen=
