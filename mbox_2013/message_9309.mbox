1] diet , 
2] can it b=
e recited in 2 or 3 sittings in a day
3] if few words are not properly reci=
ted then is there any harm , if feelings r just for mothers love with nishk=
am bhav

4] is 13 chap enough or any start addition is reqd if so then pls =
suggest, 

5] any other advice

6]  also as  u said that it is essence of v=
