Dear all,

Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my rec=
ent experience of a patient of mine.

I am doing a psychiatry job at presen=
t, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has=
 had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has i=
nvolved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is no=
t of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms star=
ted and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anyt=
hing physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this=
 is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe th=
emselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini aw=
akening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainst=
ream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by we=
stern medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged kundalini, we str=
uggle to help them.

Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My exp=
erience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be fo=
rcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffe=
ring from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and=
 it is something she cannot escape from.

I wondered what solution there co=
uld be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, wh=
o manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and ei=
ther cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that th=
e good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we =
may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. 

And let us be caref=
ul in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps =
this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "le=
t me be your instrument" and leave the kundalini rising bit to God's will.

Om Dum Durgayai Namaha
