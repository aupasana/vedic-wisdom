namaste,


> I chanted mantras in anger and had given aahutis


In the beginning of the mahabharata, bhrigu curses agni (fire) to become
the 'eater of all things', both sacred and vulgar. As a result, agni became
distressed. Through his yogic power, agni always divided himself and
remained present in all homas and other sacrifices. He took the offerings
made in the fire to the respective beings. But, he did not want to eat
anything that was impure. After bhrigu's curse, he decided to withdraw
himself from all homas.

Both the rishis who made offerings in agni and the devas who received these
offerings were distressed and went to Brahma. They asked Brahma how agni
could eat both sacred and vulger things.

Brahma now summons agni and asks him how he could withdraw himself from
homa and other sacrifices, as agni was the creator, sustainer and destroyer
of the three lokas. He then advises agni and tells him that he would not
have to consume vulgar offerings with his entire body. Only a particular
portion of agni would have to consume impure offerings. Even those
offerings would become pure the moment they were consumed by agni, and agni
himself would remain pure. Brahma thus asked agni to remain the 'eater of
all things', and agni agreed.


**********


Through this divine play between Bhrighu, Agni and Brahma, all of us have
benefited. Though we make both pure and impure offerings (both physical and
mental), the ever pure Agni remains present in our homas. He remains
unaffected, and purifies each and every one of our offerings. As we spend
more and more time with Agni, the impure within us slowly becomes pure.

sasneham,

    ajit
