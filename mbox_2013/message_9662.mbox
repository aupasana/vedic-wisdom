Namaste,


I agree to this idea totally that any or more of the paths can b=
e mixed by an individual. And I agree 200% with the statement that Jyana Yo=
ga needs one to be brutally honesty with our own selves. Which at various t=
imes we are not, because the ego (sense of I-ness) loves to shield our own =
vital flaws from ourselves to provide ever so slightly an illusion of wellb=
eing, progress and knowledge.

However, I slightly disagree with the statem=
ent on RajaYoga. IMHO, any kind of concentrated effort at calming the mind =
down, in a controlled posture, is a part of Rajayoga. And pretty much every=
 seeker tries it to some extent. And it can work too depending on how much =
one is able to focus the mind. What we normally understand by the term medi=
tation is part of RajaYoga.


What Sri Ramakrishna *may* (it looks more rea=
sonable to me) have referred, and advised against,was possibly HathaYoga. N=
ow that is extremely dangerous=C2=A0 without the right environment, without=
 the right food, right habits, right control and most importantly the right=
 mentor/guide/guru.

Hatha Yoga forces the Kundalini to awaken using a guid=
ed combination of physical postures. This automatically presumes that the Y=
ogi must have a disease free body and a very stable mind. Mistakes here can=
 be extremely costly.


As such Swami Vivekananda was very adept in meditat=
ion practices. So that would technically fall under RajaYoga.

*=C2=A0=C2=
=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

Though I am not sure of the full context, yet could no=
t resist the urge to make a small comment on a line from the emails below.
=

<<These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you can check it, I assure th=
ere are four of them.>>

Many great spiritual commentators, who are also fo=
unders of various sects within hinduism have commented and written purports=
 on the Gita. And each of these celebrated commentators have strongly disag=
reed with each other on various crucial points of interpretation of what th=
e text says. Some have read it to conclude that "X" yoga is better or highe=
r than "Y" yoga, or A philosophy is the right way to look at reality instea=
d of Y philosophy, or interpreted words/phrases in a sense that,sometimes d=
oes not make sense. And naturally followers of each of these great Gurus be=
lieve that their interpretation is the final and maximum one.

Reading all =
this can be confusing. Rather IMHO the Gita looks more like a book of progr=
essive arguments. Each section builds up into the next. It is not one again=
st the other, or one separate from the other. In that sense it is hardly a =
sectarian document, it does not say one specific interpretation of the spir=
itual reality is higher or better than another, but rather (probably becaus=
e the reality is so complex)accepts that multiple views points are *simulta=
neously* true.



Though
we have classified our understanding of the spirit=
ual path today 
into some broad exclusive basics like Jyana, Bhakti, Karma =
ETC ETC.. I am not sure if this is what the actual text intended to do.

Is=
 it not interesting that every chapter of the Gita is a Yoga? Arjuna's depr=
ession is also named as Yoga - Arjunavishad Yoga. [So many people get depre=
ssed about so many things daily, yet what exactly is special about Arjuna's=
 depression, or what is that depression which when it afflicts someone make=
s him/her=C2=A0 fit for receiving Divine knowledge?]

Therefore, IMO, one d=
oes not really go into Gyana Yoga by bypassing or staying away from Karma Y=
oga. As Karma Yoga gets perfected, automatically a higher Gyana comes into =
the seeker. And so on..

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with h=
eart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo

=C2=A0 
Namaste=
 friends,
=C2=A0
I am cc'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup because of the=
 spiritual content.
=C2=A0
I agree with Vishnu ji's comment on a specific p=
oint in Maja ji's nice write-up:

e only one ayana for one lifetime and

=C2=A0
Indeed, one can carve one's own niche by combining multiple paths.=
 They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.
=C2=A0
I'll quote Swami Vivek=
ananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:
=
=C2=A0
"Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divin=
ity within by controlling
 nature: external and internal. Do this either by=
 work or worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or al=
l of these - and be free."
=C2=A0
Here are my 2 cents.
=C2=A0
Jnana yoga em=
phasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and =
detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti y=
oga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever =
is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detache=
d action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclus=
ive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, others will automati=
cally develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or onenes=
s) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.
=C2=A0
Forget about horos=
cope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly=
 recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
=
 against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic life force t=
o purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In thi=
s age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of ob=
structions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but wh=
at Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the gre=
atest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pur=
suing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even hi=
m to practice it.
=C2=A0
Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct d=
anger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this =
age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "=
all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. I=
t's all a delusion anyway" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning=
 that reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind
 of like decl=
aring wisely in a movie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinc=
hing in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute =
honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A lo=
ng path of constant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a q=
uick delusional jump to the end.
=C2=A0
IMHo, for most people in this age, =
Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.
=C2=A0
Best re=
gards,

 is correct. It is very much<br>> possible and in fact is a measure of s=
elf realized people.<br> <br>Indeed, one can carve one's own niche by =
combining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.<br>&=
nbsp;<br>I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where he ma=
kes a comment on the 4 paths:<br> <br>"Each soul is potentially divine=
. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by controlling
 nature: exte=
rnal and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or=
 philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free."<br> <br=
>Here are my 2 cents.<br> <br>Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophizatio=
n and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga empha=
sizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion =
and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try t=
o develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and =
surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualit=
ies develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally,=
 a realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qual=
ities fully blossomed.<br> <br>Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsam=
sa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Ra=
ja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controll=
ing body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend r=
equires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air=
, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja y=
oga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explic=
itly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts=
 IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He t=
aught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.<br>=
 <br>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of fallin=
g into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sin=
cere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman.=
 I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delus=
ion anyway" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforce=
s duality in consciousness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in=
 a movie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in every s=
cary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincer=
ely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of cons=
tant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional=
 jump to the end.<br> <br>IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yo=
ga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.<br> <br>Best regar=
