Chanting of mantras get accumulated over several births. Some mantras are
a=
lready in debt. So it may happen that some mantras you had already
finished=
 considerable counts in last birth. So it may fructify early. It
can be cal=
culated using rules given in vedic remedies by Pt. Sanjay Rath.

So don't k=
eep the count. Jaap with devotion is of utmost importance.

Durgesh=
 O Mishra
