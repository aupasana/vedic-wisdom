Paramhamsa Satyananda Saraswati (disciple of Swami Sivananda Saraswati and =
Guru of the Bihar School of Yoga):

"To learn bhakti vou do not need to go =
to school or read books. Bhakti is singing, hearing and writing His name, d=
rawing His picture, living with  people who talk about God. This will not o=
nly make you free from tension and high blood pressure, it will make you im=
mensely happy."

"Love, devotion, hatred, jealousy, fear, passion, sacrific=
e and anger are feelings. You feel them; you do not see them. Similarly, yo=
u cannot see God. God has to be felt. Feeling makes you like a child, it is=
 always pure. Childlike devotion is necessary for bhakti."

"Bhakti is the =
only sadhana path free of obstacles. Bhakti is inspired and sustained by Go=
d. It is attained only by the grace of God. It is His prasad. You come to b=
hakti by God's blessing. You love Him, you become attached to him only when=
 and as He wishes. Therefore, when bhakti is His gift, His wish, how can th=
ere be an obstacle? "
