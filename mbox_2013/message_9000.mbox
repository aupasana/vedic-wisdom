Whoever said that you need to necessarily have non veg in vama marg?
It all=
 depends on guna's ( objectively based on you) and what percent of sattwa n=
eeds to get out using rajas on tamas, thus non veg may be used if guruji so=
 allows it. Vama is not about sex, non veg and rock'n'roll.

Makes sense?
N=
o?
Find someone who can genuinely guide you, off the internet.
Also, explor=
e more about this word "vipreet' and the form you are worshiping. Then, if =
you have balls of steel, combine the upper two
factors, you go ahead.

Advi=
ce - seedhi kar lo bhai, vipreet bhi ho jaaegi.
