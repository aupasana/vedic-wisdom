Hello Sandesh,

First things First, In relation to ishta(favorite deity) yo=
u need to have
understanding of what deity stands for and what you seek fro=
m HER. please
implicitly follow your guru. In my personal opinion, your psy=
che should be
grounded with the particular mantra and the vibrations to mov=
e further from
one frequency to another. Devi Pratyangira will bless you wi=
th next mantra
if you are ready for it. Please dont approach the mantra wit=
h "vira bhava"
unless you are ready. Vira bhav indicates intense commitment=
 to ishta and
guru, purity at heart, and kneeling down to be ready for the =
final "crush".

thanks
Sri
