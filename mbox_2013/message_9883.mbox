<div><span></span>=A0</div><div><span>First of all, when I =

 the utility part only and not beyon=

I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, any kn=
owledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half knowled=
ge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in our this em=
pirical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of the fact o=
f having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that the Sun do=
es not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, still we us=
e sentences like "Sun rises=A0in the east", "Sun=A0sets=A0in=
 the west" etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with activit=

<div><span></span>=A0</div><div><span>One should not comment=
 about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full =

re anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=A0must =

that if=A0one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one would definit=

arnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments fr=

<br clear=3D"none">T=
he Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shu=
nya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah.
 Therefore
 their idea of rein=
carnation
 is very different. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, =
body that coalesces together
 to give the impression of an individual being=
, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the greater flow o=
f energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation at a lat=
er date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a different point can =
coalesce into a different part. =A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in the=
ir doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarn=
ate into one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into another=
 body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnati=
ng in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another person, o=
r his energy of body incarnating in another person and all these happening =
simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.<br clear=3D"none">
<br clear=
=3D"none">Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation=
 looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed only by =
a supreme law of
 debts/balances - rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain scriptures=
 are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the=
 illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There =
is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards=
 strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.<br clear=3D"none=
">
<br clear=3D"none">But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a =
soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried fo=
rward from one life to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to =
assist and develop this soul's influence on the earth. The soul inhabit=
s and uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was t=
hat this individual and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - i=
n some birth finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual hum=
an vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=A0</span><span><span> A Supreme Negatio=
n of life is 
not the ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities=
.=A0 If=A0 moving into a state 
of complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is =
the final and inevitable aim,
 then there was just no need for Avataras to =
descend and perform complex
 life-actions. </span>The law of Karma is here =
too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as=
 in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an =
action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it d=
oes, then it changes the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive,=
 complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a ban=
dit who must have killed hundreds of people can transform himself into a Ri=
shi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a hundred times to get k=
illed in the hands of those he had killed]. </span><span>Whereas those aspe=
cts of life 
where the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly gov=
erned by 
the law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. <=
