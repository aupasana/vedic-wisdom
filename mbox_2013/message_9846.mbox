Namaster Shri Narasimha,

Thank you for your reply.

In fact, after reading=
 your earlier manuals, I got to know about the
potential 'intonation' probl=
ems.

I tried to do some research on Vedic Accents , and have attached two
=
sources that I was going through.

But they are making me even more confuse=
d, as I know nothing before about
Prachaya , Independent Svarita, Jatya Sva=
rita..etc.

(Rather, In the vedic chants that I have heard, I have never he=
ard more
than 3 notes)

I was thinking before there are only 3 'notes':

1.=
 Udatta : Unmarked in most texts ,which I thought is the 'medium/in
between=
' note
                   But these texts say it means 'Raised'

2. Anudatt=
a: The one marked with 'underscore'
                      Texts say ' Not R=
aised'

3. Svarita : I used to think this is the higher note
              =
      Texts say it goes high for half count and comes down
for next half co=
unt (makes some sense)
                    But they call it ' In between'

=
If you can tell us which rule in the book to be followed and whether to
bot=
her about Prachaya ,Sannatara, Ekasruti, Jatya Svarita etc?

Regards,
Siddh=
arth
