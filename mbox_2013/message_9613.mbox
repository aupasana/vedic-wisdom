ssession.  But none of the two have been able to do anything about it =
so far. They both say that this is an entity that keeps revisiting the litt=

as psychiatric case. Don't know what is true and what is not as no one has =
been able to help including the doctors.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you kn=

v style=3D"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:Courier New, courie=
r, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Namaste Sir,<br><br>A pos=
session by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. F=
or there are various classes and kinds and types of entities which can poss=
ess an individual and some of them can be downright nasty.<br><br>Upayas ar=
e many. As so many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* =
work, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a sp=
ecific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guar=
antee of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has =
possessed the individual and what their link for the same is. By link it me=
ans one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed =
them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be something as simple as s=
pitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into =
their territory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weaknes=
s in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberate=
ly send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, th=
ere is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situati=
on. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti th=
at those trying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.=
Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then =
unless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come =
to serious harm.<br><br>These things like removing possession are specializ=
ations. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one kno=
ws well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense =
would do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must =
know well how to handle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by forc=
e before the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to b=
e in possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain =
which will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tri=
ed to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.<br><br>[Reminds me of a=
 particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism.=
 But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about=
 the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in po=
ssession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim.=
 Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the b=
ody of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Ne=
ver trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases wher=
e the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]<br><br>=
Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spi=
rit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not poss=
ible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably B=
hairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are=
 better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time.=
 Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on=
 the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with a=
ny sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this thro=
ugh to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copp=
er pot, and then either make the possessed individual drink the water or sp=
rinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. <br><br>Best of luck an=
d may God help the family.<br><br>-Regards<br> Rajarshi<br><br><br><di=

What about Kala Bhairava mantra? Ca=
n it be more efficient for a long-time Shiva devotee? I've heard that it ca=
n repel spirits and ghosts. Can I chant these mantras at night before going=
 to sleep?<br>
