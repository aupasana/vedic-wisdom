I dont think a specific order is specified. It is always said you should re=
cite "with" not specifically before or after so it shouldnt matter.
However=
 doing it after japa, (preceded by 3 pranayamas of the moolamantra) is bene=
ficial to fix concentration.=C2=A0

Dear Krishnan Sir,

Thanks for the=
 detailed information. Yes, I meant Varah Kavacham. For me, the only purpos=
e of reciting VS and Varah Kavacham is spiritual progress. I typically do V=
arah Kavacham first, then Vishnu sahsranam and then 108 names of Narayan. I=
s it right order or should I do it with 108 names of Narayan in the beginni=
ng ?
