Also please understand in the continuity of time, nothing is
linear......mo=
st often when we are on the path of sadhana, we often tend to
assume things=
 which may not be a direct result of your previous karma.

I havent seen an=
yone who can comprehend the workings of
karma(Includes Homam) and here you =
need to seek Lord's guidance below.

"The intricacies of action are very ha=
rd to understand. Therefore one
should know properly what action is, what f=
orbidden action is, and what
inaction is."- Lord Krishna, Holy Gita, Chapte=
r 4


therfore, I would ecnourage you to take care of your body with proper=

intake of food and water and do pranayam.

On the mantra front chant Ganes=
hji's mantra and also ensure that you seek
forgiveness from Divine Mother i=
n case you feel guilty that you made a
mistake.

Pahimam Pahimam Rakshamam =
Rakshamam Paradevata

She will indeed take care of you as she does with eve=
ryone else.

regards
Srikanth
