Namaste,

I've heard from some source that if you do worship gods at nightt=
ime (i.e. after sunset) negative energy (Rakshasas) will be attracted to th=
e chanting.

Is it so? Can homas be practiced late in the evening (10 pm) i=
f there's no other time available? Can Sri Rudram/Panchakshari Mantra be ch=
anted at night?

Thank you.
