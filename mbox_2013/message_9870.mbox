Dear Narasimha,

> Most of the past life regression therapies ... are just gimmics and/or
hallucinations.


Doesn't all sadhana belong in the same bucket? Aren't all visualizations
and attempts to focus on a mantra or it's devata also trying to setup a
particular "hallucinatory" mental framework? And aren't the results of
karma ... be it the "siddhi" that results from focusing on a mantra, or the
"knowledge" that results from an attempt to tap into the past ... don't
they all belong in same bucket?

If some knowledge of the past, be it "fake" or "real", helps the sadhaka
overcome some vasana, is it any worse than any other sadhana that allows
the sadhaka to overcome the same vasana?

Pop culture and "new age" proponents package things as being "easy" or
"perfect". If instead, we admit that they are most certainly imperfect,
does it make them devoid of value? Isn't a sadhaka just as likely to
hallucinate during the meditation at the end of homa, as he is to
hallucinate during the meditation that is a part of past life regression
therapy?

sasneham,

    ajit

<div><span></span>=A0</div><div><span>First of all, when I=
 mentioned about the utility of techniques of "Hypnotherapy" and =
"Past Life Regression" for handling the problem of spirit attachm=
ents as well as many other problems for which we do not have reasonable exp=
lanation, my assertions were limited to
 the utility part only and not beyo=
nd that. I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or not, in fact=
 I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, any k=
nowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half knowle=
dge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in our this e=
mpirical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of the fact =
of having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that the Sun d=
oes not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, still we u=
se sentences like "Sun rises=A0in the east", "Sun=A0sets=A0i=
n the west" etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with activi=
ties which helps in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I'd m=
entioned about "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression"=
;.</span></div>

<div><span></span>=A0</div><div><span>One should not comme=
nt about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is ful=
l of infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just =
can not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited ways. Be=
fore anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=A0mus=
t first take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to sa=
y that if=A0one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one would defin=
itely be convinced about the same.=A0By saying that one shouldn't make =
comments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=A0by doing so=
 one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=A0blind be=
lief in religion and religious practices=A0can be termed as dogmatic but al=
so in
 science if one loses the scientific temper.</span></div><div><span><=
/span>=A0</div><div><span>Proof of pudding is in eating it, all that I can =
say to the persons willing to address any of their problems. "Hypnothe=
rapy" and "Past Life Regression" have immense utility for=A0=
those who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind. Thos=
e who are interested can read " Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weis=

add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understanding of the re=
incarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems. Reincarnation=
 is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments from past =
lives when the soul had a role to play on the external consciousness. Which=
 means if one has lived a life where there never was any opportunity for th=
e soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For d=
eath is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set =
is generated based on need.<br clear=3D"none">

<br clear=3D"none">The Budd=
hists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - w=
hich is similar to our idea of Atmah.
 Therefore
 their idea of reincarnati=
on
 is very different. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body th=
at coalesces together
 to give the impression of an individual being, which=
 upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the greater flow of energ=
y. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation at a later date=
, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a different point can coalesc=
e into a different part. =A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doct=
rine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate int=
o one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into another body *=
simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in o=
ne person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his e=
nergy of body incarnating in another person and all these happening simulta=
neously! It fits with their philosophy.<br clear=3D"none">

<br clear=3D"no=
ne">Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looke=
d at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supr=
eme law of
 debts/balances - rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are r=
eplete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illus=
ion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is not=
hing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards stric=
t and formal renunciation of life and its processes.<br clear=3D"none">

<b=
r clear=3D"none">But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul =
- that is not dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward=
 from one life to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assis=
t and develop this soul's influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and=
 uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that t=
his individual and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in som=

If=A0 moving into a state

 life-actions. </span>The law of Karma is here too, =
but it is not restricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in t=
he case of the idea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an actio=
n is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, =
then it changes the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, comp=
lex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit w=
