I have already had them play Hanuman Chalisa the whole day. Don't know if t=
hey are complying or not, but I do understand that when there is a posessio=
n and u attempt to drive it out, the spirit fights back and the situation b=
ecomes worse. Things did become worse and they had to put her in hospital l=
ast week.=A0 They were advised to do that by the nurses that visit the hous=
e and they have no option but to comply.

Thanks, 
Bhupendra
