Dear Members

Namaskar!

Kindly go through this research article on Sita's =
Agni Pariksha! You would
be surprised to know that this much talked inciden=
t never happened in
reality! An eye opening article by Shri Sanjeev Newar, =
Founder- Agniveer.
Full article can be found on the following link-

Agni Pariks=
ha is a myth
The Context

One of the most controversial episodes of Ramayan=
 is the *Agnipariskha
(Test by Fire) of Sita*. As per the alleged episode, =
after Ram had defeated
Ravan and rescued Sita, he refused to accept her dou=
bting her chastity.
Thus, Sita jumped into fire. The Fire God then rescued =
her and hence she
came out unburnt. All gods came from heaven to convince R=
am that Sita is
pure. He then agreed and accepted Sita.

Various strong vie=
wpoints exist on this issue. *Traditionalists justify the
action of Ram cit=
ing his overriding responsibility of setting right
standards in society as =
a king.* Feminists criticize the culture of that
era and Hindu religion for=
 being *anti-woman*. Anti-feminists use this
story to explain why women sho=
uld have *limited freedom*. Evangelists cite
this episode (among many other=
s) to convince Hindus to leave Hinduism and
accept any other religion. It i=
s a favorite of *Dalit
movement*protagonists who showcase this as an exampl=
e of Brahminical
dogmatism. Miraclists (those who explain everything throug=
h some miracles)
explain this as a grand strategy of divine. Some explain t=
hat the Sita
which was kidnapped by Ravan was actually a shadow of Sita and=
 actual Sita
was hiding inside fire. So when shadow Sita went inside the fi=
re, actual
Sita came out.
The Loopholes

What I always failed to understand=
 was *why Ram had to make such convoluted
plans that would be known by none=
 in any case.* Could he not have
implemented some less controversial and ye=
t more efficient plans?

In general, I have always been confused by stories=
 of miracles. The era
before advent of videography and imagery seems to be =
full of miracles.
Farther and remoter the place and event, more the probabi=
lity of miracles
explaining it. Whether it be Purans, Bible or Quran, the* =
key events are
explained by some miracle or the other.* Whether it be split=
ting of Red
Sea, or travel across seven skies in one night, or splitting of=
 moon by
simply pointing it, or churning of sea or Sita being fire-proof, i=
ts all a
miracle happening everywhere which none of us has ever witnessed n=
or expect
to witness in our lives. These miracles happen very inconsistentl=
y. For
years someone would toil and then suddenly achieve something through=

miracle.

If one considers these stories as symbolic of certain deeper fac=
ets of
life, it is indeed a very useful tool. *We have so much to learn fro=
m such
stories if we don=92t take them literally. *However, we are supposed=
 to
blindly believe in them verbatim in order to not be termed blasphemous.=

This is where these *stories start separating religion from spiritualism.*=


The debates I often witness among religions =96 which religion is best =
=96
eventually boils down to *who can prove the miracle of his religion to =
be
more authentic! *

And the atheists would laugh down such tales of mirac=
les as a reason to
hate religion. So they lose an opportunity to be purpose=
ful in life,
consider themselves as chemical reactions and *become greatest=
 victims!*

Coming to the particular story of Sita=92s asbestos test (asbes=
tos is the
material that is fully fire-proof), I could always see the flaws=
 in it. *The
Ramayan era seemed to be very liberal from perspective of wome=
n
rights.*Women even took part in battles. Obviously participating in
battl=
e implies
that there is a huge risk of getting imprisoned. Ram=92s step-mot=
her had
accompanied Dashrath in one such war. So the family of Ram was quit=
e
liberal in these matters. Ram himself had been instrumental in uniting
th=
ose women with their husbands who had been cheated by someone else. He
made=
 his friend Sugriva accept his wife again who was captured by his elder
bro=
ther.

And if we trace the overall theme of Ramayan, there is no doubt that=
 Ram
was a role model par-excellence. Few people have inspired me as much a=
s
Maryadapurushottam Sri Ramchandra. (other two being Hanuman and Krishna).=

Its not out of nothing that he is the greatest icon of Hinduism for
millen=
niums. *Thus, this story as well as many others seemed to me like
anomalies=
 that contradicted the natural flow and other principles advocated
in the s=
ame Ramayan.*

Had it been a mythological story, we could have let go of th=
is episode as
imagination of the author or symbolic of something else. Afte=
r all, *there
is no sensible way to explain what being fire-proof has to do=
 with chastity
of a woman.* And if so, then all chaste woman should be fire=
-proof, which
clearly is not the case. Because chastity does not convert yo=
ur skin into
asbestos. Further, what example is being set by such test in n=
ot clear. In
fact by expecting such miracles to prove chastity of woman, ge=
nerations
have been misguided to denigrate women. *Needless to say, this no=
tion of
chastity is blatantly against Vedas and Manu Smriti. *

In case of =
Ramayan, the fact remains that it is a historical text, and not
yet another=
 tales of Aladin. Further it is a text associated deeply with
not just Hind=
u psyche. Ram is a role model for entire India regardless of
religion. He i=
s a cultural icon. Thus these stories denigrate Hinduism,
culture and natio=
n =96 every thing. If these be true, if indeed Ram was
anti-woman, then Ram=
 cannot be role model.
The Reality

*So I decided to test out what the exac=
t episode is in Ramayana.* Now
Ramayana is an epic text, and not a divine t=
ext in lines of Vedas. So,
while Vedas have been preserved for ages through=
 a variety of methods to
protect from even minutest aberration, other texts=
 have not enjoyed that
protection. Ramayan and Mahabharat are thus replete =
with latter day
adulterations. Same is the case with Manu Smriti.

Please n=
ote that for ages, there was no printing press and publication
house to pub=
lish authentic versions of any text. They used to be written by
hand and me=
morized and spread across various schools and among scholars. So
adulterati=
on was easier. While it would be impossible to decipher each
adulteration, =
if one analyzes one can identify the obvious adulterations. *Such
adulterat=
ions can be identified by change in language style, change in
story flow, b=
eing out of context, suddenly a miracle happening and then the
story contin=
uing again as normal and contradiction with rest of the text.*

We have alr=
eady analyzed how more than 50% verses of existing Manu Smriti
can be purge=
d out as adulterated through analysis.

*In case of Ramayan, if we analyze =
the verses elaborating the Sita
Fire-Proof test, startling truths emerge.*
=

The story by and large goes on smoothly till 113th chapter of Yuddha Kand.=

In this chapter, Hanuman goes to Sita to inform her about victory of Ram.
=

In Chapter 114, Ram states that *women are respected by the respect they
g=
et from nation and their own habits. Any kind of restriction on women =96 o=
f
home, dress code, boundary =96  in order to protect their respect is unwi=
se. *
*(27)*. This shloka sums up the Hindu view of woman.

The rest of the=
 verses in Chapter 114 except the last verse do not take the
story any furt=
her. They seem to be adulterated.

In the first 6 verses of Chapter 115, Ra=
m emotionally elaborates how he
destroyed the enemy who had committed a gra=
ve crime. In the next 4 verses,
he acknowledges the efforts of Hanuman, Sug=
riva and Vibheeshan. Verses 11
and 12 seems to be a clear adulteration that=
 act as a filler to redirect
the story.

In Verses 13 and 14, Ram expresses=
 his satisfaction of getting back Sita
after winning over such grave challe=
nges.

*And then in Verse 15, he takes a surprise U turn* and states that h=
e did
not do all this to get back Sita. *Clearly this verse is an
adulterat=
ion.*Not only it suddenly gives a new direction to the story,
it does not r=
elate
to rest of the Ramayan where Ram had been even weeping in separation =
of
Sita. Even if Ram had to force Sita for Fire-test, he could have said th=
is
straight instead of lying here. In entire Ramayan, Ram has been a
truth-=
seeker, so this sudden twist is an obvious adulteration.

*And from there, =
all the remaining verses of Chapter 115 appear clear
adulteration.* For exa=
mple, in verses 22 and 23 he advises her to live with
Bharat, Lakshman, Sug=
riva, Shatrughna or Vibheeshan. The fake verses cover
the entire 116th chap=
ter where Sita answers Ram=92s allegations and asks
Lakshman to prepare a f=
ireplace. Then she jumps into it. Suddenly, in this
chapter, all Rishis, Ga=
ndharvas, Gods emerge, who were non-existent so far.

In Chapter 117, all t=
he major Gods come to Ram to talk to him. This is
perhaps the only instance=
 in Ramayan where divinity suddenly overpowers the
normal course of story. =
This is the first time that Ram is spoken of as the
Ultimate God Himself. I=
f Ram alone is Ultimate God, why the lesser Gods are
coming to convince Him=
 of his =91mistake=92 is unexplained. And why Ram asked
so many Gods to com=
e. In this Chapter, they praise divinity of Ram for all
the 32 verses.

In =
Chapter 118, Fire God comes out with Sita in her lap and offers to Ram.
The=
n Ram explains that he was playing a game to convince people about
chastity=
 of Sita. Finally the last verse 22 says:*=93Having said so, Ram met
Sita w=
ith great happiness.=94*

If all verses from Chapter 115 verse 15 onwards u=
pto Chapter 118 verse 21
are deleted, the story continues smoothly and this=
 intermediate miracle
drama has no relevance or impact whatsoever.

*Recall=
 that Chapter 115 verse 14 has Ram emotionally explaining how he got
back S=
ita with great efforts. And then Chapter 118 verse 22 says: =93Having
said =
do, Ram met Sita with great happiness.=94 There is perfect continuity. *

N=
ow Chapters 119 and 120 are again pure adulterations where the Gods praise
=
Ram even further, then Dashrath also comes with God Indra and they have
ver=
y long discussions. Indra then makes dead soliders alive again through
magi=
c. Chapter 121 starts with: *=93Ram slept peacefully that night and spoke
w=
ith Vibheeshan in morning.=94 *With minor adulterations, story continues as=

normal about how Ram and Sita went back to Ayodhya on Pushpak plane. Now,
=
till end of Ramayana, nowhere does any reference to miracles happening
emer=
ge.

So, if one undertakes a cursory glance of Ramayan, this episode clearl=
y
emerges as a latter day adulteration which may have fuelled many debates,=

groupism, anti-Hindu mindset, anti-woman mindset, conversions and insults
=
thrown upon character of Ram. However, the fact remains that the very basis=

for all this is dubious.

To sum up:

Following verses are clear adulterat=
ions:

*Chapter 114: Verse 28 onwards, except last verse*

*Chapter 115: Ve=
rse 15 onwards*

*Chapters 116 and 117*

*Chapter 118: Except last verse*

=
*Chapters 119 and 120*

If you remove all these adulterations that bring di=
scontinuity, the story
moves very smoothly and logically.
Real Ramayan and =
Real Mahabharat

*Some other frivolous myths from Ramayan and Mahabharat th=
at are used to
denigrate the noble culture of Hinduism but do not exist are=
 as follows:*

*Ramayan:*

- Sita exile (entire Uttar Ramayan is fictitious=
 and a latter day creation
having no linkage with Valmiki)

- Killing of Sh=
ambuka , a shudra by Ram (again fiction from frivolous Uttar
Ramayan)

- Ha=
numan, Bali, Sugriva etc being monkeys or apes. They were human beings,
Han=
uman was a great scholar, brilliant and impressive personality

- Ram, Laks=
hman, Sita being meat-eaters or alcohol consumers

*Mahabharat:*

- Draupad=
i being married to 5 brothers. Her name was Panchali because she
was daught=
er of ruler of Panchal, and not because she married 5 brothers.

- Krishna =
married 16000 plus wives.

The reason why Ramayan and Mahabharat were so su=
sceptible to adulterations
is also obvious. After Vedas, these 2 texts have=
 been the most respected
texts of Hinduism for several centuries now. So, i=
f you are able to
manipulate these, it is easy to manipulate Hindus. Same i=
s the case with
Manu Smriti =96 the oldest law book.

The greatest benchmar=
k, thus, to identify truth is that if it is as per
Vedas or as per reason, =
accept it. Else reject it as an adulteration.
Follow the overall theme and =
do not be bogged by minor details if they
appear contrary to reason.

Vedas=
 alone are true Dharma. Based on rock solid foundation of Vedas,
Hinduism i=
s a culture that should be proud of not only all Indians but
entire humanit=
y.

Ram is a role model for entire world. We should be proud that we are
pr=
ogeny of Ram. Whether we respect Ram as a God or God-driven is a personal
b=
elief. But character of Ram is as pure as diamond. Agniveer is committed
to=
 defence of glory of our role models.

Jai Shri Ram

with best wishes

strong></p><p>If
 all verses from Chapter 115 verse 15 onwards upto Chapter=
 118 verse 21

all that 
Chapter 115 verse 14 has Ram emotionally explaining how he got ba=

 with great efforts. And then Chapter 118 verse 22 says: =93Having =

.=A0</strong></p><p>Now
 Chapters 119 and 120 are again pure adulterations =
where the Gods praise
 Ram even further, then Dashrath also comes with God =
Indra and they have
 very long discussions. Indra then makes dead soliders =
alive again 
through magic. Chapter 121 starts with: <strong>=93Ram slept p=
eacefully that night and spoke with Vibheeshan in morning.=94=A0</strong>Wi=
th
 minor adulterations, story continues as normal about how Ram and Sita 
=
went back to Ayodhya on Pushpak plane.=A0Now, till end of Ramayana, 
nowher=
e does any reference to miracles happening emerge.</p><p>So, if 
one undert=
akes a cursory glance of Ramayan, this episode clearly emerges
 as a latter=
 day adulteration which may have=A0fuelled=A0many debates, 
groupism, anti-=
Hindu mindset, anti-woman mindset, conversions and 
insults thrown upon cha=
racter of Ram. However, the fact remains that the
 very basis for all this =
is dubious.</p><p>To sum up:</p><p>Following verses are clear adulterations=
:</p><p><strong>Chapter 114: Verse 28 onwards, except last verse</strong></=
p><p><strong>Chapter 115: Verse 15 onwards</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapters=
 116 and 117</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 118: Except last verse</strong>=
</p><p><strong>Chapters 119 and 120</strong></p><p><span style=3D"text-deco=

<h2>Real =
Ramayan and Real Mahabharat</h2><p><strong>Some
 other frivolous myths from=
 Ramayan and Mahabharat that are used to 
denigrate the noble culture of Hi=
nduism but do not exist are as follows:</strong></p><p><strong><span style=
=3D"text-decoration:underline">Ramayan:</span></strong></p><p>- Sita exile =
(entire Uttar Ramayan is=A0fictitious=A0and a latter day creation having no=
 linkage with Valmiki)</p>
<p>- Killing of Shambuka , a shudra by Ram (agai=
n fiction from frivolous Uttar Ramayan)</p><p>-
 Hanuman, Bali, Sugriva etc=
 being monkeys or apes. They were human 
beings, Hanuman was a great schola=
r, brilliant 
and=A0impressive=A0personality</p><p>- Ram, Lakshman, Sita be=
ing meat-eaters or alcohol consumers</p><p><strong><span style=3D"text-deco=
ration:underline">Mahabharat:</span></strong></p><p>-
 Draupadi being marri=
ed to 5 brothers. Her name was Panchali because she
 was daughter of ruler =
of Panchal, and not because she married 5 
brothers.</p><p>- Krishna marrie=
d 16000 plus wives.</p><p>The reason why
 Ramayan and Mahabharat were so su=
sceptible to adulterations is also 
obvious. After Vedas, these 2 texts hav=
e been the most respected texts 
of Hinduism for several centuries now. So,=
 if you are able to manipulate
 these, it is easy to manipulate Hindus. Sam=
e is the case with Manu 
Smriti =96 the oldest law book.</p><p></p><p>The
 =
greatest benchmark, thus, to identify truth is that if it is as per 
Vedas =
or as per reason, accept it. Else reject it as an adulteration. 
Follow the=
 overall theme and do not be bogged by minor details if they 
appear contra=
ry to reason.</p><h2></h2><p>Vedas alone are 
true Dharma. Based on rock so=
lid foundation of Vedas, Hinduism is a 
culture that should be proud of not=
 only all Indians but entire 
humanity.</p><p>Ram is a role model for entir=
e world. We should be proud
 that we are progeny of Ram. Whether we respect=
 Ram as a God or 
God-driven is a personal belief. But character of Ram is =
as pure as 
diamond. Agniveer is committed to defence of glory of our role =
models.</p><p>Jai Shri Ram</p><br clear=3D"all">with best wishes<div><br>Va=
