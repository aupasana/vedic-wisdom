Respected Narasimha ji,

Thanks for the clarification, the explanation make=
s sense.

However, I am sorry to come back to my basic curiosity - can we d=
raw an
ideal chart which should have all or maximum possible positive yogas=
,
without even a single negativity.

I can understand that finding the posi=
tivity or negativity depends on the
emotional state of the person who look =
at the chart - As parents would not
be able to see the negativity at their =
kid's horoscope (due to their love);
However, our idols should be so pure t=
hat even worst people shouldn't find
any negativity.
there may be some futu=
re  where all the people will be with positive charts
only (say from "1% po=
sitivity and 99% neutral" to "100% positive ). I hope
that would be satyuga=
.

Thanks and Regards,
