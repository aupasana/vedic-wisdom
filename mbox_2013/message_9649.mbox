Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
Recently I was staying at an old house in a villag=
e. I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises - &nbs=
p;creaking and something moving in the attic. I'm very sensitive to differe=
nt energies - I don't see anything, but I feel whether something divine or =
rather evil is present in a certain place. That place didn't feel good to m=
e.<br>


<br>
I was staying there for 10 days and every night I would make =
up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but on=
ce I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in =
a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some s=
teps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.<b=
r>


<br>
This doesn't seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become=
 fully aware and I can move my body.<br>
<br>
Can it be that spirits live i=
n that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people staying at t=
hat place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it's not just me=
.<br>
<br>
On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before goin=
g to sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep properly.<br>
<b=
r>
Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at home, feeli=
ng some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in height,=
 I've seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of the strange=
 feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.<br>


<br>
Is there any man=
tra that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? Somethin=
g that I can chant before going to sleep. This has been bothering me for so=
me time now and it interferes with my life.<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance!<=
