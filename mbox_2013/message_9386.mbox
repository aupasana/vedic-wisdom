Dear Krishnan Sir,

I got Dhoomavati Kavacham from internet and I did recit=
e it once normally
as I used to do with other Mantras. But after reciting i=
t once, I felt
altogether different kind of energy within. So I got suspect=
 and wanted to
ask the learned people of the group.

I am really thankful f=
or your suggestions. I will keep it in mind.

By the way, I daily recite Va=
rah Kavacham and Vishnu Sahasranaam. I hope,
there is no issue with recitin=
g Varaah and Nrisimh Kavacham.

Thanks and Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
