Dear Bhupendra and everyone else,

N=
amaste.

"Shout out to Mr Mahaganpathi"
Play this in another tab ( no issue=
s, if you don't understand one bit, join my boat)
http://www.youtube.com/wa=
tch?v=3DISik_cjsmJA

After reading everything in the past two weeks, I sens=
e there is one thing that comes up time and again, be it with kundalini Syn=
drome, or be it with sadhana, or be it with Karma's or whatever. The thing =
is that please understand, the difference between your surface personality =
and your true self( which you realize eventually by penance).

Sadhana is b=
asically a process in which you/deity kill your"self". Let us say that you =
are "Puneet/Nikhil/Gaurav/Chetna/Savitri/Mark/Andrew/John/Ali". You see, al=
l ahutis in the homam are actually meant to be sacrifice of parts of this p=
ersonality and eventually the whole personality in the purna -ahuti where i=
n you sacrifice your entire self to the deity in the fire. Actually the pur=
na- ahuti is your funeral, if you are able to look at it in that manner.

P=
lease understand that all joys and sorrows are limited to your own false se=
lf. What you think is the best for yourself ,actually is more often than no=
t that good. It might be good for your limited self, but mind you , it isn'=
t good for "you". And to tell you very honestly, god doesn't really care mu=
ch for your limited self and its endless desires, wants, desires. Mr god wa=
nts you to be out of this convoluted mess, and be back with him/her/it ASAP=
 and the only way you are coming back is when the false self is completely =
free.

Now how is that? You pay off Karma's. Now how the hell do you that? =
You suffer and stay silent. You do not make a cry and hue about it and cont=
inuously chant. Crying and shouting actually makes god sentimental and you =
extract out some stuff, maybe in the short run, but it will screw the "real=
 you" in the long run.

Please understand, none can escape suffering, for i=
t is the only way you can pay back. You have to pay. When suffering, contin=
uously remind yourself of your own confusion as to who you are and keep doi=
ng simple penance. The navagraha's and especially my beloved Mr Saturn are =
only doing their duty to get you back on track. Their duty is to break your=
 shackles, now whether they decide to do it by breaking your back, well, it=
 is their will.

When Mr Ram, Arjun, Karna, couldn't escape, who the hell a=
re we guys exactly?

And what actually is suffering?
basic lack of acceptan=
ce of your own destiny and fate. Suffering is attributed to a sense of " Wh=
y ME?" and "why not ME?", " why MY things were taken" and " Why I don't hav=
e these things"

Kundalini shundalini is all too far away for 95 out of 100=
 of us. Let's leave those, because unless you experience it yourself , you =
are bound to confuse yourself and attribute mundane things to experiences t=
o people who are now progressed and thus digging yourself into a bigger hol=
e. Apart from one book here and there, you won't know who is saying what. A=
nd who do you trust, the author is human after all.

"You" will have to die=
, no matter what if you ever hope to reach god. How do you die?
When your s=
upposed joys and things are taken from you, do you ever look at god, and cr=
y back. That is merely the beginning. Because without these things taken fr=
om you , you will never ever look at god, unless you are some hi-fi being f=
rom your previous birth. once you look and understand the purpose behind it=
 all, your cries will stop, and you will actually be able to laugh at your =
own silliness in the beginning. Homam accelerates this progress.

Here are =
some wise words from Mr Nanak ------
"If you have to reach heaven, you have=
 to die"
or
"Everyone wants heaven, nobody wants to die"

I think then ther=
e was this another point of doing homam on somebody''s half. Here is a true=
 story, once a girl who was facing incremental difficulty in getting marrie=
d to the boy of her dreams due to her parents rejection, requested another =
woman who regularly does homam to do something. Hearing her story, the homa=
m waali woman , decided to do a homam on the girl's behalf. here is what wa=
s said to god when he was present in the fire.=C2=A0 =C2=A0

" Dear God, I =
dedicate this one to the girl who suffers. I can't see her getting beat by =
her parents and her lying in torment due to such and such problem. eventual=
ly she is you only, why do you make yourself suffer so much? If the marriag=
e is ordained for her, remove obstacles, and get her married, and if it is =
not ordained, break her ties off with the boy and get her parents to send h=
er off wherever you deem fit. Don't satiate the desires of the personality,=
 do what is best for the being powering the personality and if that best is=
 that she is not with the boy of her dreams, so be it. but stop suffering t=
hrough her"

The next week, all her ties with the boy were severed, she got=
 engaged to someone else, and is married now.
What is the lesson??
The girl=
 was wanting based on her own belief that she wants this and that, but the =
homam waali woman was little more surrender -ful to god and left the whole =
scenario. The whole damn point of any penance is end of your constant belie=
f and desires based on your own limited self. And if you keep on harping, w=
ell it defeats the purpose.

Regarding the lower ethereal beings being easi=
ly satiated and giving you what you want=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6
Have you serious=
ly considered the price you will pay??
This time around mr Bhupendra Janmad=
as may get some money or the job,
but next time lets say your are born as m=
aithali gupta , the price you will have to pay will be too immense.
Then yo=
u will ask "why me?" and again start the whole process, thus sliding furthe=
r and further.
Don't go down those routes, this is not a one birth game, yo=
u won't be dead, no matter how many personalities you may shed and die in, =
you will still be there and boy you will pay.

And the fees of the ethereal=
 beings? I can't shake my head enough.
Lets skip ethereal beings , access t=
o them is anyways blocked for 99 out 100 for us.

Aap ke toh naam mein hi s=
ir, janmadas hai, janmo ke das, aap sarne ke liye aaye hain, sar li jiye, j=
ab achha hona hoga, ho jayega, if you think you can force a change, forget =
it.

Aur aapki saran is only limited to bhupinder, yeh bechara toh kabhi bh=
i mar jaayega, jald hi naak mein rui aur muh mein ghee, aur para hoga jal r=
aha hoga, lekin tum reh jaaoge.

Keep doing your homams, they will help "yo=
u", trust god on this.

Regarding the prarbadha karma's, sanchit karma's an=
d everything else, you will end up confusing yourself, seriously, it is a m=
ess to understand without penance and a deity or a deity like guru. Everybo=
dy is trying to calculate based on whatever information about the system th=
ey have. Here is a fun fact:=C2=A0 _-------->>>>>>
YOU CAN'T CALCULATE.

Th=
is system is too layered, too complex, and without you in touch with an adv=
ance being and god, forget it. Forget all of this. Focus on god as much as =
one can. And please let go of this expectation that worshipping god can get=
 you the monies, the comforts. If actual progress is there, quite the oppos=
ite is going to happen in most cases, but there is no formula and quite a l=
ot of good can happen.
It just depends on what god decides. If you are mean=
t to enjoy, you will, if no oh well, that too.

Dekho bhaiyon aur beheno, p=
ichle janmon ka ab toh kuch nahin kar sakte woh kaand to ho gaye, ab iss ba=
ar sambhal jaao, aur bhagwan ki taraf rukh karlo, is baar mauka hai, nahin =
toh next time around again the same routine ------
born crying
sucking on b=
reast
playing with toy
hitting puberty
going mad with lust
career issues
jo=
b issues
health issues
wife
child
children
Heart attack
PHAT!

and again cr=
ying without a body what did i do , what did i do, making the pledge in the=
 womb, that god i'll worship you and coming out then forgetting everything.=
 The circle won't end. It just won't end.

And do it not for exiting, do it=
 for the love of god. Develop this love, how can you then afford to stay aw=
ay from your lover.

If the lover/owner of your "self" decides that you so =
"suffer" so that you can visit him/her, oh well then Suffer.

Your sufferin=
g is actually false, stop crying "me, me, me, me , why me etc" and you will=
 likely move to where you are trying to be sent. Continue with this radio, =
you are digging yourself a grave. You wont shutup in a day, it will take ye=
ars, so let it, but develop it.


Jai Shree Ram! Jai Shree Radheya!
Har lo =
Mahadev
(P.S. - rough translation - loot lo mahadev, loot lo in yaadon ko k=
i "main" yeh tha/thi, sab khatam only mahadev left, yay!!)
