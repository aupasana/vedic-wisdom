Dear Maja, Namaste

 

1.     Please find my replies in red-italics inte=
r-laced with your lines in your post. But please make it sure and let me kn=
ow if you are going to post it in the forum  or not; as you have the habit =
of suppressing many posts. I wish to cc it to vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups. By =
the way, let me tell you a secret. The post that you have written does not =
reflect your true self; but it seems you have written it under pressure fro=
m someone else after overcoming your conscience. So keeping with the spirit=
 of the air of arrogance in this letter, I too need to pick up some words o=
f arrogance to give you a nice word-for word battle challenge. I feel sorry=
 for this battle because I know very well that this is not your true messag=
e from the core of your heart.

 

You know... I think that my emotional li=
fe is sometimes lacking in events only due to my insensitivity on complimen=
ts and sucking up from men... It is really not impressing me at all. 

2.  =
   For your kind information, I was not sucking you up. But you felt it so.=
 Perhaps you are suffering from psychiatric phobia and excessive insecurity=
, wherein a slightest genuine appreciation lands you into a mental sickness=
.

 

Same thing goes for any type of communication with me, including foru=
m discussions. Sucking up is simply irritating to the extent that I am on t=
he very verge to develop immunological reactions on it.

And really no need=
 to "decorate" my name with Shri and Ji when referring to me. When it comes=
 to you, I am happy when you at least use my name, because that means I did=
 not waste my words for nothing, that you are able to grow as a human being=
 and that you are able to acquire new skills. 

3.     Ok. I see to your ha=
ppiness and followed your desire, as you can see in my addressing. But for =
your kind information, I was not decorating your name. But you felt it so, =
because perhaps you really saw it so decorative, desperately looking for so=
 long.

 

Now you know what I label as good sarcasm. With all my due respe=
ct, but I think you still need a lot of practice and training to get to tha=
t level. 

4.     For your kind information, it was not sarcasm; but a genu=
ine heartfelt message conveyed to you. But you felt it as sarcasm because i=
t is what you are used to all the time.

 

As far as your #2 is concerned,=
 no you did not deliberately skipped anything. Even if you did skip mention=
ing fourth type of yoga, you still wrote that one is trigunata (what is thi=
s supposed to be? Nirguna?) when one is having all three, clearly using wor=
d "all" for list of three, when the truth is that this list is supposed to =
consist of four. Also you are clearly equalizing gunas with ayana, which is=
 wrong. Here, see it again your self:

 

"You are said to be trigunaateeta=
 when you have all the 3 things as follows:

Unidirectional compassionate l=
ove:---bhakti yoga

Brahmagnyaana:---Gnyaana yoga

Selfless Service:- karma=
 Yoga."

 

5.     Who knows better? You or me?  Whether I skipped it delib=
erately or not?. If I have the guts to accept the fact that I am yet to kno=
w of something; then don=E2=80=99t you think I can have enough guts to acce=
pt whether I skipped deliberately or not? Do you think I need to be cheap t=
o that level to protect my prestige? But you can think so, because that is =
what you are used to do all the time.

 

Tri-gunaaateetaa means one who is=
 beyond all three gunas, that is in Nirguna, yes..you got it right. Ok.You =
feel raja yoga is an essential fourth yoga out of 4 yogas. This is what you=
 mean to say. But I meant to put across some profound truth which you need =
to listen with rapt attention and subtle intellect. Let me explain it to yo=
u. There is one thing called =E2=80=9Cprocess=E2=80=9D(vidhi) and one thing=
 called =E2=80=9Cproduct=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cresult=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cs=
iddhi=E2=80=9D. So lets say vidhi and siddhi. Just ponder and tell me, what=
 do you think of =E2=80=9Cbhakti=E2=80=9D? is it a vidhi? Or siddhi? I have=
 heard that bhakti is a gift from God. Many people ask for Bhakti as a boon=
 from God. So it proves that Bhakti is a siddhi=E2=80=A6not a vidhi. Becaus=
e people will ask for boon, only the =E2=80=9Csiddhi=E2=80=9D; and not the =
process or =E2=80=9Cvidhi=E2=80=9D. To get bhakti, is considered as a boon/=
blessings from god.

 

Same thing holds for Gnyaana or knowledge. Knowledg=
e is a siddhi or end-result, it is not a process or vidhi. You may have to =
do tapasya(penance)  for attaining knowledge(gnyaana). So tapasya is a vidh=
i and gnyaana is a siddhi.

 

Same thing holds for selfless service or kar=
ma yoga. When can you be of any service to others? Only when you are a ripe=
 fruit matured by Gnyaana and bhakti. Only a ripened fruit is offered on pl=
ate to eat, so also only matured people who have perfected their gnyaana an=
d bhakti can essentially do any selfless service or karma yoga towards huma=
nity, just like rishis and brahmarishis. So, doing selfless service is a si=
ddhi; not a vidhi.

 

So in essence all the three things I mentioned viz. =
Bhakti, gnyaana and selfless karma=E2=80=94they all are siddhis or achievem=
ents, and not a process. This achievement or siddhi is compactly called as =
=E2=80=9CNirguna Brahmapada=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Ctrigunaateeta=E2=80=9D.

 =


Now Raaja Yoga is not a siddhi. It is 100% pure process. After tapasya, t=
he sage asks for bhakti, or gnyaana or selfless sevaa bhaava(serving attitu=
de) from God(in fact all 3 are one and the same and not mutually exclusive,=
 and togetherly called nirguna brahmapada). But never ever I have heard any=
one asking for praanaayaama or dharana or dhyaana as a boon from god. These=
 limbs of Raja yoga are a process. And process is never asked for a boon. I=
t is only the end-result which is asked.

 

Some people may raise their br=
ow over my statements as to ---are not bhakti, gnyaana or selfless karma, a=
 process? I say yes they are process too..but..but..when you  look at them =
as a process, they are essentially a covered up version of raja yoga. For e=
xample in Bhakti, when you are singing the praise of the god, you are basic=
ally doing dhaaarana and dhyaana. Same thing when you are reciting auto-sug=
gestions as a part of the process of Gnyaana Yoga like =E2=80=9CI am self=
=E2=80=A6I am not body etc..etc..=E2=80=9D, you are basically doing Pratyaa=
haara. So the subtle point is, under the pretext of different names like bh=
akti yoga, gnyaana yoga, and karma yoga we are essentially following raja y=
oga; means fundamentally we are following principles of raja yoga but under=
 a different style.

 

So the bottomline is there exists one and only one =
process or vidhi called as raja yoga which can be followed either as bhakti=
 yoga or gnyaana yoga or karma yoga, but all essentially a version of raja =
yoga.

 

Now the reason I skipped mentioning it is, I was explaining to my=
 friend about the =E2=80=9Ctrigunaateeta or nistrigunya or nirguna pada=E2=
=80=9D.  And this brahmapada is ultimate siddhi or end-result, so I did not=
 mention about the process or vidhi or raja yoga. I hope this clears your i=
ndecisiveness.

 

You feel I am mixing up gunas and ayanas. I feel you are=
 mixing up the process and the product. I am not mixing anything. I am spea=
king plain, clear, simple unqualified truth. But it appears mixing to you, =
because that is what you had been doing all the time in your life---viz=E2=
=80=94mixing up things and confusing the people.

 

This is really the ABC=
 of Jyotish... I already recommended you one very useful book (BPHS). Creat=
ion is under chapter one (you are most welcome)

 

As far as #3 in your em=
ail is concerned, I am not certified Jyotish guru, so you will have to addr=
ess that request on somebody who is. 

 

6.       Oh well if telling the a=
yana from D9 is an ABC of jyotish, then why you are unable to tell it? I do=
n=E2=80=99t think you are still sitting on chapter one to welcome me there!=
!! Perhaps to help you?..lol=E2=80=A6

And one more thing it is very clear =
that you are lying; that you are unable to tell ayana from D9 because you a=
re not certified. Just have a look at your tone viz =E2=80=9CAnyway, for wh=
ich ayana will native decide is seen in Navamsha varga. Do you know how to =
see it?=E2=80=9D It was very obvious that you knew it. But perhaps wanted t=
o put me down or show arrogance. But I took it as compassion in you, becaus=
e that=E2=80=99s what I had been doing all my life.   A person sees in othe=
rs what he himself is. But this is a battle, and you ought to be ruthless i=
n battle. And I really like fighting, perhaps a karma yoga=E2=80=A6lol=E2=
=80=A6.I hope you take sense of humor in a light spirit.

 

 

You know, p=
eople are usually either humble or over self-confident. They cant be both a=
t the same time, as these are two different "ayana" ;) Perhaps you could de=
cide which one is yours...

 

7.       First of all there is nothing like =
over-self-confidence. There is just one self, and just one confidence on th=
at self. That self-confidence is not a graded or measureable quantity like =
70% confidence or over-confidence or  under-confidence. Just one self, and =
you have either confidence or no confidence, that=E2=80=99s all.

 

Ok, le=
t me assume you meant over-self-confidence =3D arrogance. In that case, I a=
m definitely not being arrogant as is so quite obvious, but you need to mak=
e sure about yourself in this regard.

 

Ok, let us assume another meaning=
, say over-self-confidence =3D self-confidence. In that case, I feel both h=
umility and self-confidence are a product of knowledge; and knowledge is no=
thing but =E2=80=9Cclear vision=E2=80=9D. I am sure I am very clear on my c=
oncepts. Rest you can decide what exactly am I and which one I belong to=E2=
=80=A6..

 

 

Warm Regards,

Kannan

Dear Shri  Maja Strbac Ji,

Namasthe

 

1.       I feel short of words=
 to express the the joy and bliss after going through your excellently well=
 written, logical and clear exposition of the subtle concepts, filled with =
compassion towards my ignorant mind; and feeding my mind with the nourishin=

The time, pain and patience that you have undertaken to feed me=
 can only speak of the compassion in your heart borne out of true knowledge=
. Just like a mother cannot bear to see her child hungry; so also a true gn=

I have no words and can never ever repay the compassion that you have showe=

2.       Yes, I deliberately skipped mentioning Raja Yoga, th=

and this yoga requires a highly disciplined approach, which I thought would=
 be in-appropriate to mention for him.

 

3.       Dear Shri Maja Strbac J=

Om Gurave Namah

 

Dear Kannan, n=
amaste

 

I am a little bit sceptic about your insights, as apparently you=
 are not familiar with the very basics of Jyotish considering your insight =
#2...

 

Three gunas (satva, rajas and tamas) are separate subject from 4 =
ayanas which can be dharma, arta, kama and moksha. 

 

Entire bha chakra (=
zodiac) is based on these two principles, therefore we have 3 gunas "distri=
buted" in Satva/Dwishabha rashis (Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanu and Meena), Rajas/C=
hara rashis (Mesha, Karka, Tula and Makara) and Tamas/Stira rashis (Vrishab=
ha, Simha, Vrishchika and Kumbha). 

 

Akash tattva is "distributed" throu=
ghout all 12 rashis. Remaining 4 tattvas are distributed in such way that t=
here are 4 groups of rashis with one dominant tattva:

 

Agni dominant tat=
tva - Mesha, Simha and Dhanu - dharma trikona

Prithivi dominant tattva - V=
rishabha, Kanya and Makara - artha trikona

Vayu dominant tattva - Mithuna,=
 Tula and Kumbha - kama trikona

Jala dominant tattva - Karka, Vrishchika a=
nd Meena - moksha trikona

 

How do we know which tattva is dominant in wh=
ich rashi? We have 27 nakshatras and each consists of 4 padas (each pada is=
 for dharma, arta, kama and moksha) and each pada is corresponding to 1/9 o=
f a rashi - 3 deg and 20 min arc. 1/9 of a rashi is one navamsha and this i=
s basis for calculation of D9 chart (Navamsha varga). If graha is for examp=
le, in 3rd pada of any nakshatra, it will be placed in Vayu rashi in navams=
ha. You can notice that agni rashis are having 3 dharma padas in total, whi=
le other padas can repeat only twice in that rashi - therefore agni tattva =
is dominant and that rashi is clubbed in dharma trikona. This is only a sma=
ll illustration of the beauty of the Universe.

 

Now different type of 4 =
yogas based on ayana/kendra:

 

Dharma ayana - Gyana yoga- lagna and its t=
rines

Artha ayana - Karma yoga - 10th bhava and its trines

Kama ayana - R=
aja yoga- 7th bhava and its trines

Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava =
and its trines

 

These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you can check=
 it, I assure there are four of them. Though it is very indicative you skip=
ped Raja yoga (controlling own senses) on your list... 

 

Anyway, for whi=
ch ayana will native decide is seen in Navamsha varga. Do you know how to s=
ee it?

Also, one is supposed to choose only one ayana for one lifetime and=
 master it to as perfect as possible. It is not possible for a human being =
to take two or more ayanas at the same time... well, one can not go backwar=
ds and forward/left and right at the same time, can he/she? :)

ards,

Dear All Members,

Namasthe

 

1.       I have writ=
ten a few articles providing deep insights to remove all your doubts about =
religion and spirituality and jyotisha. Please permit me to post, and enjoy=
 enlightening yourself. I am going very soon, so before going I would like =
to share all my experiences for the welfare of lost souls to become their o=
wn good friends and ascend to higher planes of existence.

 

2.       You =
are said to be trigunaateeta when you have all the 3 things as follows:

Un=
idirectional compassionate love:---bhakti yoga

Brahmagnyaana:---Gnyaana yo=
ga

Selfless Service:- karma Yoga.

 

If you achieve any one of the above,=
 all three will be automatically achieved because they are not three differ=
ent things, but different way of viewing one and the same thing; and that i=
s =E2=80=9CNistriguna Brahma pada=E2=80=9D.

 

Now how to achieve it? 

-Y=
ou must have satwa Guna first.

 

How to achieve satwa guna?

-You have de=
stroy Tamo guna.

 

How to do it?

-By strengthening your intellect

 

Ho=
w to strengthen the intellect?

-By company of wise. Rishi-sangata.

 

Wha=
t to do if wise people are not their around you?

-Swadhyaaya(self-study) o=
f scriptures.

 

But I don=E2=80=99t understand anything! What to do?

-Go=
 to pilgrimages.

 

But pilgrim centers are all corrupted. What to do?

-S=
tudy scriptures and live life according to Shaastra.

 

But I already told=
 I don=E2=80=99t understand scriptures. What to do now?

-Cry=E2=80=A6Cry=
=E2=80=A6Cry..

-Go to pilgrimage and keep crying and keep calling your Mot=
her Divine

 

But I am not able to cry. What to do now?

-Then it means yo=
u don=E2=80=99t need God or Amba.

 

No..No..I need God a lot=E2=80=A6

-Y=
ou are a liar..a hypocrite=E2=80=A6

-You cannot cry, because you don=E2=80=
=99t love Amba.

 

So what to do now?

-Suffer pain at the hands of Saturn=
 and Yama.  They have extra-ordinary powers to make even a stone-hearted pe=
rson to cry. So you will finally cry. And the journey will all go upwards f=
rom here.

 

So who are the Greatest Guru? 

-Saturn and Yama

 

-That is=
 the greatness of Saturn and Yama. So everything is finally good. There is =
nothing which is bad. All the evil people are our  greatest friends..Why? b=
ecause they go to hell for our sake. By tormenting us, they make us cry, an=
d ascend our journey upwards. And after ascending our journey upwards, thos=
e evil people themselves go to naraka, descending downwards. So are they no=
t our best friend? yes..They are=E2=80=A6

 

Why I had been thinking other=
wise that evil people are bad, for so long?

-because your intellect has be=
en hijacked

 

Who hijacked my intellect?

-Moha(Attachment)

 

Why I got=
 influenced by Moha?

-because of Raaga(attraction)

 

Why I get attracted=
?

-          To experience

 

Why I want to experience?

-          Thats=
 MahaaMaaya. She attracts Parabrahman and create a desire in him to experie=
nce her.

 

Why Maahaa Maaya does like that?

-          J=E2=80=A6.She is=
 wife of Shiva(parabrahman). So both of them are always romancing and havin=
g union. And the consciousness of parabrahman when takes on the creation/ma=
tter, then they become children.

 

So, male and female are eternal?

-Yes=
. Female keeps fooling the male all the time=E2=80=A6lol..(sorry no offense=
)

 

Is she so powerful than male or Shiva?

-Yes. Shiva becomes helpless =
when he sees Paarvati, always engages in Union with her. Thats why A Rishi =
got annoyed and cursed Shiva that he will be always worshipped in this copu=
lation form.And that=E2=80=99s why the first act of creation is -represente=
d as Shiva-Linga(representing copulation of Shiva and Paarvati), after the =
copulation of which the entire Universe is born as children. Please remembe=
r these are secrets of tantra, and one should not look at copulation as a d=
erogoratory act, as we had been indoctrinated since childhood.

 

Oh My go=
d! Then no one can conquer sex urge?

-yes. No one; unless they  become Sha=
aktaas. For Shaaktaas alone can gain Moksha, no one else can. Let him try a=
nd see.

-And that=E2=80=99s why, in jyotisha, the Moksha trikonas are 4, 8=
 and 12. And 4th house is the first Moksha Bhaava, and also house of The Mo=
ther Divine.

-So see, jyotisha mathematically proves that the first step t=
o Moksha is to follow Shaakta Maarga.

 

 

3.       I hope I tried my bes=
t to put across my point, and clarity has dawn on you.

 

I am eagerly wai=
ting for your reply. 

 

Bhavadiya,

Kannan

only the =E2=80=9Csiddhi=E2=80=9D; and not the process or =E2=80=9C=

as a boon/blessings from god.<=
