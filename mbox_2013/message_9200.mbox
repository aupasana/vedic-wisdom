VEDANTA=C2=A0 IS NOT FOR EVERY ONE....


Turning to Ananda, a French lady ,=
 he asked, =E2=80=9CWhat kind of
spiritual practice are you doing?=E2=80=9D=

=C2=A0
=E2=80=9CI just go on thinking that I am the Supreme Being,=E2=80=
=9D she
replied in a somewhat proud tone.
=C2=A0
=E2=80=9CIs that so? Did y=
ou ever hear of Meerabai? She was one of
the greatest lady saints ever born=
 in India. From her childhood she felt
that Lord Krishna was her Beloved an=
d spent most of her days and nights in
worshipping Him and singing songs ab=
out Him. Finally, she had a mystic vision
of Him and her mind merged into H=
im. She thenceforth sang songs about the glory
and bliss of the God-Realize=
d state. At the end of her life, she entered a Krishna temple and disappear=
ed in the sanctum. You should
walk in the same path as her if you want to =
=C2=A0achieve the Realization,=E2=80=9D Maharaj said
smilingly.
=C2=A0
Anan=
da turned pale. Maharaj had pulverized her mountain of Vedanta in one strok=
e! She
could not speak.
=C2=A0
=E2=80=9C I may talk about Vedanta to some o=
f the people that come
here,=E2=80=9D Maharaj continued. =E2=80=9CThat is n=
ot for you and you should not pay any
attention to what I am telling others=
. The book of =C2=A0my conversations should not be taken as the
last word o=
n my teachings. I have given answers to the questions of certain
individual=
s. Those answers were intended for those people and not for everyone.
Instr=
uction can be on an individual basis only. The same medicine cannot be
pres=
cribed for all.
=C2=A0
=E2=80=9CNowadays people are full of intellectual co=
nceit. They have
no faith in the ancient traditional practices leading to S=
elf-Knowledge. They
want everything served to them on a silver platter.
=C2=
=A0
The path of knowledge makes sense to them and because of
that, they may=
 want to practice it. The will then find that it requires more
concentratio=
n then they can muster and slowly becoming humble, they will
finally take u=
p easier practices like repetition of a mantra or worship of a
form. Slowly=
 the belief in a Power greater then themselves will dawn on them and
a tast=
e for devotion will sprout in their heart. Then only will it be possible
fo=
r them to attain purity of mind and concentration. The conceited have to go=
 a
very roundabout way.
=C2=A0
Therefore I say that devotion is good enough=
 for you,=E2=80=9D
Maharaj concluded.

tins today only speak pseudo-Vedanta that is devoid of a respect for what b=
inds us in the first place and a genuine appreciation of the difficulty of =
overcoming the bondage. Let us dissect this "acceptance" thing for example.=
 Yes, it is very easy to theoretically understand that "acceptance of every=
thing" will liberate one. But what does it mean practically?
>
>For example=
, I read your note and my instinct
 was to respond. Should I "accept" the i=
nstinct and type this response? Or should I "accept" the other instinct to =
not waste time and continue with some Jyotish research work I was doing? Wh=
ich acceptance is better?

>We are constantly pulled in different directio=
ns by our dharma towards different beings/entities and it is not easy to pi=
ck the right thing to do.
>
>We can use an easy abstraction. Let us call ou=
r actions towards the rest of the world as "karma" and the actions of the r=
est of the world towards us as "karmaphala". A simple thumb rule can be (1)=
 to accept all "karmaphala" and not analyze it much and (2) to stick to our=
 dharma in picking the "karma". But there are 3 fundamental issues with thi=
s:
>
>(1) It is not easy to know one's dharma. One is often pulled in diffe=
rent directions by one's dharma towards different beings/entities. After al=
l, we are suspended in this world by a complex web of rinas!
>(2) As we eva=
luate various
 dharmas and pick current karma, some understanding of which =
karma is likely to result in which karmaphala is needed. Thus, feedback fro=
m previous karmas, in the form of "karmaphala", is of interest. But there i=
s no certainty and we can only have a vague understanding.
>(3) Firmness in=
 doing one's karma in the interest of one's highest dharma (based on one's =
best understanding at the time - could be faulty) and detachment to the cor=
responding karmaphala when it finally arrives, is what we have to do. But t=
hey are kind of opposite goals. Without some attachment, most people cannot=
 engage in firm actions.
>
>Many Vedantins make 2 mistakes - (1) they trivi=
alize the field of duality as something that is delusional and can simply b=
e wished away and (2) instead of seeing jnana and karma as two sides of the=
 coin, they see them as alternatives. They look down upon karma as somethin=
g lowly and value bookish & intellectual understanding of jnana more.
 With=
out firm & dharmik karmas, that intellectual understanding of jnana will no=
t infuse one's thinking and instincts deep enough to liberate one eventuall=
y.
>
>I can see that "sun of knowledge is so powerful that we cant even gra=
sp the edge of it's toes with our indriyas (sense-organs), hence you have t=
o use some other faculty and remember that you cant also express it to othe=
rs with your sense organs." But it is very easy for one to delude oneself t=
hat one is now grasping that Sun with "some other faculty". The proof of th=
e pudding is that theoretical understanding is accompanied by an internal t=
ransformation that expresses externally as firm dharmik karmas with detachm=
ent to karmaphala!!
>
>To anyone who lectures that all is Self/God, I just =
have one rude reply. Suppose one's hands and legs are cut off. Can one say =
that the cut off limbs and the stream of blood flowing are also Self/God an=
d be in the same blissful state? I know the answer
 in my case. Any truthfu=
l person will know the answer in one's own case. It is so easy to repeat Ve=
danta like a parrot, but Shakti is too powerful. Unless MANY deeply ingrain=
ed instincts are overcome through practice & grace, one cannot be liberated=
. Until one overcomes ALL instincts, "all is Self" is just theory.
>
>Regar=
ding Rajarshi's comment on there being something higher than the upper bird=
 in Mundakpanishad story, I don't have much to say. It is quite possible. H=
owever, whether or what is above that bird is not that interesting to me. W=
hen my personality is represented by the lower bird, my goal is to first ma=
ke the lower bird climb and reach the upper bird. Whether it stays there th=
en or flies away further up is an issue for future.

>I do not want to "put down" Vedanta. I only =
want to put it in
 perspective. It is the "anta" (end) of "veda" (knowledge=
). If one at the *beginning* or *middle* of the path ignores/puts down the =
whole path and talks excessively of the "end", it does not necessarily take=
 him to the end. It takes a loooong time to travel the path. Vedanta is jus=
t the end and not a path to the end. IMHO, Vedanta is not only useless but =
quite misleading for 99.9999% of humanity, though it is the inevitable fina=
l liberating reality for the rest who already travelled *a* path and reache=
d *the* end.
>
>Take the simple notion of acceptance. Rama, after Self-real=
ization, killed Ravana and others. Of course, he had no "dvesha" for Ravana=
. But would you normally label killing someone as "acceptance"? Understandi=
ng "acceptance" referred to in scriptures is no easy task!!!! In fact, peop=
le talk about "acceptance" without even fully understanding what it actuall=
y entails.
>
>We perceive everything through the lens of conditioning/vasan=
as
 and rinas. For example, my words may make you think that I am agitated,=
 even if I am quite "chilled" in reality. Before talking about "accepting" =
something, shouldn't we first improve one's perceptions? Can't questioning =
& contemplating help in clarifying our perceptions?
>
>Is "accepting" fault=
y/conditioned notions in our minds any useful? Isn't it better to resist, r=
eject and eject faulty/conditioned notions than to "accept" them? Wouldn't =
progress from a state of ignorance into that of wisdom naturally need a fin=
e balance between friction/resistance and acceptance?
>
>A prematurely adop=
ted stretegy of "accepting" everything with no "raaga" or "dvesha" can lead=
 to a confused and indecisive person who shuns his dharma and gets *stuck* =
in the middle of path despite speaking the language of someone who is at th=
e end of the path. For someone who is still stuck in Maayaa, it is better t=
o do somewhat selfless dharma even with some raaga and
 dvesha. Overcoming =
of raaga and dvesha naturally and organically occurs from within, as one en=
gages in more and more dharma and pays off more and more rinas.
>
>Detachme=
nt (disappearance of raaga and dvesha) comes with the maturing of jnana. Se=
lfless dharmik actions that pay off outstanding debts occur with the maturi=
ng of karma. These two sides should mature together, as they balance one. I=
f one goes to an extreme, either towards karma or jnana, without correspond=
ing progress in the other, one will very likely get stuck.

ns-serif;font-size:10pt;">Namaste friends,<br> <br>A couple of my writ=
e-ups related to Vedanta on a limited access Facebook forum may be of inter=
est to some people here. I am quoting just my comments. One should be able =
to follow them despite the missing context.<br> <br>*   =
;     *        *<br>=
 <br>Writing 1:<br> <br>I have no aversion for Vedanta at all, bu=
t many Vedantins today only speak pseudo-Vedanta that is devoid of a respec=
t for what binds us in the first place and a genuine appreciation of the di=
fficulty of overcoming the bondage. Let us dissect this "acceptance" thing =
for example. Yes, it is very easy to theoretically understand that "accepta=
nce of everything" will liberate one. But what does it mean practically?<br=
><br>For example, I read your note and my instinct
 was to respond. Should =
I "accept" the instinct and type this response? Or should I "accept" the ot=
her instinct to not waste time and continue with some Jyotish research work=
 I was doing? Which acceptance is better?<br><br>We are constantly pulled i=
n different directions by our dharma towards different beings/entities and =
it is not easy to pick the right thing to do.<br><br>We can use an easy abs=
traction. Let us call our actions towards the rest of the world as "karma" =
and the actions of the rest of the world towards us as "karmaphala". A simp=
le thumb rule can be (1) to accept all "karmaphala" and not analyze it much=
 and (2) to stick to our dharma in picking the "karma". But there are 3 fun=
damental issues with this:<br><br>(1) It is not easy to know one's dharma. =
One is often pulled in different directions by one's dharma towards differe=
nt beings/entities. After all, we are suspended in this world by a complex =
web of rinas!<br>(2) As we evaluate various
 dharmas and pick current karma=
, some understanding of which karma is likely to result in which karmaphala=
 is needed. Thus, feedback from previous karmas, in the form of "karmaphala=
", is of interest. But there is no certainty and we can only have a vague u=
nderstanding.<br>(3) Firmness in doing one's karma in the interest of one's=
 highest dharma (based on one's best understanding at the time - could be f=
aulty) and detachment to the corresponding karmaphala when it finally arriv=
es, is what we have to do. But they are kind of opposite goals. Without som=
e attachment, most people cannot engage in firm actions.<br><br>Many Vedant=
ins make 2 mistakes - (1) they trivialize the field of duality as something=
 that is delusional and can simply be wished away and (2) instead of seeing=
 jnana and karma as two sides of the coin, they see them as alternatives. T=
hey look down upon karma as something lowly and value bookish & intelle=
ctual understanding of jnana more.
 Without firm & dharmik karmas, that=
 intellectual understanding of jnana will not infuse one's thinking and ins=
tincts deep enough to liberate one eventually.<br><br>I can see that "sun o=
f knowledge is so powerful that we cant even grasp the edge of it's toes wi=
th our indriyas (sense-organs), hence you have to use some other faculty an=
d remember that you cant also express it to others with your sense organs."=
 But it is very easy for one to delude oneself that one is now grasping tha=
t Sun with "some other faculty". The proof of the pudding is that theoretic=
al understanding is accompanied by an internal transformation that expresse=
s externally as firm dharmik karmas with detachment to karmaphala!!<br><br>=
To anyone who lectures that all is Self/God, I just have one rude reply. Su=
ppose one's hands and legs are cut off. Can one say that the cut off limbs =
and the stream of blood flowing are also Self/God and be in the same blissf=
ul state? I know the answer
 in my case. Any truthful person will know the =
answer in one's own case. It is so easy to repeat Vedanta like a parrot, bu=
t Shakti is too powerful. Unless MANY deeply ingrained instincts are overco=
me through practice & grace, one cannot be liberated. Until one overcom=
es ALL instincts, "all is Self" is just theory.<br><br>Regarding Rajarshi's=
 comment on there being something higher than the upper bird in Mundakpanis=
had story, I don't have much to say. It is quite possible. However, whether=
 or what is above that bird is not that interesting to me. When my personal=
ity is represented by the lower bird, my goal is to first make the lower bi=
rd climb and reach the upper bird. Whether it stays there then or flies awa=
y further up is an issue for future.<br> <br>*    =
    *        *<br> <=
br>Writing 2:<br> <br>I do not want to "put down" Vedanta. I only want=
 to put it in
 perspective. It is the "anta" (end) of "veda" (knowledge). I=
f one at the *beginning* or *middle* of the path ignores/puts down the whol=
e path and talks excessively of the "end", it does not necessarily take him=
 to the end. It takes a loooong time to travel the path. Vedanta is just th=
e end and not a path to the end. IMHO, Vedanta is not only useless but quit=
e misleading for 99.9999% of humanity, though it is the inevitable final li=
berating reality for the rest who already travelled *a* path and reached *t=
he* end.<br><br>Take the simple notion of acceptance. Rama, after Self-real=
ization, killed Ravana and others. Of course, he had no "dvesha" for Ravana=
. But would you normally label killing someone as "acceptance"? Understandi=
ng "acceptance" referred to in scriptures is no easy task!!!! In fact, peop=
le talk about "acceptance" without even fully understanding what it actuall=
y entails.<br><br>We perceive everything through the lens of conditioning/v=
asanas
 and rinas. For example, my words may make you think that I am agita=
ted, even if I am quite "chilled" in reality. Before talking about "accepti=
ng" something, shouldn't we first improve one's perceptions? Can't question=
ing & contemplating help in clarifying our perceptions?<br><br>Is "acce=
pting" faulty/conditioned notions in our minds any useful? Isn't it better =
to resist, reject and eject faulty/conditioned notions than to "accept" the=
m? Wouldn't progress from a state of ignorance into that of wisdom naturall=
y need a fine balance between friction/resistance and acceptance?<br><br>A =
prematurely adopted stretegy of "accepting" everything with no "raaga" or "=
dvesha" can lead to a confused and indecisive person who shuns his dharma a=
nd gets *stuck* in the middle of path despite speaking the language of some=
one who is at the end of the path. For someone who is still stuck in Maayaa=
, it is better to do somewhat selfless dharma even with some raaga and
 dve=
sha. Overcoming of raaga and dvesha naturally and organically occurs from w=
ithin, as one engages in more and more dharma and pays off more and more ri=
nas.<br><br>Detachment (disappearance of raaga and dvesha) comes with the m=
aturing of jnana. Selfless dharmik actions that pay off outstanding debts o=
ccur with the maturing of karma. These two sides should mature together, as=
 they balance one. If one goes to an extreme, either towards karma or jnana=
, without corresponding progress in the other, one will very likely get stu=
