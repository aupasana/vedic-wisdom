Respected sir,<br>With due regards I request you to she=
d some light upon the recent Uttarakhand tragedy. After the tragedy it is n=
ow believed that the tragedy was due to shifting of Dhari devi temple at Al=
aknanda river. I read some post by shri Manish ji and blog of shri sanjay r=
ath ji.  <br>My doubt is that, in present context how much it is relevant t=
hat such tragedies do happen by a Devi wrath. As per our believe God is mer=
ciful and even in some of your post previously you have said that it is not=
 worthwhile to connect tragedies with God or faith for Him?<br>Hope you can=
 elaborate this.<br><br>Best Regards<br>Ashish K.agarwal<div>Sent from my B=

either sadness/disappointment nor with happiness/excitement, but with the s=
pirit of "this is what Supreme Lord is doing through me at this instan=

so and so", gives up one's own will and flows like a light leaf in=

one sees it as the will of Supreme Lord and has no notions of one's own=
