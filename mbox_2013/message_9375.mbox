Dear Narasimha-ji
Browsing over internet I've found photo-report about Girl=
 Age Attained
Ceremony
http://richardarunachala.wordpress.com/2012/12/30/ag=
e-attained-ceremonyt\
iruvannamalai/
<http://richardarunachala.wordpress.co=
m/2012/12/30/age-attained-ceremony\
tiruvannamalai/>

What came to my atten=
tion is special way to build temporary homa kundam
which was done in the ro=
om by the priest. Basically this is metal tray
with sand on it surrounded b=
y 4 bricks.
You can see it in details on the pictures:image 1

It seems like tray is made of stainless steel=
 which raise my doubts.

Could you please comment on it? Is it suitable way=
 to arrange improvised
kundam if there is no proper copper pyramid kundam?

This is my first message here and I want to express my immense gratitude
f=
or all invaluable lessons I have learned reading your messages here as
well=
 as from the site. I am veerashaiva of Kashi pitha. I have got
deeksha 3 ye=
ars ago and do everyday ishta-linga-puja  since then. I am
planning to try =
at least weekly homa.
