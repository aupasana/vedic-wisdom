Nice example..


However, IMHO, people make one vital mistake when it comes=
 to Karma-Yoga. They believe that Karma yoga means helpful activities, help=
ful to society and others ETC. That is Karma and probably good karma. But t=
here is a thin and crucial line that separates karma from becoming a Yoga a=
nd resulting into Karma-Yoga. In any case everyone is always performing kar=
ma, some karma. Even breathing is a karma. Krshna says clearly no one can e=
xist even one moment without performing some karma. The question though is =
what makes a karma into yoga and therefore a karma-yoga. 

Only when an act=
ivity is done with zero expectations of any form of result either positive =
or negative, no conscious or subconscious agendas, and with a stable and co=
nstant realization that one is merely a minitta in the activity does karma =
really become karma-yoga. Neither the activity itself, nor the results, or =
the greater flow of events is even slightly dependent on ones personal effo=
rt. There are Powers and Agencies far higher than the sharpest human mind a=
nd the stronger than the strongest human forces, who effortlessly control a=
nd work towards goals in a comprehensive and flawless manner. It is these w=
ho perform activities which we, in our limited and puerile vision and persp=
ective believe to have been done by us. When this nimitta-matra state becom=
es a constant abiding and actual realization, ONLY then real Karma Yoga sta=
rts. Before that it is just karma, good or bad, helpful or non-helpful (as =
per human standards).

Therefore, like any other form of Yoga, Karma-Yoga i=
s quite difficult. Bottomline being that intense activity, howsoever good, =
is not to be confused with activity in the mode of yoga (karma-yoga), which=
 is work performed in a state of a high spiritual realization. Therefore ev=
en simple activities like making tea and chatting with friends can become a=
 karma yoga (if done in a particular state of mind), while doing massive hu=
manitarian works (good as they are in their own way) may not necessarily be=
come karma-yoga.


Just my opinion.
