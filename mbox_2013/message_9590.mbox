hi guys....I would really like your input on something I,ve been thinking a=
bout and talking with some fellow seekers for a while now.

its about karma=
,destiny and mantras....the issue goes like this....if its in my destiny to=
 be poor for my whole life........and I come across and do a sadhana for sw=
arnakarshana bbhairava..and if it works..i would get rich right?..assuming =
such sadhanas work of course...which is another issue.

now the issue is di=
d I cheat fate?...as some people would claim is possible through tantra and=
 mantra sadhanas?

or some others would say that it already was in my desti=
ny to get rich....just that it had to happen through a certain sadhana.??

=
which is it??according to our shastras??..what is the truth of this matter?=


because if I did swarnkarshana,sati,kamadeva,and what not sadhanas...I ca=
n basically be rich,blessed with the most wonderfull beautiful wife,be perf=
ectly healthy,wealthy,and all round success ,happiness and perfection......=


it doesn't make sense at all...because if that was the case....india woul=
d be paradise by now.....

so whats your take on this issue of using mantra=
s..and tantric sadhanas?....

to what extant does it work?if it works at al=
l?...and how?....and what about destiny?...and how much can we truly alter =
it??if at all??

I tried a karna yakshini sadhana once...just as an experim=
ent to see if works...and nothing happened apart from hurting myself physic=
aly by sitting in japa for 6 hours from 12 to 6 am for 21 days...but later =
I found out the so called guru who taught me was an absolute fake...so I ca=
nt say if the sadhana truly works or not.....

in order to prevent further =
mishaps like this for myself and others....would those with experience in t=
hese things kindly share your wisdom.....

tnks...
