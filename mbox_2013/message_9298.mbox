Dear Narasimha,

Jai Ma!

A great solar eclipse indeed and a fruitful Amava=
shya and an even more fruitful Akshaya Tritiya to you and everyone who is r=
eading this email.

<<I asked for trouble, didn't I? :-)>>

Question can ne=
ver trouble you! :)

<<The *world*? You mean the world of Rajarshi? ;-)>>

=
True. But that is why I used a bit of the future continuous tense in my hop=
eful assertion:) I don't think the world at large will let go of the Dasava=
tara idea anytime soon, however the evolutionary link will keep gaining mor=
e ground. Already many seem to think that way. I was watching a TV program =
of a god-man speaking to massive gathering of his followers in an Indian ci=
ty and he was actually explaining dasavatara with evolution.

Though this t=
hought came to me independently, I am definitely not the first one, or
 hop=
efully the last one, who finds an evolutionary link in the story of the Das=
avataras. Apparently, it was Sri Aurobindo who first wrote about this.

Hmm.. the way *I look at it*, the S=
upreme Being is truly Infinite in every sense, yet when it makes a descent =
into our plane of material life, it assumes a form, a personality and a=C2=
=A0 character. Now based on the need of THAT desh-kaal, it chooses its spec=
ific personality and form, which, to the average consciousness of that peri=
od seems like a fantastic achievement, pushing the limits of imagination to=
 the extreme, for that period. And in this light, Krshna is Swayam Bhagawan=
. As if, if G-d were to come down in flesh and blood in fantastic potency f=
or the age that we are living in - it must have been Krshna with his effort=
less and matchless display of the multiple skills, including such extreme D=
ivine feats as showing his foster mother the whole universe contained insid=
e his mouth, or making Rishi Markandeya experience the effects of Yogamaya =
when he saw this great deluge that ended the world and in the middle of tho=
se turbulent waters, a Divine Child
 was floating in a Banyana-leaf, suckin=
g his own right toe. When the Child sucked Rishi Markandeya inside him thro=
ugh his breath, the Rishi perceived infinite number of universes and planet=
ary systems within the body of the Child. 

Recently I was reading a Tantri=
c scripture. Tara Rahashyam. Among ShaktAs, it is a revered scripture. I fo=
und something interesting. While naturally this being a ShaktA text, the Di=
vine Mother in Her various forms are eulogized as Supreme, it also mentions=
 that in Kali, Krshna is Supreme. This explains why only Krshna among the v=
arious avatars of Vishnu is worshiped in those parts of India where Tantras=
 were the predominant scriptures that were followed. Rama is considered as =
a part of Krshna. So along with Krshna nama, Rama nama japa is also done, t=
hough there is no exclusive mass worship of Rama in these parts. 

India ha=
s so many flavors, that it is almost mind boggling.


*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=
 *

On many subtle points, your mail was very thought provoking. And I am s=
ure I will keep pondering over various hints for quite some time. But one p=
oint I want to make about Vedanta. I agree totally with you. 

Vedanta is t=
he philosophy, not only of Shankara Adwaitha, but also that of Ramanujachar=
ya, Madhavacharya, Chaitanya, Vallavacharya as well as the TantrAs. They ar=
e all Vedantas.

Quite simple put, there are two fundamental states of pure=
 consciousness. Static, and dynamic. Purusha and Shakti. The static conscio=
usness is same all around in everything, from the highest Avatara to the lo=
west stone. But the dynamic aspect of consciousness is NOT same in everythi=
ng.

Ramakrishna used to say, Kali in present in everyone, but Her Shakti i=
s not same in everyone! This crucial point lies in the heart of Tantric Ved=
anta philosophy. By the process of sadhana, this dynamic aspect of consciou=
sness can be enhanced in an individual. This is the eternal purification of=
 individual Chit-Shakti. The purer it is, the stronger it becomes. This als=
o accommodates for the idea of vigyana.

That is why however much sadhana a=
 person may do, he/she will never ever attain to the level of a Rama or a K=
rshna. Its practically impossible. The difference is in their levels of ind=
ividualized chit-shakti. Or that of a Rishi. Their Chit-Shakit is so powerf=
ul, so pure, so free, that it can identify with the Universe and do things =
which are impossible to imagine. Which we cannot. Ever.


Once again, wishi=
ng everyone a fruitful and auspicious Akshaya Tritiya!

-Regards

There may be some confusion regarding "poornavatara".
=
=C2=A0
As Parasara used it, the term "poornavatara" does NOT mean "the most=
 complete or perfect avatara". It means a completely divine avatara with no=
 jivamsa. There can be more than one poornavataras. They are not necessaril=
y "equal".
=C2=A0
To give a simplisitc analogy, some jewllery may be gold m=
ixed with some amount of copper. If one jewllery is 100% pure gold, it does=
 not mean
 it contains all the gold in the
 world. It only means it has not=
hing other than gold. Similarly, the four poornavataras mentioned by Parasa=
ra are 100% divine and do not contain jivamsa. It does not mean they contai=
n "all the divinity" in cosmos.
=C2=A0

=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
In fact, the=
 very notion that any one form can be "the most complete or perfect avatara=
" or "one that personifies entire divinity of Supreme Being" or "one equal =
to Supreme Being" is unacceptable and inconsistent with SB 1.3.30-31, which=
 says that ANY form of Supreme Being is like a cloud in the sky, while Supr=
eme Being is like the sky containing all possible clouds.
=C2=A0
Supreme Be=
ing is endowed with infinite qualities. Any form contains a finite number o=
f those qualities. So no form can be "equal to" Supreme Being. SB 1.3.30-31=
 is clear in that regard.
=C2=A0
If one form is "equal to" supreme being an=
d others are
 not, you can conclude that that form is "the best". If neithe=
r form is "equal to" supreme being, how can you really compare the differen=
t qualities of two forms?

=C2=A0
Anyway, this rende=
rs your (3) a meaningless issue. Whether that line refers to Krishna alone =
or not is irrelevant, for, in either case, "swayam bhagavan" cannot mean "a=
 personification of the entirety of supreme being". Before you wonder wheth=
er it refers to Krishna alone or not, first figure out what "swayam bhagava=
n" actually means, in a way that is not inconsistent with verses that follo=
w! If no form is "equal to" supreme being and every form is a "subset" of s=
upreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of "swayam bhagavan=
"???

=C2=A0
Regarding (4), Parasara
 identified 4 ava=
taras as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, and identified the source of divinit=
y in each of them. He only gave objective information and did not give any =
subjective judgment on who is the best, which Suta apparently did.
=C2=A0
I=
 have not read BV Purana. If you can quote some verses before and after, I =
can comment. Any comparison between avataras WILL have to be under some sub=
jective context. I don't know the context of Suta's statement you allude to=
.
=C2=A0
Though any comparison is subjective, I will be surprised if someon=
e considers the other two poornavataras of Vishnu as the "best" avataras. B=
ut, I will not be surprised if different people consider Rama and Krishna a=
s the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon are the luminaries and show soul =
and mind, which clearly have a primary significance compared to other aspec=
ts of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna are bound to be seen as the best b=
y different people. However, what Suta
 apparently said can only be a subje=
ctive view under some context.

=C2=A0
Regarding (2): =
Kala means a part or a phase. Moon has 16 phases (representing 16 tithis, i=
ncluding Amavasya and Pournima), but Sun has only one phase - he is always =
full and bright!
=C2=A0
Just like Moon, mind has many moods, even a perfect=
ed one. A perfected mind goes through those moods with full awareness of un=
derlying reality, whereas an imperfect mind experiences them under delusion=
. But it is the nature of Moon/mind to have variations. Sun/soul OTOH has n=
o such variations.
=C2=A0
Krishna may show Vishwaroopa oneday, run away fro=
m battlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandha), do amazing miracles oneday and=
 play clever tricks another day. There is a lot more variety to his persona=
lity than Rama's. Now, does that make him better or worse than Rama? Well, =
that is
 a *subjective* matter.

Regarding (1=
): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is present in several beings such a plan=
ets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the world appearanc=
e in consciousness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So they stand for di=
fferent qualities of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance. So Vishnu's =
avataras are associated with grahas. But Pararsara said that avataras can d=
escend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings (e.g. Shiva, P=
arvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre understanding w=
hat various deities stand for, what forces play a role in creating, sustain=
ing and destroying the world appearance in consciousness. People talk too m=
uch about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there is hardly any understanding of Ve=
da. When it comes to Puranic stories, we think in terms of
 superficial sto=
ries and not in terms of how it maps to what happens in consciousness.
=C2=
=A0
Mohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Maheshwari. Nara & Narayana were inca=
rnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu + Shiva). I don't know about Dha=
nvantari and will pass for today. Dattatreya again was an incarnation of Sh=
iva + Vishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incarnation of great serpent Adi Sesh=
a (like Lakshmana).
=C2=A0
We need to go deeper into what they all stand fo=
r esoterically and what role they play in the functioning of consciousness,=
 to understand this more. Hopefully another day..

=C2=A0
Adwaitins who are skeptical about notions taught by Parasara (parama=
tmamsa, jivatmamsa, different sources of paramtmamsa etc) should realize on=
e thing. Though all is Brahman, all did not come from Brahman in one step. =
It all evolved in many steps
 and correspondingly there are some steps in t=

If a character in my dream tonight overcom=

will it. It is after all a character created and sustained in my mind!
=C2=

Same thing applies to us!

Vedanta is not wrong. But it is releva=

The *world*? You=

=C2=A0
World accepts 10 avataras where Kal=
ki will be the 10th (and not 9th as you suggested, to fit your notion of ev=
olution). Even those who are uncomfortable with Buddha replace him with som=
eone else rather than make it 9 avataras. World neither thinks much about t=

 Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no le=
ss a measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Pur=
ana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,
 like the Gaudiya=
 Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and=
 declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well=
 as Narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intrica=

Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.

atysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha=

of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic=

 dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of this =
earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashur=
ama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the N=
irguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to =
be separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the va=
rious manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness a=
nd its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth=
 and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature's grand design for life on

earth.

>>>>>=C2=A05. Of these, naturally=
, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of evoluti=
on, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier=
, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A sa=
twic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the animal ten=
dencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a grea=
ter purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be ins=
tances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will =
change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Ra=
ma did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a =
moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Ags=
atha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of t=
he final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he k=
illed Ravana not to rescue her, but it
 was the Dharma to do so, and to unh=
old his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, f=
amily honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the gen=
ius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe,=
 as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhe=
re, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into hi=
s killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that =
no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadhar=
ma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had t=
his immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 super=
natural feats into account. It is his singular and constant detachment from=
 situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances that mark hi=
s life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. Al=
l his friends, his foster parents,
 his village-folks who so loved him, ple=
aded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, lov=
e and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into an unknown d=
estiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understoo=
d that they won't understand, he promised he will return back once his work=
 in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis c=
ame to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the mo=
ment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he remo=
ved himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equa=
lly and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshn=
a, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and countin=
g. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's hea=
d and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna=
 of being a revolutionist
 and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Dur=
yodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to a=
rrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet h=
e did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his=
 own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of h=
is going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or la=
ck of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others say or think o=
f him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect =
equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his=
 life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by defini=
tion can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the re=
sults belong to the instrument. When running away from the battle-field and=
 killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, o=
r gesturing Bheema
 to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi=
 to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how t=
he situations must be lined up which would cause the destruction of these p=
eople. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But hap=
pens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Universal Forc=
e. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at =
least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or=
 such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In =
the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he ki=
lls Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 he=
aded demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the =
Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment=
 of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of sa=
twa, chief
 of which is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness cau=
sed due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was de=
stroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can als=
o cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He ha=
d no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, frien=
d, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotio=
n. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha =
was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the sc=
heme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a s=
tatic realization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality=
 of this earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna esp=
oused. None of them negated this world. If negation of this world and life =
is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of
 evolu=
tionary development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Bu=
ddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less=
 impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line t=
hat these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As =
such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to=
 be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both stat=
ic and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the =
Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body=
 of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The ori=
ginal literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are cen=
ters of psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, =
or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of=
 the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full
 power and forc=
e of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can mod=
ify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself =
is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point an=
d not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evo=
lution are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8.=
 I cannot comment on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I=
 know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagr=
ee with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understan=
