Heaing voices in the head or seeing things may or may not be an off=
shoot of a kundalini awakening. There are plenty of simultaneous things tha=
t can happen. Kundalini is only one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kundalin=
i awakening may not even make you see or hear anything, it may make a perso=
n suddenly experience some other nice things too. The mind is of a very sub=
tle nature. The astral world is a plethora of endless subtle entities of al=
l kinds. If by some chance the link to this world opens up, willingly or un=
willingly, it can cause quite a bit of problems for both mature as well as =
immature people. In the sense, those who are not aware of these can get aff=
ected by them easily, even those who do sadhana can also get affected by a =
plethora of false experiences and misplaced priorities. As such a diagnosis=
 like this simply cannot be done over net, and rarely by people of this for=
um (unless I am grossly mistaken).

Doing a homa with the desire that someo=
ne gets cured maybe good. However, it can also have unintended consequences=
. Some part of the person's karma will come to you today or tomorrow. You m=
ust have enuf spiritual backup to know how to deal with it. It is never adv=
isable to enter into the cricket field merely with a bat in hand, one must =
also wear all necessary protections.=C2=A0 The first rule is curing such ki=
nd of psycho-spiritual maladies is to find out what causes the effect, and =
if the person is trying to remedy interferes with the karmic process, how m=
uch of the effect will come to the person and how easily s/he can handle it=
. All this is complex and not easy at all. It is like a specialization.

=C2=A0 
That was an interesting read. But how is a doctor to t=
ell apart kundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both in=
clude similar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that othe=
rs cannot experience- in other words, what doctors call "hallucinations". A=
re these hallucinations or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no =
diagnostic test. 

However most doctors are pretty good at detecting the at=
tention-seeking 'fake' patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychose=
s.... their stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuin=
e "I hear voices in my head" schizophrenic or kundalini patient. 

About va=
ta, most of our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They=
 are usually unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vat=
a derangement. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advi=
ce. The use of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I'm sur=
e this does no good for vata.

The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I w=
ill do some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this=
 to any patient. 

Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the =
kundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as "psychosis" and=
 will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this wi=
ll not harm them, though I doubt it will help.

Advice and thoughts from al=
l members would be much appreciated.

 one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion =
of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journ=
ey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it rea=
lly does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things an=
d entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are =
useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own=
 ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and mis=
s-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi
 becomes even more
>  vita=
l. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kund=
alini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are be=
cause of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile =
and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes=
 that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle infl=
uences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" du=
e to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc=
. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they h=
ave chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and =
various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every optio=
n. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have =
the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so=
, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess
 work.

recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at pres=
ent, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she h=
as had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has=
 involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is =
not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms st=
arted and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find an=
ything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that th=
is is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe =
themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini =
awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in main=
stream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by =
western medicine, and as we have no treatments for
 deranged

we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. M=
y experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not =
be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the =
suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her=
, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution ther=
e could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother=

t the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom=
 we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be car=

      <div>That was an interesting r=
ead. But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises from non-kundalini p=
sychosis? Features of both include similar experiences, such as seeing/hear=
ing/smelling things that others cannot experience- in other words, what doc=
tors call "hallucinations". Are these hallucinations or the result of kunda=
lini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. <br>
<br>
However most doctor=
s are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking 'fake' patients with p=
seudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories tend to be pretty =
shoddy, and different from the genuine "I hear voices in my head" schizophr=
enic or kundalini patient. <br>
<br>
About vata, most of our patients have =
severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually unable to sleep, =
umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. We try and help=
 with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use of Cannabis and ot=
her drugs is also notoriously common- I'm sure this does no good for vata.<=
br>
<br>
The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do some on her beh=
alf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any patient. <br>
=
<br>
Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalini pati=
ent? Most doctors label kundalini problems as "psychosis" and will advise a=
nti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not harm th=
em, though I doubt it will help.<br>

Advice and thoughts from all memb=

The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its=

, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Co=
nstant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the hum=
an mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachme=
nt, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed e=
tc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to n=
ow self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more=
 intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A goo=
d guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it=
 can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, s=
ome of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and =
given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They t=

e same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi
 becomes even more<br>

 While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini =
Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because =
of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and in=
sufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that =
the aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences=
 and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to v=
arious reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That=
 can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have ch=
ances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and variou=
s possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Mor=
eover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the ri=

ar all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent=
 experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, a=
nd have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had=
 a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has invol=
ved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of=
 Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started =
and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything=
 physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is =
due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themse=
lves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awaken=
ing- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream=
 psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by wester=
n medicine, and as we have no treatments for
 deranged<br>
>  kundalini,=
 we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. =
My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not=
 be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the=
 suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume he=
r, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution the=
re could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mothe=
r, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- a=
nd either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request th=
at the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (who=
m we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be ca=
reful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perha=
ps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say =
"let me be your instrument" and leave the
 kundalini<br>
