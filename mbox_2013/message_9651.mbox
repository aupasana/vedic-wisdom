Dear Tanvir and Alamelu,

> My mother tongue is Tamil


Same here. I empath=
ize with your situation, since I was in a similar
position not too long ago=
.

The list of words that you have highlighted is long, and in many cases,
=
you've highlighted a single word which it is not possible to split up in
an=
y natural way. On top of this, if we split vedic mantras and pause, the
swa=
ras also change.

At the end of the day, the devas will try to find a way t=
o give our own
karma-phala to us. If we are destined to get "good" things, =
they may
interpret our mispronunciations to our favor. If we are destined t=
o get
"bad" things, they may interpret out good pronunciation in a way that=
 we
don't prefer. Don't worry about 'perfect' pronunciation. Use what knowl=
edge
you have to pronounce things to the best of your ability, and slowly
i=
mprove it.


*> HAVYAIRNAMASOPASADYA...*
*> I break it into HAVYARNAMA-SOPA=
SADYA... (You mentioned it too)*
*
*

This is havyaiH + namasA + upasadya.
=

sasneham,

    ajit

  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Splitting up of the long Sanskri=
t words in Homam 
  manual<br>> <br>> <br>>=A0=A0 Namaste dear mem=
bers,<br>> 
  <br>>=A0=A0 Two years ago, I came across Shri Narasimha=
ji's website 
  and was excited to discover the procedure for doing hom=
ams by yourself. 
  However, I felt quite intimidated, so I did not act upo=
n them. Lately, I kept 
  coming back to the site and decided to take it st=
ep by step to gain 
  confidence, so I have started reading the text of Shr=
i Maha Ganapathi homam 
  till the word flow is fluent. I'm less intimi=
dated by it now. I'm also quite 
  grateful to Shri Narasimhaji for mak=
ing it available as I have been wanting to 
  do this for a long time. But =
am still not ready to start it. The reason is 
  that certain words are so =
long that, to maintain a flow, I need to split the 
  word into bits that w=
ill help maintain the flow but need to know where to 
  split in order that=
 I don't change the meaning of it. I'm following the 
  Sanskrit ve=
rsion. I want to include the words (a long list) in the hope that 
  one of=
 you members can help me split them up in the right way, but my computer 
 =
 does not type the sanskrit words, nor am I able to copy and paste the sans=
krit 
  word, it does not do allow it. How can I upload those words?<br>>=
