=C2=A0  
 
It depends on one's anusandhana (i.e. the m=
eaning and the form one meditates upon during Japa).
Whats slow for one is =
just right for another.
It takes half a min for me too as Gayatri as one su=
ch special Mantra loaded with meanings that has to be "chewed" well and the=
 form has to be fully visualized.
Number is not really a big consideration.=

Getting the state of mind where other thoughts are zero and totally being =
lost in the mantra and dhyeya rupa becomes important.

Also, I think it is =
Brihadaranyaka Upanishat that tells one has to stop Gayatri at 5 places dur=
ing each chant. Add that up and 30 seconds is not really a big thing :-)

Srikanth
