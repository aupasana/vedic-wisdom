namaste,

The quoted "ganaka rishi" nyasa is usually given for the mahaganapati
mantra, and not for prana pratishthapana. For prana pratishtapana, what you
have quoted from the shiva manual is the usual practice. This section in
the ganapati manual seems to be a mistake.


> Doesn't it have to be "asya sri sadashivo"


This is not necessary. The viniyoga (application) here is not specific to
the prana pratishthapana of Shiva alone. ( If you choose to add something,
add "sadAshiva" and not "sadAshivo". )


> "rgyajussamaatarvani"


Narasimha once wrote a brief note on chandas. It may refer to the internal
movement of the mantra. Here, this may be the movement found in any of the
vedas ... which makes sense for the prana shakti devata.


> Can I say as in laghunyasa for rudram instead?


The nyasa for the rudra prashna should be used for the rudra prashna, and
not for other mantras. :-)

A note on homa with the rudra prashna -- Long vedic sections like the rudra
prashna aren't easy to chant correctly. Doing this while also offering
ahutis is an added challenge. The standard way of performing homa with
these mantras requires the mantras to be split in certain places (with
corresponding changes in swara). Some sections also have to be repeated in
particular ways.


> something like "om sri sadashiva parshadebhyo namah; balim samarpayami"?


Sure. Both versions are fine.

sasneham,
