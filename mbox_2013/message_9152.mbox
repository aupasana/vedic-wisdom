Hi Vasant,

It is really amazing to see such a wonderful photograph & resem=
blance to
the Baana. I have strong faith irrespective of such proof.

Howev=
er, in order to take a picture of the universe as shown in a
elliptical egg=
, the camera have to be out of the universe. This is absurd
and physically =
not possible. So I think that ESA photograph of the universe
is a concept p=
icture.

Views from learned Gurus are welcome.

Jitu
