Hello - I am having tough luck collecting all the bali raisins and feeding =
it to cows in the weekend as there are not too many cows in the area and my=
 hunts at times are not being successful. Sparrows eat raisins, but donot s=
how up most of the times. The pigeons are around, they do not touch raisins=
.
What's the best way of disposing the bali, if it is raisins ?

Also, can =
I offer raw rice grains as bali ?
