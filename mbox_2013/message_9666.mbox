Dear Shri Narasimha Ji,

Namasthe

 

1.       I deeply appreciate and feel grateful for having shared your
understandings. I would kindly request you to permit me to share my
understandings which stand in definite contrast with that of yours. I would
also request your noble self to allow me to point out a number of flaws,
which I consider as a liberty bestowed on debating scholars. Of course, we
don't become great if we are "scholars" because a scholar is essentially a
person who continues to learn without a pause. I would view this as an
opportunity to rectify our understandings.

 

2.       First of all you quoted Swami Vivekananda as a stamping authority
to support/strengthen your argument. Let me tell you that truth/clarity does
not need any support, because it stands itself as a support for all.(In
Hindi, "satya ko pramaan ki aavashyakta nahi hai, satya swayam apna pramaan
hai")

 

3.       Secondly, if what you have quoted from Swami Vivekananda is true,
then I am skeptical about Swami Vivekananda's understandings himself. Let me
tell you that divinity of soul is ever-existing like Sun (Sadaa Jaagati
Jyoti)(ever shining light). So do you need any effort to manifest it? Do you
mean to say that the ever-shining Brahman is at the mercy of our efforts to
get itself manifested? Perhaps..But let us ponder what actually caused that
sunlight to be eclipsed? Let me tell you that the very idea of considering
that divinity to be eclipsed is ignorance; and consequently trying to make
an effort to remove that eclipse, is a greater ignorance. Any act done under
ignorance will yield only further bondage and eclipse, and trap the soul
into the chakravyuha(tornado) of the maaya.

 

4.       The key idea here is that when we start with an assumption which
itself is faulty, then our whole calculation based on that assumption goes
faulty. So there is no point in proceeding further beyond this, or else it
is just a waste of time, without true/clarity of vision dawning on us.

 

5.       I would humbly request your noble self to view it as a healthy
scholarly debate, which necessitates being blunt and straightforward,
without being circumbulatory. This will be in the general interest and
welfare of all the earnest seekers.

 

6.       I humbly request your noble self to peruse my understandings, and
bless us with further insights.

 

Thanks and Warm Regards,

Kannan

Namaste friends,
 
I am cc'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup because of the spiritual
content.
 
I agree with Vishnu ji's comment on a specific point in Maja ji's nice
write-up:
 
> > *Also, one is supposed to choose only one ayana for one lifetime and
> > master it to as perfect as possible. *
> 
>  I am not entirely sure if the above statement is correct. It is very much

Indeed, one can carve one's own niche by combining multiple paths. They are
not meant to be mutually exclusive.
 
I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where he makes a
comment on the 4 paths:
 
"Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity
within by controlling nature: external and internal. Do this either by work
or worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of
these - and be free."
 
Here are my 2 cents.
 
Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes
on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and
self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme.
One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop that quality.
However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme
are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in
one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e.
one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.
 
Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of
that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even
Ramakrishna advised against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the
psychic life force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and
clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate
great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not
just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel of
Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged
several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda,
but did not encourage even him to practice it.
 
Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the
delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not
sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is
Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all
a delusion anyway" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that
reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind of like declaring
wisely in a movie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in
every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty,
sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of
constant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick
delusional jump to the end.
 
IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most
suitable and safest.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

friends,<br>
 <br>
I am c=
c'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup because of the spiritual content.<br>=

 <br>
I agree with Vishnu ji's comment on a specific point in Maja ji=
's nice
write-up:<br>
 <br>
> > *Also, one is supposed to choose=
 only one ayana for one lifetime and<br>
> > master it to as perfect =
as possible. *<br>
> <br>
>  I am not entirely sure if the above=
 statement is correct. It is very

easure of self realized people.<br>
 <br>
Indeed, one can carve one's =
own niche by combining multiple paths. They are not
meant to be mutually ex=
clusive.<br>
 <br>
I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Ra=
ja Yoga" where he makes
a comment on the 4 paths:<br>
 <br>
"=
;Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity
wit=
hin by controlling nature: external and internal. Do this either by work or=

worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of the=
se -
and be free."<br>
 <br>
Here are my 2 cents.<br>
 <br>
=
Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes=
 on
work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mast=
ery.
Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can p=
ick whatever
is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However, wi=
sdom, detached
action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mu=
tually exclusive.
As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, others =
will automatically
develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in &qu=
ot;Yoga" or
oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.<br=
>
 <br>
Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. I=
rrespective of
that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of huma=
nity. Even Ramakrishna
advised against it. Controlling body and mind and fo=
rcing the psychic life
force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and =
niyama and clean nadis. In
this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis =
accumulate great amounts of
obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. Th=
is is not just my view, but what
Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gos=
pel of Ramakrishna" (one of the
greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He dis=
couraged several of his sishyas from
pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vi=
vekananda, but did not encourage even him
to practice it.<br>
 <br>
Jn=
ana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the
d=
elusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not
sincere/honest/=
smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman.
I am B=
rahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion
any=
way" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces
=
duality in consciousness every instant. Kind of like declaring wisely in a
=
movie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in
=
every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty,=

sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path =
of
constant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick del=
usional
jump to the end.<br>
 <br>
IMHo, for most people in this age, =
Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most
suitable and safest.<br>
 <br>=
