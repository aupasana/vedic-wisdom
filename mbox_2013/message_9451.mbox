Very nice to see the Shanti Mantra being sent to the group. Peace is essent=
ial, the harbinger of greater good to societies in general, and our entire =
ecosystem in particular.

The great Vaasishta Muni advises Sri Rama in Mumo=
okshu Prakarana from YogaVaasishta. Among the four pillars for attaining Mo=
ksha (Liberation), The first is Shanti. 
The others being, Vichara, Santosh=
a and Saadhu Sangha..... 
May the Saadhu Sangha of Vedic Wisdom group enhan=
ce the ability to spread Shanti to its members

Om Shantih
