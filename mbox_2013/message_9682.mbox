Dear Sri Bhat,

> i need to know how to take the soil samples from the site and use it
during my regular homams


Sorry ... I have not come across any such instruction in the grihya sutras.
They do mention a very simple procedure for construction of a house.
Basically a few mantras are used to reslope the empty land, and water is
then sprinkled around the land. Then, at various points in the construction
of the house (when major weight-bearing beams are placed), a few mantras
are recited. Learned vaidikas will know the relevant mantras.

sasneham,

    ajit
