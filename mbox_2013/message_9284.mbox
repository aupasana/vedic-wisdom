Namaste Narasimha Ji and others.

I have been chanting mantras for many yea=
rs and I tend to think that different small mantras of the same Deity produ=
ces different kind of blessings.

As an example, for Lord Ganesha -

Om Gam=
 Ganapataye Namah
Om Shri Maha Ganapataye Namah
Om Ganeshaya Namah
Om Shri =
Ganeshaya Namah

These four mantras each of them give slightly different re=
sults. What is your guidance and opinion on the same and which mantra shoul=
d I choose? I read from your Homam manual that #1 mantra has been mentioned=
 there, but is there anything wrong in the other three?

I also have someth=
ing in my mind. I tend to think that mantras which are taken from the scrip=
tures "exactly as it is" are and work the best. As an example from Rudram c=
omes two mantras

1. Om Namo Bhagavate Rudraya
2. Om Namah Shivaya

That is=
 why we say "Om Namah Shivaya" and not "Om Shivaya Namah"... so am I right =
here that its the best to chant mantras as exactly taken from the scripture=
s (Without making any changes to them) and in that context what Ganesha man=
tra can I chant.

Thanks
Tanvir
