Psychiatric disorders & Ayurveda (Re: Kundalini syndrome)

=C2=A0 
Namaste,=

=C2=A0
Vaata, being a combination of air and ether, is an expansive state =
of being and can be ungrounding and destabilizing. Any big changes in lifes=
tyle or in one's body-mind complex can aggravate vaata in people of any dos=
ha type. If one is already prone to vaata dosha, then it can be even worse.=

=C2=A0<The use of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I'm=
 sure this does no good for vata.>

=C2=A0
Yes, it is a terrible idea. It n=
ot only aggravates vaata heavily, but increases ama (toxic buildup) in the =
system. Vaata is one big problem and ama is another, which mess up one's di=
gestion and kill appetite. Once the digestive fire becomes weak, system goe=
s haywire and all other problems arise. Vaata pacifying food and herbs in a=
ddition to a lifestyle that reduces toxic buildup may be helpful. Detoxific=
ation and things like panchakarma can be helpful. Simple habits like drinki=
ng hot Triphala tea every night can detoxify and make a big difference in o=
verall well-being.

=C2=A0
<Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmfu=
l in the kundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as "psych=
osis" and will advise anti-psychotics>
=C2=A0
Forget about one with Kundali=
ni experiences that one could not handle/digest and in trouble now. Even on=
e with normal psychotic issues may not be well served by the toxic combinat=
ions created by modern medicine, which I am afraid does not understand "min=
d" as well as Ayurveda did. IMHO, ayurveda has better tools to treat proble=
ms of the mind. While herbs like Jataamaamsi, Shankhapushpi, Aswagandha etc=
 can do a good job of addressing the root causes of the instability in the =
nervous system when administered properly, modern drugs only put "band-aids=
" on the symptoms arising from those root causes. One may do well to locate=
 a good ayurvedic doctor IMHO.

 all this is just a business deal. There is something you want and you ask =

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the h=

t wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience=
 of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have bee=
n involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontane=
ous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-=
body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian ori=
gin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she sea=
rched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically=
 wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to dera=
nged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as hav=
ing a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this h=
as triggered interest and
 research into this topic in mainstream psychiatr=
y. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western medicine=
, and as we have no treatments for deranged> kundalini, we struggle to help=
 them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with t=
his lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened=
. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the =
deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is somethi=
ng she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her p=
roblem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as =
the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, =
or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samarita=
ns among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of=
)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana=
 so as not to end
 up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the =
bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your ins=
trument" and leave the kundalini> rising bit to God's will. Om Dum Durgayai=

t; >>>>In Tantra, to focus on
 Kundalini, one needs a few thing=
s going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various =
elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this =
translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, co=
ntrol of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini aw=
akening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater =
force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes c=
are of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF=
 and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various=
 other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while s=
ome of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the indivi=
dual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character an=
d nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes ev=
en more<WBR>> vital. 4 - While
 someday or other every sadhaka will have=
 an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladie=
s of psychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by =
west today is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is a=
lso possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us fr=
om various subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities,=
 can get "ruptured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional =
lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities insi=
de the mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these=
 are very complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to=
 list down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly do=
ne, very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many wh=
o claim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent gu=
ess work.<WBR>>
 Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all =
these to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, a=
s the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards &nbs=

p; <WBR>> >>>>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundal=
ini syndrome based
 on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doin=
g a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someon=
e who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini=
 since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of e=
nergy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kunda=
lini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We hav=
e not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests norma=
l)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we c=
all mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwan=
ted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and resear=
ch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients a=
re not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments fo=
r deranged<WBR>> kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to =
forcibly
 waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my fe=
eling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to ki=
ll herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so ba=
d. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape fro=
m. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one =
was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve=
 the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength=
 to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for he=
r, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering reall=
y is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in =
this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safes=
t. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the ku=
ndalini<WBR>> rising bit to God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna
