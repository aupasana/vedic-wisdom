Dear Narasimha Ji,
	I was pondering over few things we routinely come acros=
s as a part of worship and how it manipulates karma pipe line,
(1) When som=
eone gives a `curse' or does a prayoga such as `maran' or `uchhatan' what h=
appens to a person who is at receiving end, does his bad karma comes forwar=
d or is it a new parabdha that is created. I vaguely remember Vimalananda m=
entioning something about a Saint's curse in Aghora trilogy.
(2) On similar=
 note, what happens when you get `blessings' say from a saint or elders? We=
 also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or =
say Shwetarka Ganapati =96 what do this items really do if they work? Somet=
hing similar with wearing gemstones for planets =96 do they bring forward g=
ood karmas or they create new ones?
(3) I recollect an episode from famous =
"Gurucharitra" (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cri=
ed out to Shri Guru "If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worship=
 God at all". At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but lat=
er tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next birth.=
 [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to rec=
ollect this episode from old memory]. So question I have is, does our sadha=
na change karmaphal to a great extent or it is just our perception that cha=
nges?
Thanking you,
Digamber
