  I have heard differ=
ent traditions pronounce this differently. There are several cases where th=
e anusvara (M) is pronounced differently before consonants. (other cases ty=
pically end up with the "gum" / "gush" type sounds).


  First, say "shaM y=
oH" normally a few times. Observe that to pronounce "M", you have to close =
the lips -- they will come in contact which each other. This is one way of =
pronouncing it. 


  In some traditions, when pronouncing the "M" before a =
"v" or "y" sound, they don't close the lips ... i.e. they stop just before =
the lips come into contact. ( to pronounce "ya" or "va", the lips cannot co=
me into contact. They stop pronouncing the "M" that precedes it at this "y"=
 or "v" position).


  If you pronounce "shaM yoH", and don't fully close t=
he lips when pronouncing "M", you'll end up with the other pronunciation th=
at you have heard.


  sasneham,


     ajit
