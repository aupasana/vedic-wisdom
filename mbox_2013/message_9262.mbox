Namaste Rakesh ji,

It's obvious that you are already spending considerable time on 
spiritual practices. If you add just 20 minutes in the morning and 
evening of a very simple but effective practice of  deep meditation like 
TM (Transcendental Meditation) it will transform your life, and improve 
your well being a lot!
You can download and read a free book about it here:
http://www.divshare.com/download/24013873-d27

Regards,

Marek

              Mahavidya means supreme wisdom. Mahavidyas are highly
              specific aspects of divine that give a sublime
              understanding of some aspect of Self, to take one closer
              to liberation. Going to them for relief from mundane
              problems is like going to Dalai Lama to complain about
              leaves coming into your lawn from a neighbor's house.
              After all, he may say "I am sorry for you" but not do
              anything about it. Go back to him when you are more
              interested in Dharma & Self!<br>

              any form and it will balance all aspects. you can use
              simple request at begning "i am dogin this for your
              pleasure and seeking ur blessings in all aspects of my
              life, please guide an help me fulfill all areas of my life
              (dharma, arth, kaam, moksha) and also make all planets
              favourable" - otherwise also diety does the same but
              saying it everytime will keep ones monkey mind cool.<br>

              bajarangbaan in 58 lines one, (was publised by chandi
              prakashan 16yrs back) with many stuti lines in between.
              there seems to be many short versions on net with no stuti

              light on reciting the Bajrang Baan daily? Are there any
              restrictions on reciting it? Specifically, are we
              forbidden from reciting it? Or, can we recite it along
              with the Hanuman Chalisa, Sankatmochan Hanumanashtaka, and
              lastly the Sri Raama Stuti?<br>
