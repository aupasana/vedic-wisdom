Namaste to All,

Narasimha-ji - Dhanyavad for excellent explanation. I wond=
er, how many people can really explain it so well.

Sanjay-ji - Thanks to y=
ou also!

Another related question - The longer sukta is also known as Panc=
h Sukta Pavaman. Why "Panch Sukta"?

Also - is it usually for Abhishek of S=
hri Datt and/or Shri Vishnu?

regards,

Jagmohan

 Dayananda Saraswati of Arya Samaj said in his Hindi commentary (http://www=
.aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/rugveda.htm) that these hymns are for "so=
umya svabhAv paramAtmA", i.e. gentle natured supreme Lord. That is a far be=

interpretation would be that these hymns are for the purificatory aspects o=

 it gives bliss, nourishes and purifies one. THAT process is described in d=
