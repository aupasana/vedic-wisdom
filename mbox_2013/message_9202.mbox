namaste,

The shashtyabdapurti is an optional "sakaama shanti-karma". There is
absolutely no requirement to perform this ritual.

The Indian cycle of time repeats at 60 years. After 60 years, we have
experienced the 30 tithis in the 12 months in each of the 60 years. And,
the next cycle of 60 years is about to start. At this juncture, this ayus
shanti karma is performed.

There is a tradition of doing a "mini-marriage" as part of this ritual,
though it is not a full-blown marriage. At the end of the ritual, there is
an exchange of garlands, and the tying the mangalya sutra. Remember that
neither of these (including the mangalya sutra dharana) is a part of the
core vedic ritual.

Doing a simple satyanarayana puja and mrityunjaya homa is a reasonable
substitue for the shastyabdapurti.

Dear learned members<br>
<br>
Is the age 60 not closer to va=

Why not initiate the man (aged 60) and the woman (often a few years younger=
) into vaanaprastha?<br>
<br>
But in the traditional sense, how can couples=
 living in the West celebrate this occasion? What is one can't find a p=
riest? Does one do ayushya homam for oneself, the way one does Ganapathi ho=
mam?<br>
<br>
Where would I find the requisite procedures for ayushya homam=
?<br>
<br>
Please help.<br>
