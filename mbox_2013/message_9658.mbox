Another quick way to get protection from entities is to meditate onto a dei=
ty before going a sleep. What I'm doing is looking at Lord Shiva's picture =
and chanting Om Namah Shivaya before going to sleep. The last thought befor=
e I go to sleep should be of Lord Shiva. The key is to raise your vibration=
s to a high level so that the beings won't disturb you.
I'm pretty sure tha=
t meditating on any other god will also work just fine.
