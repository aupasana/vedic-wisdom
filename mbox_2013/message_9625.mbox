If they can and are willing, have them plan a visit to the Isha Yoga Ashram=
, Coimbatore. They should send in the details of the case a priori so that =
the trip can be scheduled according to the instructions they receive. If th=
e situation is bad and they cannot even think of making an out of the count=
ry trip, please contact the Isha Institute of Inner Sciences, McMinnville, =
TN and schedule to meet Sadhguru when he visits the US this fall/winter.

If the person who is 'being possessed' is able to l=
earn to chant 'anjaneya dandakam' fluently with correct pronunciation it ca=
n help. He/she should chant this repeatedly each time they suspect that suc=
h external intervention/control may happen. The sounds, meter and the deity=
 associated with this particular chant doesn't allow the external spirits t=
o gain control over the person repeating it. Tongue is an important organ w=
hen such spirits try to assume control and a suitably calibrated tongue twi=
ster like the 'anjaneya dandakam' can help if the fluency, pronunciation an=
d intensity can be maintained. This 'chanting' suggestion is based on what =
I gathered via hearsay in yoga and mantra circuits.
