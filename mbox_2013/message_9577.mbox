Dear Friends,

I want to mention one incidence with me. Two months back I posted in this
group about reciting Dhoomavati Kavacham. And the learned people warned me
against doing it without initiation.

BUT, I did it once normally like other mantras. On the same day, I had
quarrel with my colleagues/partners. The next day I had quarrel with my
neighbors over parking space.

I will not discuss astrology here. But astrologically I found that Ketu is
causing these troubles to me.

I could relate dhoomavati recitation with these incidences as she is
related to Ketu.

I guess I should not have done the recitation. Even though I had no
materialistic purpose.

Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
