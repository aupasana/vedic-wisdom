Chanting shall help, it shall make you stronger. Protect you from aagaami k=
arma.
Difficulties are to cleanse our praarabdha, even great people like Ra=
mana and sai baba accepted their prarabdha.
Chanting,  like gayatri,navaarn=
a mantra etc. when properly practised(sadhana, anushtaan)shall cleanse one =
of all the karma, good or bad, as specified by our great gurus and rishis. =
Also they give the strength to over come our praarabdha. Even god is bound =
to his own rules.

And the first step to overcome a worry(a problem which i=
s out of our hands), is to forget about it. Often worries lead to realisati=
on.

Wishing you the best. Chant with passion towards the deity, 
as a guid=
e, mother or companion, to lead you out of this bhavasaagar also, not only =
your present difficulty.(sa-kaama and nishkaama)
I commiserate with you, i =
am jobless since nov 2008. I am helping others by whatever i can, somehow g=
od is sustaining me,providence, till i get an interview call, or proper opp=
ortunity.

Regards,

Vasant
