namaste,

There have a been a lot of replies to this question. I wanted to share a
suggestion that works along with any of these.

In all vaidika karmas, there is a procedure called "pratisara-bandha". This
is a raksha bandhana where a cotton thread (optimally made of 9 strands) is
energized with mantras and then worn around the wrist so that a little of
the mantra shakti stays with you. A kalasha is established, with some
vibhuti and a cotton thread placed to it's north. Then, Varuna is invoked
in the kalasha, and then a number of vedic mantras are recited. At the end,
we pray to Varuna once again, and then sprinkle the water from the kalasha
on the yajamana and the cotton thread. The cotton thread is then worn on
the wrist (right hand for men, left hand for women) as an amulet, and the
vibhuti is worn on the forehead.

The vaidika procedure specifies particular sets of mantras. In the
bodhayana tradition, this starts with the rAkshoghnam (something to destroy
rAkshasas). However, you may use some other mantra in it's place. If you
are using the hanuman chalisa, as Narasimha suggested, you can chant that
mantra a number of times, and then wear the thread and vibhuti. Or, you
could follow the Satayanarayana puja manual with the cotton thread and
vibhuti near by, and then sprinkle the thread with water and then wear it
and the vibhuti. You could even put a pot of water, think of Varuna, then
do a bunch of bhajans, and then wear the thread and sprinkle the water on
the area where you will be sleeping. The principle is the same.

The procedure for "pratisarabandha" specifically mentions disturbed sleep
as an application.

sasneham,

    ajit

Recently I =

Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing=

On the l=

<br>
Is there any mantra that will p=
rotect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? Something that I can ch=
ant before going to sleep. This has been bothering me for some time now and=
 it interferes with my life.<br>

Thank you in advance!<br>
