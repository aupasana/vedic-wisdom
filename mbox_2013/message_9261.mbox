Namaste
Apart from those prescribed by you there remedies available in Rama=
yanam
where reading certain portion gives immense relief. Another way is to=
 stay
at Kalahasti one night where rishis in the past have kept one yantra =
which
acts on the human beings when they are in deep sleep. This particular=
 yantra
is to mitigate the bad events of Raghu &Ketu. I have heard that KUK=
KE
Subramanya at Karnataka also has got similar powers.

 If you like Mother, worship Ma Durga with her 108 name prayer or Durga
Soo=
ktam or simple mantra "om dum durgAyai namaH". If you like Vishnu,
worship =
Balaji with any prayer or simple 8-akshari (om namo venkateshAya) or
12-aks=
hari (om namo bhagavate venkateshAya). If you like Shiva, worship
Nageshwar=
a with any prayer or simple "om namashshivAya namo nAgeshvarAya".

Are ther=
e any restrictions on reciting it? Specifically, are we forbidden
from reci=
ting it? Or, can we recite it along with the Hanuman Chalisa,
Sankatmochan =
Hanumanashtaka, and lastly the Sri Raama Stuti?
