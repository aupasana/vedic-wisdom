Dear Krishnan Sir,

Thanks for the detailed information. Yes, I meant Varah=
 Kavacham. For me,
the only purpose of reciting VS and Varah Kavacham is sp=
iritual progress. I
typically do Varah Kavacham first, then Vishnu sahsrana=
m and then 108 names
of Narayan. Is it right order or should I do it with 1=
08 names of Narayan
in the beginning ?

Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
