[vedic-wisdom] "Benefits" of a homam/japam going to Indra (Re: Homam proced=
ure)
 


=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
Here are my 2 cents.

=C2=A0
Puranic s=
tories are symbolic/metaphorical representations of subtle inner truths. Ta=
king them at face value is not useful. One needs to understand the subtle i=
nner meanings and "digest" them in in one's attitude.
=C2=A0
The word indri=
ya (sense) comes from Indra. Whatever we perceive through the senses falls =
under the dominion of Indra. After all, Lord Indra personifies the enjoymen=
t of sense objects within each being! If I see something and think "this is=
 so beautiful" or "this is so disgusting", the thought and its fruit fall u=
nder the dominion of Indra.
=C2=A0
Now, when one does japam or some other s=
piritual practice, one is supposed to focus the attention so much on the de=
ity/mantra that senses are shut down nearly completely (operational just en=
ough to enable the practice). If one is having other thoughts related to se=
nse objects while doing sadhana, the fruits, my friend, will obviously go t=
o Indra, who personifies the enjoyment of sense objects!!!
=C2=A0
Now, you =
don't have to really physically get up from your aasana (seat or rather pos=
ture) and go somewhere. Even your mind getting up from its stable *posture*=
 and going somewhere is enough for the fruits of your sadhana to be diverte=
d!
=C2=A0
Water is symblic of actions (the Vedic word "ap" means both water=
 and work). Ring finger stands for dharma (little finger - kaama, middle fi=
nger - artha, index finger - moksha). Touching water under aasana with midd=
le finger and applying on the third eye symbolizes basing one's focus on so=
me sense of purpose and have a clear vision of dharmik actions towards that=
 sense of purpose.
=C2=A0
The idea of this story is to remind us that we ne=
ed firmness and focus of mind and body and control the senses. When senses =
are in contact with their objects, we should have a clear vision of our sen=
se of purpose and dharma, so that we are not deluded by sense objects and f=
ocus on our dharmik actions. Otherwise, our efforts will be wasted in the e=
njoyment of sense objects.

=C2=A0
Of course, if one wants, one can follow =
the instructions in this story literally. Especially if one has this guilty=
 feeling that one is doing something wrong, that will be counter-productive=
. After all, rituals are mind games and you want to create a desired state =
of mind by manipulating surroundings and cajoling mind to behave in a way. =
It is better to just do whatever it takes to remove that guilty feeling. Bu=
t, IMHO, it is far more important in the long run to understand the inner m=
eaning and "digest" it in one's *attitude*.

=C2=A0Best regards,

Narasimha=

van, Shradha or any rites, if the person stands up from his asana/mat and l=
eave. Then the fruit or benefit of that ritual or undertaking will go to Lo=
rd Indra.<br>
> But if the person or devotee puts a drop or two of water=
 underneath the asana/mat and touch this water, with his ring finger puts a=
 tilak or puts a dot of that water on his forehead or between the eyebrows,=
 the benefit or fruit of that particular ritual, sadhana or devotion will r=
emain with the devotee. Lord Indra will not be able to snatch the fruit of =
that devotion.<br>
> This simple act keeps the fruit of your devotion wi=
th you! No one can snatch the benefit from you, not even Lord Indra.<br>
&g=
t; That's why many a times, I have been asked why is that one is praying to=
 God for so long with no benefit or fruit of that devotion. Why God is not =
listening? Well, when I explain the above story to them, it raises their ey=
ebrows. When they adopt this simple act, they start seeing results! The ben=
efit or fruit of their devotion remain with them, forever!<br>
