The good thing about spiritual rising is that whenever somebody hits you or
scolds you, you may tend to believe it could have been because some bad
karma in current life or past life. And If somebody else hit back him on
your behalf, you tend to believe, God has meant it to happen through him.
We basically dissociate the doer-ship from person and attribute it to past
Karma or God's wish.

In this philosophy, How does one recognize what needs to be done by him ?
Or Alternatively what does God wants him to do ?
