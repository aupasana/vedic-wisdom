Namaste dear members,

Two years ago, I came across Shri Narasimhaji's webs=
ite and was excited to discover the procedure for doing homams by yourself.=
 However, I felt quite intimidated, so I did not act upon them. Lately, I k=
ept coming back to the site and decided to take it step by step to gain con=
fidence, so I have started reading the text of Shri Maha Ganapathi homam ti=
ll the word flow is fluent. I'm less intimidated by it now. I'm also quite =
grateful to Shri Narasimhaji for making it available as I have been wanting=
 to do this for a long time. But am still not ready to start it. The reason=
 is that certain words are so long that, to maintain a flow, I need to spli=
t the word into bits that will help maintain the flow but need to know wher=
e to split in order that I don't change the meaning of it. I'm following th=
e Sanskrit version. I want to include the words (a long list) in the hope t=
hat one of you members can help me split them up in the right way, but my c=
omputer does not type the sanskrit words, nor am I able to copy and paste t=
he sanskrit word, it does not do allow it. How can I upload those words?

T=
hanks very much,

Alamelu
