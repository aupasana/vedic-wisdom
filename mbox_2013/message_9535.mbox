Namaste to all
These kind of Upadesa can not come ordinarily. Whoever reads=
 this should practice this attitude since it is akin to Uddhava Gita told t=
o Uddhava by Sri Krishna.

Namaste Durg=
esh,
 
There is no single answer. We are always pulled in different directi=
ons by different rinas and dharmas. One needs to JUDGE which dharma is high=
er and which rina is more important.

 
Depending on one's individual circu=
mstances, one of the following may be the best option:
 
(1) Ignore the com=
plaining wife/husband. Don't fight or argue, but keep doing your sadhana. A=
s time progresses, (a) she may see the positive change in your attitude and=
 stop complaining, (b) she may just get used to it and accept her fate, (c)=
 she may keep complaining and YOU may get used to that complaints and accep=
t your fate.
 
(2) Talk to her/him and find some compromise that is accepta=
ble. Instead of doing 1 hour sadhana, may be do half hour and spend more ti=
me doing something she likes.
 
(3) Give up your idea of sadhana and take w=
hatever you are able to do, as sanctioned by your wife/husband, as your sad=
hana. For example, cooking, cleaning dishes, washing clothes, taking her to=
 a movie, massaging her feet, taking kids to activities etc can also be sad=
hanas.
 
Any activity can be done with a protesting/dissenting attitude or =
an agitated mind, or with love and caring and a calm and composed mind. Eve=
ry activity involves interacting with some objects. Just as god is in idol =
and fire, he is in vegetables you cut, food you cook, feet you massage etc.=
 If you see an action as a chore or look at it or its object(s) with an imp=
ure mind (e.g. with lust or with anger or with frustration) or focus more o=
f your attention on yourself, then it becomes impure. If you approach the a=
ction with a calm and devoted mind, see the action and its object(s) with l=
ove, devotion and caring and focus the more of your attention on the action=
 and its objects (rather than youself and your own happiness), then it beco=
mes a ritual or sadhana.
 
Of course, in some actions one hates, it is very=
 difficult to bring that calmness and caring. In some other actions (e.g. s=
ex), one may become too selfish or self-absorbed and think too much about o=
ne's own sensations, to look at the action and other persons/objects with l=
ove, caring, devotion.

 
Thus, we normally don't talk about converting all=
 actions into sadhana and talk about japam, homam etc. It is easier in thos=
e to look at the action and its objects with a sense of purity and devotion=
. However, if that is not possible and one has to do some other actions, wh=
y note TRY to convert them into sadhana? Try to perform the action with a c=
alm, stable, selfless mind, focus attention on the action and its objects a=
nd imbibe love and caring into your thinking.
 
*        *        *
 
In fa=
ct, at some stage, (3) has to become part of one's sadhana. One has to conv=
ert every action into a sadhana. Just doing japam or homam for an hour or t=
wo may not cut it.
 
If you live in a really cold country, your room can ge=
t very cold. If you turn the heater on for an hour everyday and keep it off=
 rest of the time, the room will overall be very cold. Similarly, if you do=
 sadhana for an hour, you may feel better, but the normal attitude returns.=
 To make permanent progress, the heater has to be on most of the day! Of co=
urse, as you cannot do japam or homam for 12 hours a day, you have to conve=
rt whatever you do (eating, driving to work, your work, driving back, cooki=
ng, eating, talking to people, etc) into sadhana. At some stage, every seek=
er will have to start doing it.

 
Best regards,
Narasimha
