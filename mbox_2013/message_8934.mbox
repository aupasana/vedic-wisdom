Namaste all, 

Thankyou PVR ji for sharing all the specific mantras.

my 2 =
cents and please feel free to correct me if i am wrong.

One God manifests =
as different deities with different attributes and characters. In the very =
same way each specialized form of diety himself has his own characteristics=
 and temperament (from benovelent to playful to xxxxx ). This holds true fo=
r ganapati also.

It might be far far more better to stick to Mahaganapati =
and do a homam to him with his simple mantra for HIS pleasure (not urs), an=
d AFTER homam (before saying goodby) ask for his grace, love, his help to s=
olve whatever ur problems.

Its my experience that complicated mantra with =
specific purpose tend to be "driven by" and "invoke" a specific want in our=
 greedy nature, rather than having love, surrender and joy for diety. 

reg=
ards...
