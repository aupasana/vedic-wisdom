Namaste Sir,
=A0
I think it is a great idea. Good luck to anyone who create=
s such a site in any city!
=A0
Any public (or sometimes even private) place=
 where sadhana is done will eventually attract people of all kinds. I think=
 that's ok, as long as one does sadhana sincerely and does not consciously =
work hard to attract big crowds.
=A0
My only 2 cents is that the focus of s=
uch sites should entirely be on Fire. If a specific person associated with =
a site is revered by people, it is human tendency to idolize that person an=
d have some activities centered around that idolization. Leaving such thing=
s and personalities aside and just focusing on Fire as the guru and protect=
or, will serve well.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
