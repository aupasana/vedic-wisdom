So, help me understand this theory.

I am going through a very tough time. =
The mental torture has become so severe that death seems to be a blessings.=
 

As per the theory, my suffering is caused by my own karma. Perhaps, the =
karma from my previous life. I prayed to God. I chanted mantra. Nothing see=
ms to be working. 

If my destiny is to suffer, why should i pray to God? A=
nd if i am being punished for some kind of bad karma from the past, why am =
i not aware of it? 

It is like getting punishment without knowing your bad=
 deeds. 

If the theory of karma is right, It is so illogical and so cruel =
to God for punishing me or people like me without telling the bad things do=
ne in the past.

Please correct me if i am wrong. 

Thanks.

It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. Every action =
by one, or even people around one, has the potential to re-arrange one's ka=
rmik pools. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma th=
