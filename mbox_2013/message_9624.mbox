Namaste - When the Vrindavan Iskcon temple was built and the deities instal=
led, Srila Prabhupada mentioned to his students / disciples; now see God fa=
ce-to-face.

One more awesome quote...

"a maha-bhagavata, a highly elevate=
d pure devotee, sees the Lord everywhere, as well as within the heart of ev=
eryone. This is possible for devotees who have developed elevated devotiona=
l service to the Lord."

Srila Prabhupada always talked of spiritualizing s=
enses and the body to see and be with Lord every moment, anywhere whether i=
n the material world or spiritual by devotional service (note the service, =
not just devotion). He was the only one who called bhakti as devotional ser=
vice than just devotion. People who find meanings changed in his translatio=
ns miss his purport.

You have taken examples of Dhruv maharaj and Sri Prah=
lad maharaj; Prabhupada always mentioned if you want to be like them surren=
der to Krsna and do everything for Krsna and not for sense gratification.
