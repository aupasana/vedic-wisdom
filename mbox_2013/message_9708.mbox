Dear All Respected Members,

Please accept my humble Pranaam.

 

1.       I am undergoing an indecisiveness which I am unable to resolve on
my own. I request noble members to please share their kind wisdom and
guidance in this regard. I will be very grateful for this please.

2.       I have a student whom I teach as my child almost like a Gurukula.
The student is unable to concentrate. To enable concentration, I made a
rudraksha maala of 5 beads consisting of 4 mukha, 5 mukha and 6 mukha,
called as Saraswati Rudraksha combination.(two 4 mukha, two 6 mukha, and one
5 mukha).

3.       Now, the school authorities are not allowing her to wear rudraksha.
If she wears it on neck, it is easily detectable.

4.       My humble query towards all noble members is, is there any other
place like feet etc where we can tie the rudraksha maala, so that it
contacts the skin, and yet remain invisible to these secular school
authorities. Invisibility is the criteria. Tying on arm will not work
because she wears half shirt. Does wearing rudraaksha on feet amount to
insult? Is contact on skin an essential criteria? Suppose if she keeps it in
her bag, will it still do? I personally believe that contact with skin is
important. I have the only option of tying it on her feet, but just thought
to have your wise opinion before proceeding, as I feel indecisive. Please
share your kind wisdom and guidance. I will be very obliged. Also it will be
a blessing for the child who is appearing her 12th this year. 

 

Thanks and Warm Regards,

Kannan
