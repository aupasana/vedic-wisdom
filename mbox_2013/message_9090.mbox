Dear Bhupendra and everyone else,

Namaste.

"Shout out to Mr Mahaganpathi"=

Play this in another tab ( no issues, if you don't understand one bit,
joi=
n my boat)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DISik_cjsmJA

After reading ever=
ything in the past two weeks, I sense there is one
thing that comes up time=
 and again, be it with kundalini Syndrome, or be
it with sadhana, or be it =
with Karma's or whatever. The thing is that
please understand, the differen=
ce between your surface personality and
your true self( which you realize e=
ventually by penance).

Sadhana is basically a process in which you/deity k=
ill your"self". Let
us say that you are
"Puneet/Nikhil/Gaurav/Chetna/Savitr=
i/Mark/Andrew/John/Ali". You see, all
ahutis in the homam are actually mean=
t to be sacrifice of parts of this
personality and eventually the whole per=
sonality in the purna -ahuti
where in you sacrifice your entire self to the=
 deity in the fire.
Actually the purna- ahuti is your funeral, if you are a=
ble to look at it
in that manner.

Please understand that all joys and sorr=
ows are limited to your own
false self. What you think is the best for your=
self ,actually is more
often than not that good. It might be good for your =
limited self, but
mind you , it isn't good for "you". And to tell you very =
honestly, god
doesn't really care much for your limited self and its endles=
s desires,
wants, desires. Mr god wants you to be out of this convoluted me=
ss, and
be back with him/her/it ASAP and the only way you are coming back i=
s
when the false self is completely free.

Now how is that? You pay off Kar=
ma's. Now how the hell do you that? You
suffer and stay silent. You do not =
make a cry and hue about it and
continuously chant. Crying and shouting act=
ually makes god sentimental
and you extract out some stuff, maybe in the sh=
ort run, but it will
screw the "real you" in the long run.

Please understa=
nd, none can escape suffering, for it is the only way you
can pay back. You=
 have to pay. When suffering, continuously remind
yourself of your own conf=
usion as to who you are and keep doing simple
penance. The navagraha's and =
especially my beloved Mr Saturn are only
doing their duty to get you back o=
n track. Their duty is to break your
shackles, now whether they decide to d=
o it by breaking your back, well,
it is their will.

When Mr Ram, Arjun, Ka=
rna, couldn't escape, who the hell are we guys
exactly?

And what actually =
is suffering?
basic lack of acceptance of your own destiny and fate. Suffer=
ing is
attributed to a sense of " Why ME?" and "why not ME?", " why MY thin=
gs
were taken" and " Why I don't have these things"

Kundalini shundalini i=
s all too far away for 95 out of 100 of us. Let's
leave those, because unle=
ss you experience it yourself , you are bound
to confuse yourself and attri=
bute mundane things to experiences to
people who are now progressed and thu=
s digging yourself into a bigger
hole. Apart from one book here and there, =
you won't know who is saying
what. And who do you trust, the author is huma=
n after all.

"You" will have to die, no matter what if you ever hope to re=
ach god.
How do you die?
When your supposed joys and things are taken from =
you, do you ever look
at god, and cry back. That is merely the beginning. B=
ecause without
these things taken from you , you will never ever look at go=
d, unless
you are some hi-fi being from your previous birth. once you look =
and
understand the purpose behind it all, your cries will stop, and you wil=
l
actually be able to laugh at your own silliness in the beginning. Homam
a=
ccelerates this progress.

Here are some wise words from Mr Nanak ------
"I=
f you have to reach heaven, you have to die"
or
"Everyone wants heaven, nob=
ody wants to die"

I think then there was this another point of doing homam=
 on somebody''s
half. Here is a true story, once a girl who was facing incr=
emental
difficulty in getting married to the boy of her dreams due to her
p=
arents rejection, requested another woman who regularly does homam to
do so=
mething. Hearing her story, the homam waali woman , decided to do a
homam o=
n the girl's behalf. here is what was said to god when he was
present in th=
e fire.

" Dear God, I dedicate this one to the girl who suffers. I can't s=
ee her
getting beat by her parents and her lying in torment due to such and=

such problem. eventually she is you only, why do you make yourself
suffer =
so much? If the marriage is ordained for her, remove obstacles,
and get her=
 married, and if it is not ordained, break her ties off with
the boy and ge=
t her parents to send her off wherever you deem fit. Don't
satiate the desi=
res of the personality, do what is best for the being
powering the personal=
ity and if that best is that she is not with the
boy of her dreams, so be i=
t. but stop suffering through her"

The next week, all her ties with the bo=
y were severed, she got engaged
to someone else, and is married now.
What i=
s the lesson??
The girl was wanting based on her own belief that she wants =
this and
that, but the homam waali woman was little more surrender -ful to =
god
and left the whole scenario. The whole damn point of any penance is end=

of your constant belief and desires based on your own limited self. And
if=
 you keep on harping, well it defeats the purpose.

Regarding the lower eth=
ereal beings being easily satiated and giving you
what you want=85=85
Have =
you seriously considered the price you will pay??
This time around mr Bhupe=
ndra Janmadas may get some money or the job,
but next time lets say your ar=
e born as maithali gupta , the price you
will have to pay will be too immen=
se.
Then you will ask "why me?" and again start the whole process, thus
sli=
ding further and further.
Don't go down those routes, this is not a one bir=
th game, you won't be
dead, no matter how many personalities you may shed a=
nd die in, you will
still be there and boy you will pay.

And the fees of t=
he ethereal beings? I can't shake my head enough.
Lets skip ethereal beings=
 , access to them is anyways blocked for 99 out
100 for us.

Aap ke toh naa=
m mein hi sir, janmadas hai, janmo ke das, aap sarne ke
liye aaye hain, sar=
 li jiye, jab achha hona hoga, ho jayega, if you
think you can force a chan=
ge, forget it.

Aur aapki saran is only limited to bhupinder, yeh bechara t=
oh kabhi bhi
mar jaayega, jald hi naak mein rui aur muh mein ghee, aur para=
 hoga jal
raha hoga, lekin tum reh jaaoge.

Keep doing your homams, they wi=
ll help "you", trust god on this.

Regarding the prarbadha karma's, sanchit=
 karma's and everything else,
you will end up confusing yourself, seriously=
, it is a mess to
understand without penance and a deity or a deity like gu=
ru. Everybody
is trying to calculate based on whatever information about th=
e system
they have. Here is a fun fact:  _-------->>>>>>
YOU CAN'T CALCULAT=
E.

This system is too layered, too complex, and without you in touch with
=
an advance being and god, forget it. Forget all of this. Focus on god as
mu=
ch as one can. And please let go of this expectation that worshipping
god c=
an get you the monies, the comforts. If actual progress is there,
quite the=
 opposite is going to happen in most cases, but there is no
formula and qui=
te a lot of good can happen.
It just depends on what god decides. If you ar=
e meant to enjoy, you
will, if no oh well, that too.

Dekho bhaiyon aur beh=
eno, pichle janmon ka ab toh kuch nahin kar sakte
woh kaand to ho gaye, ab =
iss baar sambhal jaao, aur bhagwan ki taraf
rukh karlo, is baar mauka hai, =
nahin toh next time around again the same
routine ------
born crying
suckin=
g on breast
playing with toy
hitting puberty
going mad with lust
career iss=
ues
job issues
health issues
wife
child
children
Heart attack
PHAT!

and ag=
ain crying without a body what did i do , what did i do, making
the pledge =
in the womb, that god i'll worship you and coming out then
forgetting every=
thing. The circle won't end. It just won't end.

And do it not for exiting,=
 do it for the love of god. Develop this love,
how can you then afford to s=
tay away from your lover.

If the lover/owner of your "self" decides that y=
ou so "suffer" so that
you can visit him/her, oh well then Suffer.

Your su=
ffering is actually false, stop crying "me, me, me, me , why me
etc" and yo=
u will likely move to where you are trying to be sent.
Continue with this r=
adio, you are digging yourself a grave. You wont
shutup in a day, it will t=
ake years, so let it, but develop it.


Jai Shree Ram! Jai Shree Radheya!
H=
ar lo Mahadev
(P.S. - rough translation - loot lo mahadev, loot lo in yaado=
n ko ki
"main" yeh tha/thi, sab khatam only mahadev left, yay!!)
