=C2=A0 
does anyone know...who what and why we are her???.....so far I=
 guess most of us are going with the idea that some kind of primordial cons=
ciousness expressed duality....and projected ...created...or manifested wha=
t we know of as reality....and we presume a spark of it is us...so to speak=
....and it goes through a long process to merge back with the whole...and i=
ts like the journey never took place.....call it the cosmic dream if u will=
...

so we conceive of duality as shiva and or sakthi..or yin and yang if u=
 will....and at a certain moment in our existence...we feel some kind of ur=
ge to transcend.....and we try all methods to get there....

now all I know=
 is.....something exists...I cant say within or without me...I don't know e=
ven what me denotes..there is a body....and what could be labelled a mind..=
..something that proceses thoughts and emotions...but all if it is running =
bye itself....there doesn't seem to be an entity or what not in charge.....=
observe closely and u will get what I,m saying.......

now I guess the ques=
tion is...what is the gist of this so called spiritual path???......could i=
t not be that like snowflakes of nature...each one of us is no more than a =
momentary expression of consciousness?....why do we assume reincarnation to=
 be true???

to whom do we worship???and what exactly does worship mean???a=
nd who is doing the worship?.....

repeating some mystical mantra or name o=
f something that obviously cant be encapsulated in sound is considered by m=
any to be spirituality..when obviously the mind that is repeating and runni=
ng around at the same time is both one and the same...the whole process see=
ms to me like a mind game....and we feel good about theses games....like we=
 have done something to get 1 step closer to divinity..can we get closer???=
?isn't the cesspool of sludge we make in the morning just as divine....and =
all the time in the colon with us???....those who get the last statement wo=
uld get it...the rest plse ignore...

and how come we have this idea that b=
y japa,ing a gazillion times some sari clad woman on a tiger is going to ap=
pear in a vision or in front of us and make our existence free of suffering=
..and basically make everything O.K.?....

too many tamil movies perhaps?..=
.u can also substitute the sari clad woman for a man in blue with 4 arms...=
or a young stud on a peacock...ur preference....

and all for what?most of =
us are truly at the end of the day motivated by some kind of gain...touch u=
r heart and tell me it is not so???no carrot in front of the donkey it wont=
 move......

tell me honestly....how can u have love for something u don't =
know and have not experienced in any way???your bakthi is probably somethin=
g u conjured up in ur head....and at best....an expression of ur existantia=
l longings....

we are all lonely and miserable at heart....and add to that=
 the suffering of being human.....

so shall end this rant...with the quest=
ion I began with....what the f is going on guys???who what and where r we??=
??????????????????????????????????that is the question isn't it....and mayb=
e also why......the day we stop asking,and accept someone elses idea as tru=
th.....we stopped seeking.

the search isn't over till the fat cosmic lady =
sings........god bless.......whatever that means..............
