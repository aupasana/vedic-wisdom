=C2=A0Namaste,

<<Any activity can be done with a protesting/dissenting a=
ttitude or an 
agitated mind, or with love and caring and a calm and compos=
ed mind.>>

Something similar was said by Sri Aurobindoin a letter to a dev=
otee who asked him about human relationships. Quoting below. Prophetic and =
insightful words.



Question: Why do human  beings hurt each other? How do=
 we get rid of all our previous (and  future) hurts? How do we prevent furt=
her hurts (to ourselves and  others)? 



"Your question raises  a very imp=
ortant issue of the basis of human relationship. Human  relationship is so =
much full of quarrels, misunderstandings and  hurts because it is based upo=
n selfishness and centered on the fulfillment  of desires. Human love burns=
 low and is so full of smoke because  it is a flame of the ego, which is ev=
er engaged in eating up the  fuel that feeds it. It thrives upon return of =
some kind or the other  and when the need is not satisfied or the return di=
minishes, human  love tends to die or exists merely as a habitual remnant o=
f the  past or a duty to be fulfilled, as a social or religious obligation.=
  Love and selfishness are by their nature self-contradictory movements  an=
d therefore cannot co-exist. But true love is extremely rare.  Normally wha=
t passes off in its name is a strange mixture of greed  and lust applied at=
 the emotional level. Yet while none of us are  able to love truly we expec=
t the other person to truly love
 and  understand. This is a fundamental er=
ror because the ego-bound consciousness  of human beings cannot love truly =
since it dwells so much on division  rather than identity and oneness, whic=
h is what love seeks.
Relationships and 
              Expectations

Anothe=
r problem  in a relationship arises because of wrong expectations. So long =
 as there are expectations there will always remain a vulnerability  to get=
 hurt and hurt others. These expectations exist because we  all make the fu=
ndamental error of believing that others think and  feel the same way as we=
 do. In reality each one of us is different  despite certain commonality. H=
owever we should avoid the error of believing  that anyone else would think=
 and feel like us and therefore understand  us.=C2=A0 Thus before rushing t=
o react one  can see how a particular reaction will help or hinder the cent=
ral  aim of one's life. 


This is not to say that  relationships that last=
 and appear happy and smooth are free of  expectations. Many relationships =
last out of habit or mutual dependence,  others stick along due to social o=
r moral reasons as a duty and  a ritual even when the flame of love has bec=
ome tepid. Still others  curiously last despite quarrels and heartburns bec=
ause of a peculiar  need in the human vital for drama and its love for trag=
edy, as if  the drama could not endure without the exchange of these strong=
  emotions. Still others  curiously last despite quarrels and heartburns be=
cause of a peculiar  need in the human vital for drama and its love for tra=
gedy, as if  the drama could not endure without the exchange of these stron=
g  emotions. Unfortunately the vital of most human beings needs the  food o=
f anger etc to thrive. If one knows how to cut off the supply  of this fuel=
 then much can change for better. To respond to anger  with anger is like g=
etting caught up in
 the same hole as the other  person. Anger helps none b=
ut injures both. When the other partner  is angry it is better to detach on=
eself or simply walk away from  the scene or (if possible) remember that th=
is is not the total person  but only a part of him/her. After all none of u=
s is made up of one  piece and many factors could be operating in any given=
 relationship.

Even if everything was going smooth, it is unfortunately th=
e  very nature of the restless human vital to get easily dis-satisfied  wit=
h one's established position and turn towards other seemingly  greener past=
ures only to be frustrated again. For, ultimately the  source of happiness =
and fulfillment lies within and not outside  us. It lies in discovering tha=
t part or entity in us that can love  truly; give truly and thereby fulfill=
 us truly. For, in the end we  realize that the love that makes us happy is=
 not the love we receive  but the love we give. But most of our time and en=
ergy is spent in  observing what we have not received from others. We seldo=
m pause  to consider what we have given to this world and others. This gene=
rosity  of the mind and heart becomes possible only when we have discovered=
  the source of love that lies within us, our true soul.


The true and las=
ting  Solution

To discover this secret  soul in us is therefore the one tr=
ue and lasting remedy against  all previous and future hurts. The ego sense=
 in us takes a strange  pleasure in dwelling upon the real and unreal defec=
ts of others.  We see things and often attribute motives, which are not the=
re leading  to avoidable hurt and pain. The closer we get to our true soul =
and  allow our emotional nature to be governed by it, the sooner we develop=
  a more generous and luminous understanding of others. True, we cannot  un=
do the past, but we can always understand it in a truer light.  As we grow =
in our consciousness we naturally begin to be more forebearing  and truly f=
orgiving of others since we see that all of us are what  we are because of =
the unique constitution of our human nature. We  also begin to be more tole=
rant of the folly of others since we have  sincerely struggled within ourse=
lves and know what it means to try  to change oneself. And since we cannot =
really
 change another human  being we begin to work upon ourselves to make=
 ourselves immune to  the hurts and depressions, to discover joy and hope a=
nd freedom  amidst death and disaster. So long as we depend upon others to =
change  for us we can never be fully free in our happiness, as we have give=
n  it in other's hands. We have to discover the joy and strength we  need i=
n life from within us and then in proportion to our discovery  distribute a=
nd share it with others. The only lasting remedy to  hurts in human relatio=
nships is to learn to give love rather than  want to receive it.

This howe=
ver is not easy  and takes time and effort. In the meantime we can do sever=
al other  things. For example when we get hurt, we can take it as an opport=
unity  to become a little more conscious of those parts in us that childish=
ly  crave for affection. If we are sincere in our probe we can make  many u=
seful discoveries about human nature and ourselves. For example,  we may fi=
nd that the source of our hurt is not really in the other  person but in ou=
r self. We can also try to widen ourselves intellectually  and emotionally =
to accommodate the ideas, opinions and feelings  of others rather than focu=
sing only on our own grievances. Kindness  and considerateness of others se=
nsitivities go a long way towards  improving relationships. Of course all t=
hese things can come much  more readily in friendship than in a structured =
and closed relationship  where two people have to live in a defined manner =
under the same  roof. Friendship lasts mainly because it is
 not so much ba=
sed on  the expectation that others should change for our sake. Defined  re=
lationships however suffer this difficulty that the roles and  rules are al=
ready fixed by the society and others for us thereby  creating an external =
pressure of expectations. That is one reason  why the spirit of our times i=
s breaking the fixed moulds and established  roles while encouraging friend=
ship and undefined relatedness independent  of outer circumstances of birth=
, environment, society, etc. Future  relationships are likely to be less an=
d less fixed and more open  ended to allow enough room and space for each o=
ther's growth. The  future is going to encourage only those relationships, =
which are  helpful in evolution. All the moulds fixed by our past are going=
  to be broken since they have served their term and utility and must  be r=
eplaced by a newer consciousness, the consciousness of the soul  rather tha=
n of the ego. This is the true solution and the
 solution  of the future. T=
o live in and by the soul rather than for the ego  is the final solution to=
 all our miseries including those that hurt  and bruise us. To live in the =
ego is to be forever vulnerable. To  live in the soul is to be secure and f=
ree."




I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit =
ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter =
through them all.-Sri Aurobindo

=C2=A0 
Namaste Durgesh,
=
=C2=A0
There is no single answer. We are always pulled in different directi=
ons by different rinas and dharmas. One needs to JUDGE which dharma is high=
er and which rina is more important.

=C2=A0
Depending on one's individual =
circumstances, one of the following may be the best option:
=C2=A0
(1) Igno=
re the complaining wife/husband. Don't fight or argue, but keep doing your =
sadhana. As time progresses, (a) she may see the positive change in your at=
titude and stop complaining, (b) she may just get used to it and accept her=
 fate, (c) she may keep complaining and YOU may get used to that complaints=
 and accept your fate.
=C2=A0
(2) Talk to her/him and find some compromise =
that is acceptable. Instead of doing 1 hour sadhana, may be do half hour an=
d spend more time doing something she likes.
=C2=A0
(3) Give up your idea o=
f sadhana and take whatever you are able to do, as sanctioned by your wife/=
husband, as your sadhana. For example, cooking, cleaning dishes, washing cl=
othes, taking her to a movie, massaging her feet, taking kids to activities=
 etc can also be sadhanas.
=C2=A0
Any activity can be done with a protestin=
g/dissenting attitude or an agitated mind, or with love and caring and a ca=
lm and composed mind. Every activity involves interacting with some objects=
. Just as god is in idol and fire, he is in vegetables you cut, food you co=
ok, feet you massage etc. If you see an action as a chore or look at it or =
its object(s) with an impure mind (e.g. with lust or with anger or with fru=
stration) or focus more of your attention on yourself, then it becomes impu=
re. If you approach the action with a calm and devoted mind, see the action=
 and its object(s) with love, devotion and caring and focus the more of you=
r attention on the action and its objects (rather than youself and your own=
 happiness), then it becomes a ritual or sadhana.
=C2=A0
Of course, in some=
 actions one hates, it is very difficult to bring that calmness and caring.=
 In some other actions (e.g. sex), one may become too selfish or self-absor=
bed and think too much about one's own sensations, to look at the action an=
d other persons/objects with love, caring, devotion.

=C2=A0
Thus, we norma=
lly don't talk about converting all actions into sadhana and talk about jap=
am, homam etc. It is easier in those to look at the action and its objects =
with a sense of purity and devotion. However, if that is not possible and o=
ne has to do some other actions, why note TRY to convert them into sadhana?=
 Try to perform the action with a calm, stable, selfless mind, focus attent=
ion on the action and its objects and imbibe love and caring into your thin=
king.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
In fact, at some stage, (3) has to bec=
ome part of one's sadhana. One has to convert every action into a sadhana. =
Just doing japam or homam for an hour or two may not cut it.
=C2=A0
If you =
live in a really cold country, your room can get very cold. If you turn the=
 heater on for an hour everyday and keep it off rest of the time, the room =
will overall be very cold. Similarly, if you do sadhana for an hour, you ma=
y feel better, but the normal attitude returns. To make permanent progress,=
 the heater has to be on most of the day! Of course, as you cannot do japam=
 or homam for 12 hours a day, you have to convert whatever you do (eating, =
driving to work, your work, driving back, cooking, eating, talking to peopl=
e, etc) into sadhana. At some stage, every seeker will have to start doing =
it.

 as an opportunity
