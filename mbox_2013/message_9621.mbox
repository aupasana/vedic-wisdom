I can share my own recent experiences in this regard. Last week, I suddenly had gush of thoughts about ghosts, spirits and happend to see couple of videos on you tube as well that scared a hell out me. I was even scared to be home alone even during day time forget about nights. I then went onto piligrimage over the weekend to have darshan of various sakthis including madhura meenakshi, kumbakonam maangalyambika, Mysore chamundeshwari, sri rangam ranganayaki, Trichi Akhilandeshwari etc.<br><br>During my visit to Rahu sthal in kumbhakonam, I came across pratyingira temple near by, and due to my heavy interest in her, I rushed to have her darshan. I was so happy and consoled with her darshan that the ghostly and haunting thoughts vanished in just split of a second and donx27;t scare me
 any more. I was really amazed. My love for sakthis has increased much more ever since.<br><br>Since the girls condition is more severe, pratyingira homam will definitely be helpful, however it needs to be carried out by an eminent sadhaka. Haran ayia from Rochester is definitely recommended for the same. I feel if the homam is performed on her Janna nakshatram every month , it might be more helpful.<br><br>I keep the girl in my prayers and wish her speedy recovery.<br><br>Thanks<br></div></td></tr></table>            <div id="_origMsg_">

Bhupendra Ji<br>
<br>
I am really sorry to hear about the ordeal of this little girl. Rajarishi ji's advice is very good and I can probably add something which might give much sooner releif. It would be great if the family can travel to Kasi.<br>
<br>
However right in Rochester(near to New york and Boston ) there is a very powerful devi temple and the goddess is in the form of Sahasrakshi . Haran Aiya who is the main priest of the temple is a disciple of Amritananda natha saraswati and is he is very well versed in srividya upasana and tantra. <br>
<br>
Narasimha Ji visited this temple a couple of years back and he posted his thoughts.Though the original message was about something else.<br>
<br>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/4624">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/4624</a><br>
<br>
"I truly appreciate the sincerity of Haran aiya, his disciples and his lineage.<br>
I visited that temple once and was impressed with the attitude of people running<br>
it."<br>
<br>
One good example of the shakti of the sadhakas running the temple is this. Every year they do a homa for Pratyangira Devi ( Atharvana Bhadrakali ) and they use tons of chillies in the homa. Even though tons of chillies are used in the homa people's eyes do not burn while standing since the tattwa of the offering has been changed due to her grace.<br>
<br>
The Sri Chakra Journal they publish detailed it ...<br>
<br>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://srividya.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2012-Blossom-16-Petal-2.pdf">http://srividya.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2012-Blossom-16-Petal-2.pdf</a><br>
<br>
"All in all, the entire homam took about 3 hours to complete, with<br>
several kilograms of red chilli peppers being offered into the<br>
flames in the process. However, not one person felt the effect of the<br>
chilli smoke, as everything was accepted by the Devi.<br>
After the main homam,Bhairava bali was offered<br>
outside the temple and everyone was given the remaining (unburned)<br>
prasadam to take home."<br>
<br>
The goddess in the form of Pratyangira devi is famous for turning back black magic and protecting her devotees. This is the link and address to the temple.<br>
<br>
The temple also houses a Bhairava Murthy and Aiya is well versed with Pratyangira sadhana. <br>
<br>

<br>
Please take the child to the shrine and meet Haran Aiya and he will definetly suggest something more quicker.<br>
<br>

Vemparla Ram Kishore<br>
