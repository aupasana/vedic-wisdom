Dear Shri Narasimha Ji,

                 I like the simplicity of explana=
tion of how laws of
karma work. Some these very questions I've asked myself=
 and I am
grateful that you've answered them today!!

I am wondering if you=
 could please also express your views on the
following three questions:

  =
               1. How does nishkam karma works? In other words, when a
doer=
 detaches himself from an action, where does the reaction goes?  I
mean the=
 reaction has to be experienced by someone or something, right?
For example=
, in Mahabharata, after Lord Krishna's deliverance of Shrimad
bhagwad Gita,=
 when Arjuna  fought in war, if we have to assume those
actions were perfor=
med as detached from the doer, who gets all the
balancing reactions?  Or le=
t's assume that a mahapurusha X performs
some nishkam action, which is perc=
eived by some other person Y as not
favorable and thus makes him/her enough=
 angry+sad that in ordinary
circumstance it will equate to Y cursing X and =
X have to eventually
suffer equivalent effect(and so would Y) . In our scen=
ario if X's
action were truly detached, where does the curse from Y end up?=


                 2. As per Shri Vimalanda, you may also offer all the
kar=
mas as Homa to inner devas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is
lesse=
r of suffering if you do that. Who gets the remaining delta
suffering?

   =
              3. Something of a fashion now a days in current western
cultu=
re (TV shows and what not) is something called law-of-attraction
(something=
 popular in current western culture).is it merely rearranging
of karmas or =
the `positive-thinking' involved actually changing
them at some level (subt=
le )? Link:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(book)
<http://en.wikip=
edia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(book)>   .Is it really
possible that ordinary peo=
ple are capable of somehow rearranging their
own karma pipeline out of inte=
nse desire and get the things they want?

                 As always, thank=
s for all you say and do. Your writings
are treasure for seekers.

Regards
=

Kshraum

Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various agen=

in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purush=

So this requires a complicated balancing act o=

Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are =
very
complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and
pick=

Also, as new people enter one's l=

karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing ma=

may be re-arranged.
