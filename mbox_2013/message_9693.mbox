Namasthe Swami

 

With your kind blessings, I have inter-laced my re=
plies in red-ink italics after your original lines in your write-up. I am t=
hankful and glad that you took  time and patience to indulge in this vichaa=
ra-saagara-manthana. I hope the amrutha will surely arise in the end, after=
 some initial poisons and bitterness.

 

Your point 3 captures what I ofte=
n refer to as the trap of pseudo-wisdom.

 

1.     Do you mean to say that=
 the point 3 as mentioned below is a pseudo-wisdom?

 

<<Let me tell you t=
hat the very idea of considering that divinity to be eclipsed is ignorance;=
 and consequently trying to make an effort to remove that eclipse, is a gre=
ater ignorance. Any act done under ignorance will yield only further bondag=
e and eclipse, and trap the soul into the chakravyuha(tornado) of the maaya=
.>>

 
You claim that there is no "eclipse" or covering or bondage in the f=
irst place (because it is "ignorance" and not real) and yet speak of "furth=
er bondage and eclipse"! How can something that doesn't even exist, increas=
e or decrease?

 

2.     The truth is that the divinity is not eclipsed-ne=
ither it was, nor it is, and nor it will ever be . There is an illusion in =
our mind that the divinity is eclipsed. This illusion becomes =E2=80=9Creal=
=E2=80=9D and behaves as if it is real. Once the illusion becomes real, it =
starts affecting us or perhaps seem to affect us in =E2=80=9Creal=E2=80=9D,=
 and trying to get rid of it, will only put us in a deeper grip of the appa=
rent reality. The illusion of truth though not real, yet appears as real, i=
s what is defined as =E2=80=9Cmaayaa=E2=80=9D. So your point that something=
 that doesn=E2=80=99t even exist yet it seems to increase or decrease, as i=
f it is existing, is a very valid point, and that=E2=80=99s what is defined=
 as =E2=80=9Cmaayaa=E2=80=9D. The technical definition of maaya is somethin=
g which though not existing yet appears to exist. I think this explains you=
r point.
 
It EITHER does not exist at all OR exists and keeps increasing/d=
ecreasing. You can't have it both ways! :-)

3.     =E2=80=9CIt does not ex=
ist at all=E2=80=9D is  true. =E2=80=9CIt exists and keeps increasing/decre=
asing=E2=80=9D is also true. And this is what Maaya is-- To give you a feel=
ing of existence even though, in truth, it is not existing.


 
Now let us =
examine these 2 cases separately.
 
Case 1: Eclipse/bondage does not even e=
xist. So it does not increase/decrease. There is nothing to discuss! :-)
 
=
Case 2: Eclipse/bondage exists and some acts increase it and some decrease =
it. It is not merely efforts to "overcome" this eclipse/bondage that may in=
crease it. So many other acts could increase it. Some people may have engag=
ed in too many such activities and accumulated so much eclipse/bondage/cove=
ring of the innate divinity that it may actually need a lot of effort to un=
do it!
 

4.     Both the cases are true, and that is what maaya is. But on=
e is absolute truth, and another is a perceived truth or relative truth, so=
 an illusion of truth.


*        *        *
 
It is very easy to claim tha=
t all is god and that even considering that there is some covering is an ig=
norance.

5.     The statement =E2=80=9Call is god=E2=80=9D has a logical e=
rror. When you make such a statement you implicitly define and differentiat=
e two different entities viz.1. All and 2. God. So, if your statement is su=
ppose to imply non-duality, it suffers an inherent or implicit contradictio=
n in its very assumption itself where it assumes two separate, distinct, du=
al entities. When you are truly disposed off in non-duality, you cannot mak=
e any such statements.


 
Though everything is Self, Self is that which is=
 unborn and un-perishing. We are surrounded by many manifestations of Self =
that are transient, i.e. they are born and they perish. When we come in con=
tact with them, we do not focus on their imperishable essence, but focus on=
 the transient/perishable portion that is more readily perceptible to our s=
enses, manas, buddhi and chitta.
 
This perishable/transient portion is wha=
t we mean by covering/eclipse.

6.     No Dear Vipravara(learned person). T=
his perishable transient portion is not eclipse/covering/bondage. How can y=
ou have a perishable entity, when the only entity that exist is itself impe=
rishable. Let me take an example. Lets have a gold metal. Lets make three e=
ntities with that gold-viz.1. bangles 2. Necklace 3. Ear-rings. Each have d=
ifferent entities and functions and properties and behavior and of course n=
ame. Now let us focus on bangle. Bangle is something which is  circular, an=
d appears different from necklace and ear-rings. Now, I take a 20 gm gold, =
and give it a shape and name and call it bangle. Now, does the bangle exist=
 in true sense? No. Now, I melt the bangle, it turns back to 20 gm gold wit=
h no shape and name. So what was existing throughout is the =E2=80=9Cgold=
=E2=80=9D itself, and nothing else. Now you call this bangle as a perishabl=
e entity. But the point is -it is not any entity at all, in the first place=
. It is only a verbal and fictitious entity existing only in words and mind=
, not in actuality. Gold is the only entity existing in actuality. Bangle i=
s just a name given to a form and shape of  gold.

 

Now let me come back =
to what eclipse/covering/bondage is. The point is there is no such thing. I=
t is only an illusion or imagination that we are bonded/eclipsed/covered. T=
he very fact to consider gold to be eclipsed as bangle, and bangle to be pe=
rishable, transient entity, etc=E2=80=94all this is avidya.

 

Let me give=
 you an incidence of a beautiful Himalayan Sage called Swami Rama with his =
 Master. Once Swami Rama asked his master to teach him what avidya or maaya=
 or illusion is? His master explained that avidya is individual illusion/ig=
norance and maaya is cosmic illusion or ignorance. Swami Raama further aske=
d the nature of avidya. His master told that he will explain it later. Then=
 suddenly his master jumped on a tree and held it tightly clinging onto its=
 trunk and hugging it with his legs crossed across the trunk of the tree. H=
e shouted=E2=80=9DRaamaa, Raamaa, please help me, save me.I am trapped by t=
his tree. =E2=80=9C Swami Raamaa laughed and said =E2=80=9CHow silly? How c=
an this tree trap you? It has no power to trap you. It is you who have caug=
ht hold of it. Just make a decision to quit that hold. Then you will be fre=
e=E2=80=9D His master smiled. And said this is what I mean by illusion or a=
vidya. Though it has got no power to eclipse the Self, yet it appears to ha=
ve eclipsed the self. This illusion occurs when the intellect is rendered b=
lind, and not in the state of =E2=80=9Cpragnya=E2=80=9D.


 
Suppose one's =
leg is cut off, blood starts to gush out and one is about to die in a littl=
e time. Can one remain equanimous during that time and genuinely think "thi=
s body and the blood I perceive are transient. They are actually manifestat=
ions of imperishable Self. I do not care about transient manifestations. I =
only care about the imperishable Self. I am Self"?

 

7.     Under such ci=
rcumstances, if you are truly in non-dual state of your self, you will simp=
ly do the needful, that is try to approach a suitable vaidya and treat your=
 case with a suitable medicine(this is karma yoga too). If you start thinki=
ng that =E2=80=9Cyou are self=E2=80=9D, then this is wrong. Why? Let me exp=
lain. The very fact that you are =E2=80=9Creacting to=E2=80=9D the leg-cut =
off incidence, itself by default implicitly assumes that you are giving imp=
ortance/attachment to that incidence and not treating it as =E2=80=9CSelf=
=E2=80=9D. As a consequence of that reaction, you develop an excited state =
of mind, which you are trying to pacify by means of auto-suggestions like =
=E2=80=9CI am Self. I don=E2=80=99t care about perishable.etc etc=E2=80=9D.=
 This auto-suggestion proves the fact that you are already a victim of an i=
ncidence, and hence implicitly you are contradicting the non-duality. So in=
 essence, it is a hypocrisy.
 
This is just one example. Depending on the p=
erson, many such examples can be given, where pretensions of "I am Self" ca=
n be shattered and one will beg "forget about Self. I am in deep trouble. S=
omebody please help me out of this situation"!
 
If one is established in S=
elf and NO situation ever disturbs one's equanimity, only then one is reali=
zed. Such a state is not easy to achieve as some pseudo-Vedantins may sugge=
st.

 

8.     Perhaps what I can understand from you is that you had read =
the views of many scholars or vedantins which have truly bugged your mind, =
and your vocabulary and language patterns too. There appears too much of ju=
ngles of words rather than clarity of concepts. This trap of pseudo-wisdom =
is a result of too much playing with words with a very suave and subtle imp=
licit faulty assumptions not apparently traceable by gullible minds. This h=
appens when too many vedaantin scholars try to write too many bhaashyaas to=
 show their scholarly might.
 
As I said below, this is just a case of "a l=
ong path of constant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a =
quick delusional jump to the end". Unless one catches it whenever something=
 transient and perishable is drawing one's attention, one will not overcome=
 each such instinct. Until each such instinct is overcome, "all is imperish=
able Self" is just a theory one is repeating like a parrot. The covering/ec=
lipse/bondage is quite real until then.

 

9.     The unreal seems real an=
d as you said, we have to bear with the =E2=80=9Cunreal=E2=80=9D as =E2=80=
=9Creal=E2=80=9D till realization dawns. But the point is it can never dawn=
 if you stay out there just doing this. In other words, no efforts can reac=
h us to the state of truth. The truth has to reveal itself. Truth reveals i=
tself for an open and receiving heart. And all this so-called unreal illusi=
ons; and the turmoils they are going to create, ultimately lead to the clea=
nsing of heart, finally leading to the truth. Very simple yet very complica=
ted indeed. That=E2=80=99s what maaya is..:)

 

*        *        *
 
Unfo=
rtunately, some assertions of Jnana Yoga and Adwaita Vedanta can be mislead=
ing. I will try to explain it with a nice analogy from physics.
 
This worl=
d is made up of different objects. They are made up of molecules with a lot=
 of vacuum in between them. Molecules are made up of atoms and a lot of vac=
uum in between them. Atoms are made up of electrons, protons etc and a lot =
of vacuum in between them. Even those particles are made up of smaller part=
icles and a lot of vacuum in between them. As you keep dividing, you will s=
ee that things are made up of subtle portions of matter and a lot of vacuum=
. When you go to the level of small particles, work by physicists such as H=
eisenberg, Broglie, Schroedinger etc says that you can't even observe and d=
etermine the properties of those particles confidently without affecting th=
em. They may not even exist as "matter" with specific location and momentum=
 or even as waves, independent of the observer.
 
However, despite that "qu=
antum mechanics" reality at the subtlest level, we have normal "mechanics" =
too. A lot of gross objects made up of  those subtle particles are gross en=
ough and obey some grosser laws of physics (e.g. Newton's laws). We can fin=
d their positions, momentum etc accurately and make them move deterministic=
ally.
 
When one is designing a car or a pulley system or a rocket, one can=
 leave quantum mechanics and use normal mechanics. However, when one is doi=
ng research on bosons etc, one must pay attention to quantum mechanics. Oth=
erwise, one will commit errors.
 
Similarly, at the subtlest level, Self al=
one exists. Things that seem to exist may not even exist independent of the=
 observer. However, there are also the laws of karma that govern the grosse=
r reality (body, health, job, spouse, children, house, car, money etc). Ris=
his taught Adwaita Vedanta and also the laws that govern the world of duali=
ty (e.g. the law of karma).
 
When one's awareness focuses on gross objects=
 and one is working with the gross world, one better leave "quantum spiritu=
ality" (Adwaita Vedanta) and focus on normal spirituality. However, when on=
e's awareness becomes very subtle and one starts to deal with mystical expe=
riences, deities etc, one must pay attention to Adwaita Vedanta. Otherwise,=
 one will commit errors!!

 

10.  An excellent masterpiece of an example a=
nd clarity!!!. I have no words to mention the beauty of this write-up. The =
point is, newton=E2=80=99s laws are applicable in a range, so it is rather =
a model than a law. The universe exists over a wide range from huge galaxie=
s upto small atoms and molecules. Now under each range or orders of magnitu=
de, certain simplifications/models/laws help us to fairly/accurately deal w=
ith =E2=80=9Cthe events in the range=E2=80=9D. So you may be successful in =
dealing with the events in those restricted range of investigation/operatio=
n/observation. But this may not necessarily lead you to the truth and moksh=
a. Because the range is still =E2=80=9Creal=E2=80=9D for you. So you contin=
ue to live in that =E2=80=9Crange=E2=80=9D  lifetime after lifetime.

 

On=
e can live at quantum level, yet function at macro-level both simultaneousl=
y, without mutual exclusion. And this is what Krishna deems as karma yoga o=
r jeevan-mukta or Stitha-Pragnya. Such state of existence is the blessings =
of the wise people. Company of wise people is like a nuclear-weapon to dest=
roy the ignorance.

 

 

Thanks and Warm Regards,

Kannan.

Dear Shri Narasimha Ji,

Na=
masthe

 

1.       I deeply appreciate and feel grateful for having shared=
 your understandings. I would kindly request you to permit me to share my u=
nderstandings which stand in definite contrast with that of yours. I would =
also request your noble self to allow me to point out a number of flaws, wh=
ich I consider as a liberty bestowed on debating scholars. Of course, we do=
n=E2=80=99t become great if we are =E2=80=9Cscholars=E2=80=9D because a sch=
olar is essentially a person who continues to learn without a pause. I woul=
d view this as an opportunity to rectify our understandings.

 

2.       F=
irst of all you quoted Swami Vivekananda as a stamping authority to support=
/strengthen your argument. Let me tell you that truth/clarity does not need=
 any support, because it stands itself as a support for all.(In Hindi, =E2=
=80=9Csatya ko pramaan ki aavashyakta nahi hai, satya swayam apna pramaan h=
ai=E2=80=9D)

 

3.       Secondly, if what you have quoted from Swami Vive=
kananda is true, then I am skeptical about Swami Vivekananda=E2=80=99s unde=
rstandings himself. Let me tell you that divinity of soul is ever-existing =
like Sun (Sadaa Jaagati Jyoti)(ever shining light). So do you need any effo=
rt to manifest it? Do you mean to say that the ever-shining Brahman is at t=
he mercy of our efforts to get itself manifested? Perhaps..But let us ponde=
r what actually caused that sunlight to be eclipsed? Let me tell you that t=
he very idea of considering that divinity to be eclipsed is ignorance; and =
consequently trying to make an effort to remove that eclipse, is a greater =
ignorance. Any act done under ignorance will yield only further bondage and=
 eclipse, and trap the soul into the chakravyuha(tornado) of the maaya.

 
=

4.       The key idea here is that when we start with an assumption which =
itself is faulty, then our whole calculation based on that assumption goes =
faulty. So there is no point in proceeding further beyond this, or else it =
 is just a waste of time, without true/clarity of vision dawning on us.

 
=

5.       I would humbly request your noble self to view it as a healthy sc=
holarly debate, which necessitates being blunt and straightforward, without=
 being circumbulatory. This will be in the general interest and welfare of =
all the earnest seekers.

 

6.       I humbly request your noble self to p=
eruse my understandings, and bless us with further insights.

 

Thanks and=
 Warm Regards,

Kannan

[vedic-wisdom] Re: which path to choose?-a dialog

 

  

Namaste friends,
=
 
I am cc'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup because of the spiritual cont=
ent.
 
I agree with Vishnu ji's comment on a specific point in Maja ji's ni=
ce write-up:
 
> > *Also, one is supposed to choose only one ayana for one =
lifetime and
> > master it to as perfect as possible. *
>

 in fact is a measure of self realized people.
 
Indeed, one can carve one'=
s own niche by combining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually =
exclusive.
 
I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where h=
e makes a comment on the 4 paths:
 
"Each soul is potentially divine. The g=
oal is to manifest this divinity within by controlling nature: external and=
 internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or philoso=
phy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free."
 
Here are my 2 cent=
s.
 
Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga empha=
sizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self=
-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One =
can pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop that quality. Howeve=
r, wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are n=
ot mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, ot=
hers will automatically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one i=
n "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.
 
Forge=
t about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of tha=
t, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakri=
shna advised against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic =
life force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean n=
adis. In this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great a=
mounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my =
view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (on=
e of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sish=
yas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encou=
rage even him to practice it.
 
Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a dis=
tinct danger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People o=
f this age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude=
 that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't ma=
tter. It's all a delusion anyway" without fully overcoming all innate condi=
tioning that reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind of lik=
e declaring wisely in a movie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but=
 flinching in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without abs=
olute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too=
. A long path of constant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced =
to a quick delusional jump to the end.
 
IMHo, for most people in this age,=
 Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.
 
Best regard=
s,
Narasimha

 <br>
Unfortunately, some assertions of Jna=
na Yoga and Adwaita Vedanta can be
misleading. I will try to explain it wit=
h a nice analogy from physics.<br>
 <br>
This world is made up of diff=
erent objects. They are made up of molecules with
a lot of vacuum in betwee=
n them. Molecules are made up of atoms and a lot of
vacuum in between them.=
 Atoms are made up of electrons, protons etc and a lot
of vacuum in between=
 them. Even those particles are made up of smaller
particles and a lot of v=
acuum in between them. As you keep dividing, you will
see that things are m=
ade up of subtle portions of matter and a lot of vacuum.
When you go to the=
 level of small particles, work by physicists such as
Heisenberg, Broglie, =
Schroedinger etc says that you can't even observe and
determine the propert=
ies of those particles confidently without affecting them.
They may not eve=
n exist as "matter" with specific location and
momentum or even a=
s waves, independent of the observer.<br>
 <br>
However, despite that =
"quantum mechanics" reality at the subtlest
level, we have normal=
 "mechanics" too. A lot of gross objects made up
of  those s=
ubtle particles are gross enough and obey some grosser laws of
physics (e.g=
. Newton's laws). We can find their positions, momentum etc
accurately and =
make them move deterministically.<br>
 <br>
When one is designing a ca=
r or a pulley system or a rocket, one can leave
quantum mechanics and use n=
ormal mechanics. However, when one is doing research
on bosons etc, one mus=
t pay attention to quantum mechanics. Otherwise, one will
commit errors.<br=
>
 <br>
Similarly, at the subtlest level, Self alone exists. Things th=
at seem to exist
may not even exist independent of the observer. However, t=
here are also the
laws of karma that govern the grosser reality (body, heal=
th, job, spouse,
children, house, car, money etc). Rishis taught Adwaita Ve=
danta and also the
laws that govern the world of duality (e.g. the law of k=
arma).<br>
 <br>
When one's awareness focuses on gross objects and one=
 is working with the gross
world, one better leave "quantum spirituali=
ty" (Adwaita Vedanta) and
focus on normal spirituality. However, when =
one's awareness becomes very subtle
and one starts to deal with mystical ex=
periences, deities etc, one must pay
attention to Adwaita Vedanta. Otherwis=
e, one will commit errors!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
