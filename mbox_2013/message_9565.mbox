OM SHRI GANESHAYA NAMAHA

Dear Mr. Ajit,

Thanks for the response. 

In fac=
t, I wear hardly anything at all during the actual act of prayers and medit=
ation. Also, the process of living itself does not preclude sadhana and whe=
n in private (which is most of the time), I again wear the barest minimum. =
I am serious about this but would not exceed the limit in describing what I=
 wear. I felt that it is necessary to clarify since you touched upon this i=
ssue. Anyway, I would like to absorb whatever intelligible is available fro=
m various sources. To each his own.

Best wishes,
K. Ramakrishnan

Dear Ra=
makrishnan,

>=C2=A0I have been feeling hindered in my spiritual progress d=
ue to the feel of the sacred thread on my body during my sadhana.



=C2=A0=

If you feel that the sacred thread hinders you, your clothes and underclot=
hes must really, really hinder you. I'm partly joking, and partly serious.
=

Search google for "ramakrishna sacred thread", and click on the book resul=
t for "ramakrishna and his disciples". Don't just read the first 1 or 2 par=
agraphs. Keep reading to understand this episode in context.

Narasimha has=
 previously written on this topic (see the link below). If you search the a=
rchives, you will definitely find other discussions as well.
