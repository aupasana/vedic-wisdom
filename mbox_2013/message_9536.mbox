Namaste Durgesh,<br>
 <br>
There is no single an=
swer. We are always pulled in different directions by different rinas and d=
harmas. One needs to JUDGE which dharma is higher and which rina is more im=
portant.<br>
<br>
Depending on one's individual circumstances, one of t=
he following may be the best option:<br>
 <br>
(1) Ignore the complaining w=
ife/husband. Don't fight or argue, but keep doing your sadhana. As time=
 progresses, (a) she may see the positive change in your attitude and stop =
complaining, (b) she may just get used to it and accept her fate, (c) she m=
ay keep complaining and YOU may get used to that complaints and accept your=
 fate.<br>

 <br>
(2) Talk to her/him and find some compromise that is acce=
ptable. Instead of doing 1 hour sadhana, may be do half hour and spend more=
 time doing something she likes.<br>
 <br>
(3) Give up your idea of sadhana=
 and take whatever you are able to do, as sanctioned by your wife/husband, =
as your sadhana. For example, cooking, cleaning dishes, washing clothes, ta=
king her to a movie, massaging her feet, taking kids to activities etc can =
also be sadhanas.<br>

 <br>
Any activity can be done with a protesting/dis=
senting attitude or an agitated mind, or with love and caring and a calm an=
d composed mind. Every activity involves interacting with some objects. Jus=
t as god is in idol and fire, he is in vegetables you cut, food you cook, f=
eet you massage etc. If you see an action as a chore or look at it or its o=
bject(s) with an impure mind (e.g. with lust or with anger or with frustrat=
ion) or focus more of your attention on yourself, then it becomes impure. I=
f you approach the action with a calm and devoted mind, see the action and =
its object(s) with love, devotion and caring and focus the more of your att=
ention on the action and its objects (rather than youself and your own happ=
iness), then it becomes a ritual or sadhana.<br>

 <br>
Of course, in some =
actions one hates, it is very difficult to bring that calmness and caring. =
In some other actions (e.g. sex), one may become too selfish or self-absorb=
ed and think too much about one's own sensations, to look at the action=
 and other persons/objects with love, caring, devotion.<br>

<br>
Thus, we =
normally don't talk about converting all actions into sadhana and talk =
about japam, homam etc. It is easier in those to look at the action and its=
 objects with a sense of purity and devotion. However, if that is not possi=
ble and one has to do some other actions, why note TRY to convert them into=
 sadhana? Try to perform the action with a calm, stable, selfless mind, foc=
us attention on the action and its objects and imbibe love and caring into =
your thinking.<br>

 <br>
*        *        *<br>
 <br>
In fact, at some st=
age, (3) has to become part of one's sadhana. One has to convert every =
action into a sadhana. Just doing japam or homam for an hour or two may not=
 cut it.<br>
 <br>
If you live in a really cold country, your room can get =
very cold. If you turn the heater on for an hour everyday and keep it off r=
est of the time, the room will overall be very cold. Similarly, if you do s=
adhana for an hour, you may feel better, but the normal attitude returns. T=
o make permanent progress, the heater has to be on most of the day! Of cour=
se, as you cannot do japam or homam for 12 hours a day, you have to convert=
 whatever you do (eating, driving to work, your work, driving back, cooking=
, eating, talking to people, etc) into sadhana. At some stage, every seeker=
 will have to start doing it.<br>
