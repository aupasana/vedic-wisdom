c-wisdom] Re: 108 times sapatshati reading
 


=C2=A0 
Namaste Rakesh ji,
M=
e not Narasimha, will try to write something which might interest you.

Any=
one reading this , can play this in another tab, to soothe your mind.

http=
://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9R4hMUaymgc

Sir, there is something about the=
se texts , that is imperative for these
texts to really be of any meaning t=
o anyone. That is the "story" or the
"myth" coming alive "inside" of "you".=


Difficult concept to put into words, at least for me.

Let us consider Ms=
 DS for example, short for durga saptashati.

It is a freaking long text!! =
at least for people who are initially
starting out reciting it. But then th=
is the path that is not easy to
begin with. And if it were easy, everybody =
would be very successful with
it, and not many are ( it all depends on her =
and your madness)

The main point with recitation is , that Ms DS comes "al=
ive" "inside" of
"you".
The hell does that mean? It means that you visualiz=
e the chapters as
they are.
It means that your focus or the mind is not wit=
h the sexy girl you saw
in the mall, the quickfire reply you should have gi=
ven to the turd that
slightly insulted you, or what payments you have to co=
llect tomorrow
from the bank etc etc. And neither it should be somewhere si=
nging songs
and just waiting for this text (DS) to end.

Believe you me , R=
akesh ji it is tough. Insanely tough to get the mind
fixed or visualizing t=
he fight and all the carnage/beauty that is there
in DS. And what aids to t=
he fun, is if you don't know sanskrit. Ha!!

You may know how to read the d=
evanagri script, but dont really know what
it means, then the real fun star=
ts. So you are reciting a text, but
can't really visualize it because you j=
ust don't know what the hell it
means or what are you reading!

There is a =
solution to that, you will need to read, re-read and re-read
one chapter at=
 a time and tie in the hindi translation or an
interpretation with the sans=
krit text above. It will take time, an this
is not a one day process. It mi=
ght take years or days , and varies on a
case to case basis.

I think the v=
ideo would have ended in the other tab by now, you can play
this now.

http=
://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHReN67juhCg

Let us take Chapter 10 for exampl=
e,
in the beginning fo the chapter, once he sees that his brother is dead
G=
unda no 2 ( (Mr shumbh bhai) shouts at madameji for cheating and
relying on=
 various other ladies  for killing his brother in crime gunda
no 1 ( Nishum=
bh bhai ) and cheating, and madame-ji replies with aww,
those all were actu=
ally me and merges all the forms back and shows him.

Now , when you get to=
 the tenth chapter, this visualization should be
there ,when you read the s=
pecific verses about this incident and not be
thinking about oh my god when=
 will this end I am tired and mere paise us
kutte harami ke paas pare hain =
aur woh nahin de raha hai.

Over a period of time when you repeatedly visua=
lize the entire story
along with the reading, then will it one day come ali=
ve inside of you
and teach you further, because there are layers upon layer=
s upon layers
of meaning there and it will be slowly taught very serenely d=
epending on
her wish and judgement.

Video must have ended
http://www.youtu=
be.com/watch?v=3DKpGhw6bdmEQ

"If one has to do 108 times sapatshati readin=
g then can u pls guide what
r rules in this time like "

If you can manage =
one good reading with a nice visualization going on,
it will be much better=
 than 108 times of just rushing through with it.

1] diet ,
You will want t=
o keep it as light as possible, khichri does the trick,
you will need all t=
he "inner fire" for your focus on the text and it is
a limited resource, so=
 the more heavier food you have the more it will
be used for digestion and =
potty preparation.

2] can it be recited in 2 or 3 sittings in a day
No pro=
blems in that, but decide the routine before you committing to
madame- she =
just does not like people backing off.

3] if few words are not properly re=
cited then is there any harm , if
feelings r just for mothers love with nis=
hkam bhav

Bhaisahab, kuch nahin hoga, you are not worshipping a churail he=
re,
eventually ma hain, tumko kategi bhi toh roegi bhi, pehle hi maafi maan=
g
lo. bum nahin phootega/phootegi.

Plus you are saying harm with nishkam b=
hav, not sure those two fit in
the same sentence.

4] is 13 chap enough or =
any start addition is reqd if so then pls
suggest,
Bhaiyo, 13 hi karlo thee=
k thaak focus ke saath , go to bigger things
later.

5] any other advice
Yo=
u try to improve your one reading and step by step get it to a point
where =
the text is flowing inside of you and out, other wise 108 will be
just a me=
ntal burden with you trying to hurriedly complete, with you
getting terribl=
y bored while youa re at it.. Don't expect any fruits
post your 108 complet=
ion.

6]also as  u said that it is essence of vedas but how can it give mok=
sha
as we r just reading but if one does recitation of one mantra with
clos=
ed eyes then is mantra better.

Ooh the video must have ended, here another=
 one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=3Dendscreen&NR=3D1&v=3DKEvKcdBfqt=
U

You make the entire text run inside of your head like a HD movie in
1080=
p resolution and you will yourself say that it is the essence of the
vedas.=


""""but how can it give moksha as we r just reading"""""
You dont just ha=
ve to read, hehe.

Regarding, moksha, all i can say used to be the name of =
very pretty girl
back in school, saali ki shaadi ho gayi, god-damn it!!

An=
yways if anyone expects any results , forget it. All she will be doing
is s=
moking a cigarette and yawning, if you just go through it
mindlessly.

But =
it always start mindlessly and if you keep at it, she eventually
decides to=
 teach you. So start today ,and make small improvements every
day.

Its all=
 training and the amount of hard work that you put in, in any
field of life=
, same here.

One good reading of only 13 chapters takes about 1 hour 10 mi=
nutes or 20
depending on your speed and if you are really comfortable it ca=
n go down
to about an 55 to sixty minutes for one reading, that is if you h=
ave
really been living with Ms DS for years.

Bhagwan aapke saath rahe for =
108 in a day.

Jai Radhika!
