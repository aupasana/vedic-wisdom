Hello Kannanji :)

Nice example about the 7th to 10th grade students.
My pl=
ace is situated in the central plains of Karnataka state on the banks of Ri=
ver Tungabhadra. It is a place where many mystics lived once. Also continue=
 to guide people through personal channeling, poems and their life stories.=
 One of the mystics (also i deem him to be my first manasik guru - Shishuna=
la Shareefa) has once said - "why to walk when you have wings to fly?"=A0
T=
he spiritual path is so treacherous that sometimes i feel graduated and at =
times i am in kindergarten. It is useful if one is rigid enough to embrace =
tough standards for himself and at the same time also flexible enough to tr=
anscend it to embrace a simpler approach.=A0
Theoretically it is nice to fe=
el everything is maaya and everything is blissful - this attitude sometimes=
 manifests things to suit one's beliefs. Psychologically it leads to attach=
ment to pleasantries of life so much so that just the absence of it gives r=
ise to miseries of mind. To understand this you may try this food for 40day=
s - boiled rice and vegetables (not onions or garlic but dry ginger can be =
used) and ghee. You may witness how the mind disintegrates to reveal the ma=
aya that you are referring to. But be honest with the self - its the key to=
 get surprised of our own personality :)
I do not claim to understand in to=
to the methods i present here, nonetheless i have personally experimented t=
hem and discuss the results for want of further exposition on them.
Vaacha-=
jaala? i thought we were having a conversation my friend :)

The path throu=
gh which one falls can also rise :)

:) :)=A0
