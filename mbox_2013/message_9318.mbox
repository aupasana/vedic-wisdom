dear sir..from what i understand from certain serious tantrics i met....th=
ey told me that these beings cant come to you in a physical form at all....=
and if you r doing these type of sadhanas without a proper guru chances are=
 that nothing would happen at all.

you will be far better off with a human=
 companion....and gain far more doing normal worship.

and dont trust what =
you come across on the net on apsaras and yakshinis.a whole lot of male fan=
tasies get carried away with the nonsense being portrayed.

with regards...=
..and god bless.
