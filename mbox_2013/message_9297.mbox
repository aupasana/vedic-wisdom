Dear Respected Gurus, 

I have been recently studying the topic on Eclipses=
 and Akshaya Tritiya. 

The information which I found is: 

>From one side 1=
0 of May is a Solar Eclipse and it is considered that nothing serious shoul=
d not be started one week before and after the eclipse. 

On the other hand=
 Akshaya Tritiya is considered to be one of the best days to start new proj=
ects and beginnings. 

I would much appreciate if you could help me to cast=
 light on this topic and clarify what the truth is. Or else maybe you can g=
ive any source where it is possible to read about it. 

Thank you very much=
 for your help.

Tanita
