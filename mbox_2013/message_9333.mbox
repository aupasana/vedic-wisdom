=
In a very special event organized at Dada Mote Mandir, Village Bharthal,
Bi=
jwasan, Delhi, today on May 21, 2013, 482 Pakistani Hindu refugees were
hon=
ored with Yajnopaveet (Sacred Thread in Hinduism).  The program was
masterm=
inded by Dr D K Garg, eminent educationist and Head =96 Education &
Knowled=
ge Excellence (Agniveer). Dr D K Garg is leading the Agniveer
initiative fo=
r supporting Pakistani refugees.

The program got wholehearted support and =
leadership from various eminent
organizations and individuals. Dr Anil Arya=
, President =96 Arya Yuwak
Parishad conducted the event and galvanized supp=
ort from various quarters.
Several other educationists, industrialists and =
social activists joined in
this event.

These 482 Pakistani Hindus have tak=
en refuge in Delhi after fleeing from
Pakistan as result of unprecedented a=
nti Hindu wave there. Kindly visit
http://agniveer.com/pakistani-hindus-are=
-indias-responsibility/ to know
more about these families and difficulties =
they are facing currently.
Agniveer organized couple of medical camps last =
month for the families and
distributed medicines for free
http://agniveer.c=
om/agniveers-medical-camp-for-pakistani-hindus/ . Agniveer
also became inst=
rumental in helping 25 (now 70) Pakistani Girls get free
education upto gra=
duation in several Gurukuls. Here are the details
http://agniveer.com/free-=
education-for-pakistani-hindu-girls-agniveer-meets-pakistani-hindus/

But t=
oday was a historic day for two reasons. *These Hindus that,
unfortunately,=
 are called as =91Dalits=92, who were denied rights of practicing
their rel=
igion by fanatics, who were denied rights of performing rituals,
performed =
Yajna after taking Yajnopaveet (Sacred Thread) and broke stupid
notions of =
casteism.* They defied slavery of hundreds of years and now
vowed to live a=
 free and dignified life henceforth. All of them resolved to
leave meat, al=
cohol, addiction, smoking, gambling and follow examples like
Ram, Krishna, =
Hanuman and Dayanand. They also resolved to become Vedic role
models to att=
ract entire world to Vedas. They took oath of avenging
tortures on them in =
last 65 years in Pakistan by spreading Peace, tolerance
and showcasing why =
they love Hinduism, why they live for Hinduism and why
they can die for Hin=
duism.

*Today=92s event was a slap in the face of those who believe that w=
omen and
=91lower caste=92 people cant perform Yajna or cant have Yajnopave=
et/Janeu.
Yajnopaveets were distributed to all regardless of caste and gend=
er. And
Agniveer is committed to spearhead this crusade against caste and g=
ender
inequality till it ends.*

In his address, Shri Sanjeev Newar =96 Fou=
nder, Agniveer urged the Pakistani
refugees to be not just survivors but be=
 role models. He explained that
this Janeu Sanskar is a vow that they will =
not only assert their commitment
to Hinduism, but set such examples that wh=
ole world is attracted to
Hinduism. He urged them to understand what true H=
induism is, what a true
Arya is and become true Arya =96 noble ones. The Pa=
kistani brothers and
sisters agreed with wet eyes.

*Dr D K Garg asked them=
 to take a promise that they will shun all vices
forever  and say no to alc=
ohol, tobacco, smoking, meat. They all willfully
agreed. He also offered jo=
bs to 50 of them in his organization along with
home, electricity and every=
 other facility for dignified living. But they
must strive to be Vedic role=
 models =96 that was the precondition. *Many
other prominent people like Dr=
 Anil Arya, Shri Muni Pratap, Shri Mahender
Bhai,  Cap. Ashok Gulati, Shri =
Vidya Sagar Verma, Shri Ram Kumar, Shri
Subhash Dua, Shri Shishupal Arya, S=
hri Jagveer Arya, Shri Bhagat Singh
Rathi, Acharya Aman Singh Shastri, Shri=
 Jiwan Shastri, Shri Rajiv Param,
Shri Prem Kant Batra also encouraged peop=
le to live life in Vedic way.

Apart from Yajnopaveets, clothes were also d=
istributed to the families that
Agniveer=92s representatives have collected=
 from across India. Shri Ronak,
Shri Bipin and many other Agniveer represen=
tatives led the massive
campaigns for collecting clothes and medicines for =
this cause. Volunteers
from Spiritual and nationalistic organizations like =
Art of Living worked
hand in hand to make this campaign a success. Agniveer=
 thanks all
individuals and groups that helped in this Seva mission directl=
y or
indirectly. Once again many thanks to our Agniveers Bipin and Ronak fo=
r
their restless efforts.

Agniveer thanks from bottom of the heart to all =
those who made this event a
success. We thank Dr D K Garg who was the maste=
rmind behind this whole
event. We also thank Dr Anil Arya  for his invaluab=
le leadership in making
this event a success. And lastly we thank Ch Nahar =
Singh, modern day
Bhamashah, with folded hands who has been giving  shelter=
, protection and
doing everything for these brothers and sisters in distres=
s singlehanded.

*Good news is that after 70 children of these families hav=
e been offered
free education till graduation by Gurukul Noida, Gurukul Has=
anpur and
Gurukul Faridabad,  local administration has also agreed to provi=
de primary
education to all children of these families free of cost.* Child=
ren were
distributed school bags and books in today=92s event.

Agniveer th=
anks all of you for your support and love. We shall continue to
work for th=
e cause of humanity. Kindly visit this link to see pictures of
event http:/=
