rome)



    Namaste friends,
     
    Bhakti yoga or the path of surrende=
r and devotion is indeed more suitable in this age. I did not mean to say o=
therwise.
     
    But just having an ishta devata is not enough to be "pr=
otected" from deep and troublesome instabilities when one's body-mind compl=
ex goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring devotee becomes a =
Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji =
gave below for "psychological disorder", the second lady "did much sadhana =
of Srirama". Even those who think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up=
 with hallucinations, mental and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one=
's conditioning and desires!) interpretation of internal/external experienc=
es and even madness.
     
    True surrender/devotion to ishta devata will=
 definitely protect one, but cultivating it is as difficult as cultivating =
detachment through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment are almos=
t the same.
     
    This is why I said that *lightness of conditioning* i=
s the most important thing. One with dense conditioning will find SOME way =
to fail even if a great guru or god are ready to help.
     
    *        *=
        *
     
    Now, the question is: How do we reduce our conditioning=
? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantra=
s, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by reg=
ular introspection and self-improvement.
     
    Taking mind away from it=
s current pre-occupations (e.g. "I am smart", "I am doing good sadhana", "I=
 am mad at X", "I did not get what I deserve in Y", "I am better than X", "=
I must have Y at any cost" etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditi=
oning, for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning!
     
    To=
 reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualizatio=
n may work better for some people.
     
    One approach is to contemplate=
 god whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can imagine a be=
ing in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle/ideal/ab=
ility that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinating for th=
e mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects around that=
 are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind is ab=
out to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can try to c=
ontemplate god instead.
     
    Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says in the =
movie "Life of Pi" about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can't be trans=
formed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits!
     
   =
 Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks "the omnipresen=
t God is enjoying this thru this instrument" and starts contemplating the q=
ualities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sense objec=
ts, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whenever o=
ne is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks "the omnipresent Go=
d is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument" and starts con=
templating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone, one=
 is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on.
     
=
    In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. Eve=
ry now and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than ab=
out god ("*I* am doing this nice bhajan", "*I* am doing this nice homam", "=
I think *I* am making progress through this"). With effort and perseverance=
, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the supreme=
 power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long time to train a wild ani=
mal, it takes a long time to train mind!
     
    Try to develop devotion =
and surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/p=
rinciple of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate t=
hat concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When min=
d veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don't spend too much t=
ime dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into con=
templating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself.
     
=
    The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it ab=
out themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try =
to break free from it.
     
    *        *        *
     
    Finally, one=
 can try to overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actio=
ns that benefit a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from tru=
ly loving god is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our =
*limited* notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One wa=
y to overcome that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people ar=
ound us are as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with =
them, love them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to tran=
scend the limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God?

        Namaste friends,
         
        Someone with p=
sychiatric problems may expereience what sounds like a Kundalini rise, but =
it may or may not be one.
         
        It must be conceded though that=
 Kundalini spontaneously rising through various nadis without one having go=
ne through proper preparation in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one's attit=
ude and development of detachment) CAN create havoc!
         
        One =
may wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in a layman with no sadhana=
, while many serious sadhakas may not experience it.
         
        Firs=
tly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL STEP in overc=
oming one's current limited identity.
         
        Let me give an anal=
ogy. One wanting to move from one's small dilapidated house (this body-mind=
 complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace o=
ver time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasion=
ally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out=
 of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact,=
 it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in=
 it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without =
any out of body experiences. These are not my word's, but Maharshi Vasishth=
a's words to Lord Rama.
         
        Secondly, one does not get someth=
ing without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may ha=
ve deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enou=
gh effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepare=
d (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.
      =
   
        As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. =
Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constrain=
ts on what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous ac=
tions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longe=
r want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealt=
h one's whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. On=
e may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life aft=
er that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In a=
nother case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be rebo=
rn as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that =
experience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives, =
always "seeking" something they are "missing".
         
        Anyway, co=
ming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience giv=
en by a rising Kundalini and one's previous karmas constrain one from havin=
g it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire d=
estined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).
         
=
        *        *        *
         
        Kundalini rise is not necessa=
rily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and det=
achment.
         
        Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I w=
ent to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I w=
ent to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kil=
l it!
         
        We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap =
called this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a certain sl=
ow death!
         
        If our ideas about who we are (viz this current=
 body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this "infinite Self" as sha=
stras say, won't a complete realization of that at some stage involve stepp=
ing out of this body-mind complex, without being scared?
         
        =
*        *        *
         
        Kundalini rise after most undesirable=
 conditioning is overcome, is far better than Kundalini rise forced when so=
me really undesirable conditioning is still left in one's system.
         =

        When one transcends one problematic notion about who one is and wh=
at one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may sp=
ring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion "I am the =
body", there may be another notion in one's body-mind complex that one's aw=
areness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar,=
 a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep=
 desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a=
 re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one's self-awaren=
ess (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc.=
 The person may show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and=
 get stuck badly.
         
        An awakened Kundalini in a system with =
undesirable conditioning may accentuate one's weaknesses and wrong notions =
heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.
         
   =
     *        *        *
         
        The best approach I recommend is=
 to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome=
 your weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to em=
phasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people a=
round you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negativ=
e attachment.  
        Don't worry about whether your Kundalini rises or n=
ot. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripu=
s) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or not. If your ability to resist them is =
increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep,=
 you are still making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalin=
i (your self-awareness) will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her L=
ord (true Self).
         *        *        *
         
        One word on=
 surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most p=
eople do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may b=
e offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.
         
        =
"I want X, I will pray to you and please give it to me", "I am scared of Ku=
ndalini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me" - all this is just =
a business deal. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True s=
urrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True s=
urrender is losing oneself in one's fascination for the qualities of Lord. =
True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one's way (whether it is p=
leasurable or highly painful) as Lord's prasad and accepting it gratefully.=
 True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in =
the face of (and during) Death.
         
        If one without true surre=
nder and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, =
one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not tha=
t god does not want to "protect" one as said below. It is not about protect=
ing or endangering. If you go back to my "chipmunk glued to mouse trap" exa=
mple above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one's=
 conditioning makes one *run away* from God's protection! God's protection =
may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away f=
rom!
         
        *        *        *
         
        Whether throug=
h the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Reali=
ze that all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while=
 you have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anyt=

es, dislikes etc) can protect one as one's Kundalini rises to meet True Sel=
f. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one's nadis will distract rising Ku=
ndalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.

     The real key is how light your conditioning is.

            In Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few t=
hings going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the vari=
ous elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words t=
his translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness=
, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalin=
i awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with grea=
ter force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then tak=
es care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens =
- IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to var=
ious other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature whi=
le some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the in=
dividual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=
r and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=
s even more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an ex=
perience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of p=
sychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west t=
oday is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also po=
ssible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from var=
ious subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can g=
et "ruptured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifest=
yles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the=
 mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are v=
ery complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list =
down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, ve=
ry few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who clai=
m they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess wo=
rk. Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achi=
eved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Gr=

            Dear all, Just w=
anted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of=
 a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been i=
nvolved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous=
 awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-bod=
y experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin=
 and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she search=
ed for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wr=
ong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to derange=
d kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having=
 a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has =
triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. U=
nfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, an=
d as we have no treatments for deranged kundalini, we struggle to help them=
. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this l=
ady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. Thi=
s woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deran=
ged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something sh=
e cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her proble=
m. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the k=
undalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or gi=
ve her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans am=
ong you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- th=
eir suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so a=
s not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti=
 marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrumen=

amaste 
    friends,<BR> <BR>Bhakti yoga or the path of surrender and =
devotion is 
    indeed more suitable in this age. I did not mean to say 
 =
   otherwise.<BR> <BR>But just having an ishta devata is not enough to=
 be 
    "protected" from deep and troublesome instabilities when one's bod=
y-mind 
    complex goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring d=
evotee 
    becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the=
 two examples 
    Leelaji gave below for "psychological disorder", the sec=
ond lady "did much 
    sadhana of Srirama". Even those who think of a deit=
y and pray to him/her can 
    end up with hallucinations, mental and spiri=
tual disorders, wrong (colored 
    by one's conditioning and desires!) int=
erpretation of internal/external 
    experiences and even madness.<BR>&nbs=
p;<BR>True surrender/devotion to ishta 
    devata will definitely protect =
one, but cultivating it is as difficult as 
    cultivating detachment thro=
ugh wisdom! In fact, true surrender and 
    detachment are almost the same=
.<BR> <BR>This is why I said that 
    *lightness of conditioning* is =
the most important thing. One with dense 
    conditioning will find SOME w=
ay to fail even if a great guru or god are 
    ready to help.<BR> <BR=
>*        
    *    =
    *<BR> <BR>Now, the question 
    is: How do we redu=
ce our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single 
    magic bullet. T=
hinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can 
    help, but the=
y need to be augmented by regular introspection and 
    self-improvement.<=
BR> <BR>Taking mind away from its current 
    pre-occupations (e.g. "=
I am smart", "I am doing good sadhana", "I am mad at 
    X", "I did not ge=
t what I deserve in Y", "I am better than X", "I must have 
    Y at any co=
st" etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for 
    these t=
houghts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning!<BR> <BR>To reduce 
    th=
e regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualization may 
   =
 work better for some people.<BR> <BR>One approach is to contemplate g=
od 
    whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can imagine a=
 being in 
    your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle/=
ideal/ability 
    that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fasci=
nating for the mind 
    to contemplate that it does not care about other o=
bjects around that are 
    making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mi=
nd. Whenever mind is about to 
    entertain its regular debilitating pre-o=
ccupations, one can try to 
    contemplate god instead.<BR> <BR>Mind =
is a wild animal. As Pi says in 
    the movie "Life of Pi" about the tiger=
 on the boat, wild animals can't be 
    transformed or domesticated, but t=
hey can be trained into some 
    habits!<BR> <BR>Whenever one is enjo=
ying a sensual pleasure, if one 
    thinks "the omnipresent God is enjoyin=
g this thru this instrument" and 
    starts contemplating the qualities of=
 that god instead of thinking too much 
    about limited sense objects, on=
e is better placed to reduce the damage done 
    by shadripus. Whenever on=
e is angry at someone for what they did, if one 
    thinks "the omnipresen=
t God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that 
    instrument" and s=
tarts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of 
    being angry a=
t someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by 
    shadripus=
. And so on.<BR> <BR>In the beginning, even contemplation of 
    god =
becomes laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up 
    becom=
ing about oneself rather than about god ("*I* am doing this nice 
    bhaja=
n", "*I* am doing this nice homam", "I think *I* am making progress 
    th=
rough this"). With effort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about 
=
    oneself and keep it centered on the supreme power that runs the show. J=
ust 
    as it takes a long time to train a wild animal, it takes a long ti=
me to 
    train mind!<BR> <BR>Try to develop devotion and surrender. =
Based on all 
    that you read and heard, develop of a concept/principle o=
f god that is so 
    superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that c=
oncept as frequently as 
    possible, especially when meditating. When min=
d veers off into other things, 
    gently steer it back. Don't spend too m=
uch time dissecting what mind is 
    doing and why. Just put it back gentl=
y into contemplating god. Try to make 
    it about god rather than about y=
ourself.<BR> <BR>The main drawback of 
    the sadhana of most people =
is that they make it about themselves at some 
    level or the other. Thou=
gh that is unavoidable, try to break free from 
    it.<BR> <BR>* =
;       
    *     &=
nbsp;  *<BR> <BR>Finally, one can 
    try to overcome the limite=
d sense of self and engage in selfless actions 
    that benefit a larger s=
et of people than oneself. What stops us from truly 
    loving god is our =
deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our 
    *limited* notion=
 of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way 
    to overco=
me that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people 
    around u=
s are as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with 
    t=
hem, love them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to 
    =
transcend the limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent 
    God?<BR=

        friends,<BR> <BR>=
Someone with psychiatric problems may expereience 
        what sounds like=
 a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not be 
        one.<BR> <BR>It m=
ust be conceded though that Kundalini 
        spontaneously rising through=
 various nadis without one having gone 
        through proper preparation =
in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one's 
        attitude and development o=
f detachment) CAN create 
        havoc!<BR> <BR>One may wonder how Ku=
ndalini may spontaneously rise 
        in a layman with no sadhana, while =
many serious sadhakas may not 
        experience it.<BR> <BR>Firstly,=
 Kundalini rise is NOT an 
        achievement. It is just A SMALL STEP in =
overcoming one's current limited 
        identity.<BR> <BR>Let me giv=
e an analogy. One wanting to move from 
        one's small dilapidated hou=
se (this body-mind complex) to a huge palace 
        (realized Self) may f=
irst construct the palace over time and move into 
        it when it is CO=
MPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays 
        in the pal=
ace still under construction (analogy for out of body 
        experiences =
due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it 
        comes wi=
th risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in 
        it=
. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization 
        wi=
thout any out of body experiences. These are not my word's, but 
        Ma=
harshi Vasishtha's words to Lord Rama.<BR> <BR>Secondly, one does 
   =
     not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient effort 
  =
      towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previou=
s 
        life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be get=
ting it 
        now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not eve=
n want it!) 
        when it comes in this life.<BR> <BR>As you do sad=
hana, try not to 
        fancy too many specific desires. Nature has a del=
ay mechanism in 
        granting your desires (because of constraints on w=
hat Nature can give 
        you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous =
actions). So Nature 
        sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when y=
ou no longer want it or 
        want something else. For example, one may =
pray for great wealth one's 
        whole life and be born as a rich but v=
ery sick man in next life. One may 
        not enjoy that wealth and pray =
whole life for health. In the life after 
        that, one may be very hea=
lthy, but not have any knowledge or money.

   unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of

            origin and had never heard of =
kundalini until her symptoms started 
            and she searched for an e=

            anything physically =
wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might 
            be that this is=

            mentally ill d=

            unwanted s=

            Unfortuna=

uggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the 
            kunda=
lini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that 
            k=
undalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill 
        =
    herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is 
   =
         so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she

          cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to he=

            problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, w=
ho 
            manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this=
 woman- 
            and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear =
this. May I 
            request that the good samaritans among you pray fo=

            others like her (whom we may not know of)- thei=
r suffering really is 
            pitiable. And let us be careful in our s=
