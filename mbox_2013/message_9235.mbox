  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Help needed - Please respond


    

  Dear friends,

  I need a big help and very urgent. My friend is in a deep marriage crisis and she strongly feels that she has some strong karma that is taking a big tool on her life. She is very depressed and is looking for some divine intervention. 

  I was wondering if there are any avadhutas living in south india that she can go to and get some relief. Any help in this matter would be really appreciated.

  Please respond as soon as you can.

  Thanks
  Bhakta.
