Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
Ajit's reply to Digamber ji's nice questions is tho=
ughtful. I will add my 2 cents.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =
=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0The cosmos runs based on the fundamental law th=
at each action (karma) gives a reaction/result (karmaphala) commensurate wi=
th it. Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various agendas engag=
ing in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purusha is the =
witness of it all.
=C2=A0
Though each karma should give karmaphala that is =
commensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the karmaphala, i=
.e. another being. So this requires a complicated balancing act on part of =
Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very compl=
icated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking of age=
nts for their delivery.

=C2=A0
At any time, some karmas from one's past ar=
e placed in a "must experience karmaphala in this life" pool, some karmas i=
n a "preferably experience karmaphala in this life" pool and the rest in th=
e third pool which may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are =
assigned and ordered in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karm=
aphala sequencing of all beings.
=C2=A0
The assignment and ordering of thes=
e pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in various new actions=
 and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one's life, possibil=
ities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may change and =
hence the pools may be re-arranged.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
As one en=
gages in remedial measures such as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may=
 transform one's nature, change one's vulnerabilities or re-arrange one's d=
ynamics with other beings (including planets, deities etc, who are the subt=
le agents of delivery of karmaphala, who operate through other people who a=
ct as physical agents of delivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as =
a result. Some undesirable karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or push=
ed down in order within the same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upg=
raded to a higher pool or pushed up in order within the same pool.
=C2=A0Wh=
en someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient mental force behind it (t=
his is the key), the same thing can happen. It is all about re-arranging ka=
rmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or even people around o=
ne, has the potential to re-arrange one's karmik pools. A karma about to gi=
ve karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karmaphala a=
nytime soon may be advanced sooner.
=C2=A0
However, remember that the remed=
ial measure has to be as intense as the karma that it is trying to manipula=
te. You can move a small rock with small force, but you need a large force =
to move a big rock or a hill.
=C2=A0

If there is no negative karma in one'=
s pool that can give a specific result, nobody can make one experience that=
 result, no matter what ritual one does. However, even great souls have a l=
ot of negative karmas in their optional pool and even evil people have a lo=
t of positive karmas in their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, c=
urses and blessings can often make some difference.
=C2=A0
This point is we=
ll illustrated by the "Guru Charitra" story Digamber ji referred in his poi=
nt (3).
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
If one thinks that one can escape the =
fruits of one's actions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings=
, who may show favoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The =
He-aspect of God is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-as=
pect of God is the power that impartially and impassionately manages the fi=
ne balance and order within this play of actions and fruits. All beings are=
 equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of saint=
s. She administers just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using av=
ailable agents.
=C2=A0
The karmas we committed in the past are already in t=
he pipeline and will give their results sooner or later. The best we can do=
 with them, with some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most=
 important thing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now.=
 Simply put, selfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others =
are bad karmas and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or bene=
fit to others are good karmas.
=C2=A0
When it comes to manipulating the pre=
-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort =
and current action, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are availabl=
e in shastras, but we can't be certain about the specific impact of each ac=
tion. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has t=
o be commensurate with the karma itself.
=C2=A0
You need only small force t=
o push a cat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.

Narasimha

 they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?
>>(3) I recollect =
an episode from famous "Gurucharitra" (well known in Maharashtra), wherein =
a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru "If we cannot change `parabdha, =
then, why do we worship God at all". At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates he=
r dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the=
 karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word=
, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memory]. So question I =
have is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to a great extent or it is just =
our perception that changes?

(2) On similar note, what happens when you get `bl=
essings' say from a saint or elders? We also come across lot of tantric ite=
ms like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 wha=
t do this items really do if they work? Something similar with wearing gems=
tones for planets =E2=80=93 do they bring forward good karmas or they creat=
e new ones?<br>


(3) I recollect an episode from famous "Gurucharitra" (we=
ll known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Gur=
u "If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all". At t=
hat point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shisy=
a, that he has only readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me=
 if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episod=
e from old memory]. So question I have is, does our sadhana change karmapha=
l to a great extent or it is just our perception that changes?<br>
