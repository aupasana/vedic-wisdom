Dear shri Narasimha ji,

   As always, thanks for your excellent writeup! =
You did cleared up some
of my very doubts and I am thankful for that!

For =
some further clarification, i stumbled upon this ebook, which I like
to sha=
re, as it sheds light regarding duty, karmayoga etc 
http://www.vivekananda=
.net/PDFBooks/EightLecturesKarmaYoga.pdf
<http://www.vivekananda.net/PDFBoo=
ks/EightLecturesKarmaYoga.pdf>

I also made some notes, in case someone doe=
sn't have chance to read
through the book, please forgive omissions and err=
ors. Blue comments are
for neural association only and are not from the boo=
k.



    * Result of pleasure and pain is what is called man's "character"=
.
    * The external world is simply the suggestion, the occasion, which
se=
ts you to study your own mind, but the object of the study is always
your o=
wn mind.
    * There are certain works which are, as it were, the aggregate=
, the
sum total, of a large number of smaller works. (seashore sound <-- so=
und
of millions of minute waves) Every pulsation of the heart is making is
=
work; certain works we feel and they become tangible to us, they are, at
th=
e same time, the aggregate of a number of small works.
    * Every fool bec=
omes hero at one time or another. Watch a man do his
most common actions; t=
hose will tell you the real character of a great
man.
    * The Karma in ef=
fects on character is the most tremendous power that
man has to deal with.
=

    * All actions are manifestation of will. Will is made by character,
ch=
aracter is manufactured by Karma, which is manifestation of
will.(circular =
reference?)

    * A man may buy all the books in the world, but he will on=
ly be able
to read those he deserves, and this deserving is produced by kar=
ma.
    * Our karma determines what we deserve and what we can assimilate.
=
    * What is use of learning how to work? Everyone works! But, there is
su=
ch a thing as frittering away our energies. Knowing how to do work
that wil=
l bring greatest results.
    * There cannot be work without motive
    * W=
ork for work's sake. He is the highest gainer, more paying in
physical valu=
e as well.
    * Love, truth and unselfishness are not only moral figures, =
but are
highest ideals because they are such manifestations of power.
    *=
 Restraint will produce a gigantic will, that character which makes
a world=
 move.
    * When wanting to help, never think what the mans attitude shoul=
d be
toward you.

    * Ideal man is he who in midst of greatest silence fi=
nds intensest
activity, and vice versa: the secret of restraint.

    * Tam=
as: inactivity

    * Rajas: activity
    * Sattva: calm, sweet, gentle, co=
ntrolling both T and R
    * Plants, animal, men all governed by these 3 T,=
R,S

    * Karma yoga has to deal with these 3 elements

    * Morality and=
 duty: according to mental constitution or the
different plane of existence=
, duty and morality may vary. (There is no
universal morality and duty).
  =
  * There are gradations of duty and morality: what is duty of one
state of=
 line in one set of circumstances will not be that of another.
    * The ma=
n who has begun to hate himself, the gate to degeneration has
been opened!
=
    * To advance, we must have

    *  faith in ourselves first (1) and

  =
  * then faith in God (2) and

    * not hate our self.

    * Two extremes=
 are very similar. (too low of light, or too bright:
you can't see)

    * =
Like was there is different in resistance (can strike, but do not)
and non-=
resistance ( can resist but do not)

    * One who resist (not from weaknes=
s, but willingly) commits a sin.

    * Inactivity should be avoided by all=
 means. (tamas?)Activity means
resistance.
    * Until you've passed throug=
h that activity , (fulfill the desire)
will come the time when you know thi=
s are little things, and you come to
state of calmness/serenity.
    * Unit=
y in variety is the plan of creation. (religion, caste,
species)
    * I sh=
ould not be judged by your standards, nor you be mine (apple to
apple compa=
rison)
    * Helping man

    * spiritual knowledge is the highest help tha=
t can be given to him.
(give man a fish vs. teach to fish)
    * Next to sp=
iritual comes intellectual help.
    * Next to intellectual help is physica=
l help.

    * Non-attachment to work

    * Samskara =3D=3D=3D tendency (d=
ependent probability(not a chance based))

    * Every ripple in mind marks=
 an impression, even when we are not
obvious on surface, these marks are su=
fficiently strong to work beneath
the surface, sub-consciously.
    * What =
we are at each moment =3D sum total of all impressions up to
that point in =
mind (including ones from past lives.)  this is what
really what is meant b=
y character.
    * Bad marks of mind should be conquered by fresh waves of =
good mark
(Present is most powerful<-Yoga Vasistha), until those that are e=
vil are
almost disappeared/subdued. But after that good tendencies have als=
o to
be conquered. The attached must become unattached! (when I take one
th=
rone out of my hand using another throne, I must then throw away
"both" thr=
ones).

    * Work , but let not the action or thought produce a deep impre=
ssion
in mind/soul.

    * Attachments are made because of associations (ne=
ural net?) if I
remember someone just with one  glimpse and found hundred o=
f kindred
things inside my mind, such being the case, a deep impression wil=
l be
immediately made upon mind.
    * Work as if you were stranger in this=
 land, work incessantly, but do
not bind yourself.

    * The very reason f=
or nature's existence is for the education of
soul; it has no other meaning=
.

    * With love there is no painful reaction.
    * If you can incessant=
ly take that position that you are a giver,
that everything given by you is=
 a free offering to the world, without
any thought of return, it will not b=
ring attachment. Attachment only
comes when we expect something!

    * Dut=
y

    * Do the duty which is our by birth and we've done that, do the duty=

that is by our position.
    * Duty is seldom sweet. Duty is sweet only th=
rough love.
    * A man should not be judged by nature of his duties but by=
 the
manner in which he does them.

    * Our duty to others mean helping o=
thers, doing good to the world.
But we really only help ourselves. This wor=
ld is not made that we should
come and help! World is perfect (normalized, =
reached local/global
maxima), it is perfectly fitted to meet its ends. It d=
oes not need any
help from us, Yet we must do good.

    * Be grateful when=
 a helping opportunity arise! So that helping cause
, you help yourself by =
being good. It is the only way we can become
perfect.
    * Always remember=
 curly tail of dog when you have tendency to become
fanatic. You need not w=
orry or make yourself sleepless, the world will
go on.
    * It is level-he=
aded man, calm man of good judgment and cool nerves,
of great sympathy and =
love, who does good work.
    * (Same space/time) Good mind/thought, vs. ba=
d mind/ thought resonate
each other.. If you are tune to a frequency, someo=
ne broadcasting on
that frequency, you will pick that up.
    * (Across tim=
e) thought waves may travel hundreds of years until they
meet with an objec=
t with which they vibrate in unison (resonance).
    * When man is doing ev=
il action, he has brought his mind to certain
state of tension (resonance )=
, and all waves corresponding to that
tension that are already in atmospher=
e, will struggle to enter his mind!
So, this has two fold danger (receiver+=
 transmitter), first we open
ourselves to all the evil influences surroundi=
ng us; second we create
similar waves which will affect others!!!

    * Th=
e action one has done cannot be destroyed unit it has borne
fruit!

    * A=
 perfect life is a contraction in terms. This compound struggle
between som=
ething inside and external world is what we call life.
    * The highest id=
eal is eternal and entire self-abnegation. Karma yoga
leads to that.
    * =
Pravritti (revolving towards you being the center: selfish) : evil
(me my m=
ine)
    * Nivritti (revolving away from me : selfless) : good .
    * Self=
ishness is world, unselfishness is God.
    * All actions bear good and evi=
l at the same time! We cannot put a
line of demarcation and say this action=
 is entirely good and this
entirely evil. We cannot breathe or live without=
 injuring others.
    * Any action that is not done for your own sake, what=
ever it be, will
have no effect on you! Any action that you do for yourself=
 will bring an
effect on you!

    * Helping ourselves via Work

    * Give=
 up idea of attachment (as an ordinary nurse, who take care of
your kid, bu=
t walks away when done.)
    * Do not mix in the fray: hold yourself as wit=
ness only!

    * Give up fruits of work unto the lord
    * The only duty =
is to be unattached and to work as free beings

    * Everything you do und=
er compulsion is attachment

    * Don't get attached. Its attachment comes=
 all our pain.

    * Don't get pride in that someone is dependent upon you=
.
    * No-one in this universe depends upon us. They are all helped and
wi=
ll be helped even if millions of us were not here.
    * Helping other is a=
 privilege.

    * World does not require any help from you. When you have =
trained
your nerves and your muscles to this idea, there will be no reactio=
n in
the form of pain.
    * Nothing in the universe has power over you unt=
il you admit it.!!
    * So by non-attachment, you deny the power of anythi=
ng to act upon
you.
    * First hear, then think, and then practice. Practi=
ce is the key.
Many things that you do not understand , by constant hearing=
 , will be
made clear.
    * The explanation of everything is in yourself. =
No one was ever
taught by another; each one of us has to teach himself!! Th=
e external
teacher is only the suggestion which rouses internal teacher (Ag=
ni?)to
understand things.

Sanchita means "piled up". Prarabdha karmas are different in the s=
ense
that their fructification has already begun. The verb "prArabh" means
=
"to begin". Its noun form "prArambha" means "beginning" and its gerund
noun=
 form "prArabdha" means "the [one that was] begun". Prarabdha karmas
are ac=
tions for which the process of reaction has already begun and in
the pipeli=
ne. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up karmas that have not
kicked off th=
eir fruits yet. They can be delayed indefinitely. If one
becomes liberated =
while living, one can merge in Cosmic Self without
experiencing the fruits =
of sanchita karmas. However, fruits of prarabdha
karmas are already in the =
pipeline and need to be experienced even by a
liberated being.
> >>=C2

Though fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline, even
they ca=
n actually be delayed or manipulated. Bottomline is that there
are agents o=
f delivery at the physical and subtle level even for things
deep in the pip=
eline and hence some limited adjustment is possible.
