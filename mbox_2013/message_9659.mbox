=C2=A0I agree with your explanation of all four different types of yoga and=
 also bhakti yoga being the safest of all kinds. Dont you think all these y=
ogas are NOT an end in itself but to prepare the mind for awakening?? The p=
urpose behind all this should be to free oneself from karmic bindings and b=
e free of the =C2=A0bondage. That has to be the core purpose of any type of=
 yoga. To be free is to be awakened.=C2=A0

No matter what path you follow =
ultimately there should be a perception where one sees the thought for what=
 it is and there is a cleansing of the action. And there will be no karma w=
hen you are NOT bound to the action. Now does these four types of yogas pre=
pare one for this perception or at least create more probability or mental =
states where such a thing is possible. I am not sure.=C2=A0

Your movie ana=

=C2=A0 
Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
I am cc=
'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup because of the spiritual content.
=C2=
=A0
I agree with Vishnu ji's comment on a specific point in Maja ji's nice =
write-up:
=C2=A0
> > *Also, one is supposed to choose only one ayana for on=
e lifetime and
> > master it to as perfect as possible. *

ble and in fact is a measure of self realized people.
=C2=A0
Indeed, one ca=
n carve one's own niche by combining multiple paths. They are not meant to =
be mutually exclusive.
=C2=A0
I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "R=
aja Yoga" where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:
=C2=A0
"Each soul is pot=
entially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by controllin=
g
 nature: external and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psyc=
hic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free=
."
=C2=A0
Here are my 2 cents.
=C2=A0
Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophiza=
tion and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga em=
phasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devoti=
on and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and tr=
y to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control a=
nd surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qua=
lities develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Final=
ly, a realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these q=
ualities fully blossomed.
=C2=A0
Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa,=
 nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja =
yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controlling=
 body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requ=
ires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, w=
ater and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga=
 can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitl=
y taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IM=
HO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taug=
ht it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.
=C2=A0=

Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into th=
e delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/hone=
st/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I am Bra=
hman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion anywa=
y" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality=
 in consciousness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a movie =
that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in every scary scen=
e, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and e=
arnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant cont=
emplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to =
the end.
=C2=A0
IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yo=
ga are the most suitable and safest.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
