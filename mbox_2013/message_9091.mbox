Dear all,

I do think, that in the midst of our spiritual striving, we have=
 to remember that there are hundreds of millions of people who are sufferin=
g, some much more than us.

Given the sea of misery around us, it seems imp=
ortant that every japa, every homam, every pooja, every prayer that we do o=
ught to be dedicated to the welfare of all creation without exception.

We =
seek liberation. Liberation from what? From 'me' and 'mine'. Surely the fir=
st step is to break down the barriers between us. Your suffering has to bec=
ome my suffering. Otherwise there is no oneness. It's just a word. If you'r=
e hungry, and I really feel one with you, I've got to do something about yo=
ur hunger. Half the world is dying of starvation, and the other half is dyi=
ng of diseases due to overeating. The half that are overeating are generall=
y unaware and/or uninterested in the ones that are starving in front of the=
m. It's a tragedy.

We live surrounded by beggars, homeless people, sick pe=
ople, dying people. (How many live near you? Are you doing something for th=
em?) The West is in many ways as miserable as the East- it seems that pract=
ically 50% of people here are on antidepressants. 

We can serve the suffer=
ing in 3 ways. In thought, word and action. We are not noble charity worker=
s, living in rural places, striving day and night to feed the hungry and gi=
ve clothes to the naked. We are not of much help in terms of action and wor=
d. 

The least we can do is send them positive thoughts via prayer, japa, h=
omam and pooja. Let us at least be generous in thought, even if we cannot b=
e in action. 

And hopefully, most crucially, we will be one day moved to g=
ood action. May be help build a free clinic in a rural part of India or Afr=
ica, provide a scholarship for deserving kids from poorer backgrounds, set =
up a soup kitchen for the homeless/beggars. SOMETHING that actually creates=
 some good in this miserable world of ours.

The path to realisation accord=
ing to Sivananda and many other yogis is SERVE, Love, Give, Purify, Meditat=
e and Realise. Service comes first. There is no spirituality without servic=
e. 

If all the homams and japas we do, don't create a feeling that "others=
 suffering is my suffering" i.e. genuine Oneness, then there's a long way y=
et to go in our journey. This feeling slowly develops, but we have to make =
a start somewhere. May be just by small acts of service, like buying food f=
or someone who is hungry and can't afford a meal.

Gandhi said, "Fie on tha=
t man who uses his rosary while the man next to him is starving." 

I think=
 real spirituality must involve providing basic practical help to others. F=
ood, education, clothes (when I was in India last month, I hear some childr=
en froze to death in Delhi), whatever we can give. It is as important as ho=
mam and japa. It is nothing less than feeding and clothing the living God. =


Homam and japa is meant to purify us so we give generously. And giving do=
es sometimes involve an element of sacrifice.

I've always loved the Bodhic=
itta concept in Buddhism. This idea that one even desires enlightenment, no=
t for one's own sake, but for the sake of all sentient beings. The yogis pr=
ayer is also wonderful "I do not wish even for liberation. I wish only to b=
e Your instrument, and to do Thy will."

Sivananda says "Surrender everythi=
ng unto Him. Place your ego at His feet and be at ease. He will take comple=
te charge of you. Let Him mould you in any way He likes. Let Him do exactly=
 as He wills. He will remove all defects and weaknesses. He will play beaut=
ifully in this body flute. Hear the marvellous music of the flute of the Lo=
rd-the mysterious music of the soul-and rejoice."
