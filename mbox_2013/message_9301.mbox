Namaste,
=C2=A0There is very clearly an evolutionary pattern in the choice =
of the bodies taken by Vishnu - fish, turtle, pig, lion-man, dwarf, man. Ho=
wever, I do not agree with the thinking that spiritual power evolved from M=
atsyavatara to Buddhavatara (or Krishnavatara if you don't like Buddha and =
drop him). It rather shows that the highest spiritual power can use ANY FOR=
M as the vessel, based on the need on earth. After all, Vishnu in a boar wa=
s 100% divine, whereas Vishnu in a man (e.g. Parasu Rama or Buddha) was not=
 100% divine.
=C2=A0

Two additional points:
=C2=A0
(1) Speculations of pal=
eontologists about millions of years back need to be taken with a load of s=
alt.
(2) I hope you won't propose that there was also a phase when turtles =
ruled the world before that(unless you are talking about Ninja turtles :-),=
 in which case they did rule the world a few decades back!).
=C2=A0
The bot=
tomline is that it is not necessary that there be phases when pigs or turtl=
es or fish ruled earth, for Vishnu to take that form.
=C2=A0

On many subtle points, your mail was very thought provoking. And I am sure =
I will keep pondering over various hints for quite some time. But one point=
 I want to make about Vedanta. I agree totally with you.

>Vedanta is the=
 philosophy, not only of Shankara Adwaitha, but also that of Ramanujacharya=
, Madhavacharya, Chaitanya, Vallavacharya as well as the TantrAs. They are =
all Vedantas.

>Quite simple put, there are two fundamental states of pure=
 consciousness. Static, and dynamic. Purusha and Shakti. The static conscio=
usness is same all around in everything, from the highest Avatara to the lo=
west stone. But the dynamic aspect of consciousness is NOT same in everythi=
ng.
>
>Ramakrishna used to say, Kali in present in everyone, but Her Shakti=
 is not same in everyone! This crucial point lies in the heart of Tantric V=
edanta philosophy. By the process of sadhana,
 this dynamic aspect of consc=
iousness can be enhanced in an individual. This is the eternal purification=
 of individual Chit-Shakti. The purer it is, the stronger it becomes. This =
also accommodates for the idea of vigyana. 
>
>That is why however much sad=
hana a person may do, he/she will never ever attain to the level of a Rama =
or a Krshna. Its practically impossible. The difference is in their levels =
of individualized chit-shakti. Or that of a Rishi. Their Chit-Shakit is so =
powerful, so pure, so free, that it can identify with the Universe and do t=
hings which are impossible to imagine. Which we cannot. Ever.

avataras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings =
(e.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre u=
nderstanding what various deities stand for, what forces play a role in cre=

>>=
1.Can you please explain in what way the Hamsa Avatara, or the Nara-Narayan=
a Avatara, or the Dhanwantari Avatara or the Balarama Avatara or Mohini (wh=
o did a great job of denying Asuras share of amrita) is any less "sustainin=
g" than Matsya or Varaha Avtara that they should not find a place in the li=
st of Dasavataras? All of them are mentioned as Avataras of the Supreme Bei=
ng in SB.
>>
>>2. What is your opinion about the general stated idea that o=
nly Krshna is 16 kala-poorna and others are not?
>>
>>3. That the SB mentio=
ns Krshna as Swayam Bhagwan ONLY with respect to the previous sloka where i=
t says that all rishis, munis etc are also Avataras, is one interpretation,=
 and not too popular at that. OTOH, most of the great commentators, and the=
y were no less in their
 spiritual merit
 or intellectual prowess have take=
n that specific verse to mean Krshna to be greater than ALL Avataras. The v=
erse itself does not mention that it is with respect to the previous verse,=
 or with respect to all the 17 verses that precede it, which lists all Avat=
aras. So it boils down to interpretation based on individual conditioning. =
It seems Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, etc all shared a si=
milar conditioning which made them read that verse to mean that only Krshna=
 is Swayam Bhagwan. Would you agree to this conclusion? :) 
>>
>>4. Apparen=
tly in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Suta tells the Rishis of Naimisharanya t=
hat Krshna is greatest Avatara of them all. So, how do we resolve this appa=
rent conflict between what Rishi Parashara states and what this Purana stat=
es? If it is a matter of personal choice, then of course matter ends here.

 Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no le=

 In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 1=

ali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,on=
ce he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were composed a=
fter this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]

>>>>>>3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance=
. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Bud=
dha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequen=
ce of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aqua=
tic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to =
the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of th=
is earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Paras=
hurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to th=
e Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not =
to be separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the=
 various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousnes=

 naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage =
of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of m=
uch easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic =
mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the =
animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force =
for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there =
can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature=
 and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ra=
mayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He d=
id have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispel=
led by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At th=
e end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner,=
 that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it
 was the Dharma to do so, =
and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when h=
e lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly =
to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as=
 a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to=
 it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminat=
ed into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, =
such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn th=
e Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, O=
TOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=
=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant det=
achment from situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances =
that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for=
 Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,
 his village-folks who so lo=
ved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the =
shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into =
an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then =
he understood that they won't understand, he promised he will return back o=
nce his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when=
 the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged=
. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krs=
hna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to e=
veryone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala =
abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling=
 and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shis=
hupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly ac=
cused Krshna of being a revolutionist
 and charlatan, Krshna did not kill h=
im. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician,=
 wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of =
kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was b=
ack into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one i=
nstance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivoc=
ation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others sa=
y or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had =
the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. Tha=
t is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yo=
gi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the actio=
n nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away from the batt=
le-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart J=
arashanda, or gesturing Bheema
 to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getti=
ng Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew e=
xactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the destructio=
n of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational think=
ing. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Un=
iversal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama =
Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut=
 Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different =
picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama=
 after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes=
 the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramay=
ana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is th=
e embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great character=
istics of satwa, chief
 of which is self-control, as well as the occasional=
 sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until R=
avana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint,=
