If one ponders over carefully, Swami Chidananda Saraswati's views are not t=
o be seen limited to destiny of man, but more expansively about the great c=
osmic intelligence that is behind all activities in the creation.
Man's des=
tiny lies not in remaining trapped in a cyclical movement as one may superf=
icially think. As he himself clarified:'man's destiny is a PROCESS of going=
 back the source and original' the 'original state of perfection and freedo=
m', a process of evolution.
A perpetual cyclic movement has no finality. A =
linear process of evolution has the ultimate objective of a destination.
By=
 consecrating oneself to be an intelligent participant to the process (that=
 is what yoga is all about)is what sanatan philosophy recognises as our ult=
imate achievement - our birth right, which all of us shall achieve one day =
by the grace of the Lord Brahman. - Sri BImal Mohanty 9.4.13 (bimalmohanty@=
