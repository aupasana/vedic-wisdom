Sirs, those of you experienced in Mantra Sadhana kindly reply 
to this. Is =
it ok if I do mantra japa lying on bed comfortably? Or 
should it always be=
 in a a seated positon? Because, lying on 
bed comfortably, I can do far mo=
re number of rounds than 
sitting up. Also, I can concentrate entirely on m=
antra being 
chanted that way. Also I read somewhere Anga nyasa, Kara 
nyas=
a etc.are not necessary, just chanting the specified 
mantra is adequate. W=
hat's your opinion on this?
