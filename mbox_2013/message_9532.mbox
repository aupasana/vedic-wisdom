Namaste Durgesh,
=C2=A0
There is no single answer. We are always pulled in =
different directions by different rinas and dharmas. One needs to JUDGE whi=
ch dharma is higher and which rina is more important.

=C2=A0
Depending on =
one's individual circumstances, one of the following may be the best option=
:
=C2=A0
(1) Ignore the complaining wife/husband. Don't fight or argue, but=
 keep doing your sadhana. As time progresses, (a) she may see the positive =
change in your attitude and stop complaining, (b) she may just get used to =
it and accept her fate, (c) she may keep complaining and YOU may get used t=
o that complaints and accept your fate.
=C2=A0
(2) Talk to her/him and find=
 some compromise that is acceptable. Instead of doing 1 hour sadhana, may b=
e do half hour and spend more time doing something she likes.
=C2=A0
(3) Gi=
ve up your idea of sadhana and take whatever you are able to do, as sanctio=
ned by your wife/husband, as your sadhana. For example, cooking, cleaning d=
ishes, washing clothes, taking her to a movie, massaging her feet, taking k=
ids to activities etc can also be sadhanas.
=C2=A0
Any activity can be done=
 with a protesting/dissenting attitudeor an agitated mind, or with love and=
 caring and a calm and composed mind. Every activity involves interacting w=
ith some objects. Just as god is in idol and fire, he is in vegetables you =
cut, food you cook, feet you massage etc. If you see an action as a chore o=
r look at it or its object(s) with an impure mind (e.g. with lust or with a=
nger or with frustration) or focus more of your attention on yourself, then=
 it becomes impure. If you approach the action with a calm and devoted mind=
, see the action and its object(s)with love, devotion and caring and focus =
the more of your attention on the action and its objects (rather than youse=
lf and your own happiness), then it becomes a ritual or sadhana.
=C2=A0
Of =
course, in some actions one hates, it is very difficult to bring that calmn=
ess and caring. In some other actions (e.g. sex), one may become too selfis=
h or self-absorbed and think too much about one's own sensations, to look a=
t the action and other persons/objects with love, caring, devotion.

=C2=A0=

Thus, we normally don't talk about converting all actions into sadhana and=
 talk about japam, homam etc. It is easier in those to look at the action a=
nd its objects with a sense of purity and devotion. However, if that is not=
 possible and one has to do some other actions, why note TRY to convert the=
m into sadhana? Try to perform the action with a calm, stable, selfless min=
d, focus attention on the action and its objects and imbibe love and caring=
 into your thinking.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
In fact, at some stage,=
 (3) has to become part of one's sadhana. One has to convert every action i=
nto a sadhana. Just doing japam or homam for an hour or two may not cut it.=

=C2=A0
If you live in a really cold country, your room can get very cold. =
If you turn the heater on for an hour everyday and keep it off rest of the =
time, the room will overall be very cold. Similarly, if you do sadhana for =
an hour, you may feel better, but the normal attitude returns. To make perm=
anent progress, the heater has to be on most of the day! Of course, as you =
cannot do japam or homam for 12 hours a day, you have to convert whatever y=
ou do (eating, driving to work, your work, driving back, cooking, eating, t=
alking to people, etc) into sadhana. At some stage, every seeker will have =
to start doing it.

=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
