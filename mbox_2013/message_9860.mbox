Namaste,

To add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understand=
ing of the reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems. =
Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific momen=
ts from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external conscio=
usness. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any oppor=
tunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be re=
called. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved=
 and new set is generated based on need.

The Buddhists do not believe in t=
he existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our id=
ea of Atmah. Therefore their idea of reincarnation is very different. It is=
 like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together to giv=
e the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegrated=
 and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can c=
oalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can si=
multaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. =C2=
=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to=
 have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while another =
part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a L=
ama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his ener=
gy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnating=
 in another person and all these
 happening simultaneously! It fits with th=
eir philosophy.

Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a reinca=
rnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed o=
nly by a supreme law of debts/balances - rna. Hence rnabandhana. Jain scrip=
tures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid o=
f the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. T=
here is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency to=
wards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.

But the ol=
d Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at =
death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to another a=
nd the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul's i=
nfluence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle=
 for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul =
- for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *co=
nsciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=
=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is 
not the ultimate aim, it is only one a=
mong many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state 
of complete ne=
gation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then there was j=
ust no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex life-actions. The l=
aw of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of give a=
nd take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The important =
thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to =
the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediately. =
Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is wh=
y a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can transfo=
rm himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a hu=
ndred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. Whereas tho=
se aspects of life 
where the soul has no play or no scope of play, are fir=
mly governed by 
the law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of en=
ergy. 

Now since the soul is what remembers and everything else being peri=
shable, the only indestructible link between past life and present life, it=
 is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete cine=
matic biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there have been l=
ives when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all, then those=
 are dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. For Nature, tho=
se lives serve no purpose at all. 


Moreover all these are possible ONLY i=
f and when an individual starts living in and through the soul in a very ve=
ry strong manner. That is not easy. 

-Regards

Namaste,
=C2=A0
I know those who a=
re excited by these new age ideas like "past life regression" will be badly=
 upset with honest views, but let me state my view.

=C2=A0
It is possible =
to remember past life. 
However, if such memory does not come at a very you=
ng age due to some deep 
desires from past life or an unnatural death befor=
e, it is not easy to get it later. Even for a great yogi with tremendous se=
lf-control, calming the mind down to suppress 
current conditioning suffici=
ently to remember past life is not easy.
=C2=A0
For example, at least 3 sai=
nts/yogis of a high spiritual caliber claimed to be re-incarnations of Rama=
krishna Paramahamsa. If such saints cannot accurately know their own past l=
ife, anybody thinking that someone else can make one aware of one's past li=
fe is just kidding oneself.
=C2=A0
Remembering past life or making someone =
else do so, is not at all easy. In comparison, hallucinating that one remem=
bered past life or making someone else 
hallucinate that one remembered pas=
t life, is certainly very easy! In fact, I suspect that is what happens in =
most past life regressions..

=C2=A0
There is a deep reason why 
Nature has=
 built this mechanism of forgetting a life when another life 
starts. Other=
wise, this game will end very quickly. This forgetfulness prolongs the game=
 very much and makes it far more interesting.
=C2=A0
Best regards,

It also suggests contacting the following for help. The extract from the FA=

p are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spiri=
t of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person tryi=
ng to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.
>>>
>=
>>These things like removing possession are specializations. These do not f=
all under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is ge=
tting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay =
away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to
 hand=
le the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time til=
l which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of th=
e individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve so=
me not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spir=
it. It is all a complex chain.
>>>
>>>[Reminds me of a particular individua=
l I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting =
any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well a=
s the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the p=
revious karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit an=
d do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free w=
ill, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove =
it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a =
very violent nature, force had to be applied.]
>>>
>>>Best thing to do is a=
) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and ho=
pe for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family memb=
ers to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi=
, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it =
with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20=
 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of posses=
sion. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the m=
ental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. =
While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then eith=
er make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her.=
 And pray as hard as possible.

<html><body><div style=3D"color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=
mes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt"><div><span>Namaste,<b=
r><br>To add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understanding =
of the reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems. Rein=
carnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments f=
rom past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external consciousne=
ss. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any opportuni=
ty for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be recall=
ed. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and=
 new set is generated based on need.<br><br>The Buddhists do not believe in=
 the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our =
idea of Atmah. Therefore their idea of reincarnation is very different. It =
is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together
 to =
give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegra=
ted and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these ca=
n coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can=
 simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. &=
nbsp; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, =
to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while anothe=
r part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a=
 Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his en=
ergy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnati=
ng in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with t=
heir philosophy.<br><br>Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a=
 reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy gov=
erned only by a supreme law of debts/balances - rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Ja=
in scriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to g=
et rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Ni=
rvana. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the ten=
dency towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.<br>=
<br>But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not=
 dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one lif=
e to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop=
 this soul's influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human min=
d/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual an=
d unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, =
be able to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a=
 Divine Life. </span><span><span> A Supreme Negation of life is 
not t=
he ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.  If  mo=
ving into a state 
of complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and=
 inevitable aim,
 then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and p=
erform complex
 life-actions. </span>The law of Karma is here too, but it i=
s not restricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case =
of the idea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is hel=
ping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it =
changes the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unf=
ailing and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must =
have killed hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [=
 he did not have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the =
hands of those he had killed]. </span><span>Whereas those aspects of life 
=
where the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by 
the=
 law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. </span></div><=
