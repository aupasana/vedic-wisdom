Dear Durgesh,

"Here is an important classical principle, employed by Ayurveda, Yoga,
Tantra, and Vastu alike, applicable equally to microcosm and macrocosm:
Whenever one structure or function interacts with another, there will be a
reciprocal influence between them; ordinarily, that structure or function
that is subtler will have a greater influence on its counterpart.

For instance, prana flow characteristically has a greater influence on
breathing than the other way around, which is why regulation of the breath
can control prana only when those breath exercises are carefully repeated
over time. Prana flow provides a conduit for attention, but attention
guides prana. Since attention is subtler than prana, its impact on prana is
greater than prana's impact on attention. Generally, in fact, attention
directs prana; wherever our attention goes, so goes our prana -- and so go
we, impelled to move in the direction followed by our awareness and life
force."

 -- Dr. Robert E. Svoboda
