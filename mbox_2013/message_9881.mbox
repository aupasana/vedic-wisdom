It is my personal conviction that different devotees connect to their deity=
 in different way. Some may practice devotion by silently facing all the pr=
oblems in life without complaint and some other may be like a child who is =
always complaining his Mother about every small issue. Some may simply take=
 what life offers and find happiness in bhakti without even desire for any =
Jnana and some others may be such that they always keep asking and explorin=
g and desire to attain Sarva-Vidya along with Bhakti. I feel, it is very di=
fficult to define what activities or attitudes can be called as that of "Tr=
ue Devotee". I guess only thing that can be said is, whatever be the way of=
 expressing Bhakti, one should be honest and surrendering. If one has firm =
conviction of God and has taken his refuge, then he everything else happens=
 on its own. :)

Dear all,
=
=C2=A0
Just want to
share with you some experiences of mine in the last fiv=
e days. 


This week
was important to me for two main reasons- one, I had a=
n important examination
to take yesterday. Two, this is the last week of th=
e purascharana (ends on Nov 3)
and I wanted to make sure I kept up with the=
 daily japa to finish as planned.

Five days
ago, I developed a painful swe=
lling on my body and began antibiotics in the
hope that it would heal. I wa=
s hoping it was an infected cyst (which can heal
with antibiotics) rather t=
han an early abscess (which often needs surgery). 


I
have a major fear of=
 going under anaesthesia (based on certain experiences), so
I prayed hard t=
o God to let this be a simple infected cyst which would heal with
antibioti=
cs. Swami Sivananda says- never ask for troubles to be removed, always
ask =
God for the strength to bear them- however, I just felt I couldn=E2=80=99t =
face surgery right now. Aside from the fear of a general anaesthesic, the s=
uccess of my
exam and completion of purascharana were both threatened by th=
e potential
surgery- I felt massively stressed and upset by the turn of eve=
nts.

The painful
swelling did not respond to antibiotics for the first few=
 days, and in fact,
grew bigger and seemed to be looking increasingly like =
an abscess, and less
like a cyst. I contacted a surgical doctor friend of m=
ine to seek advice as I
was worried about long-term complications if I resi=
sted surgery and the condition
got worse. She said the condition sounded ve=
ry much like an abscess and I would
almost certainly need surgery.

I was
a=
dvised to fast from midnight and attend the surgical ward for an examinatio=
n
with a high likelihood of being admitted for surgery that day.
=C2=A0
My =
reaction
to this situation was most undevotional. I have always hoped that =
I would not
complain to God when things go bad, and be equally grateful for=
 the bad things=C2=A0 in life as the good- because, I am told, this
is the =
hallmark of a true devotee. I have prayed many times to be made a true
devo=
tee.
=C2=A0
However, I showed
a sad lack of devotion in the last 24-48 hour=
s. Faced with a general
anaesthesia and an unpleasant surgery (with a painf=
ul wound afterwards), I
complained bitterly to God. I said that I felt tota=
lly abandoned, and asked
myself why I dared to expect anything better. Mill=
ions of humans die
like flies all over the world (in freak accidents, storm=
s, wars)- why should my
insignificant life be any different. How dare I thi=
nk I should be any
different? If He does not care about them, why should He=
 care about me? Heartless
heartless God. 


In the middle of all this, anot=
her part of my being was ashamed
of my lack of forbearance and devotion and=
 was quietly saying to God- sorry, I
just am not a true devotee, but your t=
rue devotees say You are great, and good-
please have pity on me and give m=
e the strength to face the anaesthetic and the
surgery bravely because it l=
ooks like I'm going to have to have this. 

I finally resigned
myself to su=
rgery, and felt the same terror and misery that some of my own
patients pro=
bably experience when I refer them to a surgeon for a necessary
procedure.
=
=C2=A0
I repeated my
mantra =C2=A0constantly during the car ride to
hospita=
l for myself and for all the other unlucky people who were in the same
boat=
 as me. I did feel a certain calm in the midst of the fear while doing
this=
.

On arrival
at the hospital, the senior surgeon who heard my story said h=
e was sorry but it
didn=E2=80=99t sound at all like a cyst (they are uncomm=
on in this part of the body),
and much more likely to be an abscess. But wh=
en he examined me, he said he was
quite surprised to find that it was actua=
lly a cyst and not an abscess at all. He
said there was no need for surgery=
, and advised me to carry on with the
antibiotics and seek advice again if =
things do not improve in the next week.=C2=A0 


Needless to say I was trem=
endously relieved
not to have to go under the knife. I was also very gratef=
ul to God, not just
for letting me off the hook this time, but also for sho=
wing me just where my
current level of devotion is (well away from the targ=
et).

Anyway, the
euphoria of not being operated upon is still with me. My =
exam is over (am
hoping I passed), and I am going to complete the last five=
 days of the
purascharana with renewed vigour. I may not be much of a devot=
ee, but as His saintly
devotees say, God truly is great. :) Attempting to b=
ecome a real devotee is probably well worth it.

Durgayai Namaha
