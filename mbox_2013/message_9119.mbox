Dear rAma,

Waters in Kalasha are where you are transfering The Divine to. =
This has to be different from the Achamana pAtra. prANa pratishTa or Invoca=
tion of Divine is - materializing The Energy from akASa tatvam to prithvi t=
attva in steps - dhyAna (from akASa), mantra transfers it to air in breath,=
 to fire in the hOma and then to water in the Kalasha and finally onto plan=
ts/idols via abhishEkam/prOkshaNam. For the daily ritual we do these in qui=
ck succession and may not realize the significance. If you take part in any=
 Temple/Diety consecration process each of these steps are elaborately done=
. It is a different debate if any of us are really capable of such prANa pr=
atishTa but the steps are meant for that. 

So, it is good to water the pla=
nts with that in the Kalash. From time management p.o.v, may be you can col=
lect everydays water into a bigger vessel and water the plants on weekends.=
 

Regards,
-Prasad
