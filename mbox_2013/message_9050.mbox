Dear all,

Thank you for your valuable reflections and anecdotes on this su=
bject. I've enjoyed reading them.

Kbkm-ji, I really like your suggestion o=
f 10 minutes of prayer for the health of others before going to bed. What a=
 lovely idea- I strongly feel that this would be a great help, especially i=
f we do it in great numbers. It is good to pray for individuals and also ex=
tend the prayer for all beings and all creation.

What better way of develo=
ping Bhakti than prayer for the welfare of all beings, including 'friends',=
 'enemies'  and strangers.

Warm regards,

Aparna
