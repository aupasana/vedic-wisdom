Hello, 

Chalisa, sankat mochan, ram stuti are purely strotra and heartfelt=
 bhakti is the key. pick any one and do 11/21 times for 21/41 days. 

one e=
ffective key i heard is to use samput of "sri ram jai ram jai jai ram" betw=
een every lines of chalisa. that makes hanumanji extremely pleased.

I had =
heard for siddhi for hanuman chalisa one has to take sankalp for 100times f=
or 100days and then one gets tested also during the sadhana. better to have=
 a guru and do such things under his guidance only. 

One of my friends nan=
aji did this for 10-15 yrs i guess and lot of people used to hear deep brea=
ths and panting sounds around him, many even saw shadow or something of han=
umanji around him. also if someone used to get affected by some ghosts n st=
uff, his mere step in that home used to drive the ghosts away....

In case =
of bajarang baan, its supposedly tantrik+sabar in nature so its very potent=
. doing such stuff is like riding a heavy motorcycle so u need a guru and s=
ome helmet and stuff. ideally have a tantra guru. then before reading u nee=
d to do short ram-sita-laxman puja, something like "sri ram jai ram jai jai=
 ram" 51/108 times. then do the paths and again the 108 times the mantra. a=
lso on the alter keep small red cloth as asan coz hanumanji will come and w=
ould like to have a seat. keep daas bhav and thank him profoundly and say s=
orry later. whatever u offer him as prasad people keep tulsi on top. and ba=
th is MUST.

regards
