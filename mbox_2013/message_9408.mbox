This whole universe is manifestation of Divine Mother (Ma Lalita), she is
t=
he nature, the prakriti. And Ma Kali is the ugra form of mother meant to
pu=
nish the ill deeds. Government meddles with the nature causing ecological
i=
mbalance. And this ensues the whole fiasco. Dhari devi shifting was the
tri=
gger point to the tragedy, as if she was waiting for the humans to cross
th=
e last line. The nature has corrected itself by this tragedy. And why not
p=
unish the people ? They are the one who elect the government ?

Resp=
ected sir,<br>With due regards I request you to shed some light upon the re=
cent Uttarakhand tragedy. After the tragedy it is now believed that the tra=
gedy was due to shifting of Dhari devi temple at Alaknanda river. I read so=
me post by shri Manish ji and blog of shri sanjay rath ji.  <br>
My doubt i=
s that, in present context how much it is relevant that such tragedies do h=
appen by a Devi wrath. As per our believe God is merciful and even in some =
of your post previously you have said that it is not worthwhile to connect =
tragedies with God or faith for Him?<br>

<span>BTW, observe the imagery. Line before
 says
 "dharma =
setu pAlakaM" - the ruler of the bridge of dharma. Dharma is merely se=
en as a bridge here. Bridge to what? Obviously bridge over the sea of samsa=
ra and into infinite freedom. Bhairava not only controls the bridge, but hi=
s main purpose is to take one into infinite freedom from that bridge. Thus,=
 swadharma mArga nAshakaM fits nicely following that line.</span></div>

<span>BTW, some people may be tempt=

 and roams naked. He is already free and does those things <sp=

n> In any case, even Bhairava, the deity of destroying right-wrong distinct=
ions in mind and ringing in liberation is described as "dharma setu pa=

 freedom, you HAVE to stay afloat of the ocean of samsara, by getting atop =
the bridge of dharma! Otherwise you will sink in the ocean of samara, toppl=

 end, "the end" is not anywhere near for most people on earth and=
 they better realize it!<br>

 Hindu philosophy taught by many modern gurus, especially of the Vedantic b=
