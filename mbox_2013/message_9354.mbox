KRITE TU MANAVO DHARMASTRETAYAAM GAUTAMO SMRITAH || 
DWAPARE SHANKHALIKHITA=
A KALAU PARASHARAH SMRITAH ||

Means,

Manu Smriti was most relevant in Sat=
ya Yuga. In Treta, Smriti created by Gautam had most relevance whereas in D=
wapar, Shankh's Smriti was mostly recognized. But in Kali Yuga, it is Paras=
har Smriti that by and large shows the way to the ignorant people.

Now if =
you read Manu Smriti you will really have some serious doubts on what we ha=
ve heard about Satya yuga!Because this book has no place for anyone except =
Brahmins, lows are totally in favor for Brahmins and for others very rude l=
ines are drawn,more later on this.
Varna vyavastha is a kalank for Hinduism=
 and there is no reason I find to put Brahmins on top of others,by any mean=
s.
