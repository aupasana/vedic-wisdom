My point is NOT that past life and any of its details cannot be recalle=

whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surfa=

However, if such memory does=

. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what =
action allowed them to enter into the person.
 Sometimes it can be
 somethi=

 as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
 causa=
lly entering into their territory and being susceptible to such possession =
by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entit=
ies are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever=
 be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handl=
ing such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the a=
mount of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate in order to =
remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevo=
lent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this=
, he/she may come to serious harm.

 if a spir=

"><br clear=3D"none">To add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our=
 understanding of the reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more=
 problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those spe=
cific moments from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the exter=
nal consciousness. Which means if one has lived a life where there never wa=
s any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it c=
annot be recalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all ge=
t dissolved and new set is generated based on need.<br clear=3D"none"><br c=
lear=3D"none">The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They=
 believe in Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah.
 Therefore
 the=
ir idea of reincarnation
 is very different. It is like an energy stream ma=
de up of mind, body that coalesces together
 to give the impression of an i=
ndividual being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the=
 greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another for=
mation at a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a diffe=
rent point can coalesce into a different part.   Hence it is possible =
for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of h=
is energy reincarnate into one body while another part of his energy reinca=
rnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy o=
f speech incarnating in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in=
 another person, or his energy of body incarnating in another person and al=
l these happening simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.<br clear=
=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Those philosophies which believed in this kind=
 of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energ=
y governed only by a supreme law of
 debts/balances - rna. Hence
 rnabandha=
na. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this i=
s to get rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shu=
nya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence t=
he tendency towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processe=
s.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">But the old Vedantic idea was diffe=
rent. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike body/mind et=
c - but carried forward from one life to another and the chief aim of human=
 evolution was to assist and develop this soul's influence on the earth. Th=
e soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The gr=
eat idea was that this individual and unique soul - for no two souls are ex=
actly same - in some birth finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an =
individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life. </span><span><span> =
A Supreme Negation of life is 
not the ultimate aim, it is only one among m=
any possibilities.  If  moving into a state 
of complete negation=
/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim,
 then there was just n=
o need for Avataras to descend and perform complex
 life-actions. </span>Th=
e law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of giv=
e and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The importa=
nt thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth =
to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediatel=
y. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is=
 why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can tran=
sform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a=
 hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. </span><=
