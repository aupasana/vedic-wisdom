Dear Narasimha,

Jai Ma!

<<If capturing the popular imagination is the cri=
terion,>>

You misunderstood what I was saying. There is a nuance here. The=
 concept of Dasavatara has caught the popular imagination, not necessarily =
the worship of Dasavatara.

When it comes to worship and individual spiritu=
al progress, as I firmly believe, any deity, any conception and any religio=
n can help an individual to reach a state of Self-realization and mukti. Th=
ere are so many paths, deities, practices, philosophies because there are s=
o many varied kinds of individuals. No one format will work for all.

Howev=
er, I simply cannot find, any other reason or justification for that matter=
 as to why the Dasavatara-concept has become popular, unless we consider th=
e evolutionary angle.

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

Dear Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
<<I believe in the evolut=
ionary parable of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reason why these =
set of Avatara, from the whole list of possible Avataras, have captured the=
 popular imagination.>>
=C2=A0
If capturing the popular imagination is the =
criterion, then Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are the most popular ones among=
 the 9. Why are the *4th*, 7th and 8th avataras most popular if there is a =
nice "evolutionary" sequence among the 9???
=C2=A0
There is a very simple e=
xplanation, if one throws away the notion of "evolutionary" sequence. These=
 are *poornavataras*, completely divine and devoid of jeevatmamsa, as per P=
arasara. In contrast, the 5th and 6th
 avataras did have some jeevatmamsa i=
n them.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
<<I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too =
as per SB. His spirituality is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet,=
 he is not in the list of 9/10 Avataras.>>
=C2=A0
First of all, dasavataras=
 are not a "top 10" short-list of SB's list. SB list gives the avataras of =
Supreme Being ("Purusha" as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are specifically of=
 Vishnu, who is the "sustaining principle" of Purusha. Dattatreya is an ava=
tara of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and de=
structive principles of Purusha combined together. That is why he is not am=
ong Dasavataras. That does not make him any less or more. His purpose/funct=
ionality is simply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venk=
ateswara. Just in terms of "popularity", he is actually more popular than
 =
some of the dasavataras.
=C2=A0
Secondly, rather than *comparing* avataras =
in terms like "less" or more in "spirituality", try to *understand* avatara=
s from the point of view of what functionality and role they play in the fu=
nctioning of collective cosmic consciousness. THAT is the key to understand=
ing them and their place in cosmos. And also to internalizing them eventual=
ly..
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Whether you call the Supreme Being as Pur=
usha or Krishna or Shiva or Surya or Narayana does not really matter, for S=
criptures are clear that He is beyond names or descriptions.
=C2=A0
If your=
 devotion to Him is steadfast, if your notion of Him expands with time beyo=
nd the initial notions you start off with, and if the paramatmamsa in you i=
s able to resonate to Him and the conditioning of your jeevatmamsa is being=
 overcome, that is all that
 matters!
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

>=C2=A0

 some of points you have raised. I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Fee=

>=C2=A0
>Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquia=
lly used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials wa=
y beyond what any normal human being can achieve, came into existence from =
the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate Go=
d=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity betwe=
en terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the G=
ita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Va=
ishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, =
Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest =
known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differing n=
uances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krsh=
na as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a =
measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana a=
nd the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,
 like the Gaudiya Vais=
hnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and decl=
ared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as N=
arayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately =
linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshn=
a, not as a separate Divity in himself.
>=C2=A0
>Whatever the case maybe, e=
ach school had its own set of established saints and scholars to vouch for =
their views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which is often, as you ri=
ghtly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.
>=C2=A0
>We=C2=A0hu=

=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatara=C2=A0because invar=
iable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those times, the life of the=
 Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way beyond=C2=A0imagination=
 for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avatara comes=
 on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, of which =
we have very little written record, the world at large remained entirely ov=
erawed by Rama Avatara.
>=C2=A0

He had not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had hi=

 But Krshna had zero=
=C2=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents =
from Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere=
 he forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a=

=A0Balarama in his next incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Kr=
shna. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are the=

r village in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone wi=

a, with perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false pr=

>>>
>>>
>>>1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Ava=
taras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and=
 Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself a=
re in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the A=
vatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these A=
vatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna=
 is "swayam Bhagawan."
>>>
>>>
>>>2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10=
, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and sign=
ificance across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which w=
ere composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, i=
t was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect of =
Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were com=
posed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantr=
as]
>>>
>>>
>>>3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. =
Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddh=
a) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence=
 of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquati=
c, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to th=
e dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of this=
 earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashu=
rama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the =
Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to=
 be separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the v=
arious manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness =
and its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of eart=
h and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature's grand design for life on =
earth.
>>>
>>>
>>>4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the par=
able of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worshi=
ps say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the =
soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can l=
ead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vi=
shnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massive s=
piritual dynamos.
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>>=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krs=
hna are most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both insid=
e as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age.=
 Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is i=
n control of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within=
 and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. H=
owever, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even t=
hough few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only wh=
en circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel de=
jected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear b=
efore the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the =
later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battl=
e, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana n=
ot to rescue her, but it
 was the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family=
 honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. T=
he way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis =
Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as=
 an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 =
years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Rava=
na, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal co=
nsideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life i=
s a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate=
 detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats =
into account. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, f=
rom people, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the=
 age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends,=
 his foster parents,
 his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him =
that it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort =
of his happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and des=
tination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they wo=
n't understand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is=
 over. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him ask=
ing him to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of t=
hem started getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself qu=
ietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one=
 has any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later m=
erely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment =
the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back=
 into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a re=
volutionist
 and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who u=
sed to think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krs=
hna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not fini=
sh the enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised se=
lf. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overb=
oard, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confiden=
ce in his actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And the=
n right in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to d=
eliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains =
the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never=
 be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong t=
o the instrument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliy=
a Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bh=
eema
 to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhism=
a, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations =
must be lined up which would cause the destruction of these people. This ki=
nd of knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one =
is constantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not f=
ind these kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the V=
almiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other au=
xilliary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ra=
mayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, an=
d then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and=
 Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, t=
he picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mi=
nd. Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief
 of=
 which is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to sep=
aration from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he lo=
ved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some g=
rief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachmen=
t to anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and=
 therefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda =
never left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spir=
itual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolut=
ionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realizat=
ion, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth=
. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of=
 them negated this world. If negation of this world and life is the final a=
im, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of
 evolutionary develo=
pment? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an =
Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in =
that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Av=
ataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vais=
hnava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara=
. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic=
, outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed=
 their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and=
 therefore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literatu=
re of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psycho=
logical functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-develop=
ed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avatara=
s - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full
 power and force of one of th=
ese 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousn=
ess or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself is various pos=
siblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha.=
 Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nin=
e in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comm=
ent on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what =
the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)=
[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textua=
l misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras =
has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in t=
he Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing w=
hich is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha co=
mes living in the full and complete
 purity and might and force and strengt=
h of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn =
away opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Ev=
en Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his=
 ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won't even need that. The white horse and t=
hat sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify =
the various errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I =
look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my view=
s, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -=

energy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipl=

f. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has differen=
t qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.=
 =C2=A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us first,
 perfect it and then perfec=
t other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the=

and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=

 subjective preference. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Let us focus on Rama a=
nd Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in =
us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and has n=
o agendas, no likes or dislikes. =C2=A0 Once mind fancies a separate existe=
nce with some
 agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousn=
ess stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength a=
nd support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind,=
 energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It suppor=
ts them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It =
impassionately witnesses and records all of one's agendas and karmas so tha=
t Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite full=
 awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. =
As mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the=
 notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports =
them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionat=
ely. =C2=A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functio=
nality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interes=
ting enough
 to some. =C2=A0 On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes an=
d agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achi=
eving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!!=
 Though soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consc=
iousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind tha=
t keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and e=
ven decides/affects every entity's dharma. That way, mind is really the "bo=
ss" of the individualization. No wonder Krishna's life appeals more to one =
who may be excited by this description! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

rishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama's life in perspectiv=
e. =C2=A0 Rama's life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he re=
ceived Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whateve=
r was his "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was give=
n
 kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the be=
hest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had n=
o complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty t=
o various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed=
 his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with =
Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it i=
mpassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he sear=
ched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him t=
o leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every l=
ife situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Eve=
n as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impass=
ionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully le=
arned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana! =C2=A0 Rama
 =
is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impa=
ssionately discharges one's dharma arising from the momentum of karmas befo=
re liberation. THAT is basically what soul does! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

=A0 As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect=
 demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =C2=A0 He was born as=
 a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable =
demon king with many great qualities. =C2=A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes on=
e humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demon=
ic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one's discrimination is not please=
d until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one's entire consciousn=
ess, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=

od as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of
 our consciousness o=
perate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =C2=A0 Let us not compare Da=
savataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are mor=
e attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and develo=
p devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara. =C2=A0 *=C2=

vataras.>><br> <br>First of all, dasavataras are not a "top 10" =
short-list of SB's list. SB list gives the avataras of Supreme Being ("Puru=

"sustaining principle" of Purusha. Dattatreya is an avatara of Brahma, Vish=
nu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and destructive principles=
 of Purusha combined together. That is why he is not among Dasavataras. Tha=
t does not make him any less or more. His purpose/functionality is simply d=
ifferent from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venkateswara. Just in te=
rms of "popularity", he is actually more popular than
 some of the dasavata=
ras.<br> <br>Secondly, rather than *comparing* avataras in terms like =
"less" or more in "spirituality", try to *understand* avataras from the poi=
nt of view of what functionality and role they play in the functioning of c=
ollective cosmic consciousness. THAT is the key to understanding them and t=

your devotion to Him is steadfast, if your notion of Him expands with time =
beyond the initial notions you start off with, and if the paramatmamsa in y=
ou is able to resonate to Him and the conditioning of your jeevatmamsa is b=

istence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as th=
e ultimate God on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic sim=
ilarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion start=
ed from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major p=

the earliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (wit=

Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some, like th=
