Dear Bhupendra,

I don't know any special technique. A couple of comments none the less ...


> If you have done sadhana correctly
> forget about getting or not getting job
> you would have not frustrated like this


Doing sadhana "correctly" is easier said than done. In yoga vasishtha,
Vasishtha himself acknowledges that overcoming our past is difficult.
He tells us to "grit our teeth" and keep trying with supreme effort.
(dantaiH dantAn vicUrNayan, param pauruSham aashritya ...)

When you talk to people privately, you will quickly find out that many (or
all) of them suffered from similar frustrations, even when doing sadhana.
All of them are still working and struggling day to day with overcoming
obstacles, internal and external. You are not alone. Everyone goes through
ups and downs.

Vasishtha tells us to keep trying. As long as you keep trying, you *will*
eventually get there. (adyatanaiH guNaiH prAktanaH doShaH asandeham
shAmyati)

Sometimes, it feels like the effort we have to put in is unending, and
that this is an impossible task ... it is like magically trying to turn a
stone into a gem (pauruSham ca navAnantam ... na yatnenApi mahatA prApate
ratnam ashmataH).

But, it just feels this way ... you *can* get there, though the road may be
long and hard. (niyataH parimANasthaH puruShArthaH).


> it provides me no releive in this time of need


Sadhana, over time, will provide you what you need ... which is often
different from what you think you want / need. As much as possible, stick
with your sadhana, and do it for it's own sake (even if you try it do it
without actively *asking* for anything, what you want will be continuously
ringing in the back of your mind). So, let it remain there as much as
possible.

Keep working hard.

sasneham,

   ajit
