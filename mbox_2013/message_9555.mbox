Sri Shatish,

Amazing!!! All the best and i'm sure Lord Ganesha is with you=
 to get your mission completed. Even after 60 days, you may continue to per=
form homam if not with so many rules that you have set for yourself :)

=C2=A0 
Dear Sir,=C2=A0

How are you? My na=
me is Shathish and im from Malaysia. Im currently 28 years old and single. =
I came across of your Ganapathy Homam video couple months a ago and it caug=
ht my attention seriously =C2=A0until it became my passion to perform it.

=
I went and consulted few priest in the temples and most of them discouraged=
 me as they told me i need to learn the manthars and im not eligible for it=
. Moreover, i went through many obstacles to perform this Ganapathy Homam f=
or the last 6 months. Finally, upon God`s grace i managed to prepared mysel=
f for it smoothly and came up to conclusion to perform this Ganapthy Homam =
=C2=A0for 60 days. As for this the protocols are being setup such ways belo=
w;
-Renting a house separately for 2 months
-Bought all the materials neede=
d for the Homam
-Fasting with breakfast one type of fruit and milk(eat afte=
r served in front of Lord Ganesha during Homam). Lunch would be one small p=
late of steamed Green Gram and dinner would be one fruit and one tumbler of=
 cow milk. All this will be cook and prepared my ownslef as im staying alon=
e
-Sleeping using a mat and pillowed with paper wrapped with dhoti
-No ente=
rtainments such as movies, radio stations, cinemas, smoking, consuming alco=
hol, etc.
-Only listen to Bhajans, Manthras and read Hinduisme articles
-We=
aring Malai( a type of holy chain worn around during fastings) to control a=
ll my senses
- No cutting finger nails and hair for this 2 months
-Wash my =
own clothes


The procedures applies the same of yours from the beginning t=
ill the end. yhe additional part is the manthars as flow below;
-Ganapathy =
Shodaspachara with Narayana Suktham (16 services)
-Ganapathy Moola Manthra =
12X ( Aum Gam Ganapathye....)
-Ganapathy Moola Manthra 12X ( Aum Gajanam Tu=
ah Ganapatim Hava..)
-Ganpathy Stotram 3X
-Ganapathy Atharavaseerasham 3X
-=
Ganapathy Kaari Sakti Malai 21X

I bought all the additional materials need=
ed such as honey,sesame seeds, some murmura, some nuts,popped corn and othe=
r materials that can be offered in fire. for the daily basis i buy flowers =
and arugumpul (sacred grass for Lord Vinayaka)Moreover, for Poornahuti i wi=
ll put a whole cocunut with few coins, 9 navaganis(types of beans used for =
prayers), coins, and with vibuthi, kunkumum, sandal wood powder, turmeric p=
owder, etc.

I have full support from my parents. They like pillars to me i=
n this matter. In fact i do have a Brahmin Iyer childhood friend who clears=
 my doubt when it comes to Ganapathy Homam. He is the one who prepares all =
the dharbas for me, teaches me other important about Homam, teaches me how =
to maintain the fire. Additioanlly, he is the one who suggest me to put wat=
er Pot and bath with it every morning. All this happens because of Lord Gan=
esha. In fact, my family, friends, and other are astonished of my actions. =
I took 6 months to learn all the manthars and actions of this homam from th=
e manual and the videos.

Even though i fall easily tired because im workin=
g and fasting but in the end it gives me a kind of pleasure and self-satisf=
action of the Homam completion.Its just sometimes the intonation and the pr=
onunciation compared to yours will be different. Sometimes the coconut that=
 i put for Poornahuti will not crack till end. Sometimes i miss certain rit=
uals. These are things actually makes me upset because i want to do it perf=
ectly. Whatever it is, my devotion to LORD GANESHA is divine.

As im sendin=
g this email to you today it has been 21 days of performing the Ganesha Hom=
am and 39 days to go on. On the 56th day of this Homam will be the VInayaga=
r Chathurti day which falls 9th September 2013. Im doing this =C2=A0as iam =
not expecting much from this outcome rather want to challenge myself from b=
eing discipline and after the 60th day i want my life to have better enhanc=
ement and all ways.

Finally what i would like to extend is my gratitude to=
 you is there is no common word as THANK YOU to you as you have taught me s=
omething which is been hiding for thousands of years from eye of public. Ev=
ery beginning of the Homam i think of you and your family in well-being, of=
f course Dr. Manish Pandit, all the Gurus,Pandits, =C2=A0Rishis, Mahans, Mu=
nis, Thevargals, etc.


Thank You so much Mr.PVR Narasimha Rao.

Keep in to=
uch :)

Shathish Rengayan
