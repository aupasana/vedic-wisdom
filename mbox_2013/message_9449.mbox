Not sure how many of you visited, but it is a place to visit. Their Lordshi=
ps' lilas are amazing, I had the fortune of being there in April 2011. I ha=
ppened to read this link, http://www.narasimhalila.com/history.html, the en=
tire sweet memories came back. I thought, why not share :-)
If you happen t=
o visit, do meet HH Sri Jananivasa and HH Sri Pankajhangri dasa, the twin b=
rothers who Srila Prabhupada talked about and said "these brothers Roy and =
John, they are sincere and speak no non-sense." What Prabhupada mentioned e=
ven as a casual statement went wrong, some people take him as an ordinary d=
evotee which is an entire different discussion though. Even today, when tho=
se brothers speak, it is only nectar, all about their Lordships and their L=
ilas. They even figure in Manishji's Krsna or Myth video.

regards
rAma
