Hi, 

dotn know why ur so concerned about one planet rahu only. 

Homam is =
the best practice, choose any form and it will balance all aspects. you can=
 use simple request at begning "i am dogin this for your pleasure and seeki=
ng ur blessings in all aspects of my life, please guide an help me fulfill =
all areas of my life (dharma, arth, kaam, moksha) and also make all planets=
 favourable" - otherwise also diety does the same but saying it everytime w=
ill keep ones monkey mind cool.

if ur still concerned about grah, devata n=
 ur chart issues. then after u have worshipped main form ask him to covert =
in main 5 devata and give 3 ahuties to each. u can give 3 ahuties to each g=
rah also.

rest all technicality dotn matter as its all about quality of sa=
dhana and not anything else.

any longer version of bajarang baan is good. =
just avoid the 34 line short version on net. but if ur sincere even that wi=
ll work...

in vimlanandas words "carve ur own niche"

regards

Can anyone throw light on reciting the Bajrang Baan daily? Are there any re=
strictions on reciting it? Specifically, are we forbidden from reciting it?=
 Or, can we recite it along with the Hanuman Chalisa, Sankatmochan Hanumana=
shtaka, and lastly the Sri Raama Stuti?
