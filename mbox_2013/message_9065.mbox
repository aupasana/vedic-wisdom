An excellent quote from Sri Aurobindo on Rajarshi's facebook page:
=C2=A0
"=
The
 love which is turned towards the Divine ought not to be the usual vita=
l
 feeling which men call by that name; for that is not love, but only a 
v=
ital desire, an instinct of appropriation, the impulse to possess and 
mono=
polise. Not only is this not the divine Love, but it ought not to be
 allow=
ed to mix in the least degree in the yoga. The true love for the 
Divine is=
 a self-giving, free of demand, full of submission and 
surrender; it makes=
 no claim, imposes no condition, strikes no bargain, 
indulges in no violen=
ces of jealousy or pride or anger =E2=80=93 for these 
things are not in it=
s composition." Sri Aurobindo.

surrender and devotion is indeed more suitable in this age. I did not mean =
to say otherwise.
>=C2=A0
>But just having an ishta devata is not enough to=
 be "protected" from deep and troublesome instabilities when one's body-min=

periences and even madness.
>=C2=A0

vating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment ar=
e almost the same.

g? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantr=
as, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by re=
gular introspection and self-improvement.
>=C2=A0
>Taking mind away from it=
s current pre-occupations (e.g. "I am smart", "I am doing good sadhana", "I=
 am mad at X", "I did not get what I deserve in Y", "I am better than X", "=
I must have Y at any cost" etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditi=
oning, for
 these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning!
>=C2=A0
>To=
 reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualizatio=
n may work better for some people.
>=C2=A0
>One approach is to contemplate =
god whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can imagine a bei=
ng in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle/ideal/abi=
lity that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinating for the=
 mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects around that =
are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind is abo=
ut to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can try to co=
ntemplate god instead.
>=C2=A0
>Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says in the mo=
vie "Life of Pi" about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can't be transfo=
rmed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits!
>=C2=A0
>Wh=
enever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks "the
 omnipresent =
God is enjoying this thru this instrument" and starts contemplating the qua=
lities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sense objects=
, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whenever one=
 is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks "the omnipresent God =
is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument" and starts conte=
mplating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone, one i=
s better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on.
>=C2=A0
=
>In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. Every =
now and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than about=
 god ("*I* am doing this nice bhajan", "*I* am doing this nice homam", "I t=
hink *I* am making progress through this"). With effort and perseverance, o=
ne can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the supreme po=
wer that runs the show. Just as it takes a long
 time to train a wild anima=
l, it takes a long time to train mind!
>=C2=A0
>Try to develop devotion and=
 surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/prin=
ciple of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that=
 concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When mind v=
eers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don't spend too much time=
 dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into contem=
plating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself.
>=C2=A0
>=
The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it about =
themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try to b=
reak free from it.

>Finally, one can try =
to overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions that b=
enefit a larger set of
 people than oneself. What stops us from truly lovin=
g god is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited=
* notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way to ove=

are as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, lo=

, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Co=
nstant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the hum=
an mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachme=
nt, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed e=
tc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to n=
ow self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more=
 intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A goo=
d guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it=
 can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, s=
ome of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and =
given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They t=
ake hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes th=
e same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more
 vital. 4 - While som=
eday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awe=
kening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. T=
he human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient=
 to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura o=
f an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps=
 us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various rea=
sons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow=
 free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of c=
ausing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possibli=
ties are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, eve=
n if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowle=
dge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doin=
g nothing more than an intelligent guess work.
 Sometimes it will have resu=
lts, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a s=
ound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in=
 corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi

Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my rece=
nt experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present,=
 and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has h=
ad a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has inv=
olved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not =
of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms starte=
d and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anythi=
ng physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this i=
s due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe them=
selves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awak=
ening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstre=
am psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by west=
ern medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged
 kundalini, we stru=
ggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My exper=
ience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forc=
ibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the sufferi=
ng from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and i=
t is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could=
 be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who m=
anifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and eithe=
r cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the g=
ood samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may=
 not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in=
 our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this =
is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me =
be your instrument" and leave the kundalini
 rising bit to God's will. Om D=

nder and devotion is indeed more suitable in this age. I did not mean to sa=
y otherwise.<br> <br>But just having an ishta
 devata is not enough to=
 be "protected" from deep and troublesome instabilities when one's body-min=
d complex goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring devotee bec=
omes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the two examples L=
eelaji gave below for "psychological disorder", the second lady "did much s=
adhana of Srirama". Even those who think of a deity and pray to him/her can=
 end up with hallucinations, mental and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored=
 by one's conditioning and desires!) interpretation of internal/external ex=
periences and even madness.<br> <br>True surrender/devotion to ishta d=
evata will definitely protect one, but
 cultivating it is as difficult as c=
ultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachmen=
t are almost the same.<br> <br>This is why I said that *lightness of c=
onditioning* is the most important thing. One with dense conditioning will =
find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god are ready to help.<br>&nb=
sp;<br>*        *    =
;    *<br> <br>Now, the question is: How do we reduce o=
ur conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking o=
f a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be a=
ugmented by regular introspection and self-improvement.<br> <br>Taking=
 mind away from its current pre-occupations (e.g. "I am smart", "I am doing=
 good sadhana", "I am mad at X", "I did not get what I deserve in Y", "I am=
 better than X", "I must have Y at any cost" etc etc) is key to eventually =
overcoming conditioning, for
 these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditi=
oning!<br> <br>To reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, differen=
t imagery/visualization may work better for some people.<br> <br>One a=
pproach is to contemplate god whenever possible, in the middle of any activ=
ity. You can imagine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person o=
r as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfe=
ct and fascinating for the mind to contemplate that it does not care about =
other objects around that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the =
mind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occu=
pations, one can try to contemplate god instead.<br> <br>Mind is a wil=
d animal. As Pi says in the movie "Life of Pi" about the tiger on the boat,=
 wild animals can't be transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained=
 into some habits!<br> <br>Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure=
, if one thinks "the
 omnipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument=
" and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of thinking to=
o much about limited sense objects, one is better placed to reduce the dama=
ge done by shadripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for what they did, i=
f one thinks "the omnipresent God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru=
 that instrument" and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instea=
d of being angry at someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done=
 by shadripus. And so on.<br> <br>In the beginning, even contemplation=
 of god becomes laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up be=
coming about oneself rather than about god ("*I* am doing this nice bhajan"=
, "*I* am doing this nice homam", "I think *I* am making progress through t=
his"). With effort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about oneself =
and keep it centered on the supreme power that runs the show. Just as it ta=
kes a long
 time to train a wild animal, it takes a long time to train mind=
!<br> <br>Try to develop devotion and surrender. Based on all that you=
 read and heard, develop of a concept/principle of god that is so superb an=
d fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that concept as frequently as possibl=
e, especially when meditating. When mind veers off into other things, gentl=
y steer it back. Don't spend too much time dissecting what mind is doing an=
d why. Just put it back gently into contemplating god. Try to make it about=
 god rather than about yourself.<br> <br>The main drawback of the sadh=
ana of most people is that they make it about themselves at some level or t=
he other. Though that is unavoidable, try to break free from it.<br> <=
br>*        *    &nb=
sp;   *<br> <br>Finally, one can try to overcome the limited=
 sense of self and engage in selfless actions that benefit a larger set of
=
 people than oneself. What stops us from truly loving god is our deep and s=
ub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* notion of self that d=
rives the current body-mind complex). One way to overcome that is to selfle=
ssly love others. After all, other people around us are as much replicas of=
 god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love them and give them u=
nconditionally, how can we ever hope to transcend the limited sense of Self=
 and truly love omnipresent God?<br> <br><div style=3D"color:rgb(0, 0,=

focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constan=
t efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the human mi=
nd-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, m=
ore equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc et=
c. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now se=
lf identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more inte=
nse kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good gur=
u is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can =
also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some o=
f which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given=
 half a chance can make
 use of the individual for its own ends. They take =
hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the sa=
me. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more vital. 4 - While someday =
or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekenin=
g and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The hu=
man psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to d=
eal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an =
individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us t=
o remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various reasons,=
 high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free=
 assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causin=
g serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities =
are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if =
such a diagnosis
 is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge =
to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing no=
thing more than an intelligent guess work. Sometimes it will have results, =
sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sound =
mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - <span class=3D"yi=

r all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent =
experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, an=
d have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had =
a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involv=
ed out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of =
Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started a=
nd she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything =
physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is d=
ue to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themsel=
ves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakeni=
ng- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream =
psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western=
 medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged
 kundalini, we struggl=
e to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experien=
ce with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibl=
y wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering =
from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it i=
s something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be=
 to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who mani=
fests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either c=
ure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good=
 samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may no=
t know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in ou=
r sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is =
why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be =
your instrument" and leave the kundalini
 rising bit to God's will. Om Dum =
