DHARMACENTRAL.COM MALICIOUSLY HACKED BY TERRORISTS!!!

On Wednesday, Septem=
ber 10 - one day before the commemoration of the 9-11
terrorist attacks, Dh=
armacentral.com was maliciously hacked in an unprovoked
attack by terrorist=
s. Hacked under the name of a supposed "Islamic" group,
Dharmacentral has b=
een offline for the last 24 hours.

See: http://dharmacentral.com/quickstar=
t.html

The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have been informed abou=
t this
terrorist attack and are currently investigating the source. In addi=
tion, our
web host and lawyer have been informed and are taking independent=
 action.

Dharmacentral.com WILL be back soon.

Dharmacentral.com is one of=
 the most frequently accessed, largest and most
informative websites in the=
 world today dedicated to Vedic spirituality,
Sanatana Dharma, Bhakti-Yoga,=
 and global Dharma restoration. As such, it is not
surprising that the demo=
nic elements of the Kali Yuga see it as a direct threat
to their envy-drive=
n pathology, and to their plan to continue their demonic
rule.

The forces =
of adharma (anti-spirituality), however, will never win. As Bhagavan
Sri Kr=
ishna Himself explains in the Bhagavad Gita:

paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya=
 ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge

"In order to de=
liver the sages and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to
reestablish=
 the principles of Dharma, I advent Myself millennium after
millennium." (B=
hagavad Gita, 4:8)

We now take shelter in full self-surrender (prapatti) a=
t the divine lotus feet
of Bhagavan Sri Krishna and ask for His direct prot=
ection and victory.

In order to assure that such attacks are never again s=
uccessful in the future,
we need your direct help RIGHT NOW in order to gre=
atly upgrade our web security.
We can only do this with your immediate and =
generous donations. Please donate
generously at our sister website:

http:/=
/dharmacivilization.com/donate/


Let us not allow the anti-Dharma forces t=
o be successful! Donate Today!

Victory to Sanatana Dharma!



Please forwa=
rd to all supporters of Sanatana Dharma.
