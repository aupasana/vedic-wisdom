Dear Rajarshi,

Rama and Krishna are Vishnu's avataras. So t=
hey obviously have Vishnu tattva.
=A0
Whether you like it or not, Pararsara=
's *comparison* of dasavataras is an important key if you really want to *c=
omparatively* understand their esoteric nature. He is after all a maharshi!=
 Based on his clear guidance, Sun is from the paramatmamsa of Sun (soul/Shi=
va) and Moon is is from the paramatmamsa of Moon (mind/Shakti).
=A0
Thus, R=
ama and Krishna being "Vishnu tattva+Shiva tattva" and "Vishnu tattva+Shakt=
i tattva" is derived logically based on Pararsara's teaching.
=A0
To me, it=
 also makes terrific sense based on a study of their lives and personalitie=
s, but that would be *subjective* and based on my own understanding what Sh=
iva tattva and Shakti tattva are. Even leaving such analysis, my conclusion=
 is based on an objective comparative factor coming from a maharshi. On the=
 other hand, all your views are based on your subjective understanding of v=
arious factors and your subjective opinions.
=A0
As for Hanuman being Shiva=
 tattva, you too agreed that "Hanuman was an exceptional amsa of Shiva". So=
 we both basically agree on Hanuman being Shiva tattva.
=A0
Bottomline: My =
views are based on objective factors. Your view that Krishna is pure Shiva =
tattva, OTOH, is based on a subjective (and possibly faulty) understanding =
of various things, including Shiva tattva and Krishna's personality.
=A0

=A0
You missed the word "more" in=
 what I said. Yes, all beings have some paramatmamsa, but a lot more jivatm=
amsa. Those who have "more" paramatmamsa are avataras. Very few avataras ex=
ist that are completely free from jivatmamsa and Parasara calls them "poorn=
avataras". That way, most avataras are "amsavataras".
=A0
To summarize, onl=
y paramatmamsa=3Dpoornavatara, a lot of paramatmamsa and some jivatmamsa=3D=
amsavatara, a lot of jivamsa and a little paramatmamsa=3Dnormal people.
=A0=

Happy Akshaya Tritiya again!

Best regards,
Narasimha

@homam108 I am combining a=
 few answers to some of your twits in here.

You said : <<Rama=3DVishnu tat=
tva+Shiva tatva, Krishna=3DVishnu tatva+Shakti tatva, Hanuman=3DShiva tatva=
.>>

To substantiate your point, such that others find it acceptable, you m=
ust corroborate this with valid examples from confirmed primary texts, and =
your derivation from those examples. That would make a meaningful debate. O=
therwise, anyone can have any opinion. What do others care?

I disagree. Ve=
ry simply put, I understand Shiva tattwa as detachment. Shakti tattwa is an=
y form and manner and display of Shakti (this is the most fluid definition)=
, and Vishnu tattwa as an instinct of preserving and protection for dharma =
for a spiritual purpose. As one becomes more universal, so does ones dharma=
.

In an objective study of Krshna's life as it comes down to us from the M=
ahabharata and the 10th Canto of the Bhagwatam, I find ample and more evide=
nces of Shiva Tattwa in him. Leaving aside the Supernatural Godly feats tha=
t he performed as a powerful, but dharmik, display of supernatural Shakti, =
it is his perfect detachment and therefore perfect self-confidence in every=
 move - even when he runs away from battle in a well calculated plan as per=
 Mbha- that is most striking. If this is not Shiva tattwa, I don't know wha=
t Shiva Tattwa is. That is why he was considered the perfect Purusha, while=
 everyone else, male of female is a Shakti with respect to Krshna. In Krshn=
a Avatara there is Shiva, and Shakti tattwa working in perfect synergy, and=
 of course Vishnu Tattwa, otherwise he would not have bothered with the gre=
ater dharma.

Today Hanumana is famous as the best devotee of Rama or the g=
reatest warrior. But the original Valmiki Ramayana - and that is why I so l=
ove the original Ramayana as opposed to later retellings - described him as=
 an expert in all forms of music, expert in poetry, expert in grammer/logic=
, expert in speech, a pundit of the highest order, a very multifaceted char=
acter! That is why the Narada Purana says he contains amsas of both Shiva a=
nd Vishnu in him.


<<These words r used subjectively. Beings coming down w=
ith more paramatmamsa r called avataras. Even they may contain only a 1/2>>=


Conceptually I disagree with this understanding too and here is why. Ther=
e is a bit of the paramatma in everyone, in which case the whole idea of am=
sas and avataras would not be meaningful at all because it would be too gen=
eric. Gita mentions very clearly that as the Lord Supreme (Paramatma) sits =
in the heart of all matter and manifestation.

The specific use of the term=
s amsa vs avatara is important. Why is Rama or Krshna not called an amsa of=
 Vishnu but Avatara of Vishnu, but Hanumana is called an amsa of Shiva? I d=
on't think the ancient sages used words and terms loosely. Because the core=
 philosophy of the shaivas was that Shiva has only archetypal avatars like =
Sadyajata, Tatpurusha Vamdeva, Aghora, Ishana. Later it was extended to inc=
lude Bhairava, and all the 8 Bhairavas as avatars of Shiva, and Virabhadra.=
 These beings are not directly involved, in a catalytic way, with human lif=
e as the main Vishnu Avataras are. Hanuman therefore comes as an aid to Ram=
a, not to win the battle by himself which he very well could have done, but=
 only in establishing the principle and purport of Rama's life and act.

So=
 I adhere to that school of thought that says Shiva takes no avatars. Thoug=
h various amsas of his comes down often for different works. Hanuman was an=
 exceptional amsa of Shiva.

Vimalananda, IMO, nails it perfectly when he s=
ays Shiva or Paramashiva is Unmanifested Absolute. His stories, his Avatara=
s, his iconography - smashan, sitting naked on the himalayas in samadhi ETC=
 - all is but an attempt to explain/capture this concept of the Unmanifeste=
d Absolute.

Narayana is that aspect of the Absolute which guides the consc=
iousness and spiritual path on earth. Hence the name - Nara + Ayana.

Naray=
ana and Paramashiva are too ways of looking at that Absolute, based on thei=
r generic functions.
