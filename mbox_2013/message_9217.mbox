Thank you for your reply,Rajgopalji..

i's Ganesh Atharvasheersham,

and I heard ''Sanhita Sandhi:" whereas in ano=
ther recording (by other
person),it is ''Sa-gum-hita  Sandhi:''

Can Narsin=

Basi=
c rule for yajurveda chanting is:<br>
if a anusvaara is followed by ya ra l=
a va sha shha sa ha, it is pronounced as "gg" or "gum".=
 That could be due to paaTha-bhedha.<br>
