Thank you for taking your time to answer all the questions! I really apprec=
iate your efforts in making  all of the sacred practices available to every=
one. I cannot find words to express my gratitude!

Me and many other people=
 I know would love to see word-by-word translation of the mantras in the ma=
nuals. This would be very helpful in understanding the true meaning. If thi=
s is not too much effort for you, please offer a translation for people lik=
e me, who want to get deeper into the practice.

Thank you!
