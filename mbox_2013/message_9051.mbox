Hi Scsa, 

Hope you're doing good.

There's a shop in London called "Sanskr=
uti" in Wembley that sells havan kunds. It's a little gem of a place that a=
lso contains every imaginable item needed for Hindu rituals- from beautiful=
 deity murthis to brass lamps and camphor.

I would recommend this place fo=
r any wannabe homam-doer in the UK. And no, I don't own the place, know the=
 owner or have any shares in it :P 
It's just a great one-stop shop for wha=
t what you need to get that homam fire going.

Om 

Aparna
