I just want to reply to this and you will not hear me again.

Yes there were some tolerant sufi saints, but what percentage of muslins are they?
Do we respect something because 10% of its members are tolerant?
How much destruction and killing has islam brought?
How much killing and destroying did mahammad do himself to spead "the right religion"?

I have no problems with other traditions/religions/path because, other then a few encounters here and there, they can coexist together. This
is not the case with islam. If you need examples, take a lot at how other traditions/religions/paths are treated in any of the islamic countries.

Take care

Namaste friends,

As the reaction below demonstrates, intolerance promotes/begets intolerenace.

There are several sufi saints who did not talk about killing infidels and showed great love and compassion for god and for ALL creations of god. Some even accepted and worshiped Hindu deities. Yet, when someone speaks of "Allah", it elicits this reaction!

I do not want to comment on whether this reaction is correct or incorrect. After all, everyone acts uniquely based on one's conditioning and cumulative life experiences. Moreover, I am not really a scholar on Islam and am not familiar with various interpretations of Quran and other scriptures of Islam.

But, all I want to say is that intolerance feeds intolerance and love feeds love. You react to someone's intolerance with further intolerance and that will make them react to you with further intolerance. And so on. Unfortunately intolerance spreads much faster (like a wild fire!) than does love.

Aparna ji, nice composition! There is something natural, pure and beautiful about it..

Best regards,
Narasimha

Is this the same allah that wants to kill all the infidels/non-believers and
wants everyone to show absolutely no tolerance to other's beliefs?

Ney

An empty, hollow, reed flute,
I must become a Ney.
So that through me unimpeded,
Divine music Allah can play.

But the wretched stubborn mind
Must always have its own way.
And the six enemies fight within,
Desperate to stay.

Allah none reaches You,
Save through Your infinite Grace,
Of the undivine now,
Let there be no trace.

Lord, the Spirit is willing,
Though the flesh is weak.
This life is irksome and,
The journey long and bleak.

Yet there is no room for despair,
When one is Your own child.
You redeemed Mira and Kabir,
Why shall You leave the rest behind?

You defeated the enemies,
Within countless Saints of yore.
They can be performed yet again,
Those feats achieved before.

Yea surely You shall not abandon,
Your worthless devotee.
Lacking in faith and intellect,
Filled with hypocrisy.

For Your compassion knows no bounds,
And embraces one and all.
Your Love holds the Universe,
Ever in its thrall.

Wide as the sky is Your heart,
Limitless as the ocean is Your love,
That ever redeems the lowly,
And raises them up above.
