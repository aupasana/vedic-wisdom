Dear Narasimha Ji
Thanks a lot for all the clarifications and information=
 
(1) As of now I will conveniently use your way of samputikarana, the othe=
r one takes real long time
(2) Going forward I would include both these ver=
ses in Saptashati too, the same way I have been doing stuthi patha of ch5 (=
and as you mentioned here)
(3) This is really very helpful information, hop=
e Swami Sathasivom add to this too 
Thanking you,
Digamber

 or japam.

after a small gap.
> =C2=A0

 is important. If you want to do serious sadhana, eat saattwik food. Don't =

 3 or 5 days. What I would like to know, what and how much he ate during th=
