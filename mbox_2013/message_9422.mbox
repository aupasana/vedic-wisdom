Ney

An empty, hollow, reed flute,
I must become a Ney.
So that through me =
unimpeded,
Divine music Allah can play.

But the wretched stubborn mind
Mus=
t always have its own way.
And the six enemies fight within,
Desperate to s=
tay.

Allah none reaches You,
Save through Your infinite Grace,
Of the undi=
vine now,
Let there be no trace.

Lord, the Spirit is willing,
Though the f=
lesh is weak.
This life is irksome and, 
The journey long and bleak.

Yet t=
here is no room for despair,
When one is Your own child.
You redeemed Mira =
and Kabir,
Why shall You leave the rest behind? 

You defeated the enemies,=

Within countless Saints of yore.
They can be performed yet again,
Those fe=
ats achieved before. 

Yea surely You shall not abandon,
Your worthless dev=
otee.
Lacking in faith and intellect,
Filled with hypocrisy.

For Your comp=
assion knows no bounds,
And embraces one and all.
Your Love holds the Unive=
rse,
Ever in its thrall. 

Wide as the sky is Your heart,
Limitless as the =
ocean is Your love,
That ever redeems the lowly,
And raises them up above. =
