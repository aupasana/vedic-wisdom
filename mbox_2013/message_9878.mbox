<<When a Ramakrishna told a few of his disciples who they w=

tly, those disciples ended up, a few decades later, living a life of exempl=
ary renunciation and selfless service to society and disseminated sublime w=

I totally agree with the statement that lack of personal agendas, selfle=
ss motvites, satwik intent are very powerful things. Anything done in this =
manner always eventually turns out good.
=C2=A0
In Sri Ramakrishna's case, =
there is one more point IMO. His visions, based on which in a=C2=A0totally =
non-calculating, guileless and childlike manner, he would proclaim the past=
 lives of various disciples, had a strong grain of truth that actualized in=
 a reasonable accurate manner at a much later date. Let me give one example=
. One day Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room around evening when he sa=
w a vision of Lord Krishna with another young boy, dressed like a cowherd, =
standing in the middle of a lotus.=C2=A0 The next day he saw the exact same=
 boy come to Dakshineshwar. Incidentally the boy's name was Rakhal, meaning=
 cowherd. Sri Ramakrishna told him that he was in a previous birth, one of =
the cowherd companions of Sri Krishna in Vrndavana! Later, many decades lat=
er, when Sri Ramakrishna himself had left his physical body, Rakhal went on=
 to become a teriffic saint of very very high caliber named Swami Brahmanan=
da and one of the greatest devotees of Lord
 Krshna. His spiritual fulfillm=
ent came through worship of Lord Krshna and the study of the Gita. In his l=
ast years, he would see and interact with Krshna at all times and hours bef=
ore his own death he saw Lord Krshna come to him and take his hand and call=
 him back to his own realm. Within hours of this experience he died. The po=
int being, the vision that Sri Ramakrishna saw many decades ago,at a time w=
hen Rakhal himself had no clue of his potential and his specific path, all =
proved correct and accurate. Ramakrishna himself was not alive to see that =
day,=C2=A0therefore it cannot be said e had any agenda in making those proc=
lamations to Rakhal about his past life and his path. So if all this turned=
 out to be true in such a tremendous manner, we have no basis to say that h=
is declaratoin of Rakhal's, or anyone else's=C2=A0past life was not-true. 
=
=C2=A0Wwe know what imagination and visualization is. All of us have these =
powers of imagination is various measures. But none of us can 'imagine' the=
 future and make it happen the way we imagine it, that=C2=A0too=C2=A0on a=
=C2=A0regular basis. Then it is not imagination any more. This is something=
 else totally. All of Sri Ramakrishna's vision proved to be 100% accurate a=
t all times. Not one failed.=C2=A0 This is far=C2=A0beyond the capability o=
f the human mind, imagination or visualization or whatever else we want to =
call it.

Around the time when Swami Vivekananda was born, Ramakrishna one =
day saw a vision in the sky. He saw a powerful bolt of lightning coming fro=
m Kashi and heading towards Bengal. He saw, in his vision, the whole sky wa=
s like split asunder by the power and force of that blaze of lightning. He =
told some people around him that a very powerful soul has takne birth who h=
as a strong connection to Lord Shiva. Nearly twenty years after this vision=
 he met the future Swami Vivekananda for the first time, and as Vievakanda'=
s life later showed, he turned out to be=C2=A0a great Shiva devotee. 

Loos=
ely speaking one can say that the mind has many hidden abilities. But I loo=
k at it differently. We are born with three koshas - annamaya (physical bod=
y), pranamaya ( life-force) and manomaya (mind). Even in these, each indivi=
dual with have subtle variations in the amount of influence, clarity, depth=
 and other things that they have at their disposal in the use of these kosh=
as. This is standard knowledge. One can be born with a very roboust physica=
l body that can sustain many things while anothe with a weak body. Etc. But=
 there is a fourth kosha which lies only as a potential. SOme yogis, by the=
 power of their sadhana, can develop the same. Shastras call it Vigyanamaya=
.=C2=A0One of best misconcption of this age is that Vgyana means intellect =
as we know it. Hardly. Even the most logically powerful, sharpest and swift=
est intellect is still a working of the manomaya kosha, of course at a high=
 pitch. But the Vigyana is sifferent. WHen the Yogi is able
 to=C2=A0develo=
p and use this kosha various apparently supernatural things can manifest. T=
hese appear supernatural from our point of view, but maybe just an ordinary=
 funtionality of that kosha=C2=A0-=C2=A0sheath - of the human organism. Is =
this Maya? It is as much Maya as you hands and your legs are.. At a very hi=
gh level of development of Vigyanamaya kosha=C2=A0abilities of Trikal Darsh=
an may come to the Yogi automatically. This is similar to, as I mentioned i=
n the previous mail, the ability to enter the consciousness in the Karan Ja=
gat. That is how some exceptional Yogis, as Vimalananda so offhandly remark=
s, can see an individual and see 25=C2=A0birth in the past and 25 possible =
births in the future! (given thecurrent momentum).

None of this is imagina=
tion at all.=C2=A0 What is the use=C2=A0of this otherwise obscure kosha? On=
e gets=C2=A0the clearest view of REALITY from here than from any of the oth=
er koshas. That is all the bottomline is.Percieving the One Reality using=
=C2=A0the various means at our disposal.=C2=A0

A man like Sri Ramakrishna =
is born with these koshas developed to a very=C2=A0high degree, unlike rest=
 of the seekers. That=C2=A0is why his visions=C2=A0almost never failed.

Re: Past life regression (Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nightt=

=C2=A0 
Dear Ajit,
=C2=A0
Great point. However, a genuine siddhi a=
nd a hallucination cannot be painted with the same brush.
=C2=A0
If a yogi =
with Kundalini in a higher chakra obtains a special siddhi and a hasty newb=
ie hallucinates getting the same siddhi, they are of course not the same, t=
hough both are stuck in Maya (the delusory power of the field of duality)!
=
=C2=A0
Suppose everyone in a room (field of duality) sees a rope (Self) as =
a snake (world appearance). They are all under the influence of Maya. Suppo=
se one person in the room makes the snake seem (to everyone in the room) to=
 have 10 heads. Suppose another person imagines the snake to have 10 heads =
and that everyone sees 10 heads, while everyone actually sees only one head=
.
=C2=A0
In an *absolute* non-dualistic sense, both are in delusion because=
 it is not a snake in the first place and a rope. But, in a *relative* dual=
istic sense, the latter is hallucinating and the former is mastering the dy=
namics of the room.
=C2=A0

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Having said that, I must r=
e-emphasize that it is silly to pursue any siddhis. Seeking the ability to =
make the rope that everyone sees as snake appear to have 4 heads or 10 head=
s to all is a silly goal.
=C2=A0
A true seeker will seek the ability to alw=
ays see as rope what everyone sees as snake. That is the only meaningful "a=
bility". During the process of acquiring that ability, one may get other ab=
ilities (e.g. the above one). Some seekers get attached to them and get stu=
ck. Some reject them and keep progressing.

Whe=
n a Ramakrishna told a few of his disciples who they were in a past life, o=
ne might not have been able to know FOR SURE if he was correct or not. Neve=
rtheless, there are a few things to note: (1) He was not operating with any=

lude that his visions were perhaps genuinely inspired. 
=C2=A0
There has to=
 be a sense of saattwik purpose and lack of selfish agendas behind any know=
ledge that comes to one, for one to benefit from it spiritually. Knowledge =
coming from a visit to a commercial psychotherapist is hardly likely to be =
that way.
=C2=A0In any case, my basic point is that it is not at all easy t=
o know past life of oneself or others. It requires a seeker of great calibe=
r.

=C2=A0

Of course, you are right - the nice feeling on=
e may obtain in homam or meditation or any activity may be qualitatively sa=
me. If a regular practice eventually lessens one's conditioning, then =
only it can be said to be working.
=C2=A0
However, most practices do help o=
ne in the long run (may be years or lives, depending on the denseness of on=
e's conditioning), if they are done with *regularity*. Despite wrong a=
ttitude and missteps in the beginning, one does find one's path if one=
 sticks to a sadhana. That is why I am a fan of regular practices instead o=
f one-off practices.
=C2=A0
A one-off practice can also transform one treme=
ndously if one's conditioning is sufficiently light already. However, =
we do not encounter such people anymore. That is why I downplay one-off pra=
ctices and emphasize regular practice.
=C2=A0
Whether it's homam or ja=
pam or a kriya, just do it regularly with as sincere and devoted a mind as =
possible.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 

Knowing details of past life/lives is mo=
stly useless. If there is a serious debt that needs to be paid back, we do =
get a chance in this life to pay it back, whether or not we know its cause.=
 If there is a really good deed we did, we do get its fruit, whether or not=
 we know its cause.

There is nothing higher than the abil=
ity to listen to one's own conscience, even when inconvenient. That co=
nscience is the representation of god in us. It is the highest guru, highes=
t astrologer one can consult and the highest psychotherapist. It doesn'=
;t tell you all the logic, formulas and calculations it uses, but it always=
 gives the perfect advice!

Normally we suppress the voice of conscience an=
d follow the voice of conditioned mind. But, as we listen to it more, the v=
oice of conscience becomes louder and clearer..

>>>To add to the complexit=
y of the problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over =
simplified and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and=
 the soul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul =
had a role to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has li=
ved a life where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth=
 and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete p=
rocess. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based o=
n need.
>>>
>>>The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. The=
y believe in Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah. Therefore thei=
r idea of reincarnation is very different. It is like an energy stream made=
 up of mind, body that coalesces together to give the impression of an indi=
vidual being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the gr=
eater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another format=
ion at a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a differen=
t point can coalesce into a different part. =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for=
 a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his =
energy reincarnate into one body while another part of his energy reincarna=
te into another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of s=
peech incarnating in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in an=
other person, or his energy of body incarnating in another person and all t=
hese
 happening simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.
>>>
>>>Those=
 philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the =
Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law o=
f debts/balances - rna. Hence rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with=
 this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life=
 and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here t=
hat is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and forma=
l renunciation of life and its processes.
>>>
>>>But the old Vedantic idea =
was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike bod=
y/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to another and the chief aim=
 of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul's influence on=
 the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for this p=
urpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul - for no tw=
o souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *consciously* =
operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=C2=A0A Supr=
eme Negation of life is not the ultimate aim, it is only one among many pos=
sibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state of complete negation/Shunya/=
Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then there was just no need fo=
r Avataras to descend and perform complex life-actions. The law of Karma is=
 here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of give and take of ene=
rgy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The
 important thing is whet=
her an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. =
If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a m=
assive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara=
 -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can transform himself in=
to a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a hundred times t=

 life where the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed b=

 Sri Ramakrishna's case, there is one more point IMO. His visions, based on=
 which in a totally non-calculating, guileless and childlike manner, h=
e would proclaim the past lives of various disciples, had a strong grain of=
 truth that actualized in a reasonable accurate manner at a much later date=
. Let me give one example. One day Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room =
around evening when he saw a vision of Lord Krishna with another young boy,=
 dressed like a cowherd, standing in the middle of a lotus.  The next =
day he saw the exact same boy come to Dakshineshwar. Incidentally the boy's=
 name was Rakhal, meaning cowherd. Sri Ramakrishna told him that he was in =
a previous birth, one of the cowherd companions of Sri Krishna in
 Vrndavan=
a! Later, many decades later, when Sri Ramakrishna himself had left his phy=
sical body, Rakhal went on to become a teriffic saint of very very high cal=
iber named Swami Brahmananda and one of the greatest devotees of Lord Krshn=
a. His spiritual fulfillment came through worship of Lord Krshna and the st=
udy of the Gita. In his last years, he would see and interact with Krshna a=
t all times and hours before his own death he saw Lord Krshna come to him a=
nd take his hand and call him back to his own realm. Within hours of this e=
xperience he died. The point being, the vision that Sri Ramakrishna saw man=
y decades ago,at a time when Rakhal himself had no clue of his potential an=
d his specific path, all proved correct and accurate. Ramakrishna himself w=
as not alive to see that day, therefore it cannot be said e had any ag=
enda in making those proclamations to Rakhal about his past life and his pa=
th. So if all this turned out to be true in such a
 tremendous manner, we h=
ave no basis to say that his declaratoin of Rakhal's, or anyone else's =
;past life was not-true. </SPAN></SPAN></div>

<DIV style=3D"RIGHT: auto">Around the time when Swami Vivekananda=

<DIV style=3D"RIGHT: auto"> </DIV>
<DIV st=
yle=3D"RIGHT: auto">Loosely speaking one can say that the mind has many hid=
den abilities. But I look at it differently. We are born with three koshas =
- annamaya (physical body), pranamaya ( life-force) and manomaya (mind). Ev=
en in these, each individual with have subtle variations in the amount of i=
nfluence, clarity, depth and other things that they have at their disposal =
in the use of these koshas. This is standard knowledge. One can be born wit=
h a very roboust physical body that can sustain many things while anothe wi=
th a weak body. Etc. But there is a fourth kosha which lies only as a poten=
tial. SOme yogis, by the power of their sadhana, can develop the same. Shas=
tras call it Vigyanamaya. One of best misconcption of this age is that=
 Vgyana means intellect as we know it. Hardly. Even the most logically powe=
rful, sharpest and swiftest intellect is still a working of the manomaya ko=
sha, of course at a high pitch. But the Vigyana is sifferent.
 WHen the Yog=
i is able to develop and use this kosha various apparently supernatura=
l things can manifest. These appear supernatural from our point of view, bu=
t maybe just an ordinary funtionality of that kosha - sheath - of=
 the human organism. Is this Maya? It is as much Maya as you hands and your=
 legs are.. At a very high level of development of Vigyanamaya kosha a=
bilities of Trikal Darshan may come to the Yogi automatically. This is simi=
lar to, as I mentioned in the previous mail, the ability to enter the consc=
iousness in the Karan Jagat. That is how some exceptional Yogis, as Vimalan=
anda so offhandly remarks, can see an individual and see 25 birth in t=
