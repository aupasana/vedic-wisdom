Dear Aman,

Narayan dasa represents environment we are exposed to. And Vims=
ottary (or
some other nakshatra dasa variation) shows our reaction to the e=
nvironment.

So instead of using Narayan Dasa and Tithi Pravesh chakra. You=
 should
verify the event from Narayan Dasa and Vimsottari Dasa.

Transits, =
Tithi Pravesh and Sahamas can be used in the end to doubly sure
the logic.
=

Particularly Using Sahamas I have not been able to conclusively explain
th=
ings in various charts. So I don't give much importance to them.

Regards
D=
urgesh O Mishra
