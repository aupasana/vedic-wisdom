Dear Ranga,

Punyahavacanam is literally the "pronouncement (vAcana) of a fruitful /
good (puNya) day (aha)". It is not a separate ritual, but is part of the
preliminary rites (purvanga) for bigger rituals.

For the punyahavacana, a few yogis who know the vedas are invited, and they
chant some mantras to purify the environment around them. They declare this
to be a good muhurta, and chant some mantras to impel svasti, riddhi and
shrii (i.e. general auspiciousness).

For the taittiriya tradition, the yajusha-mantra-ratnakara document from
http://www.aupasana.com/vedas has a set of "shuddhi punyaha" and "punyaha"
mantras on pages 8 and 9 that you can use for punyahavacana.

The griha-pravesha ceremony (entering the house) has two main parts -- (i)
entering the house while bringing the scared fire and other auspicious
items into the house while chanting a few mantras and (ii) performing a
vastu homa.

For someone who is comfortable with homa and wants to do the griha pravesha
by themselves, my suggestion would be to enter the house while mentally
chanting the mantra for your ishta-devata. Enter the house with your homa
kunda and a lit lamp. Then, perform a ganapati homa. After the ganapati
homa (before the purhahuti), make offerings to vastoshpati with the vastu
sukta. Then do the standard wrap up.

In the previous document, the last paragraph on page 8 which starts with
"vAstoShpate" and ends with "shivam" is the vastu sukta. It has only 4
mantras. Make as many offerings as you can with these mantras. For someone
who is comfortable with homa, the only "new" thing is these four mantras.
Alternatively, just say "vAtoShpataye svAhA" and make offerings to
vAstoShpati with this nAma mantra.

If you know the punhahavacana procedure / mantras, you can certainly do it.
If not, don't worry about it ... it is not the focus of the ritual.

sasneham,

   ajit
