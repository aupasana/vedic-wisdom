dear seeker....the 3d form that we use to visualise during meditation is
just a tool for the human mind....how can infinity...or god ...or divinity
if u will...which is said to be infinity itself.....appear to a human
mind???
as far as I know dhyanam is a tool and not the objective....just a stepping
stone...

I think a vision is not the goal of meditation....but the understanding of
the very nature of consciousness is and should the true objective.....

think about it this way...if u do happen to see hanuman..or whomsoever u
fancy...has it occurred to u who or what is seeing or experiencing the
vision?...which is the crux of the matter.

if you can plse read about totapuri and Ramakrishna paramahansa....u will
get the idea...

with regards...and god bless
