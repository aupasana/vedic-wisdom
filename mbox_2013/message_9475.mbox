Are you doing any form of spiritual practice?<br>
<br>
If yes, th=
e best way to find answers to your questions (according to those people who=
 have found answers), is to carry on doing whatever spiritual practice that=
 appeals to you with faith and enthusiasm, without expecting anything in re=
turn. Tricky to do, but it has worked time and again with many people.<br>
=

<br>
Asking questions is a useful function of the intellect, but it has to=
 lead to actually doing some form of spiritual practice to actually find th=
e answers.<br>
<br>
There's an interesting parable from Sri Ramakrishna=
 in this regard...<br>
<br>
<a href=3D"http://www.rkmission.org.my/ramakris=
hna.html" target=3D"_blank">http://www.rkmission.org.my/ramakrishna.html</a=

<br>
"Two friends went into an orchard. One of them possessing m=
uch worldly wisdom immediately began to count the mango trees there and the=
 number of mangoes each tree bore, and to estimate what might be the value =
of the whole orchard. <br>

<br>
His companion went to the owner, made frie=
nds with him, and then, quietly going to a tree, pluck the fruits and eat t=
hem. <br>
<br>
Whom do you consider to be the wiser of the two? Eat mangoes=
. It will satisfy your hunger. <br>
<br>
What is the good of counting the t=
rees and leaves and making calculation? The vain man of intellect busies hi=
mself uselessly with finding out the `why' and `wherefore' of creat=
ion, while the humble man of wisdom makes friends with the Creator and enjo=
ys His gift of supreme bliss."<br>

<br>
It's nice to know the why=
s and wherefores of creation but the human intellect is a frail instrument =
with limited capacity and will not be able to find the answers. Peace of mi=
nd and the answers, according to the Teachers, comes through Intuition, dir=
ect experience of reality. This in turn comes from spiritual practice. <br>=


<br>
All the best with your spiritual practice....no doubt it will help y=
ou find the answers you are looking for.<br>
