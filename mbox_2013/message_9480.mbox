=C2=

does anyone know...who what and why we are her???.....so far I guess m=

it goes through a long process to merge back with the whole...and its like =

thing exists...I cant say within or without me...I don't know even what me =

that proceses thoughts and emotions...but all if it is running bye itself..=
..there doesn't seem to be an entity or what not in charge.....observe
 clo=
sely and u will get what I,m saying.......now I guess the question is...wha=
t is the gist of this so called spiritual path???......could it not be that=
 like snowflakes of nature...each one of us is no more than a momentary exp=
ression of consciousness?....why do we assume reincarnation to be true???to=
 whom do we worship???and what exactly does worship mean???and who is doing=
 the worship?.....repeating some mystical mantra or name of something that =
obviously cant be encapsulated in sound is considered by many to be spiritu=
ality..when obviously the mind that is repeating and running around at the =
same time is both one and the same...the whole process seems to me like a m=
ind game....and we feel good about theses games....like we have done someth=
ing to get 1 step closer to divinity..can we get closer????isn't the cesspo=
ol of sludge we make in the morning just as divine....and all the time in t=
he colon with us???....those who get the last statement would
 get it...the=
 rest plse ignore...and how come we have this idea that by japa,ing a gazil=
lion times some sari clad woman on a tiger is going to appear in a vision o=
r in front of us and make our existence free of suffering..and basically ma=
ke everything O.K.?....too many tamil movies perhaps?...u can also substitu=
te the sari clad woman for a man in blue with 4 arms...or a young stud on a=
 peacock...ur preference....and all for what?most of us are truly at the en=
d of the day motivated by some kind of gain...touch ur heart and tell me it=
 is not so???no carrot in front of the donkey it wont move......tell me hon=
estly....how can u have love for something u don't know and have not experi=
enced in any way???your bakthi is probably something u conjured up in ur he=
ad....and at best....an expression of ur existantial longings....we are all=
 lonely and miserable at heart....and add to that the suffering of being hu=
man.....so shall end this rant...with the question I
 began with....what th=
e f is going on guys???who what and where r we?????????????????????????????=
???????that is the question isn't it....and maybe also why......the day we =
stop asking,and accept someone elses idea as truth.....we stopped seeking.t=
he search isn't over till the fat cosmic lady sings........god bless.......=
whatever that means..............
