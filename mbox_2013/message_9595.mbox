Dear Bhupendraji,

I feel the family should recite if possible whole Chandi=
-Path for few days or at least the Chandi-Kavach everyday (its better if th=
ey take sankalpa everyday before beginning that they are chanting to protec=
t the girl from all negative energies, beings etc and free her of any such =
problems) till the girl becomes alright.

Namaste All,
I am very interested in this email thread. I kn=
ow of a family in Boston where one of the family members is posessed. I had=
 asked for help in this forum but did not get any response. If someone coul=
d provide some guidance, that would be great.
The situation is very bad and=
 the family is virtually broke becuase of this spending on medical treatmen=
t because so far, no other help. In absence of any other solution,  this os=
 being treated as medical condition.
Thanks, 
Bhupendra

Thanks, I will give it a try!

What about Kala Bhairava man=
tra? Can it be more efficient for a long-time Shiva devotee? I've heard tha=
t it can repel spirits and ghosts. Can I chant these mantras at night befor=
e going to sleep?
