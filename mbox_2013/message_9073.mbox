Namaste,

I can speak only from my point of view. Each must decide what see=
ms right to them. 

<<But if =C2=A0that is what God wanted =C2=A0that we =
=C2=A0can=C2=A0lessen their>>

Right. Only problemis how do you know whatGo=
d wants? This requires a sufficiently high state of realization to understa=
nd whatGod actually wantsand not confuse it withour belief of what we think=
 God is wanting or not wanting. Secondly when you are in a state when you c=
an understand what God wants you to do, clearly and without hesitation, the=
re is no scope for grieving or frustration or half measures. For you become=
 constantly aware of the Divine Will and the accompanying Force of the same=
. This Force is the Supreme Mother against whom no opposition, of worlds vi=
sible or worlds invisible, can stand.


But no doubt as you must have reali=
zed, it is not easy. More often we tend to confuse or impose our own ideas =
or mental beliefs, however pious and holy and apparently virtuous they seem=
 in our eyes, ontu God and act accordingly. Then when things take a turn th=
at is unforseen, we suffer from agony and grief and then try and shift goal=
posts in a vain attempt at self-justification. This is not a spiritually he=
lpful behavior. Better is to start with the first acknowledgement that we h=
ave no clue of God's Will. It can be anything.

<<.=C2=A0But=C2=A0then can =
we leave every one =C2=A0on their =C2=A0own karma. Then=C2=A0what=C2=A0is t=
he way to 
=C2=A0go =C2=A0ahead...to =C2=A0purify =C2=A0ourselves =C2=A0as =
=C2=A0well as =C2=A0those =C2=A0who =C2=A0are =C2=A0suffering?>.

If you th=
ink you can take on others Karma and happily deal with them, please go ahea=
d. I follow a different philosophy. First attain a state of realization whe=
re one is in constant communion with the Divine Will, then act as the Will =
directs. God, or whatever you chose to name it, is infinitely capable of ru=
nning the universe and managing karma of various entities. Indeed that Infi=
nity is All Powerful, Omnipotent. It has perfectall round knowledge. We don=
't. Not until a communion is firmly established inside.Till such time whate=
ver I do and however pious it may seem to me is still a product of my own c=
onditioned mindand nothing more. That is the naked truth. 


There is a dif=
ference between compassion and pity. Compassion can arise only when there i=
s detachment inside. For only in seriousdetachment, and a very quite mind i=
s it possible to understand all angles of a problem. A many-sided knowledge=
 comes. Then one realizes what exactly needs to be done, if at all anything=
 needs be done in a certain situation. Pity on the other hand jumps into ac=
tions, rather is driveninto action without this integral wisdom. It has an =
internal agitation. When Arjuna refused to kill his Gurus, he was driven ve=
ry deeply by a sense of pity. Krshna. OTOH, who works through Immaculate Wi=
sdom knew that only by the deaths of these otherwise great mencan future ge=
nerations be in peace. His vision was far reaching and more consequential. =
This was Divine Compassion. The actions based on compassion always have a g=
reater impact than pity, for compassion presupposes a settled wide-angle wi=
sdomwhich in turn can arise only in equanimity,
 detachment and internal qu=
ietude. The great Gods are always compassionate, but never pitiful. If they=
 suffered from pity, then every time someone cries for spiritual realizatio=
n these Great Beings would have rushed down and poured a realized state int=
o the consciousness in a single fraction of a second. But they don't do so.=
 Not until they know for sure that the adhara or mind-body is capable enoug=
h to make good use of their energies. They wait for the right time to inter=
vene. That is their unique compassion!

The thing is, even self purificatio=
n is not done by ourselves. At a point in sadhana one inevitable realizes t=
hat it is a Higher Force that does the purification=C2=A0 process. We are a=
t best, as the Gita describes, are a nimitta-matra. How then can one who ha=
s not reached a stable and Divine Union with the Supreme even think of puri=
fying anyone elsewhen we are not even able to purify ourselves sufficiently=
and are at the mercy of this Infinite and All Capable Force?

A deeper and =
deeper surrender from all parts of mind and life and body. A sincere, patie=
nt, respectful wait. Positive efforts at self examination and correction. I=
nternal consecration. And waiting for an eventual grace which cannot be con=
trolled or commanded or demanded. That, IMO, is the way out. Let the busine=
ss of running the world be left to God, who is more than capable of doing s=
o using a million and one methods.

As for me, only if I am 101% sanguine t=
hat someone shares an extremely strong karmic bond with me, and my trying t=
o help can be useful in some way, ONLY THEN I can make an effort to help, t=
hough it cannot be said if the effort will fructify at all. At one point I =
used to believe, a bit ignorantly, that I could help others. Now all such i=
deas are being driven out of my head.=C2=A0

That is how I look at it. I am=
 sure others will have their own differing view-points...


-Regards

Heaing=
 voices in the head or seeing things may or may not be an offshoot of a kun=

Kundalini is only one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kundalini awakening ma=

easily, even those who do sadhana can also get affected by a plethora of fa=

Doing a homa with the desire that someone gets cured =
maybe good. However, it can also have unintended consequences. Some part of=

complex and not easy at all. It is like a specialization.

That was an interesting read. But how is a doctor to tell apart kun=
dalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar=
 experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot exp=
erience- in other words, what doctors call "hallucinations". Are these hall=
ucinations or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic te=
st. 

However most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeki=
ng 'fake' patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their s=
tories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine "I hear voi=
ces in my head" schizophrenic or kundalini patient. 

About vata, most of o=
ur patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually =
unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement=
. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use o=
f Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I'm sure this does n=
o good for vata.

The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do some o=
n her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any patie=
nt. 

Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalini pat=
ient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as "psychosis" and will advise =
anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not harm t=
hem, though I doubt it will help.

Advice and thoughts from all members wou=
ld be much appreciated.

 Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Sud=
dhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose =
the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more d=
etachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, =
greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one h=
as to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a f=
ar more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 =
- A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really do=
es - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and enti=
ties, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useles=
s, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends.=
 They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-util=
izes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi
 becomes even more
>  vital. 4 -=
 While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini =
Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because =
of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and in=
sufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that =
the aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences=
 and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to v=
arious reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That=
 can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have ch=
ances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and variou=
s possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Mor=
eover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the ri=
ght knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are =
often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess
 work.

ar all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent=
 experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, a=
nd have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had=
 a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has invol=
ved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of=
 Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started =
and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything=
 physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is =
due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themse=
lves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awaken=
ing- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream=
 psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by wester=
n medicine, and as we have no treatments for
 deranged
>  kundalini, we str=
uggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My expe=
rience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be for=
cibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffer=
ing from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and =
it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there coul=
d be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who =
manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and eith=
er cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the =
good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we ma=
y not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful i=
n our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this=
 is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me=
 be your instrument" and leave the

erson suddenly experience some other nice things too. The mind is of a very=
 subtle nature. The astral world is a plethora of endless subtle entities o=

 as immature people. In the sense, those who are not aware of these can get=

is never advisable to enter into the cricket field merely with a bat in han=

      <div>That =
was an interesting read. But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises =
from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experiences,=
 such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience- in o=
ther words, what doctors call "hallucinations". Are these hallucinations or=
 the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. <br>
<br>=

However most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking 'f=
ake' patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their storie=
s tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine "I hear voices i=
n my head" schizophrenic or kundalini patient. <br>
<br>
About vata, most o=
f our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usual=
ly unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangem=
ent. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The us=
e of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I'm sure this doe=
s no good for vata.<br>
<br>
The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I wil=
l do some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this t=
o any patient. <br>
<br>
Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful i=
n the kundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as "psychosi=
s" and will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope t=
his will not harm them, though I doubt it will help.<br>
<br>
Advice and th=
oughts from all members would be much appreciated.<br>
