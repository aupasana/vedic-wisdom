Namaste friends,
=A0
Some people are confused with the "sh" sound as in "sh=
iva" or "shrI rAma" or "shava". I want to clarify it.
=A0
There are three s=
-sounds in Sanskrita - sha, Sha and sa (using iTrans notation). They appear=
 in alphabet in that order. The middle one is written in Devanagari script =
like "pa" with a cross line through it. The first letter "sha" (as in shiva=
) is pronounced by some as "Sha" and by some as "sa" and both are incorrect=
.
=A0
First some background..
=A0
Consider the five Sanskrit letters "ka" (=
k as in in kavi - poet), "cha" (ch as in chaNDI or church), "Ta" (T as in T=
om or Tapori), "ta" (t as in tantra) and "pa" (p as an pass). Pronounce the=
m in quick succession a few times - "ka cha Ta ta pa". Note the point where=
 tongue touches the upper palate/surface of mouth when you say these. For "=
ka", it will be way back in mouth, near the throat. For "cha", it will move=
 towards the front, but still in the back. For "Ta", it will move further t=
owards the front and tongue will touch a little above teeth. For "ta", tong=
ue will touch teeth. For "pa", tongue will not touch anything, but lips wil=
l touch each other.
=A0
Say "ka cha Ta ta pa" several times and notice the =
progression from the back of mouth to lips. Get a feel for the position of =
"cha Ta ta". Say "cha Ta ta" several times.
=A0
Now, the pronunciation of "=
sha Sha sa" (sh as in shiva, shrI etc, Sh as in uShA, veSha etc, s as in sa=
tya, sama) is very similar to that of "cha Ta ta". In the latter 3 sounds, =
tongue touches the upper palate of mouth at 3 places (for which you just go=
t a feel). In the former 3 sounds, tongue comes close to touching in the sa=
me 3 places, but does not actually touch. It comes close to touching and th=
ere is some gap.
=A0
With this understanding, now practice saying "cha sha"=
 several times, "Ta Sha" several times and "ta sa" several times. You will =
see that each pair is pronounced at the same place. If tongue touches mouth=
's upper palate at one position for the first sound and comes close to touc=
hing at a *different* position for the second sound in the same pair, you a=
re making a mistake. Try again.
=A0
No wonder that visarga becomes sh, Sh a=
nd s if ch, T and t (respectively) come after it, as per sandhi rules of gr=
ammar. Sanskrit grammar is very logical and based on phonology (study of so=
unds).
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
