Dear Narasimha,

Jai Ma! 

<<But dasavataras are popular 
because they all =
came from the *sustaining* principle of Supreme Being.>>

Now lets get into=
 more subtle, precise analysis :)I have the following queries.

1.Can you p=
lease explain in what way the Hamsa Avatara, or the Nara-Narayana Avatara, =
or the Dhanwantari Avatara or the Balarama Avatara or Mohini (who did a gre=
at job of denying Asuras share of amrita) is any less "sustaining" than Mat=
sya or Varaha Avtara that they should not find a place in the list of Dasav=
ataras? All of them are mentioned as Avataras of the Supreme Being in SB.

=
2. What is your opinion about the general stated idea that only Krshna is 1=
6 kala-poorna and others are not?

3. That the SB mentions Krshna as Swayam=
 Bhagwan ONLY with respect to the previous sloka where it says that all ris=
his, munis etc are also Avataras, is one interpretation, and not too popula=
r at that. OTOH, most of the great commentators, and they were no less in t=
heir spiritual merit or intellectual prowess have taken that specific verse=
 to mean Krshna to be greater than ALL Avataras. The verse itself does not =
mention that it is with respect to the previous verse, or with respect to a=
ll the 17 verses that precede it, which lists all Avataras. So it boils dow=
n to interpretation based on individual conditioning. It seems Chaitanya Ma=
haprabhu, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, etc all shared a similar conditioning wh=
ich made them read that verse to mean that only Krshna is Swayam Bhagwan. W=
ould you agree to this conclusion? :) 

4. Apparently in the Brahma Vaivart=
a Purana, Suta tells the Rishis of Naimisharanya that Krshna is greatest Av=
atara of them all. So, how do we resolve this apparent conflict between wha=
t Rishi Parashara states and what this Purana states? If it is a matter of =
personal choice, then of course matter ends here.
=C2=A0
<<If one does not =
try to understand the nature, essence and purpose of 
each avatara and look=
s at superficial things like the physical body they
 came in, and tries to =
fit them in some pattern, one will only draw 
superficial conclusions.>.


=
Unless one can provide very convincing answers as to why these 9 are consid=
ered in the list of Dasavataras and NOT others like Mohini or Danwantari wh=
o are also mentioned as Avataras, I am afraid the world will keep getting m=
ore and more convinced that this specific list of dasavataras represent a p=
arable of evoluion, where One Being comes in 9 different forms, in 9 differ=
ent times, for 9 different purposes to guide the process of evolution of li=
fe and consciousness in the manifested world on planet earth.

=C2=A0 
Dear R=
ajarshi,
=C2=A0
<<There is a nuance here. The concept of Dasavatara has cau=
ght the popular imagination, not necessarily the worship of Dasavatara.>>
=
=C2=A0
Did I use the word "worship" below? I too am talking about "catching=
 the popular imagination"! :-)
=C2=A0
Please look at the individual avatara=
s in this supposedly "evolutionary" sequence. Can anyone honestly claim tha=
t Vamana, who came after Narasimha, "caught the popular imagination" the sa=
me way Narasimha did?
=C2=A0
Out of the 9 so far, the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 8th=
 avataras of Vishnu are the "poornavataras" as per Parasara. This is utterl=
y inconsistent with any belief that avataras are an "evolutionary" sequence=
.
=C2=A0
Dasavataras are NOT an increasing sequence in ANY terms. There are=

 many avataras, which are refined aspects of Supreme Being that descended =
to earth for specific purposes based on the task at hand. But dasavataras a=
re popular because they all came from the *sustaining* principle of Supreme=
 Being. If one does not try to understand the nature, essence and purpose o=
f each avatara and looks at superficial things like the physical body they =
came in, and tries to fit them in some pattern, one will only draw superfic=
ial conclusions.

Narasimha

>>=C2=A0
>>Some freeflowing th=
oughts that struck me while thinking about some of points you have raised. =
I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel free to disagree :)
>>=C2=A0
>>=
Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquially used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawa=
n as a Superman with unlimited potentials way beyond what any normal human =
being can achieve, came into existence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali Y=
uga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate God=C2=A0on earth. It is difficul=
t to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawan=
a. The Bhagawata religion started from the Gita and a contemplation of the =
life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujachar=
ya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as t=
he nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translation =
of the Gita) - considered, (with differing nuances on the=C2=A0relation bet=
ween jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception o=
f God on earth. This was aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of t=
he earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a co=
mplete Avatara. Some,
 like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and=
 took a very literal view of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Bei=
ng, and the formless Paramatma, as well as Narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0th=
e aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but=
 was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in =
himself.
>>=C2=A0
>>Whatever the case maybe, each school had its own set of=
 established saints and scholars to vouch for their views. So it boiled dow=
n to interpretation, which is often, as you rightly pointed out, based on=
=C2=A0various conditionings.
>>=C2=A0
>>We=C2=A0human beings are creatures =
of imagination. Whenever an Avatar appears on the earth,=C2=A0most of the g=
reat Mahatmas who appear after the Avatara, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=
=A0character of the last Avatara=C2=A0because invariable in the context of =
the desh-kaal-patra of those times, the life of the Avatara shows actions p=
erformed which are=C2=A0way beyond=C2=A0imagination for *those times*. Such=
 a situation continues until the next Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in =
the period after Rama, and before Krshna, of which we have very little writ=
ten record, the world at large remained entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.
=
>>=C2=A0
>>In this light Krshna is the Poorna-Avatara. When Kalki will appe=
ar on earth, he will be invarible accompanied by a set of powerful Rishis -=
 every Avatara comes with his coterie of Rishis who explain the philosophy =
and spirituality of the Avatara to the general masses - who will then creat=

 Avataras.

to cross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he=
 could have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his=
 army. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean a=

on, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has some f=
orm of power or influence in
 this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had no ma=
lice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He was th=
e very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningn=
ess are impossible.
>>=C2=A0
>>Recently, a friend of mine told me that he h=
as learnt all his life that one must listen to Krshna's advice, but only fo=
llow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehementl=
y. If one reads entire Krshna's life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna of=
 Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru =
who speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the=
 Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all thro=
ugh his life at every instance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under all=
 circumstances of life, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes m=
e wonder, was this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do something lik=
e this? It is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate from e=
verything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He ha=
d not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wif=
e abducted for him to start a war against Ravana.
 But Krshna had zero=C2=
=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents fro=
m Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he=
 forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a gr=

ama all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0=
Balarama in his next incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshn=
a. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they d=
oing with all these kings, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their v=
illage in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will =
understand everything. But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, =
with perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false prais=
es, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I=
 am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I
 wo=
rship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single =
sadhaka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kin=
d of perfected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from =
the world or actively performing a larger dharma.

monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with=
 a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of d=
ejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when circumstance=

arching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final=
 assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed =
the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells S=
ita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue he=
r, but it
 was the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That t=
oo was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look a=
t this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for rep=
resenting the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, a=
nd not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribul=
ation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed =
into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal consideration or =
emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of w=
hat a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment rig=
ht from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. I=
t is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from people, fro=
m environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, =
he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster par=
ents,
 his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would m=
ake no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, s=
ettled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshn=
a tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won't understand,=
 he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never=
 returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to part=
icipate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started get=
ting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the =
scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any specia=
l right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept drop=
ping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse=
 was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into his poise=
. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist
 an=
d charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of=
 Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his =
vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies =
off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in th=
e whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a s=
ingle shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actio=
ns, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then right in the =
middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most=
 sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal =
of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. I=
t is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the instrumen=
t. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or wh=
en advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema
 to hit Du=
ryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as i=
f by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined u=
p which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge=
 cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly a=
nd consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind =
of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana=
. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts =
and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have =
a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita tur=
ns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships =
her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that=
 emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore h=
e displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief
 of which is self-=
control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from hi=
s wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly=
. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the s=
tability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything i=
n this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he w=
as never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him =
even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in =
this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars.=
 His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in =
a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this n=
ot in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated t=
his world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then why se=
nd so many avatars at crucial stages of
 evolutionary development? If the s=
piritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then w=
hy not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But=
 do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Naray=
ana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava tradition=
s in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, =
to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of li=
fe as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind=
 of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an o=
bject of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of the Nath =
Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functio=
ns. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most peop=
le, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding B=
uddha - correspond to the full
 power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. =
Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow th=
e consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities, are =
9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the =
chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. An=
d the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which gr=
aha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, =
however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rul=
e out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepresenta=
tion in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet app=
eared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books=
, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is perfect=
ly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in t=
he full and complete
 purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah.=
 By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing f=
orces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used =
diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I=
 am speculating, won't even need that. The white horse and that sword is a =
metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the various err=
ors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the sto=
ry of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am rea=
sonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =C2=A0R=

=C2=A0 There was a discussion on Lord Vishnu's Dasavataras on a limited acc=
ess forum on Facebook. A learned friend wrote that "Krshna is the God-man",=
 "Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage" and "Buddha after Krshna i=
s like going back from the linear progression of spirituality that the Avat=
ars manifest one after the other upto Krshna". =C2=A0 I want to emphaticall=
y disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a "linear progression of spi=
rituality..upto Krshna". =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Each avatara represen=
ts an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. =C2=A0 Maharshi Parasara equat=
ed dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are S=
un, Moon and Mars, respectively. =C2=A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, =
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul=
, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, sp=
irit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline,
 spirit of innovation/b=
reaking barriers and detachment (respectively). =C2=A0 Correspondingly, eac=
h avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. E=
ach story is an example of how that aspect operates. =C2=A0 Lord Rama's sto=
ry is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna's story is a p=
erfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana's story is a perfected e=
xample of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha's story is a p=
erfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=

=A0 * =C2=A0 Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, =
energy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipl=
ine/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Sel=
f. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has differen=
t qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.=
 =C2=A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us first,
 perfect it and then perfec=
t other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the=
 end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable =
and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=

that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities=
 of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one wh=
o is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstr=
ates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and=
 subjective preference. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Let us focus on Rama a=
nd Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in =
us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and has n=
o agendas, no likes or dislikes. =C2=A0 Once mind fancies a separate existe=
nce with some
 agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousn=
ess stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength a=
nd support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind,=
 energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It suppor=
ts them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It =
impassionately witnesses and records all of one's agendas and karmas so tha=
t Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite full=
 awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. =
As mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the=
 notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports =
them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionat=
ely. =C2=A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functio=
nality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interes=
ting enough
 to some. =C2=A0 On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes an=
d agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achi=
eving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!!=
 Though soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consc=
iousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind tha=
t keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and e=
ven decides/affects every entity's dharma. That way, mind is really the "bo=
ss" of the individualization. No wonder Krishna's life appeals more to one =
who may be excited by this description! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

rishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama's life in perspectiv=
e. =C2=A0 Rama's life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he re=
ceived Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whateve=
r was his "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was give=
n
 kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the be=
hest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had n=
o complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty t=
o various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed=
 his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with =
Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it i=
mpassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he sear=
ched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him t=
o leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every l=
ife situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Eve=
n as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impass=
ionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully le=
arned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana! =C2=A0 Rama
 =
is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impa=
ssionately discharges one's dharma arising from the momentum of karmas befo=
re liberation. THAT is basically what soul does! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=
=A0 As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect=
 demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =C2=A0 He was born as=
 a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable =
demon king with many great qualities. =C2=A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes on=
e humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demon=
ic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one's discrimination is not please=
d until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one's entire consciousn=
ess, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
* =C2=A0 Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be understo=
od as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of
 our consciousness o=
perate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =C2=A0 Let us not compare Da=
savataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are mor=
e attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and develo=
p devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara. =C2=A0 *=C2=

a Avatara or Mohini (who did a great job of denying Asuras share of amrita)=

eneral stated idea that only Krshna is 16 kala-poorna and others are not?<b=
r><br>3. That the SB mentions Krshna as Swayam Bhagwan ONLY with respect to=
 the previous sloka where it says that all rishis, munis etc are also Avata=
ras, is one interpretation, and not too popular at that. OTOH, most of the =
great commentators, and they were no less in their spiritual merit
 or inte=
llectual prowess have taken that specific verse to mean Krshna to be greate=
r than ALL Avataras. The verse itself does not mention that it is with resp=
ect to the previous verse, or with respect to all the 17 verses that preced=
e it, which lists all Avataras. So it boils down to interpretation based on=
 individual conditioning. It seems Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallavacharya, Nim=
barka, etc all shared a similar conditioning which made them read that vers=

 of personal choice, then of course matter ends here.<br> <br><<=
If one does not try to understand the nature, essence and

conclusions.>.<br><br><br>Unless one can provide very convincing answers=
 as to why these 9 are considered in the list of Dasavataras and NOT others=
 like Mohini or Danwantari who are also mentioned as Avataras, I am afraid =
the world will keep getting more and more convinced that this specific list=
 of dasavataras represent a parable of evoluion, where One Being comes in 9=
 different forms, in 9 different times, for 9 different purposes to guide t=
