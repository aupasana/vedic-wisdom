Dear Narasimha Ji and other members.
	I have been following this forum for =
some time now and joined this week so that I can take part and get help wit=
h questions I have from time to time.  Hope members of the forum would be h=
elpful and share their views. Here are few questions I have with Chandi pat=
h/homam
(1) I read in Vedavani Saptashati book about Pallav, Yojana and Sam=
puta Chandi path. For Samputa patha, they mention to chant a verse before a=
nd after of each verse, so we have 700(700)700 =96 2100 total verse to chan=
t. Did I get it right here? any other opinion?
(2) In the parivar devata aa=
huti and Saptashati mahayantra (6th circle), we have 24 devatas [Vishnumaya=
=85=85.Chiti], however, the  5th chapter of Saptashati,  Dhruti and Pushti =
are missing, wonder why. I tend to include them when I do stuthi mantra alo=
ne in the same order as in 6th circle of mahayantra.
(3) Narasimha Ji, I re=
ad that Swami Sathasivom did 1,000 Chandi homas during a 3-month period. I =
was curious to know how was his day to day conduct. Not that I can think of=
 100day at stretch but could help for 3 or 5 days. What I would like to kno=
w, what and how much he ate during this period, at what times of day, how m=
uch water one can drink. Was he sitting whole day at stretch for 10 homams =
or did 5+5 homam morning evening? Any detailed info I guess would be helpfu=
l for all here.
Thanking you,
Digamber
