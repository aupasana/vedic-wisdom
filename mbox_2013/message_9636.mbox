Namaste.
  >>>I would like to upload a hyphenated version - with long words=
 hyphenated in a way that'll be easier for me to say together fast. I'm jus=
t curious to think what your opinion of that would be.

  Sure Ji. But as I=
 said, you can break the word in any way depending upon the syllables, beca=
use AFTER YOU MEMORIZE, you will see that remembering and saying the whole =
word is very very easy, no matter how big it is!
  Thanks
  Tanvir
