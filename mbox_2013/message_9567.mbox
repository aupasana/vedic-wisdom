Hello everyone,

Recently I was staying at an old house in a village. I had=
 trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises -  creaking an=
d something moving in the attic. I'm very sensitive to different energies -=
 I don't see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rather evil i=
s present in a certain place. That place didn't feel good to me.

I was sta=
ying there for 10 days and every night I would make up because of a feeling=
 of somebody staring at me - I could see them but once I started focusing o=
n them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a terrified state breat=
hing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some steps near the bed and a=
 roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.

This doesn't seem like =
sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my bo=
dy.

Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There w=
ere a few more people staying at that place and everybody had severe proble=
ms with sleep, so it's not just me.

On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram=
 at that place before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able=
 to sleep properly.

Upon coming back home from that place I started waking=
 up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up t=
o 50 cm in height, I've seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, =
all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.

Is there=
 any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? =
Something that I can chant before going to sleep. This has been bothering m=
e for some time now and it interferes with my life.

Thank you in advance!
=
