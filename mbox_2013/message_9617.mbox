Dear Saurabh,

I think these are very genuine queries. Some important thing=
s to ponder over regarding this question:

1. What does it mean to "see" a =
devata? If one does not see, can one "hear" a Devata, or feel His/Her prese=
nce?

2. Is seeing a Devata similar to seeing another person or a shopping =
mall or a Disney land? If it is same then why can't we see Devatas whenever=
 we wish. If not, what is different?

3. What do you expect to happen if an=
d when you see a Devata? Assuming that it were possible. For example if you=
 say want to see/meet Barrack Obama you have a certain expectation in your =
mind about how the interaction will go. Similarly what kind of expectation =
is in the mind about the idea of seeing/meeting a Devata..

4. Krshna was a=
 Devata who lived like a Devata in this material plane. We can be sure of t=
his from the list of miraculous incidents surrounding Him from childhood. H=
is lifting a mountain on a finger, showing the Universe to his mother insid=
e his mouth, displaying his 4 armed forms, using the Sudarshana Chakra to c=
ut off the head of Sishupala, causing an eclipse to happen by will, cloning=
 Himself into multiple number of exactly same forms such that he could be p=
resent with all the gopis at the same time etcetera. These are things which=
 a Devata can do and a human can't. So people around Him were effectively s=
eeing Devata in flesh and blood, in full potency. Did it really cause a mas=
sive spiritual turn in their lives? For some yes, for others no. INfact str=
angely it was the Gopis, whose interaction with Krshna was for the least pe=
riod of time compared to many others - since Krshna could never come back t=
o Vrndavana once He left for Mathura - who benefitted
 maximum (spiritually=
 speaking) from Him. Then as He spoke the Gita, Krshna showed a Virat Roopa=
 - a Universal Form, so infinite that it is impossible to experience proper=
ly by the five senses even if they have been made subtle by His blessings -=
 to Arjuna who got so scared that he begged the Lord to change the form int=
o the one which is easier for him to grasp, 4-armed Vishnu. SO what kind of=
 meeting/seeing/darshan is our mind expecting when it comes to a Devata? 

=
The normal/human form - which may or may not benefit a seeker depending on =
the internal state of the seeker? (It benefitted Gopis, it did not benefit =
many others)

The special form - in case of Krshna with four arms holding s=
hankha, chakra, gada etc? This form has benefitted many. Yet, when Krshna a=
ppeared in this form to Gopis, they refused to accept Him and asked Him to =
come back in his form as Krshna. So we cannot say for sure that this kind o=
f a Divine form is sufficient to push a seeker into a high spiritual state.=


Finally the Universal Form. This cannot be digested by anyone. Irrespecti=
ve of Divine Sense or gross senses. No body in the history of spirituality =
has been able to experience the truly and infinitely Universal Form and sta=
y sane or not feel fear and awe. Not one instance. There was in Bengal a gr=
eat sadhaka named Swami Nigamananda Saraswati about 150 years ago. He was a=
 disciple of the great Aghori Vamakhepa and by Vama's blessing he had reali=
zed the Goddess Smashan Tara. One day the disciple insisted that he wanted =
to see the Universal form of the Mother Tara. Vama his guru tried to dissua=
de him. But he was adamant and kept asking the form of Ma Tara that he coul=
d see and interact with, to appear in the Universal form. The next thing he=
 saw was just a face, whose fierce blood-dripping fangs encompassed the who=
le sky and covered his entire range of vision. Swami Nigamananda fainted im=
mediately. Mind you, he had by then already acquired great proficiency
 in =
worship of Smashan Tara - the very same Devata whom he requested to appear =
before him in a Universal form. Later when he came back to senses, he saw V=
ama fanning his head and telling him never to ask Her for the Universal for=
m. It simply CANNOT be digested by anyone! 
Basically this 
mean, to me, th=
at our consciousness CANNOT ever comprehend INFINITY as 
it is. It will alw=
ays make an approximation for its own good. Moses 
could not take the raw L=
ight of God in the burning bush episode on Mt Sinai. Same thing.

So is it =
this form of a Devata that we want to see? Is it even possible to see/hear/=
touch/experience?

More importantly, what is the difference between these v=
arious seeings? Infact, why are they different in the first place?

5. The =
important question to ask would be, IMHO, not whether Devatas can be "seen"=
, but what do we, as seekers, expect to happen IF a Devata chooses to manif=
est Himself/Herself on our consciousness? Unless we are very, very, very ex=
ceptional, such that a Devata has pre-decided based on certain karmas and p=
romises from past existences to come and intervene in our lifepath - as it =
happened with Aghori Vimalananda - and pull our strings, chances are that w=
e may not derive much benefit from a casual meeting with a Devata, just lik=
e so many in the Kurukshetra never derived any benefit from meeting Krshna,=
 who was a Devata no doubt.

A Devata has various roopas depending on which=
 instrument we are using to percieve Him/Her. The sthoola roopa - gross for=
m (rare but not impossible for a Devata). You need the gross phsyical sense=
 to experience this. The sukshma roopa where we need subtle senses to perce=
ive the Devata. This is what mostly happens with people who "see" Devatas. =
Such an interaction can very good, to just another day with nothing special=
. It all depends on how much internal preparation has been done by the seek=
er. As an analogy, you can, if lucky, go and meet Barrack Obama say hi and =
come back. Nothing much happens. Over time you forget it and life goes on. =
Or you can also meet Obama and then maybe impress him so much that he in tu=
rn does something really nice for you which he is well capable of, which su=
stains long and changes your life. 

Then there is the causal form and the =
greater causal form. These are too rare. To have a "Darshan"/experience of =
a Devata in these forms, one will have to do solid work of self-transformat=
ion. That is detachment, control of internal enemies, etc etc, the standard=
 advices which all scriptures and sadgurus tell us. One experience of any D=
evata in the causal form is sufficient to leave a massive impact on a perso=
n's life for ever. And the greater causal is mostly offlimits for just abou=
t 99.999999% of us. That is the Universal Form. These are similar to experi=
ence of the Self or the soul, as enumerated in the Upanishadic literature. =
Nothing less.

-Regards

=C2=A0 
Namaskar,=C2=A0I have a very simple & interesting =C2=A0ques=
tion to ask from the respected members on this forum:



My question is in =
respect of vision of god in kaliyuga - is
possible or not in today's parlan=
ce?

And if it is possible so would a person able to see or
manifest god=E2=
=80=99s presence through divya chakshu which he can develop through
right s=
adhna and yog, is it right!
Going through different blog over the internet =
and as per my
personal belief and understanding what I can conclude that a =
person should
develop high thinking, he should be free from false ego, =C2=
=A0should be humble in his approach and there
should be a significant reduc=
tion of lust, anger and greed within his personality traits, only then he
f=

OR
Any person can view God through mantra jap by following certain rituals =
with or
without developing these qualities. Because I came to know that lor=

can give his vision through a specific mantra and after attaining=
 siddhi he can
appear before the japak

What qualities wer=
e present in Druva, Prahalad & renowned
saints which attracts the supreme p=

himself in front of them, is it due to intense love, Bhakti=
 or what exactly!!
Can anyone please put some light and elaborate this for =
my
understanding. Sometimes right explanation is must for a seeker and I th=
ink God will help me in this through your vital inputs.

Suggestions & insi=
ghts will be highly appreciated and can prove helpful in fostering divine k=

Thanks &=
