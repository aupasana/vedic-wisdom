Namaste friends,
=A0
Bhakti yoga or the path of surrender and devotion is i=
ndeed more suitable in this age. I did not mean to say otherwise.
=A0
But j=
ust having an ishta devata is not enough to be "protected" from deep and tr=
oublesome instabilities when one's body-mind complex goes through a big tra=
nsformation. Not every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ra=
vanas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for "psycholog=
ical disorder", the second lady "did much sadhana of Srirama". Even those w=
ho think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, men=
tal and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one's conditioning and desir=
es!) interpretation of internal/external experiences and even madness.
=A0
=
True surrender/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but cu=
ltivating it is as difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In f=
act, true surrender and detachment are almost the same.
=A0
This is why I s=
aid that *lightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One with =
dense conditioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god a=
re ready to help.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
N=
ow, the question is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortunately, ther=
e is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, ho=
mam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by regular introspection an=
d self-improvement.
=A0
Taking mind away from its current pre-occupations (=
e.g. "I am smart", "I am doing good sadhana", "I am mad at X", "I did not g=
et what I deserve in Y", "I am better than X", "I must have Y at any cost" =
etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for these thoughts k=
eep *reinforcing* the conditioning!
=A0
To reduce the regular pre-occupatio=
ns of mind, different imagery/visualization may work better for some people=
.
=A0
One approach is to contemplate god whenever possible, in the middle o=
f any activity. You can imagine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/ab=
le person or as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that =
is so perfect and fascinating for the mind to contemplate that it does not =
care about other objects around that are making shadripus and ashtapashas w=
ork on the mind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its regular debilitati=
ng pre-occupations, one can try to contemplate god instead.
=A0
Mind is a w=
ild animal. As Pi says in the movie "Life of Pi" about the tiger on the boa=
t, wild animals can't be transformed or domesticated, but they can be train=
ed into some habits!
=A0
Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if on=
e thinks "the omnipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument" and st=
arts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of thinking too much a=
bout limited sense objects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done =
by shadripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for what they did, if one th=
inks "the omnipresent God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that in=
strument" and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of bei=
ng angry at someone, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shad=
ripus. And so on.
=A0
In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes l=
aced with ego. Every now and then, the activity ends up becoming about ones=
elf rather than about god ("*I* am doing this nice bhajan", "*I* am doing t=
his nice homam", "I think *I* am making progress through this"). With effor=
t and perseverance, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it cente=
red on the supreme power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long time t=
o train a wild animal, it takes a long time to train mind!
=A0
Try to devel=
op devotion and surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of=
 a concept/principle of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/c=
ontemplate that concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditati=
ng. When mind veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don't spen=
d too much time dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gen=
tly into contemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about your=
self.
=A0
The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make=
 it about themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable=
, try to break free from it.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *
=A0
Finally, one can try to overcome the limited sense of self and en=
gage in selfless actions that benefit a larger set of people than oneself. =
What stops us from truly loving god is our deep and sub-conscious love for =
*ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* notion of self that drives the current body=
-mind complex). One way to overcome that is to selflessly love others. Afte=
r all, other people around us are as much replicas of god as we are. If we =
cannot empathize with them, love them and give them unconditionally, how ca=
n we ever hope to transcend the limited sense of Self and truly love omnipr=
esent God?
=A0

occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy=
 for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? =
In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses no=
thing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization =
without any out of body experiences. These are not my word's, but Maharshi =

>>=A0

As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Nature has a=
 delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints on what
 =
Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous actions). So =
Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it o=
r want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one's who=
le life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not e=
njoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, on=
e may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another case=
, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn as a tig=
er or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that experience.=
 Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives, always "see=
king" something they are "missing".
>>=A0
>>Anyway, coming back to Kundalin=
i, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundal=
ini and one's
 previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, o=

ng. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various eleme=

 of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakeni=
ng happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force=
. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care o=
f the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and =
when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various othe=
r things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some o=
f them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual =
for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nat=
ure and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even mo=
re
 vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience=
 of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycholog=
y are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is =
puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible s=
ometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various sub=

auma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind an=

y recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at pr=

 has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This h=
as involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She i=

anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that =
this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describ=

akti yoga or the path of surrender and devotion is indeed more suitable in =
this age. I did not mean to say otherwise.<br> <br>But just having an =
ishta devata is not enough to be "protected" from deep and troublesome inst=
abilities when one's body-mind complex goes through a big transformation. N=
ot every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After a=
ll, out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for "psychological disorder"=
, the second lady "did much sadhana of Srirama". Even those who think of a =
deity and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, mental and spirit=
ual disorders, wrong (colored by one's conditioning and desires!) interpret=
ation of internal/external experiences and even madness.<br> <br>True =
surrender/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but
 cultiv=
ating it is as difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact,=
 true surrender and detachment are almost the same.<br> <br>This is wh=
y I said that *lightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One =
with dense conditioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or =
god are ready to help.<br> <br>*      &n=
bsp; *        *<br> <br>Now, the qu=
estion is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no si=
ngle magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc ca=
n help, but they need to be augmented by regular introspection and self-imp=
rovement.<br> <br>Taking mind away from its current pre-occupations (e=
.g. "I am smart", "I am doing good sadhana", "I am mad at X", "I did not ge=
t what I deserve in Y", "I am better than X", "I must have Y at any cost" e=
tc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for
 these thoughts k=
eep *reinforcing* the conditioning!<br> <br>To reduce the regular pre-=
occupations of mind, different imagery/visualization may work better for so=
me people.<br> <br>One approach is to contemplate god whenever possibl=
e, in the middle of any activity. You can imagine a being in your mind, eit=
her as an ideal/able person or as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in =
many beings, that is so perfect and fascinating for the mind to contemplate=
 that it does not care about other objects around that are making shadripus=
 and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its =
regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can try to contemplate god instea=
d.<br> <br>Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says in the movie "Life of Pi"=
 about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can't be transformed or domestic=
ated, but they can be trained into some habits!<br> <br>Whenever one i=
s enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks "the
 omnipresent God is enjoy=
ing this thru this instrument" and starts contemplating the qualities of th=
at god instead of thinking too much about limited sense objects, one is bet=
ter placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whenever one is angry at=
 someone for what they did, if one thinks "the omnipresent God is giving me=
 the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument" and starts contemplating the=
 qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone, one is better pla=
ced to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on.<br> <br>In the =
beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. Every now and =
then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than about god ("*=
I* am doing this nice bhajan", "*I* am doing this nice homam", "I think *I*=
 am making progress through this"). With effort and perseverance, one can a=
void making it about oneself and keep it centered on the supreme power that=
 runs the show. Just as it takes a long
 time to train a wild animal, it ta=
kes a long time to train mind!<br> <br>Try to develop devotion and sur=
render. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/principl=
e of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that con=
cept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When mind veers=
 off into other things, gently steer it back. Don't spend too much time dis=
secting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into contemplat=
ing god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself.<br> <br>=
The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it about =
themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try to b=
reak free from it.<br> <br>*       =
 *        *<br> <br>Finally, one ca=
n try to overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions =
that benefit a larger set of
 people than oneself. What stops us from truly=
 loving god is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *l=
imited* notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way =
to overcome that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people arou=
nd us are as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with th=
em, love them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to transc=
end the limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God?<br> <br>=

br> <br>Someone with psychiatric problems may expereience what sounds =
like a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not be one.<br> <br>It must b=
e conceded though that Kundalini spontaneously rising through various nadis=
 without one having gone through proper preparation in this life (i.e. fine=
-tuning of one's attitude and development of detachment) CAN create havoc!<=
br> <br>One may wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in a layma=
n with no sadhana, while many serious sadhakas may not experience it.<br>&n=
bsp;<br>Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL S=
TEP in overcoming one's current limited identity.<br> <br>Let me give =
an analogy. One wanting to move from one's small dilapidated house (this bo=
dy-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the p=
alace over time and
 move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one =
occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy=
 for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? =
In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses no=
thing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization =
without any out of body experiences. These are not my word's, but Maharshi =
Vasishtha's words to Lord Rama.<br> <br>Secondly, one does not get som=
ething without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may=
 have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put e=
nough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprep=
ared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.<br>=
 <br>As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Na=
ture has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints=
 on what
 Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous act=
ions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer=
 want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth=
 one's whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One=
 may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life afte=

antra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddh=
i. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose th=
e human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more det=
achment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, gr=
eed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has=
 to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far=
 more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - =
A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does=
 - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entiti=
es, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless,=
 and given half a chance can make
 use of the individual for its own ends. =
They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utili=
zes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more vital. 4 - Whil=
e someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakt=
i awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of th=
is. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insuffi=
cient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the a=
ura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and =
helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to variou=
s reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can =
allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances=
 of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various pos=
siblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover=
, even if such a diagnosis
 is correctly done, very few can have the right =
knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are ofte=
n doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work. Sometimes it will have=
 results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point i=

<div>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini synd=
rome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psych=
iatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who see=
ms to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since ch=
ildhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in =
the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini unti=
l her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not bee=
n able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it=
 might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call menta=
lly ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spont=
aneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into t=
his topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not we=
ll-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for derange=
d
 kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken th=
e kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundali=
ni should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at time=
s because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it wi=
ll consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what=
 solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the=
 Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of =
this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May=
 I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others =
like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And=
 let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation our=
selves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps s=
afest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the kundalini
