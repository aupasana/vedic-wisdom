namaste,

In the very first chapter of the yoga vasishtha, there is a short but very
interesting story. Once, Vishnu went from Vaikuntha to Brahmaloka. Everyone
in Brahmaloka, led by Brahma himself, got up to receive Vishnu. Sanatkumara
alone remained seated. Vishnu told him, "You remain still because you think
you are beyond desire, though this is rooted in ego, and you are still
afflicted by desire. Since you have yet to overcome desire, you will
still undergo another birth."

When this applies to Sanatkumara, who are we to think that we are beyond
impurities and karma-yoga?

sasneham,

   ajit
