Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
I am cc'ing this to v=
edic-wisdom yahoogroup because of the spiritual content.
=C2=A0
I agree wit=
h Vishnu ji's comment on a specific point in Maja ji's nice write-up:
=C2=

=C2=A0
Indeed, one can carve one's=
 own niche by combining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually e=
xclusive.
=C2=A0
I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" whe=
re he makes a comment on the 4 paths:
=C2=A0
"Each soul is potentially divi=
ne. The goal is to manifest this divinity
 within by controlling
 nature: e=
xternal and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control,=
 or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free."
=C2=A0
He=
re are my 2 cents.
=C2=A0
Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wis=
dom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on =
self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surre=
nder to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop=
 that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender=
 to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities devel=
ops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a realiz=
ed person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualities ful=
ly blossomed.
=C2=A0
Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatrams=
a etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99%=
 of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controlling body and mi=
nd and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requires strict =
yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and foo=
d, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dang=
erous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in =
"Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He disc=
ouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Viv=
ekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.
=C2=A0
Jnana yoga =
is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the delusional=
 trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/smart eno=
ugh for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatev=
er I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion anyway" without f=
ully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in consciou=
sness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a movie that "it's j=
ust a movie and not reality", but flinching in every scary scene, crying in=
 every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, =
jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant contemplation an=
d self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the end.
=C2=
=A0
IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the m=
ost suitable and safest.
=C2=A0

Narasimha
