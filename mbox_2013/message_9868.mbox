If the body and mind get dissolved upon death, then where does karma
attach? If the soul can recall, doesn't this soul now have some sort of a
body and/or mind? Instead of explicitly admitting a body (whether it is
subtle or gross) that survives upon death, haven't you just created an
implicit body bound to your concept of a soul?

sasneham,

    ajit

<div s=
tyle=3D"font-size:12pt;font-family:'times new roman','new york&=
#39;,times,serif"><div><span>Namaste,<br><br>To add to the complexity of th=
e problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over simplif=
ied and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the so=
ul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a r=
ole to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a l=
ife where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and sh=
ine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process.=
 Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.=
<br>

<br>The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They bel=
ieve in Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah. Therefore their ide=
a of reincarnation is very different. It is like an energy stream made up o=
f mind, body that coalesces together
 to give the impression of an individu=
al being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the greate=
r flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation =
at a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a different po=
int can coalesce into a different part. =A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama=
, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy =
reincarnate into one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into=
 another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech i=
ncarnating in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another p=
erson, or his energy of body incarnating in another person and all these ha=
ppening simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.<br>

<br>Those philo=
sophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Univer=
se only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of debt=
s/balances - rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this=
 term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and =
move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that i=
s of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal ren=
unciation of life and its processes.<br>

<br>But the old Vedantic idea was=
 different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike body/m=
ind etc - but carried forward from one life to another and the chief aim of=
 human evolution was to assist and develop this soul's influence on the=
 earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpo=
se. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul - for no two so=
uls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *consciously* oper=
ate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=A0</span><span>=
<span> A Supreme Negation of life is 
not the ultimate aim, it is only one =
among many possibilities.=A0 If=A0 moving into a state 
of complete negatio=
n/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim,
 then there was just =
no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex
 life-actions. </span>T=
he law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of gi=
ve and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The import=
ant thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth=
 to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediate=
ly. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That i=
s why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can tra=
nsform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born =
a hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. </span>=
<span>Whereas those aspects of life 
where the soul has no play or no scope=
 of play, are firmly governed by 
the law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical gi=
ve and take of energy. </span></div><div style=3D"font-style:normal;font-si=
