Hi Aparna ji,

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 You might remember I had wri=
tten to you before.

You mentioned about the migraines. I had been sufferin=
g a lot because of it too.

I did try a mudra which provided some relief. 
=

Press the tip of each finger (the nail part) of the left hand with the thu=
mb and index finger of the right hand.
The pressing should be done when exh=
aling and release the fingers when inhaling.
Repeat the same with the other=
 hand.
Repeat the process 10 times. Try and see if this works out.

How is =
life in the UK? Which part of UK did you say you were? I forgot, stupid me =
:)

best regards,

=C2=A0
=C2=A0 
Dear all,

I am coming to the end of my purascharan=
a practice of the ashtakshari mantra-
will finish next week on Oct 9. I tho=
ught I would share some thoughts with you
about my perception of the effect=
s of my practice.

I would say the biggest effect (that I can perceive) is =
on my physical self. In
simple terms, I find that if I flout Nature's rules=
, specifically regarding
proper sleep and food, without fail I get an awful=
 migraine. This never used to
be the case. I have had dreadful working hour=
s in the past (before starting the
purascharana) and could get away with sk=
ipping meals and sleeping erratically
if work demanded it. 

However I simp=
ly cannot do this anymore. I have had a ridiculous number of
migraines in t=
he last two years, which coincides with starting the purascharana
two years=
 ago. It may just be happening because I'm getting older, but before I
star=
ted this practice, I could generally get away with going to bed late and
wa=
king late. I know this is not the habit of a true sadhak, but when you get
=
home from work late, sometimes going to bed straightaway can be frustrating=

(because it feels like you did nothing all day but work). I always wanted =
to be
more disciplined but found it difficult especially after a long day a=
t work.

Anyway, I now have no choice but to get to sleep latest by 10.30 p=
m, or I can
expect a migraine the next day. Needless to say, sleeping early=
 means I wake up
early, and end up doing sadhana early- a habit I struggled=
 to cultivate due to
erratic working hours. Thanks to Mother Nature, I am n=
ow pretty much forced to
obey what I call basic 'yoga rules' - not skipping=
 meals (disturbs my vata
dosha!), sleeping on time- basically being more di=
sciplined. I feel that She is
standing over me with a stick, forcing me to =
get to bed on time and eat
sensibly!

Regarding the effects on the practice=
 on my mind, the old enemies (anger, envy,
etc) still rear their ugly heads=
, but I am more aware of them- and am now a bit
better at keeping them in c=
ontrol. Still have plenty of work to do before they
are completely eliminat=
ed.

I am happy that (by coincidence) the finishing date of the purascharan=
a happens
to be mid-Navaratri. I am planning to start an anushthana of the =
Navarna mantra
tomorrow. I plan to do japa of the Navarna mantra- three mal=
as a day- for just
over a year to complete 125,000 repetitions (supposedly =
the minimum for any
anusthana). I plan to keep up the Ashtakshari mantra to=
o at 7 malas a day.

I am now on a tridosha pacifying diet in the hope that=
 the migraines will improve.
I am also going to try to sleep even earlier (=
by 10 pm) in the hope that this
will enable me to wake up in brahma muhurth=
a daily (luckily sunrise in the UK
is at 7 am at present!). 

A happy Navar=
atri to all of you.

Best wishes,

Aparna

ay the biggest effect (that I can perceive) is on my physical self. In
simp=
le terms, I find that if I flout Nature's rules, specifically regarding
pro=
per sleep and food, without fail I get an awful migraine. This never used t=
o
be the case. I have had dreadful working hours in the past (before starti=
ng the
purascharana) and could get away with skipping meals and sleeping er=
ratically
if work demanded it. <br>
<br>
However I simply cannot do this an=
ymore. I have had a ridiculous number of
migraines in the last two years, w=
hich coincides with starting the purascharana
two years ago. It may just be=
 happening because I'm getting older, but before I
started this practice, I=
 could generally get away with going to bed late and
waking late. I know th=
is is not the habit of a true sadhak, but when you get
home from work late,=
 sometimes going to bed straightaway can be frustrating
(because it feels l=
ike you did nothing all day but work). I always wanted to be
more disciplin=
ed but found it difficult especially after a long day at work.<br>
<br>
Any=
way, I now have no choice but to get to sleep latest by 10.30 pm, or I can
=
expect a migraine the next day. Needless to say, sleeping early means I wak=
e up
early, and end up doing sadhana early- a habit I struggled to cultivat=
e due to
erratic working hours. Thanks to Mother Nature, I am now pretty mu=
ch forced to
obey what I call basic 'yoga rules' - not skipping meals (dist=
urbs my vata
dosha!), sleeping on time- basically being more disciplined. I=
 feel that She is
standing over me with a stick, forcing me to get to bed o=
n time and eat
sensibly!<br>
<br>
Regarding the effects on the practice on =
my mind, the old enemies (anger, envy,
etc) still rear their ugly heads, bu=
t I am more aware of them- and am now a bit
better at keeping them in contr=
ol. Still have plenty of work to do before they
are completely eliminated.<=
br>
<br>
I am happy that (by coincidence) the finishing date of the purasch=
arana happens
to be mid-Navaratri. I am planning to start an anushthana of =
the Navarna mantra
tomorrow. I plan to do japa of the Navarna mantra- three=
 malas a day- for just
over a year to complete 125,000 repetitions (suppose=
dly the minimum for any
anusthana). I plan to keep up the Ashtakshari mantr=
a too at 7 malas a day.<br>
<br>
I am now on a tridosha pacifying diet in t=
he hope that the migraines will improve.
I am also going to try to sleep ev=
en earlier (by 10 pm) in the hope that this
will enable me to wake up in br=
ahma muhurtha daily (luckily sunrise in the UK
is at 7 am at present!). <br=

<br>
A happy Navaratri to all of you.<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
