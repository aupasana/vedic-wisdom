Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under c=

his translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness=
, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalin=
i awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with grea=
ter force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then tak=
es care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens =
- IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to var=
ious other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature whi=
le some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the in=
dividual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=
r and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=
s even more
>> vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an=
 experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies o=
f psychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by wes=
t today is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also=
 possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from =
various subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, ca=
n get "ruptured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lif=
estyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside =
the mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these ar=
e very complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to li=
st down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done,=
 very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who c=
laim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess=
 work.

ople of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mi=
ne. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the c=
are of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of th=
eir kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences an=
d surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never h=
eard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explan=
ation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (al=
l tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Man=
y people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual cri=
sis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered intere=
st and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately the=
se patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no =
treatments for deranged
>> kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis =
try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed=
 my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants=
 to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is=
 so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot esca=
pe from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logica=
l one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to r=
elieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the st=
rength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray =
for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering=
 really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end =
up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the=
 safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave =
the kundalini

c-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome<BR>> >>>><BR>> >>>&=
gt;  <BR>> >>>>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of =
kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am=
 doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of s=
omeone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their
 kun=
dalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surge=
s of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of=
 kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. =
We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests=
 normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many peopl=
e we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or=
 unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and =
research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these pati=
ents are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatme=
nts for deranged<BR>> kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis tr=
y to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed m=
y feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants t=
o kill herself at times because the suffering from the deranged
 energy is =
so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escap=
e from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical=
 one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to re=
lieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the str=
ength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray f=
or her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering =
really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end u=
p in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the =
safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave t=
he kundalini<BR>> rising bit to God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparn=
