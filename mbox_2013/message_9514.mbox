Om Guruve Namah

Few decade ago, My wife did fasting for 4 weeks on Monday and on 5th week
there were 3 deaths in her family.

Ever since, she is scared of fasting on Mondays.

Is it good to link these two events ?

Is it possible for Gods to be angry for fasting ?

Please enlighten me.

Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
