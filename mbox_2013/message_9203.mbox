Hello Friends,

One more question in Sanskrit pronunciation :

i have noticed in some vedic recordings that people pronounce the ''half''
ga sound just like ga...

for example in Ganesh Atharvasheersham :
in my sanskrit text,

''sanhita sandhihi''...is pronounced ''sa-gum-hita sandhihi'' by many...as
it is written that way

the former seems correct...but in a sanskrit text is mentioned in place of
anuswaram as ''half'' ga

hope you all could understand what i am saying

sorry for my poor knowledge of sanskrit terminology..

i have heard priests saying ''half'' ga sound in many other places as
well...

thanks,
siddharth
