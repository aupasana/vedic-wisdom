=C2=A0In my most humble opinion, there is no universal better or lesser p=
ath of worship. It all depends on the soul doing it. Since the reality is I=
nfinite in nature, the number, manner and mechanism of approach is also equ=
ally vast and infinite. It all depends on that specific soul who is doing t=
he act of worship, be it dhyan, or chanting mantras or worship of idols. Ev=
en the very act of living life as we know can, for the right kind of soul, =
make it approach closer to the Reality without using any special mechanism,=
 like sitting and meditating or doing puja or chanting mantra. All depends =
on the soul. So best is to find out what works best for oneself. What may w=

Namaste,

Correct, if =
the mind involved is highly purified and has a good level of
shama and dama=
 (equanimity and self-restraint).

When we make offerings externally (e.g. =
to an idol), mind is distracted by
so many external things and unlikely to =
be fully focused on the act. When a
highly purified mind makes offerings in=
ternally, it is possible for it to be

That can indeed be more effective.

However, until one reaches such a stage=

unavoidable) to engage in external and mate=
rial offerings. A mind that is
unfocused and distracted needs some objects =
and actions to anchor it and
make it somewhat focused and disciplined.
