Sir=C2=A0

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Thanks for your response and the beau=
tiful explanation you have given of all the four paths of self realization.=
 Let me try to put all this into a perspective here.=C2=A0

Now my understa=
nding is that all these four different path lead to the same point or the e=
nd result and that is self realization. No matter what path or approach you=
 take the end result or the truth has to be the same. It cannot be two diff=
erent thing for two different people and in that case it is not the Truth. =
The path one adopts may be of hindu persuasion or some other religious pers=
uasion the end result has to be the same. Not only the end result one has t=
o come to a point where one has an insight or a perception that finishes th=
e ego or self directed activity.=C2=A0

Karma is a natural result of the fr=
eedom that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning without freed=
om to act. I do mistakes and create imbalance only when I have freedom to a=
ct and as such I have pay it back and restore balance in Nature. To have th=
e freedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect sense to =
me.=C2=A0

Now due to karmic overload it may become very hard for large num=
bers of people to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if Nature allows one=
 to be free of this attachment without a payback. Now there is a train of t=
hought which says that one can look into the whole nature of this attachmen=
t at one shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one thing after anot=
her look at this whole thing to the root , have a perception and get out of=
 it. In a sense our ancestors were intelligent that they devised some way t=
o clear this Karma but it seems like for large numbers of people these will=
 become crutches rather than help to get out of the karmic cycle and lead a=
n existence where one is free to act. If my previous karma is influencing m=
y action then I am not free.=C2=A0

Is it possible for someone to look into=
 this whole process of attachment and have an insight and be free of it rig=
ht now....

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
> Dont you think all these=
 yogas are NOT an end in itself but to prepare the mind for awakening??
=C2=
=A0
Correct. These paths get one started in the walk towards the same end p=
oint - Self-realization.

=C2=A0
> To be free is to be awakened.
=C2=A0
Not=
 exactly. Awakening is just a step towards freedom. Freedom comes in the en=
d after walking a path for enough time after awakening.
=C2=A0
An unawakene=
d sadhaka practicing jnana yoga reads books and talks eloquently about how =
everything is god, but looks at different people, objects and experiences w=
ith a different attitude. He becomes happy (if not externally, atleast inte=
rnally) when people praise him and becomes upset when people criticize him,=
 and so on. An awakened sadhaka practicing jnana yoga starts to honestly co=
ntemplate one's actions, words, thoughts (and even instincts finally) and s=
lowly weeds out conditioning that makes one look at different transient thi=
ngs differently. As his equanimity increases, still there will be episodes =
of getting carried away. As he employs contemplation and self-correction mo=
re and more, such episodes will become less and less frequent and one will =
become liberated in the end.
=C2=A0
An unawakened sadhaka practicing karma =
yoga passionately engages in dharmik actions for the benefit of others. He =
gets elated and feels proud when good results come and becomes upset when b=
ad results come. An awakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga starts to have d=
etachment to results. When something happens which makes him elated, proud,=
 ashamed or upset, he will not think much about it, take it as god's prasad=
 and think about what is the right action for him right now. As his detachm=
ent increases, still there will be episodes of getting carried away. As one=
 becomes more and more detached (to results of actions), such episodes will=
 become less and less frequent and one will become liberated in the end.
=
=C2=A0
An unawakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga goes through yama, niyama=
, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana etc. His psychic life force may even arise an=
d ascend. He may have various experiences and may feel proud or become atta=
ched to them. An awakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga will not not lose se=
lf-control in the face of anything and will keep the focus on samadhi. He w=
ill not be distracted by anything that comes on the way and keep perfecting=
 concentration and self-control so that samadhi (deep concentration on the =
unconditioned Self) comes. In the beginning, one may be in samadhi state no=
w and then. As practice is perfected, one can be in it all the time and bec=
ome liberated.
=C2=A0
An unawkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga is devote=
d to god and worships him/her as much as one can, but will project his ego,=
 conditioning and desires onto his worship and hence onto the god he worshi=
ps. For example, he may think "I worship the highest god while that person =
worships a lower god. I am better" or "I am worshipping god everyday. I wil=
l get so and so result" or "I worship god more than that person. I am bette=
r". An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga has little expectation, pride=
 etc. Worship becomes not about him but about god! He worships god and marv=
els at the power that holds this cosmos together - the power that runs thin=
gs infinitismally smaller than a boson and infinitely larger than a galaxy.=
 He will look at himself as a fully insignificant particle in front a supre=
me power. His desires, likes, dislikes, conditioning and agendas start to s=
eem too insignificant in front of contemplating about that supreme power. E=
ven as that
 devotional spirit increases, there will be episodes when one b=
ecomes self-centered in one's worship. But with practice, one loses oneself=
 completely and surrenders completely to the supreme power and become liber=
ated in the end.
=C2=A0
In each path, one may walk the path without making =
any significant progress for a long time. As one starts to imbibe the inher=
ent qualities of the path, some internal transformation will kick in. Yet, =
the force of prior conditioning, coming from many lives, is too strong to o=
vercome. One keeps walking..

>=C2=A0
>Here are my 2 cents.
>=C2=A0
>Jnana =
yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on wo=
rk and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. B=
hakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick wh=
atever is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom, =
detached action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually=
 exclusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, others will a=
utomatically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or=
 oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.
>=C2=A0
>Forget ab=
out horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I=
 strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna=
 advised
 against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic lif=
e force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadi=
s. In this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amou=
nts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my vie=
w, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one o=
f the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas=
 from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourag=
e even him to practice it.
>=C2=A0
>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a=
 distinct danger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. Peop=
le of this age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to de=
lude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn'=
t matter. It's all a delusion anyway" without fully overcoming all innate c=
onditioning that reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind
 o=
f like declaring wisely in a movie that "it's just a movie and not reality"=
, but flinching in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Withou=
t absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problemati=
c too. A long path of constant contemplation and self-correction can be red=

 than that person. I am better". An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga =
has little expectation, pride etc. Worship becomes not about him but about =
god! He worships god and marvels at the power that holds this cosmos togeth=
er - the power that runs things infinitismally smaller than a boson and inf=
initely larger than a galaxy. He will look at himself as a fully insignific=
ant
 particle in
 front a supreme power. His desires, likes, dislikes, cond=
itioning and agendas start to seem too insignificant in front of contemplat=

iple paths. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.<br> <br>I'll =
quote Swami Vivekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where he makes a comment =
on the 4 paths:<br> <br>"Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is =
to manifest this divinity
 within by controlling
 nature: external and inte=
rnal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or philosophy -=
 by one, or more, or all of these - and be free."<br> <br>Here are my =
2 cents.<br> <br>Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom.=
 Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self=
-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender=
 to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop tha=
t quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender to =
the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities develops =
nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a realized p=
erson (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualities fully b=
lossomed.<br> <br>Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatra=
msa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 9=
9% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controlling body and =
mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requires stric=
t yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and f=
ood, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be da=
ngerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught i=
n "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He di=
scouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to V=
ivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.<br> <br>Jna=
na yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the de=
lusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/s=
mart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman=
. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion anyway" w=
ithout fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in =
consciousness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a movie that=
 "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in every scary scene, c=
rying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earne=
stness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant contempl=
ation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the =
end.<br> <br>IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma =
yoga are the most suitable and safest.<br> <br>Best regards,<br>Narasi=
