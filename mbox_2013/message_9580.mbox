Namaste Bhupendra ji,

I pity the family and also the girl. Try calling rud=
raksha-ratna....they deal with severe voodoo/black magic cases and might be=
 able to help. Alternatively did you try homams? Long time back I had moved=
 to an apartment which was haunted. I cleansed it through rigorous prayers.=
 =C2=A0I literally chanted god's name 24/7. I also know of someone who has/=
is tackling extremely dangerous blackmagic through regular homams. The deta=
ils of her life will scare anyone. Today she has reduced the impact drastic=
ally just with homams. =C2=A0

=C2=A0http://www.rudraksha-ratna.com/=C2=A0
=


I will send out my prayers to the family.
Good luck and best regards,=C2=

Priya

Namaste Al=
l,
I am very interested in this email thread. I know of a family in Boston =
where one of the family members is posessed. I had asked for help in this f=
orum but did not get any response. If someone could provide some guidance, =
that would be great.
The situation is very bad and the family is virtually =
broke becuase of this spending on medical treatment because so far, no othe=
r help. In absence of any other solution,  this os being treated as medical=
 condition.
Thanks, 
Bhupendra

What about Kala Bhairava mantra? Can it be more effic=
