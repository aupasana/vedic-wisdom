When you say that you have Hindi version of the Saptashloki, are you doing =
ahoutis with the Sanskrit Shlokas (700) or doing something with the Hindi v=
erses? 

There are different strategies to maintain the Homam fire for leng=
thy Homams but there are not too many short cuts to the total Homam time if=
 you plan to do the entire Saptashati.  You can trim some of the earlier of=
ferings but the entire 13 chapters will take time - 700 Shlokas. 

There ar=
e several alternates such as doing Homam with Saptashloki only or doing Hom=
am with the 4 stutis in chapter 1,4,5, and 11, etc. in the beginning. 

It =
is better to practice oral recitation of the Saptashloki and once you can r=
ead the entire chapters in 60-90 mins (keeping pronunciation clear) then yo=
u have good chance to wrap the Homam in less time.
