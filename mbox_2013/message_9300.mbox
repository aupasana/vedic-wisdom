Dear Narasimha & Rajarshi,

There can be multiple meanings. I had come across the following article a few years ago. Rajarshi's thinking was on my mind for quite some time.

You mean the world of Rajarshi? ;-)>><br><br>True. But that is why I used a bit of the future continuous tense in my hopeful assertion:) I don't think the world at large will let go of the Dasavatara idea anytime soon, however the evolutionary link will keep gaining more ground. Already many seem to think that way. I was watching a TV program of a
 god-man
 speaking to massive gathering of his followers in an Indian city and he was actually explaining dasavatara with evolution.<br><br>Though this thought came to me independently, I am definitely not the first one, or
 hopefully the last one, who finds an evolutionary link in the story of the Dasavataras. Apparently, it was Sri Aurobindo who first wrote about this.<br><br>*   *     *<br><br><<To give a simplisitc analogy, some jewllery may be gold mixed with some 
amount of copper. If one jewllery is 100% pure gold, it does not mean it

four poornavataras mentioned by Parasara are 100% divine and do not 
contain jivamsa. It does not mean they contain "all the divinity" in 
cosmos.>><br><br>Very beautiful analogy! Makes sense.<br><div id="yiv1276886991yui_3_7_2_27_1368126251839_56"><span id="yiv1276886991yui_3_7_2_27_1368126251839_349"><br><br><<</span> If no form is "equal to" supreme being and every form is a "subset" of 
supreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of "swayam 
bhagavan"???>><br><br>Hmm.. the way *<span style="text-decoration:underline;">I look at it</span>*, the Supreme Being is truly Infinite in every sense, yet when it makes a descent into our plane of material life, it assumes a form, a personality and a  character. Now based on the need of THAT desh-kaal, it chooses its specific personality and form, which, to the average consciousness of that period seems like a fantastic achievement, pushing the limits of imagination to the extreme, for that period. And in this light, Krshna is Swayam Bhagawan. As if, if G-d were to come down in flesh and blood in fantastic potency for the age that we are living in - it must have been Krshna with his effortless and matchless display of the multiple skills, including such extreme Divine feats as showing his foster mother the whole universe contained inside his mouth, or making Rishi Markandeya experience the effects of Yogamaya when he saw this great deluge
 that ended the world and in the middle of those turbulent waters, a Divine Child was floating in a Banyana-leaf, sucking his own right toe. When the Child sucked Rishi Markandeya inside him through his breath, the Rishi perceived infinite number of universes and planetary systems within the body of the Child. <br><br>Recently I was reading a Tantric scripture. Tara Rahashyam. Among ShaktAs, it is a revered scripture. I found something interesting. While naturally this being a ShaktA text, the Divine Mother in Her various forms are eulogized as Supreme, it also mentions that in Kali, Krshna is Supreme. This explains why only Krshna among the various avatars of Vishnu is worshiped in those parts of India where Tantras were the predominant scriptures that were followed. Rama is considered as a part of Krshna. So along with Krshna nama, Rama nama japa is also done, though there is no exclusive mass worship of Rama in these parts. <br><br>India has so many
 flavors, that it is almost mind boggling.<br><br><br>*  *   *<br><br>On many subtle points, your mail was very thought provoking. And I am sure I will keep pondering over various hints for quite some time. But one point I want to make about Vedanta. I agree totally with you. <br><br>Vedanta is the philosophy, not only of Shankara Adwaitha, but also that of Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Chaitanya, Vallavacharya as well as the TantrAs. They are all Vedantas.<br><br>Quite simple put, there are two fundamental states of pure consciousness. Static, and dynamic. Purusha and Shakti. The static consciousness is same all around in everything, from the highest Avatara to the lowest stone. But the dynamic aspect of consciousness is NOT same in everything.<br><br>Ramakrishna used to say, Kali in present in everyone, but Her Shakti is not same in everyone! This crucial point lies in the heart of Tantric Vedanta philosophy. By the process of sadhana,
 this dynamic aspect of consciousness can be enhanced in an individual. This is the eternal purification of individual Chit-Shakti. The purer it is, the stronger it becomes. This also accommodates for the idea of vigyana. <br><br>That is why however much sadhana a person may do, he/she will never ever attain to the level of a Rama or a Krshna. Its practically impossible. The difference is in their levels of individualized chit-shakti. Or that of a Rishi. Their Chit-Shakit is so powerful, so pure, so free, that it can identify with the Universe and do things which are impossible to imagine. Which we cannot. Ever.<br><br><br>Once again, wishing everyone a fruitful and auspicious Akshaya Tritiya!<br><br>-Regards<br> Rajarshi<br><br><br></div><div id="yiv1276886991yui_3_7_2_27_1368126251839_549"><br id="yiv1276886991yui_3_7_2_27_1368126251839_58"></div><div id="yiv1276886991yui_3_7_2_27_1368126251839_60"><i

This is a really nice occasion for extra 
meditation or extra homam or extra contemplation or extra 
philosophization.<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br>> <span id="yiv1276886991yui_3_7_2_27_1368126251839_619">Now lets get into more subtle, precise analysis :)<br> <br></span>I asked for trouble, didn't I? :-)<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br>> this apparent conflict between what Rishi Parashara<br>> states and what this Purana states<br> <br>There may be some confusion regarding "poornavatara".<br> <br>As Parasara used it, the term "poornavatara" does NOT mean "the most complete or perfect avatara". It means a completely divine avatara with no jivamsa. There can be more than one poornavataras. They are not necessarily "equal".<br> <br>To give a simplisitc analogy, some jewllery may be gold mixed with some amount of
 copper. If one jewllery is 100% pure gold, it
 does not mean
 it contains all the gold in the
 world. It only means it has nothing other than gold. Similarly, the four poornavataras mentioned by Parasara are 100% divine and do not contain jivamsa. It does not mean they contain "all the divinity" in cosmos.<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br>In fact, the very notion that any one form can be "the most complete or perfect avatara" or "one that personifies entire divinity of Supreme Being" or "one equal to Supreme Being" is unacceptable and inconsistent with SB 1.3.30-31, which says that ANY form of Supreme Being is like a cloud in the sky, while Supreme Being is like the sky containing all possible clouds.<br> <br>Supreme Being is endowed with infinite qualities. Any form contains a finite number of those qualities. So no form can be "equal to" Supreme Being. SB 1.3.30-31 is clear in that regard.<br> <br>If one
 form is "equal to" supreme being and others are
 not, you can conclude that that form is "the best". If neither form is "equal to" supreme being, how can you really compare the different qualities of two forms?<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br>Anyway, this renders your (3) a meaningless issue. Whether that line refers to Krishna alone or not is irrelevant, for, in either case, "swayam bhagavan" cannot mean "a personification of the entirety of supreme being". Before you wonder whether it refers to Krishna alone or not, first figure out what "swayam bhagavan" actually means, in a way that is not inconsistent with verses that follow! If no form is "equal to" supreme being and every form is a "subset" of supreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of "swayam bhagavan"???<br> <br>*       
 *        *<br> <br>Regarding (4), Parasara
 identified 4 avataras as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, and identified the source of divinity in each of them. He only gave objective information and did not give any subjective judgment on who is the best, which Suta apparently did.<br> <br>I have not read BV Purana. If you can quote some verses before and after, I can comment. Any comparison between avataras WILL have to be under some subjective context. I don't know the context of Suta's statement you allude to.<br> <br>Though any comparison is subjective, I will be surprised if someone considers the other two poornavataras of Vishnu as the "best" avataras. But, I will not be surprised if different people consider Rama and Krishna as the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon are the luminaries and show soul and mind, which clearly have a primary significance compared to other aspects of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna are bound to be seen as the best by different people.
 However, what Suta
 apparently said can only be a subjective view under some context.<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br>Regarding (2): Kala means a part or a phase. Moon has 16 phases (representing 16 tithis, including Amavasya and Pournima), but Sun has only one phase - he is always full and bright!<br> <br>Just like Moon, mind has many moods, even a perfected one. A perfected mind goes through those moods with full awareness of underlying reality, whereas an imperfect mind experiences them under delusion. But it is the nature of Moon/mind to have variations. Sun/soul OTOH has no such variations.<br> <br>Krishna may show Vishwaroopa oneday, run away from battlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandha), do amazing miracles oneday and play clever tricks another day. There is a lot more variety to his personality than Rama's. Now, does that make him better or worse than Rama? Well, that
 is
 a *subjective* matter.<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br>Regarding (1): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is present in several beings such a planets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the world appearance in consciousness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So they stand for different qualities of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance. So Vishnu's avataras are associated with grahas. But Pararsara said that avataras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings (e.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre understanding what various deities stand for, what forces play a role in creating, sustaining and destroying the world appearance in consciousness. People talk too much about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there is hardly any understanding of Veda. When it comes to Puranic stories, we think in terms of
 superficial stories and not in terms of how it maps to what happens in consciousness.<br> <br>Mohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Maheshwari. Nara & Narayana were incarnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu + Shiva). I don't know about Dhanvantari and will pass for today. Dattatreya again was an incarnation of Shiva + Vishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incarnation of great serpent Adi Sesha (like Lakshmana).<br> <br>We need to go deeper into what they all stand for esoterically and what role they play in the functioning of consciousness, to understand this more. Hopefully another day..<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br>Adwaitins who are skeptical about notions taught by Parasara (paramatmamsa, jivatmamsa, different sources of paramtmamsa etc) should realize one thing. Though all is Brahman, all did not come from Brahman in one step. It all evolved in many
 steps
 and correspondingly there are some steps in the process of liberation!<br> <br>If a character in my dream tonight overcomes its conditioning in the dream, it will simply merge back into my mind and not into Brahman yet. Of course, it cannot do even that until I actually will it. It is after all a character created and sustained in my mind!<br> <br>Same thing applies to us!<br> <br>Vedanta is not wrong. But it is relevant and applicable at "anta", i.e. the end. Most of us may not yet be anywhere near "the end".<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br>BTW, I distinguished between Vishnu and 
Narayana above. If you study Narayana sooktam and Vishnu Sooktam, you 
can understand the difference. In Vaishnava traditions, they are 
considered one, but, strictly speaking, that is inaccurate. Of course, 
you can reach Narayana through Vishnu. But then, you can reach Narayana 
through Rudra or Bhairava as well!<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br>> I am afraid the world will keep getting more and more convinced that<br>> this specific list of dasavataras represent a parable of evoluion<br> <br>The *world*? You mean the world of Rajarshi? ;-)<br> <br>World accepts 10 avataras where Kalki will be the 10th (and not 9th as you suggested, to fit your notion of evolution). Even those who are uncomfortable with Buddha replace him with someone else rather than make it 9 avataras. World neither thinks much about this nor draws hasty conclusions. World really does not care about this..<br> <br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<br>--------<br>Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org <br>--------<br> <br><div id="yiv1276886991yui_3_7_2_37_1367796055441_335"><blockquote

All of them are mentioned as Avataras of the Supreme Being in SB.<br><br>2. What is your opinion about the general stated idea that only Krshna is 16 kala-poorna and others are not?<br><br>3. That the SB mentions Krshna as Swayam Bhagwan ONLY with respect to the previous sloka where it says that all rishis, munis etc are also Avataras, is one interpretation, and not too popular at that. OTOH, most of the great commentators, and they were no less in their
 spiritual merit
 or intellectual prowess have taken that specific verse to mean Krshna to be greater than ALL Avataras. The verse itself does not mention that it is with respect to the previous verse, or with respect to all the 17 verses that precede it, which lists all Avataras. So it boils down to interpretation based on individual conditioning. It seems Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, etc all shared a similar conditioning which made them read that verse to mean that only Krshna is Swayam Bhagwan. Would you agree to this conclusion? :) <br><br>4. </span><span id="yiv1276886991yui_3_7_2_27_1368126251839_387"><span>Apparently in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Suta tells the Rishis of Naimisharanya that Krshna is greatest Avatara of them all.</span> So, how do we resolve this apparent conflict between what Rishi Parashara states and what this Purana states?

Why are the *4th*, 7th and 8th avataras most popular if there is a nice "evolutionary" sequence among the 9???<br> <br>There is a very simple
 explanation, if one throws away the
 notion of "evolutionary" sequence. These are *poornavataras*,
 completely divine and
 devoid of jeevatmamsa, as per Parasara. In contrast, the 5th and 6th
 avataras did have some jeevatmamsa in them.<br> <br>*        *        *<br> <br><<I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9/10 Avataras.>><br> <br>First of all, dasavataras are not a "top 10" short-list of SB's list. SB list gives the avataras of Supreme Being ("Purusha" as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are specifically of Vishnu, who is the "sustaining principle" of Purusha. Dattatreya is an avatara of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and destructive principles of Purusha combined together. That is why he is not among Dasavataras. That does not make him any less or more. His purpose/functionality is simply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venkateswara. Just in terms of
 "popularity", he is actually more popular than
 some of the dasavataras.<br> <br>Secondly, rather than *comparing* avataras in terms like "less" or more in "spirituality", try to *understand* avataras from the point of view of what functionality and role they play in the functioning of collective cosmic consciousness. THAT is the key to understanding them and their place in cosmos.

It is difficult to miss the phonetic similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest known non-sanskrit
 translation of
 the Gita) - considered, (with
 differing
 nuances on the relation between
 jiva,
 paramatma, moksha etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some, like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as Narayana, as merely the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.</span></div>

Whenever an Avatar appears on the earth, most of the great Mahatmas who appear after the Avatara, remain overawed by the character of the last Avatara because invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those times, the life of the Avatara shows actions performed which are way beyond imagination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, of which we have very little written record, the world at large remained entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.</span></div>

But if logic is the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not agree to his philosophy as it comes down to us from his followers, but it cannot be denied that Adi Shankara was arguable one of the sharpest and most logical of spiritual philosphers. His intellectual and logical mind is beyond doubt. Just that Shankara never claimed himself to be an Avatara. Neither did Siddhartha. Only that the later came 3000 years ago, and the former came possibly in the last 1000 years. Shankara's spiritual impact on the world is no less than
 that of
 the Buddha. What
 mainstream Hinduism today is,
 could not have been, had it
 not been for
 the invaluable
 contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Buddha was truly the awaited 9th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not have been able to absorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus make it lose its grip on India. Buddhism barely exists in land of its birth.</div>

When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-service. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring, educative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to cross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he could have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow his army safe passage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocated, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean, THEN Rama took up weapons to get the job done. A powerful
 warrior, who
 knows very well how powerful
 he himself is, not letting that sense
 of power
 pervert his mind even
 for a moment is an amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comtemplation, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has some form of power or influence in this world in any sphere. Rama had no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He was the very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningness are impossible.</div>

I disagree with this vehemently. If one reads entire Krshna's life with an objective mind, Krshna of Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Gita, Krshna the Divine Worker himself followed it all through his life at every instance. It is his perfect detachment under all circumstances of life, from childhood to his death, that makes me wonder, was this
 a man or
 was this a
 God? Can a man even do something
 like this?
 It is as if there is a part of
 Krshna who is
 always separate
 from everything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He had not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wife abducted for him to start a war against Ravana. But Krshna had zero personal stake in the Mahabharata. After liberating his parents from Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a great war to cleanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed Rama all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as Balarama in his next incarnation he could hardly understand Krshna. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with all these kings, and that they should return to their village in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will understand everything. But that cannot stop him from following
 his dharma, with perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false praises, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I worship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of a single sadhaka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma who has displayed this kind of perfected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the world or actively performing a larger dharma.</div>

That was the last known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a circus-stoplight of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and on the other bitter enemies accusing him of being a heretic right upto the very end of his brief life, and yet none of that affected him to any great degree. He faced terrific racism in the America, yet not a single speech of his reflects the slightest trace of bitterness, anger, or negativity. That is such a fantastic achievement, IMHO.</div>

And then the Universal Chit-Shakti (Adya Shakti) will flood such an
 individual with
 oppulence unimaginable, of
 this world and
 also of what lies in other
 worlds, like
 Krshna's six
 oppulences - Infinite wealth, infinite beauty, infinite power/knowledge, infinite fame, and infinite detachment from all the other five. </div>
