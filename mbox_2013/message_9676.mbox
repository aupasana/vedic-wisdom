Namaste,

<<There is so much ambiguity with respect to the nature of this t=
ransformation and the timing...how do you expect anyone to take this seriou=
sly. >>

Absolutely. There is zero guarantee of when it will happen and how=
. But that is what exactly it is. By craving, demanding, crying or wishing,=
 it normally does not come.

What should be the motivation for it? I don't =
know. Generally there is no specific material motivation other than, possib=
ly if it can be called a motivation, one moves to a state of sthitapragya -=
 or stable-knowledge, where one can remain unaffected and abide in a strong=
 equanimity and spiritual light ,at least internally, inspite of things whi=
ch are apparently nice and those which are apparently not nice. In such a s=
tate one is not so much bothered about whether this species called humans m=
ust survive or not, but rather one remains in tune with the Cosmic Will. If=
 this species, speaking from an evolutionary viewpoint, is fit to carry on =
it will, else it must perish and Nature will evolve some other form(at) to =
act as a vehicle for the consciousness, which is what all lifeforms finally=
 are.

The Buddha did practice a lot of penance before he transformed into =
the Tathagata and if we are to believe his own words as it comes to us from=
 the Jataka tales, he had been born 500 times before he became the Buddha.
=

It is good to believe that we will transform right now, it is another matt=
er to actually be able to do so. Mostly, an instantaneous change never real=
ly happens. A few lifetimes is a fair measure of time for such a difficult =
task. Those who can transform now must have been trying so for a few lifeti=
mes.

The bottomline is that, there is just no shortcut for any genuine tra=
nsformation. There never was, there never will be. 
 
-Regards
 Rajarshi

=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I agree with your explanation of all four different=
 types of yoga and also bhakti yoga being the safest of all kinds. Dont you=
 think all these yogas are NOT an end in itself but to prepare the mind for=
 awakening?? The purpose behind all this should be to free oneself from kar=

matter what path you follow ultimately there should be a perception where o=

And there will be no karma when you are NOT bound to the action. Now does t=
