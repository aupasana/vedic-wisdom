This I agree. Go ahead, Sreya, there are no restrictions, particularly in B=
hakti Yoga !

  Unfortunately someone gave you wrong information. There are no negative e=
ffects of reciting a stotra. 
  KS is a strotra (or hymn) praising the divi=
ne mother. It is the simplest way of doing Sri Chakra puja.

  Namaste

  Can anyone let me kn=
ow that reading Sri Devi Khadgamala Stotra has any restrictions of age, sex=
 ( M/F)?

  I am reading it for couple of days and didn't had any differenc=
e as because in return I am not expecting any magic from the mother except =
her acceptance of my little prayer to her. But someone told me that I shoul=
d not read it as I am still young and married people should not read it as =
it has many beej mantras in it and reading it will gather me many doshas.

=
  Please let me the truth behind as I really like the Stotram and would lik=
e to continue it.

  Regards
  Shreya
