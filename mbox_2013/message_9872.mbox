Dear Ajit,

<<If the body and mind get dissolved upon death, then where doe=
s karma 
attach?>>

If the soul can recall, doesn't this soul now have some=
 sort of a body and/or mind? Instead of explicitly admitting a body (whethe=
r it is subtle or gross) that survives upon death, haven't you just created=
 an 
implicit body bound to your concept of a soul?>>

I am not sure that I=
 understood your question correctly. 


Karma "attaches" itself by setting =
certain preconditions/circumstances based on the desires of the soul and le=
ssons the egosense must learn for manifesting the soul. This process is tak=
en care of by Nature's laws. These two - desire and need - are slightly dif=
ferent. At the moment of death the soul has a specific ability to internali=
ze and project what it needs/wants to experience in the next birth. That ge=
ts set firmly. That counts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reaction =
process of actions performed is the need or the consequence to be faced in =
order that the egosense can learn to be more responsible in its actions.. A=
nd, here is the catch in the theory of Karma that I believe in, the reactio=
n process again is exact and divided into a reaction to the body or to the =
mind or to the life based on the instrument which was used to perform/engag=
e in a specific karma. Now since our ego-sense will identify with these to =
hold them together, so the
 egosense will experience the reaction. We mostl=
y live from our egosense. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much dee=
per. Now assuming suddenly that the individual in the next birth has a tota=
l spiritual transformation and is able to manifest the soul and live life f=
rom it, the reactions may not come or if they do may be highly reduced in n=
ature such as not to be of any real consequences. When the soul starts gove=
rning an individual instead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an in=
dividual becomes different from others. 


In another model of reality, it =
is the karana sharir will hold the seeds of the karma. which is never destr=
oyed. But the karana sharir is very different from the normal mind or life =
or body. It is more like a super subtle background process in all individua=
ls. To be able to reach consciousness the karana sharir, is a very very hig=
h spiritual achievement. Our karmas are mostly and almost always in the rea=
lm of body, life and mind. Karana is way beyond this. A typal repository of=
 various things. It is infact only when a person can experience the karana =
sharir that he/she can really enter into the realm of the Great Gods. They =
are Beings of this karana jagat, typal and fixed in essence, never changing=
, like the individual karana sharir. Now one can logically ask, so if the k=
arana sharir is recording karma, is it not getting fatter? This is a proble=
m of our logical mind which may not hold true in that realm. If=C2=A0 we ke=
ep adding jugs of water to the ocean,
 will it overflow? No. This is quite =
beyond the normal mind which is limited by its own regimented logic.


Each=
 of the sharir is not only an individual's own but is also effectively and =
fluidly connected to the whole world of that realm. So with the physical we=
 interact and live in the physical world, with the sukshma we interact and =
be a part of the sukshma jagat, same with the karan. Only difference being =
the depth, intensity and the nature of these three. The Karana is very fixe=
d and supremely subtle. Like a seed. While the sthula is the maximum change=
able of the three. Everything that is there in the sthula jagat is born out=
 of a seed from the karana. As such, nothing in the sthula can go beyond th=
e potentialities held by its most fundamental essence that lies in the Kara=
na. Hence great Yogis, those who can access this realm at will, can know th=
e most essential nature of a thing by experiencing what a thing is in its d=
eepest essence in this Karana jagat, and thus get to know all its possibili=
ties without ever trying to explore them in the physical realm
 or the subt=
le realm. Quite off limits for most of us.


Hope this helps.

-Regards

eign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For there are var=

>>>>>
>>>>>Upayas are many. As s=
o many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theore=

or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any=
 method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed th=
e individual and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has =
to find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to ente=
r into the person.
 Sometimes it can be
 something
 as simple as spitting s=
omewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their ter=
ritory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the =
mind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send t=
o cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no=

l depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those =
trying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover,=
 if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless th=
e person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to seriou=
s harm.
>>>>>
>>>>>These things like removing possession are specialization=

 do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know =
well how to
 handle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force be=
fore the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in=
 possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain whic=
h will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried t=
o remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.
>>>>>
>>>>>[Reminds me of a=
 particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism.=
 But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about=
 the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in po=
ssession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim.=
 Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the b=
ody of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Ne=
ver trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases wher=
e the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]
>>>>>
>=
>>>>Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with=
 spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not =
possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferab=
ly Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms=
 are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and t=

ons/circumstances based on the desires of the soul and lessons the egosense=
 must learn for manifesting the soul. This process is taken care of by Natu=
re's
 laws. These two - desire and need - are slightly different. At the mo=
ment of death the soul has a specific ability to internalize and project wh=
at it needs/wants to experience in the next birth. That gets set firmly. Th=
at counts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reaction process of action=
s performed is the need or the consequence to be faced in order that the eg=
osense can learn to be more responsible in its actions.. And, here is the c=
atch in the theory of Karma that I believe in, the reaction process again i=
s exact and divided into a reaction to the body or to the mind or to the li=
fe based on the instrument which was used to perform/engage in a specific k=
arma. Now since our ego-sense will identify with these to hold them togethe=
r, so the egosense will experience the reaction. We mostly live from our eg=
osense. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much deeper. Now assuming =
suddenly that the individual in the next birth has a total spiritual
 trans=
formation and is able to manifest the soul and live life from it, the react=
ions may not come or if they do may be highly reduced in nature such as not=
 to be of any real consequences. When the soul starts governing an individu=
al instead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an individual becomes =
different from others. <br></div><div style=3D"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-si=

 background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;">In another model of re=
ality, it is the karana sharir will hold the seeds of the karma. which is n=
ever destroyed. But the karana sharir is very different from the normal min=
d or life or body. It is more like a super subtle background process in all=
 individuals. To be able to reach consciousness the karana sharir,
 is a ve=
ry very high spiritual achievement. Our karmas are mostly and almost always=
 in the realm of body, life and mind. Karana is way beyond this. A typal re=
pository of various things. It is infact only when a person can experience =
the karana sharir that he/she can really enter into the realm of the Great =
Gods. They are Beings of this karana jagat, typal and fixed in essence, nev=
er changing, like the individual karana sharir. Now one can logically ask, =
so if the karana sharir is recording karma, is it not getting fatter? This =
is a problem of our logical mind which may not hold true in that realm. If&=
nbsp; we keep adding jugs of water to the ocean, will it overflow? No. This=
 is quite beyond the normal mind which is limited by its own regimented log=
ic.<br></div><div style=3D"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-famil=

transparent; font-style: normal;">Each of the sharir is not only an individ=
ual's own but is also effectively and fluidly connected to the whole world =
of that realm. So with the physical we interact and live in the physical wo=
rld, with the sukshma we interact and be a part of the sukshma jagat, same =
with the karan. Only difference being the depth, intensity and the nature o=
f these three. The Karana is very fixed and supremely subtle. Like a seed. =
While the sthula is the maximum changeable of the three. Everything that is=
 there in the sthula jagat is born out of a seed from the karana. As such, =
nothing in the sthula can go beyond the potentialities held by its most fun=
damental essence that lies in the Karana. Hence great Yogis, those who can =
access this realm at will, can know the most essential nature of a thing by=
 experiencing what a thing is in its deepest essence in
 this Karana jagat,=
 and thus get to know all its possibilities without ever trying to explore =
them in the physical realm or the subtle realm. Quite off limits for most o=
f us.<br></div><div style=3D"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-fam=

yone,</span></div><div><span></span> </div><div><span>I just thought o=
f adding some clarifications.</span></div>

<div><span></span> </div><=
div><span>First of all, when I mentioned about the utility of techniques of=
 "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression" for handling the problem of spir=
it attachments as well as many other problems for which we do not have reas=
onable explanation, my assertions were limited to
 the utility part only an=
d not beyond that. I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or no=
t, in fact I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I beli=
eve, any knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is h=
alf knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in =
our this empirical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of=
 the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that=
 the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, =
still we use sentences like "Sun rises in the east", "Sun sets&nb=
sp;in the west" etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with activit=
ies which helps in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I'd mentio=
ned about "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression".</span></div>

<div><sp=
an></span> </div><div><span>One should not comment about the wealth in=
side a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibil=
ities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just can not say that the u=
niverse can behave in any particular limited ways. Before anyone comments a=
bout the utility of any branch of knowledge one must first take a sinc=
ere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if one =
really takes a sincere dip into any subject one would definitely be convinc=
ed about the same. By saying that one shouldn't make comments before t=
aking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that by doing so one would pre=
vent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only blind belief in rel=
igion and religious practices can be termed as dogmatic but also in
 s=
cience if one loses the scientific temper.</span></div><div><span></span>&n=
bsp;</div><div><span>Proof of pudding is in eating it, all that I can say t=
o the persons willing to address any of their problems. "Hypnotherapy" and =
"Past Life Regression" have immense utility for those who are desirous=
 of addressing their problems with an open mind. Those who are interested c=
an read " Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss" to start with.</span></d=
iv>

<div><span></span> </div><div><span>To respected Narasimha sir, I=
 would like to inform that these are not "new age ideas". These were there =
much before in India.
 to cite concept of "Jaati Smaran" of Jainism is one =
among them. Jainas used this technique of "Jaati Smaran" to reinforce renun=
ciation in the
 followers.</span></div><div><span></span> </div><div><=
span>To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that so far as my knowled=
ge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over phone, but however,=
 there are so many problems which can be handled even over phone. To cite o=
ne example - One girl was having one recurrent bad horrifying dream fo=
r past 4/5 years and she approached me for the treatment. But due=
 to my official engagements I was camping at a far off place for aroun=
d 2 months. Her problem was getting worsened as it had  star=
ted affecting her professional career adversely. So having left with no cho=
ice, I agreed to give her a session over phone. The phone session continued=
 for around one and half an hour and she got relieved from her that recurre=
nt dream
 and also started improving her
 professional life. Since that day=
 the dream has not yet visited her again.</span></div><div><span></span>&nb=
sp;</div><div><span>It all depends on the openness of the mind, the strengt=
h of the desire to overcome etc. The universe is much more than what we see=
,what we can see and what we can believe to see.</span></div>
