Namaste Frineds,

I was a mute listener to this group for years now. I am r=
eally delighted to
read and feel blessed.

I have two things to say here:

=
1) I have read somewhere that, Lord Sri Rama was born seven thousands year
=
ago (January 10, 5114 BC) and Sri Krishna was born around 5 thousands year
=
ago (on July 21, 3228 BC). I know only these two names where we have
succes=
sfully (at least - upto certain level) related the good and bad
karmas (kno=
wn to us) or life events and corresponding planetary positions
(modern worl=
d term would be : reverse engg). I am more curious to know, if
there would =
be any one coming to earth who will be having all the possible
positive ene=
rgies AND will not have anything in negative (in vedic term I
think we can =
say Supreme Lord). I hope we would be able to draw something
with the astro=
logical tools we have now, the best possible horoscope, which
will have the=
 planets placed at their best and further finding out that
possible date fo=
r the planetary position through the planetarium tools we
have. I think tha=
t can support the date we have for the actual SAT YUG, it
will support our =
vedic calculations of YUG's timings.(let it be thousand
and thousands of ye=
ars from now).

2) I was following this group from last 5/6 years, but not =
able to speak up
- though I had the above mentioned thought. it happens a l=
ot to me, may be
due to my Lagnesh mercury is in 6th house, i find bit diff=
icult to convey
my thoughts. However when it comes and I convey the thought=
s, it becomes
argument - may be due to my second house has Rahu there. Plea=
se do not take
this (point 1) as argument (and forgive and redirect me - if=
 this was
already covered somewhere else).
