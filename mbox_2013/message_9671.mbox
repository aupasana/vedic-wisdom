Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
Your point 3 captures what I often refer to as the trap=
 of pseudo-wisdom.
=C2=A0
<<Let me tell you that the
very idea of consideri=
ng that divinity to be eclipsed is ignorance; and
consequently trying to ma=
ke an effort to remove that eclipse, is a greater
ignorance. Any act done u=
nder ignorance will yield only further bondage and
eclipse, and trap the so=
ul into the chakravyuha(tornado) of the maaya.>>
=C2=A0
You claim that ther=
e is no "eclipse" or covering or bondage in the first place (because it is =
"ignorance" and not real) and yet speak of "further bondage and eclipse"! H=
ow can something that doesn't even exist, increase or decrease?
=C2=A0
It E=
ITHER does not exist at all OR exists and keeps increasing/decreasing. You =
can't have it both ways! :-)
=C2=A0
Now let us examine these 2 cases separa=
tely.
=C2=A0
Case 1: Eclipse/bondage does not even exist. So it does not in=
crease/decrease. There is nothing to discuss! :-)
=C2=A0
Case 2: Eclipse/bo=
ndage exists and some acts increase it and some decrease it. It is not mere=
ly efforts to "overcome" this eclipse/bondage that may increase it. So many=
 other acts could increase it. Some people may have engaged in too many suc=
h activities and accumulated so much eclipse/bondage/covering of the innate=
 divinity that it may actually need a lot of effort to undo it!
=C2=A0
*=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
It is very easy to claim that all is god and that even c=
onsidering that there is some covering is an ignorance.
=C2=A0
Though every=
thing is Self, Self is that which is unborn and un-perishing. We are surrou=
nded by many manifestations of Self that are transient, i.e. they are born =
and they perish. When we come in contact with them, we do not focus on thei=
r imperishable essence, but focus on the transient/perishable portion that =
is more readily perceptible to our senses, manas, buddhi and chitta.
=C2=A0=

This perishable/transient portion is what we mean by covering/eclipse.
=C2=
=A0
Suppose one's leg is cut off, blood starts to gush out and one is about=
 to die in a little time. Can one remain equanimous during that time and ge=
nuinely think "this body and the blood I perceive are transient. They are a=
ctually manifestations of imperishable Self. I do not care about transient =
manifestations. I only care about the imperishable Self. I am Self"?
=C2=A0=

This is just one example. Depending on the person, many such examples can =
be given, where pretensions of "I am Self" can be shattered and one will be=
g "forget about Self. I am in deep trouble. Somebody please help me out of =
this situation"!
=C2=A0
If one is established in Self and NO situation ever=
 disturbs one's equanimity, only then one is realized. Such a state is not =
easy to achieve as some pseudo-Vedantins may suggest.
=C2=A0
As I said belo=
w, this is just a case of "a long path of
constant contemplation and self-c=
orrection can be reduced to a quick delusional
jump to the end". Unless one=
 catches it whenever something transient and perishable is drawing one's at=
tention, one will not overcome each such instinct. Until each such instinct=
 is overcome, "all is imperishable Self" is just a theory one is repeating =
like a parrot. The covering/eclipse/bondage is quite real until then.
=C2=
=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Unfortunately, some assertions of Jnana Yoga an=
d Adwaita Vedanta can be misleading. I will try to explain it with a nice a=
nalogy from physics.
=C2=A0
This world is made up of different objects. The=
y are made up of molecules with a lot of vacuum in between them. Molecules =
are made up of atoms and a lot of vacuum in between them. Atoms are made up=
 of electrons, protons etc and a lot of vacuum in between them. Even those =
particles are made up of smaller particles and a lot of vacuum in between t=
hem. As you keep dividing, you will see that things are made up of subtle p=
ortions of matter and a lot of vacuum. When you go to the level of small pa=
rticles, work by physicists such as Heisenberg, Broglie, Schroedinger etc s=
ays that you can't even observe and determine the properties of those parti=
cles confidently without affecting them. They may not even exist as "matter=
" with specific location and momentum or even as waves, independent of the =
observer.
=C2=A0
However, despite that "quantum mechanics" reality at the s=
ubtlest level, we have normal "mechanics" too. A lot of gross objects made =
up of=C2=A0 those subtle particles are gross enough and obey some grosser l=
aws of physics (e.g. Newton's laws). We can find their positions, momentum =
etc accurately and make them move deterministically.
=C2=A0
When one is des=
igning a car or a pulley system or a rocket, one can leave quantum mechanic=
s and use normal mechanics. However, when one is doing research on bosons e=
tc, one must pay attention to quantum mechanics. Otherwise, one will commit=
 errors.
=C2=A0
Similarly, at the subtlest level, Self alone exists. Things=
 that seem to exist may not even exist independent of the observer. However=
, there are also the laws of karma that govern the grosser reality (body, h=
ealth, job, spouse, children, house, car, money etc). Rishis taught Adwaita=
 Vedanta and also the laws that govern the world of duality (e.g. the law o=
f karma).
=C2=A0
When one's awareness focuses on gross objects and one is w=
orking with the gross world, one better leave "quantum spirituality" (Adwai=
ta Vedanta) and focus on normal spirituality. However, when one's awareness=
 becomes very subtle and one starts to deal with mystical experiences, deit=
ies etc, one must pay attention to Adwaita Vedanta. Otherwise, one will com=
mit errors!!
=C2=A0

Narasimha

>1.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I deeply appreciate and feel grateful for having shared =
your
understandings. I would kindly request you to permit me to share my un=

which stand in definite contrast with that of yours. I would a=

noble self to allow me to point out a number of flaws, whi=

bestowed on debating scholars. Of course, we don=

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 First of all you quoted Swami Vivekananda=
 as a stamping

truth/clarity does not need any support, because it stands itself a=

for all.(In Hindi, =E2=80=9Csatya ko pramaan ki aavashyakta nah=

>=C2=A0
>3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Secondly, if what you have
quoted from Swami Vivekana=
nda is true, then I am skeptical about Swami Vivekananda=E2=80=99s
understa=
ndings himself. Let me tell you that divinity of soul is ever-existing
like=
 Sun (Sadaa Jaagati Jyoti)(ever shining light). So do you need any effort
t=
o manifest it? Do you mean to say that the ever-shining Brahman is at the
m=
ercy of our efforts to get itself manifested? Perhaps..But let us ponder wh=
at
actually caused that sunlight to be eclipsed? Let me tell you that the
v=
ery idea of considering that divinity to be eclipsed is ignorance; and
cons=
equently trying to make an effort to remove that eclipse, is a greater
igno=
rance. Any act done under ignorance will yield only further bondage and
ecl=
ipse, and trap the soul into the chakravyuha(tornado) of the maaya.
>=C2=A0=

>4.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 The key idea here is that when we =
start with an assumption which
itself is faulty, then our whole calculation=
 based on that assumption goes
faulty. So there is no point in proceeding f=
urther beyond this, or else
it=C2=A0 is just a waste of time, without true/=
clarity of vision dawning on us.
>=C2=A0

=C2=A0 I would humbly request your noble self to view it as a healthy

circumbulatory. This will be in the general interest and welfare of all=
 the earnest
seekers.

>=C2=A0

>=C2=A0
>I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from his b=
ook "Raja Yoga" where he makes
a comment on the 4 paths:
>=C2=A0
>"Each sou=
l is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity
within by co=
ntrolling nature: external and internal. Do this either by work or
worship =
or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these -
and =
be free."
>=C2=A0
>Here are my 2 cents.
>=C2=A0
>Jnana yoga emphasizes on p=
hilosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on
work and detachment. R=
aja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery.
Bhakti yoga emphasize=
s on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever
is natural to=
 one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached
action, sel=
f-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive.
As one o=
f these qualities develops nicely in one, others will automatically
develop=
 too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or
oneness) will have =
all these qualities fully blossomed.
>=C2=A0
>Forget about horoscope, navam=
sa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of
that, I strongly recommend =
against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna
advised against it.=
 Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic life
force to purify and=
 ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In
this age of pol=
luted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of
obstructions a=
nd Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what
Ramakrish=
na explicitly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the
greatest spirit=
ual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from
pursuing Raja Y=
oga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him
to practic=
e it.
>=C2=A0
>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of f=
alling into the
delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are no=
t
sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Bra=
hman.
I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a =
delusion
anyway" without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that rein=
forces
duality in consciousness every instant. Kind of like declaring wisel=
y in a
movie that "it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in
eve=
ry scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty,
si=
ncerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of
=
constant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusi=
onal
jump to the end.

 focus on the transient/perishable portion that is more readily perceptible=
 to our senses, manas, buddhi and chitta.<br> <br>This perishable/tran=

 cut off, blood starts to gush out and one is about to die in a l=

"this body and the blood I perceive are transient. They are actually manife=
stations of imperishable Self. I do not care about transient manifestations=
. I only care about the imperishable Self. I am Self"?<br> <br>This is=
 just one example. Depending on the person, many such examples can be given=
, where pretensions of "I am Self" can be shattered and one will beg "forge=
t about Self. I am in deep trouble. Somebody please help me out of this sit=
uation"!<br> <br>If one is established in Self and NO situation ever d=

p; *<br> <br>Unfortunately, some assertions of Jnana Yoga and Adwaita =
Vedanta can be misleading. I will try to explain it with a nice analogy fro=
m physics.<br> <br>This world is made up of different objects. They ar=
e made up of molecules with a lot of vacuum in between them. Molecules are =
made up of atoms and a lot of vacuum in between them. Atoms are made up of =
electrons, protons etc and a lot of vacuum in between them. Even those part=
icles are made up of smaller particles and a lot of vacuum in between them.=
 As you keep
 dividing, you will see that things are made up of subtle port=
ions of matter and a lot of vacuum. When you go to the level of small parti=
cles, work by physicists such as Heisenberg, Broglie, Schroedinger etc says=
 that you can't even observe and determine the properties of those particle=
s confidently without affecting them. They may not even exist as "matter" w=
ith specific location and momentum or even as waves, independent of the obs=
erver.<br> <br>However, despite that "quantum mechanics" reality at th=
e subtlest level, we have normal "mechanics" too. A lot of gross objects ma=
de up of  those subtle particles are gross enough and obey some grosse=
r laws of physics (e.g. Newton's laws). We can find their positions, moment=
um etc accurately and make them move deterministically.<br> <br>When o=
ne is designing a car or a pulley system or a rocket, one can leave quantum=
 mechanics and use normal mechanics. However, when one is doing research on=

 bosons etc, one must pay attention to quantum mechanics. Otherwise, one w=
ill commit errors.<br> <br>Similarly, at the subtlest level, Self alon=
e exists. Things that seem to exist may not even exist independent of the o=
bserver. However, there are also the laws of karma that govern the grosser =
reality (body, health, job, spouse, children, house, car, money etc). Rishi=
s taught Adwaita Vedanta and also the laws that govern the world of duality=
 (e.g. the law of karma).<br> <br>When one's awareness focuses on gros=
s objects and one is working with the gross world, one better leave "quantu=
m spirituality" (Adwaita Vedanta) and focus on normal spirituality. However=
, when one's awareness becomes very subtle and one starts to deal with myst=
ical experiences, deities etc, one must pay attention to Adwaita Vedanta. O=
therwise, one will commit errors!!<br> <br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<=

friends,<br>
 <br>
I am cc'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup becau=
se of the spiritual content.<br>
 <br>
I agree with Vishnu ji's commen=
t on a specific point in Maja ji's nice
write-up:<br>
 <br>
> > =
*Also, one is supposed to choose only one ayana for one lifetime and<br>
&g=
t; > master it to as perfect as possible. *<br>

 <=
br>
Indeed, one can carve one's own niche by combining multiple paths. They=
 are not
meant to be mutually exclusive.<br>
 <br>
I'll quote Swami Vi=
vekananda from his book "Raja Yoga" where he makes
a comment on the 4 paths=
:<br>
 <br>
"Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest =
this divinity
within by controlling nature: external and internal. Do this =
either by work or
worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or mo=
re, or all of these -
and be free."<br>
 <br>
Here are my 2 cents.<br>=

 <br>
Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yog=
a emphasizes on
work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control a=
nd self-mastery.
Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Suprem=
e. One can pick whatever
is natural to one and try to develop that quality.=
 However, wisdom, detached
action, self-control and surrender to the Suprem=
e are not mutually exclusive.
As one of these qualities develops nicely in =
one, others will automatically
develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e=
. one in "Yoga" or
oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.<=
br>
 <br>
Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc.=
 Irrespective of
that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of hu=
manity. Even Ramakrishna
advised against it. Controlling body and mind and =
forcing the psychic life
force to purify and ascend requires strict yama an=
d niyama and clean nadis. In
this age of polluted air, water and food, nadi=
s accumulate great amounts of
obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. =
This is not just my view, but what
Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel=
 of Ramakrishna" (one of the
greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged=
 several of his sishyas from
pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekanand=
a, but did not encourage even him
to practice it.<br>
 <br>
Jnana yoga=
 is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the
delusiona=
l trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not
sincere/honest/smart en=
ough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman.
I am Brahman. Whate=
ver I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion
anyway" without =
fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces
duality in conscio=
usness every instant. Kind of like declaring wisely in a
movie that "it's j=
ust a movie and not reality", but flinching in
every scary scene, crying in=
 every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty,
sincerely and earnestness, =
jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of
constant contemplation an=
d self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional
jump to the end.<br>=

 <br>
IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga a=
re the most
suitable and safest.<br>
 <br>
Best regards,<br>
Narasimha=
