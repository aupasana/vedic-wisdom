This is an important issue to be aware of by any aspirant. As informed by s=
isters Aparna and Leela Sastry, I also know one case, where a lady from Che=
nnai experienced adverse effects of such exercises called as Pranayama and =
 Yoga in various centers. She failed to get sleep inspire of heavy doses of=
 sedatives. I contacted her, only from this Vedic - Wisdom group long back,=
 and  tried to counsel her for remedial measures. With many household respo=
nsibilities, her life became horrible, with out sleep,and with heavy medica=
tion sleeping at the early hours after late night and failing to discharge =
her duties in the morning to her husband and school going children.

The po=
int is not to criticizes any school of Yoga. If a Master trains his discipl=
es in any yogic phenomena, he should take responsibility to also show remed=
ial measures. It is so happening that, out of enthusiasm ,many are suggesti=
ng many methods of Pranayama. Yoga,herbal remedies or Mantras with out full=
-pledged expertise in it.
 So aspirants please be aware to practice anythin=
g only from a Master, and not middle knowledged persons. If any adverse rea=
ction occures, a Master should be able to rectify and save the followers. 
=

Beware of the adverse effects of everything medicines,healing procedures,n=
atural alternative medicines, massages, teachings called yoga. Best thing a=
s suggested by the two sisters is Dedication, Submission, Selflessness , ch=
arity, more applications giving and not in receiving from others. Love and =
help all through life. One should realize the Narayana in all and serve the=
m heart fully. Do not go on acquiring,but keep offering. Be streamlines I d=
aily routine, to get a rhythm. Do not forget the SUN GOD who is appearing e=
veryday. All energy is received fromSun. 

If we just follow some of such p=
rinciples, there will be a chemistry happening  in the body resulting in tr=
ansformation and transmutation of  cells.

Let us pray everyday before goin=
g to bed for 10 min to ask for healing to all suffering ones. Whenever you =
come into contact anyone through out the day, immediately note down the nam=
e, age, suffering of the person in a diary immediately. Everyday at bed tim=
e pray for all such persons you have noted. Continue for each sufferer pray=
er for three consecutive days in the night and delete the name. Like this o=
ne can help many sufferers to get healing.

With love and best wishes
