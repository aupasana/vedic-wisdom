Each of us came into the world, with our present body, with a baggage of
various mental tendencies (many of which are "negative"). Then, from
childhood until the present time, we added to that baggage.

So, we want to do two things -- (i) make sure that we aren't adding to the
existing mountain of previous karma, and (ii) slowly burn off the mountain
of karma.

If you are not adding to the existing mountain day-by-day, and you have the
same mental focus, you may get the same results by doing the japa over a
longer time span. However, if you are not even able to burn off the current
day's baggage through sadhana, doing a small amount of japa over a long
period of time may not help.

You definitely have the right spirit ... modify the sadhana to be practical
for you, and do the best that you can. However, we have to be careful not
to be complacent. Our life spans are short, and we are all experts at
accumulating new karmas at alarming rates.

As a result of intense sadhanas over shorter time spans, we might be able
to stop the day-by-day accumulation of karmas that we normally engage in.
That is when the sadhana has a chance to be effective.

sasneham,

    ajit
