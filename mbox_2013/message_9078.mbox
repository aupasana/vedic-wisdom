Namaskaar,

But then how do we change what's fundame=
ntally in this pool? How will one's prayer of "Destroy my dushkarma" to the=
ir beloved deity manifest? Does it manifest by reducing one's propensity to=
 dushta karma from that moment on, or does it manifest by actually removing=
 dushta karma from the existing pool? If there was no way to remove dushta =
karma from the existing karma pool (as you seem to indicate below), then wh=
at's the meaning of Prayashchita?

Please comment.
