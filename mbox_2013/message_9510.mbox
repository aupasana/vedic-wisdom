Thanks so much Mr. Rao.

These facts are really worthy for understanding =
the importance of meditation and serenity in life through which one can att=
ain self knowledge, self observance or even attain Siddhis. This is a maste=
rpiece information given by you to the seekers of spirituality. I really ap=
preciate the way you explain and share our ancient divine knowledge regardi=
ng Vedas & mantras in the most simplified manner which a man of today's tim=
e can understand and believe.

Regards,
Saurabh Kaushik

=
=C2=A0 
Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
You may find some people who have an unbeli=
evably uncanny intuition. They may sometimes seem to "read your mind" and a=
ddress what you are thinking, without you saying anything. Some of you may =
even develop such an ability in future. Even if intuition is not good in ge=
neral, it may become very good with certain people or certain matters.
=C2=
=A0
I want to say a few words about such phenomena and say a few words of c=
aution.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Some people are more "aware" in their =
intuition, while some people are not so aware and simply resonate to others=
' thoughts without awareness.
=C2=A0
As an example, someone I know does hom=
am everyday and is a regular and rational person without an imaginative/int=
uitive mind that gets visions, dreams etc.
=C2=A0
Though his sadhana was sa=
attwik (even his visualization of fierce deities was in Upanishadic terms),=
 oneday he felt a strong urge to mix blood in rice and offer it in homam. I=
t did not seem natural to him and so he did not act on that instinct though=
 it re-appeared in his mind several times that
 day. He ignored it as an un=
natural thought for him.
=C2=A0
A couple of days later, he received a mail =
from someone close to him but living 1000s of miles away. This person happe=
ned to go to a smashan that weekend night for meditation and saw some Tantr=
iks doing a
 "Rakta Chamunda" homam. They were offering ingredients dipped =
in their blood in homam. He just sat there and observed them. He later sent=
 a mail about it.
=C2=A0
When the original person received the mail, he rea=
lized why he had that thought a couple of days back. His mind was simply re=
sonating to the thoughts of the other person, without a complete awareness.=
 In fact, such a thing happened to him several times with the same person.
=
=C2=A0
There were also many occasions when he would randomly talk about som=
e topic and one specific person in the room would claim that that person wa=
s thinking about exactly that topic. Again, the question in the mind of tha=
t person resonated in the other mind and the person started talking about i=
t.

=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
First, how does this work? Simple - reson=
ance between minds.
=C2=A0
Suppose you are talking loud. You may not hear w=
hat others around you are saying. Similarly, if your mind is vibrating with=
 too many thoughts, it may not resonate to the vibrations in other minds ar=
ound it.
=C2=A0
But, if you are relatively calm, you can hear what others a=
re saying. Similarly, if your mind is relatively calm, it may pick up vibra=
tions in other minds around it (or even 1000s of miles away if there is som=
e attachment/connection) and resonate to those vibrations!
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Second, how to know where the thought is coming from?
=C2=
=A0
When an infant listens to tens of voices, he simply hears different sou=
nds and does not know from which face each sound is coming from. Over time,=
 after many observations and correlations, brain learns to discern from whi=
ch face each sound is coming from. Later, one may
 recognize a voice even w=
hen the face is behind a curtain or otherwise invisible!
=C2=A0
Similarly, =
if one so wishes, one can develop the ability to discern the source of each=
 thought that vibrates the mind, after much observation and correlation. Th=
e mind can of course be trained. However, a seeker of self-realization need=
 not actively pursue such an ability, for it serves no useful purpose in Se=
lf-realization.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The ability to 
calm the vibr=
ations in the mind due to conditioning and then the ability to calm any vib=
rations due to resonance is more important than the 
ability to discern the=
 source of vibrations.
=C2=A0
Whether a thought that vibrates one's mind ri=
ght now is coming from one's own conditioning or sensory observation or som=
eone else's, is not the crux. The crux is knowing whether one should perfor=
m any physical/mental *action* based on thought, to fulfill one's swa-dharm=
a, or just observe the thought and leave it (move on). A true seeker's focu=
s will be on that ability, i.e. developing clarity regarding one's own dhar=
ma, than figuring out the source of each thought. The latter can be a distr=
action or even an ego trap.
=C2=A0
Nevertheless, Nature may sometimes give =
one abilities that one does not actively pursue or need (perhaps because on=
e desired it long back). A true seeker neither tries for nor resists what i=
s not needed by one. One does not dwell on it in either case and moves on.
=
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
One may argue that certain special abilities=
 can help one pay off karmik debts on one's way to liberation. However, one=
 can (must) trust Nature to arrange for circumstances to pay off one's debt=
s. The key is to be aware of what one can give others in any given circumst=
ance and give it without holding back. If one gets used to giving without e=
xpecting any payback, Nature will automatically arrange for all of one's de=
bts to be paid off. No special abilities are needed.
=C2=A0
Of course, when=
 there is a clash between giving thing X to person A vs giving
 thing Y to =
person B, one needs to use one's discretion. That is where our conditioning=
 may block us from the right call. As we know our dharma better and get a s=
ense of which of our dharmas are higher, we may start to make the right cal=
ls.
=C2=A0
The bottomline: Try to know your dharma (declared by the spark o=
f divinity in heart). Try to follow it to the best of ability. Give whateve=
r you can give others, without expecting any payback. Ignore thoughts arisi=
ng in mind, which do not contribute to fulfillment of your dharma, no matte=
r what the source of that thought may be.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Bef=
ore I sign off, a
 couple of words on Rakta Chamunda from the story above.
=
=C2=A0
The verb cham means to 
drink/eat/consume. The verb mund means to sh=
ave or deplete. Chamunda 
means one who drinks and finishes. Rakta means co=
nditioning or coloring 
(the words rakti (attachment) and virakti (detachme=
nt) come from the 
same root). Rakta Chamunda is the one who drinks and emp=
ties all 
conditioning that causes desires. Offering blood is an approximat=
ion. Also, ironic that some people worship Rakta Chamunda for vashikaran..
=
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

First, how does this work? Simple - resonance between minds.<br> <br>S=

ot resonate to the vibrations in other minds around it.<br> </span><br=

 you can hear what others are saying. Similarly, if your mind is relatively=
