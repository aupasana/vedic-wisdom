=C2=A0 
Namaste Durgesh,
=
=C2=A0
There is no single answer. We are always pulled in different directi=
ons by different rinas and dharmas. One needs to JUDGE which dharma is high=
er and which rina is more important.

=C2=A0
Depending on one's individual =
circumstances, one of the following may be the best option:
=C2=A0
(1) Igno=
re the complaining wife/husband. Don't fight or argue, but keep doing your =
sadhana. As time progresses, (a) she may see the positive change in your at=
titude and stop complaining, (b) she may just get used to it and accept her=
 fate, (c) she may keep complaining and YOU may get used to that complaints=
 and accept your fate.
=C2=A0
(2) Talk to her/him and find some compromise =
that is acceptable. Instead of doing 1 hour sadhana, may be do half hour an=
d spend more time doing something she likes.
=C2=A0
(3) Give up your idea o=
f sadhana and take whatever you are able to do, as sanctioned by your wife/=
husband, as your sadhana. For example, cooking, cleaning dishes, washing cl=
othes, taking her to a movie, massaging her feet, taking kids to activities=
 etc can also be sadhanas.
=C2=A0
Any activity can be done with a protestin=
g/dissenting attitude or an agitated mind, or with love and caring and a ca=
lm and composed mind. Every activity involves interacting with some objects=
. Just as god is in idol and fire, he is in vegetables you cut, food you co=
ok, feet you massage etc. If you see an action as a chore or look at it or =
its object(s) with an impure mind (e.g. with lust or with anger or with fru=
stration) or focus more of your attention on yourself, then it becomes impu=
re. If you approach the action with a calm and devoted mind, see the action=
 and its object(s) with love, devotion and caring and focus the more of you=
r attention on the action and its objects (rather than youself and your own=
 happiness), then it becomes a ritual or sadhana.
=C2=A0
Of course, in some=
 actions one hates, it is very difficult to bring that calmness and caring.=
 In some other actions (e.g. sex), one may become too selfish or self-absor=
bed and think too much about one's own sensations, to look at the action an=
d other persons/objects with love, caring, devotion.

=C2=A0
Thus, we norma=
lly don't talk about converting all actions into sadhana and talk about jap=
am, homam etc. It is easier in those to look at the action and its objects =
with a sense of purity and devotion. However, if that is not possible and o=
ne has to do some other actions, why note TRY to convert them into sadhana?=
 Try to perform the action with a calm, stable, selfless mind, focus attent=
ion on the action and its objects and imbibe love and caring into your thin=
king.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
In fact, at some stage, (3) has to bec=
ome part of one's sadhana. One has to convert every action into a sadhana. =
Just doing japam or homam for an hour or two may not cut it.
=C2=A0
If you =
live in a really cold country, your room can get very cold. If you turn the=
 heater on for an hour everyday and keep it off rest of the time, the room =
will overall be very cold. Similarly, if you do sadhana for an hour, you ma=
y feel better, but the normal attitude returns. To make permanent progress,=
 the heater has to be on most of the day! Of course, as you cannot do japam=
 or homam for 12 hours a day, you have to convert whatever you do (eating, =
driving to work, your work, driving back, cooking, eating, talking to peopl=
e, etc) into sadhana. At some stage, every seeker will have to start doing =
it.

=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
