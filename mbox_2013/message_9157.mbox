Wonderful inspirational talk given in 1989 by Swami Chidananda Saraswati of=
 the Divine Life Society.

"Blessed immortal souls, beloved children of the=
 Divine!.....

....When we speak of the destiny of man we don't speak of a =
special human being or a historical person, but we speak very much of ourse=
lves=97today=97here=97in this world of the fourth quarter of our very troub=
led yet eventful 20th century. What is our destiny?"........

.............=
..."There is a great cycle. In this cosmic existence there is a great cycle=
. The sun shines upon the oceans, upon the seas, upon huge lakes, upon all =
collections of water. And when the heat of the sun intensifies, the water b=
egins to evaporate, it gives up its substance, its thickness and rises up a=
s vapour and ascends into the skies, and upward winds help its ascent......=
...Ponder this cycle!"

"You are now in one half of the circle. You have be=
en born into this state of identification with the gross physical body whic=
h is perishable, which is subject to so many imperfections, change, disease=
, old age, infirmities and one day it has to pass. Now you are involved wit=
h that which is not your real identity, your real Self=97it is non-self....=
..

.......whereas you are an uncreated principle, eternal, beginningless, =
timeless, for you are one with the cosmic principle. Temporarily you have f=
orgotten your eternal oneness with that. It is a state where you have wande=
red away and have become alienated from your source and origin, and that ha=
s started all your problems."

.... "All your weeping and wailing, all your=
 present human pains and sorrows and sufferings are to be directly attribut=
ed to your having separated yourself in consciousness from that great reali=
ty which is the very quintessence of peace and joy."

"So from this state w=
here only half the cycle has taken place you have to start the journey back=
 home and complete the cycle and rest once again in that pristine state of =
divine perfection and freedom."

"This is the destiny of man as cognised by=
 seers of transcendental divine insight."
