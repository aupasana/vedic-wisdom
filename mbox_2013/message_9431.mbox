Hi,

The poem was a tribute to the Sufis. In these times of Islamophobia, t=
hey have been sidelined by the vociferous radical Sunni groups who claim to=
 be 'true' Islam, and who look down upon all religions including Sufism.

O=
ur conception of God is a perfect being, all loving and compassionate. This=
 is the reality according to all saints (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist=
) who directly experienced God/Truth.

How can this perfect being be blamed=
 for the stupidity of humans fighting each other?

Allah is not to blame fo=
r Muslims killing each other in His Name.

Vishnu and Shiva are not to blam=
e for Vaishnavites and Shaivaites (their followers) despising and fighting =
each other in India.
Krishna cannot be blamed for the terrible atrocities c=
ommitted in the as a result of the caste system. 

The lower human nature i=
s responsible.

The need to feel superior is responsible. 

"My house is be=
tter than your house, my car/my country/my religion is better"...it's all a=
bout the "my" not about God. "My" God is better than your God, so I am bett=
er than you"...is the implied meaning. Fighting in the name of God is not a=
bout God, but about "me"..it's all about pride and superiority.

It is true=
 that Islam today has a very dark side. Darker than other religions at the =
moment...though every religion has dark elements in its past. I've been at =
the receiving end of some negativity from a couple of Muslim friends when I=
 was at university- they dropped me as a friend because I wasn't Muslim but=
 Hindu. It was hurtful at the time but I'm over it. People are all on a pat=
h of evolution. If I'd been born in a Muslim family, I may have been condit=
ioned into thinking their way. This world is a play of God. All this is hap=
pening as per His wish. I actually feel sorry for people who fight in the N=
ame of God.....what unnecessary stress and tension they create in their hea=
ds. 

Sufis are a wonderful tolerant group. They are an example of the bhak=
ti tradition of India where they see themselves as the lover and God as the=
 Beloved. The bhakti tradition says you can build a relationship with God a=
s a friend/parent/servant/lover....the Sufis follow the path of becoming tr=
ue lovers of God. Their methods of worship are banned in many Islamic count=
ries and they are not considered Muslim at all by the mainstream and treate=
d very badly. But the mainstream are just missing out in the most beautiful=
 part of their tradition. 

Thanks Narasimhaji for the kind comments.

Best=
 wishes,

Aparna
