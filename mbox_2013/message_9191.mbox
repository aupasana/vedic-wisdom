Namaste,
Dear Narasimha, I am very happy for your manual's, thank of much a=
nd god bless you!

I have some questions, please help me:

In the "Sri Maha=
 Ganapati Homam" manual it says that after "Uttaraangam" we need to make "T=
arpanam (satisfying with liquid)
" but in the Video this part is missing, i=
s this part necessary or can be without it?

When should I say my Sankalpa =
(my desire) to Devata and how? (In Pooja there are several options)

Can I =
read the Mantras from the document in my Mind? Because it is than like read=
 the book.

It's correctly when I chant let's say this mantra "Om Kum Kujay=
a swaahaA"? Or only "Om Kum Kujaya namaha swaahaA"? (in Main part)

How sho=
uld I stack firewood in the homa kundam before begining? Because there are =
options (Square, triangle, etc.)

Can I use Cow dung in this Homam? and can=
 I use Bell-ringer and when it is to used?

And last question, what remains=
 after the completion of the Homam in a plate(Akshata in a plate, Ghee, Flo=
wer etc), can I use this in the next Homam or I must bey new Flower and do =
new Akshata etc.?

Please help me

With deep respect to Narasimha for his w=
ork
