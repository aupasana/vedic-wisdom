Hello! Everyone

If it's only a case of being possessed by Spirits then the=
re are many ways available in hypnotherapy and past life regression therapy=
 to deal with the same. I myself can also do it if anyone is in need of the=
 same. But since I am not a professional and I'm a govt servant in India, s=
ometimes I might find difficulty in adjusting my time. I'm pursuing this as=
 a hobby only and I don't charge for the services.=C2=A0 For persons who ne=
ed urgent help can contact any good professional hypnotherapist or past lif=
e regression therapist. There are lot many ways to handle varieties of issu=
es for which one may not find any explanation. Websites of two such profess=
ional and good institutes I can recommend are www.liferesearchacademy.com a=
nd www.hypnotherapyschoolindia.com. if you Google for hypnotherapist and pa=
st life regression therapists for your area you might get many of them. But=
 please check their credentials before approaching anyone except for the tw=
o I referred
 above about whom I've personal knowledge of being highly comp=
etent. I hope that this information is helpful.

,<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">A possession by a foreign entity, IF=
 genuine, is always a very serious matter. For there are various classes an=
d kinds and types of entities which can possess an individual and some of t=
hem can be downright nasty.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Upayas are=
 many. As so many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* w=
ork, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a spe=
cific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guara=
ntee of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has p=
ossessed the individual and what their link for the same is. By link it mea=
ns one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed t=
hem to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be something
 as simple as s=
pitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into =
their territory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weaknes=
s in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberate=
ly send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, th=
ere is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situati=
on. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti th=
at those trying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.=
Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then =
unless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come =
to serious harm.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">These things like rem=
oving possession are specializations. These do not fall under the ambit of =
normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, any sadhaka=
 with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every action has =
its repercussion and one must know well how to
 handle the same too. Again
=
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which, based on previ=
ous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individual, then that=
 too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pleasant cons=
equences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is all a complex=
 chain.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">[Reminds me of a particular in=
dividual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before st=
arting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as=
 well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as pe=
r the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would=
 sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own=
 free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to =
remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit i=
s of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]<br
 clear=3D"none"><b=
r clear=3D"none">Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who knows exactly how=
 to deal with spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the =
first is not possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any dei=
ty - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC =
(fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force a=
nd will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not=
 help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 h=
ours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination=
 to see this through to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl o=
f water in a copper pot, and then either make the possessed individual drin=
k the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. <br cl=
