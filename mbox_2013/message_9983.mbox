Namaste

We are pleased to present second p=
art of the path-breaking series on
Hinduism. As you would see in comments a=
nd facebook, this series has led to
many Muslims embracing the goodness of =
Hinduism. In words of Md Khaja:

"Through Swami Vivekananda, I got to know =
the basics of Sanskrit (Hindu)
Philosophy. But, through Agniveer site I got=
 to know the whole of Sanskrit
(Hindu) philosophy. "

Ershad Hossain says: =
"In reviving Hinduism or the Sanatanadharma, we will
bring peace to this wo=
rld once again."

(continued from http://agniveer.com/why-i-am-proud-to-be-=
hindu-part-1/)
*Reason 6: Hinduism- Research friendly, reform friendly*

Hi=
nduism has no book, no person, no history, no ideology to defend. It does
n=
ot matter whether you worship through lighting of agarbatti, or conduct
Haw=
an, or ring bells in temple, or recite name with eyes closed in
isolation, =
or keep fasts, or enjoy sweets in festivals.

*The core of Hinduism is defi=
ned in Yajurveda 1.5 (Idam Aham Anritaat
Satyam Upaimi)- =93 I strive to re=
ject the non-true and accept the true in
this present moment. So Hinduism i=
s all about living in present and
choosing what is best right now, irrespec=
tive of what may have appeared
right in past.* It is all about making that =
incremental progress every
moment like in any research-based discipline.

H=
induism doesn=E2=80=99t demand you to defend what you have stood for in pas=
t.
You must be able to defend what you are standing for right now. And if y=
ou
cannot defend, then simply evolve.

Thus research and knowledge-enhancem=
ent is encouraged unlike many
religions. In fact there are many verses whic=
h specifically state that
unless one is on a constant path of seeking newer=
 and latest knowledge,
wisdom will ever remain elusive. Knowledge alone lib=
erates.

I am not aware of any religion that specifically states that mathe=
matics
and astronomy must be mastered to have rightly-directed understandin=
g of
God, soul, spiritualism, after-life and related topics.

I am not awar=
e of any religion that states that it does not matter what you
believe in r=
ight now, even if that belief amounts to blatant blasphemy.
What matters is=
 that you are on a genuine pursuit of knowledge increment.

I am not aware =
of any religion that demands you to keep changing, keep
evolving, keep impr=
oving, keep innovating to choose even better ways out.
That demands you to =
kill the past and live in present to make a better
future. That proactively=
 encourages reforms in every aspect of living
instead of clinging to archai=
c interpretations of some =E2=80=98divine=E2=80=99 message.

That is why *e=
ven though many social evils got into Hindu society over its
long history (=
longest in world), at the same time, reform movements also
emerged in paral=
lel to fight these evils.*And that is why Hindu society has
been so vocal i=
n admitting that social evils like casteism, Sati, polygamy
and dowry are i=
ndeed social evils. Thus the Hindu society proudly made laws
to destroy the=
se social evils, and considered these reforms as genuine
Hinduism.

*That i=
s why saints like Kabir, Nanak and Dayanand Saraswati are held in
such high=
 esteem by Hindu society even though they critically challenged
the prevail=
ing social norms of their times.*

That is why, Hinduism is not a religion =
in first place. It is simply an
enlightened way of life.

So if you are a s=
cientist, social reformer, researcher, inventor or
discoverer, you are a Hi=
ndu. It does not matter what your theological or
religious beliefs are.

A =
Newton is a Hindu, Einstein is a Hindu, APJ Abdul Kalam is a Hindu, Steve
J=
obs is a Hindu, every sensible person is a Hindu. More the sensibility,
mor=
e the Hinduism within him.
*Reason 7: Hinduism- Journey of personal discove=
ry*

The fundamental principle of Hinduism is that *root of sorrow lies in
=
ignorance (Avidya). And remedy is wisdom (Vidya)*. This wisdom cannot be
ex=
ternally imposed. It has to be discovered within by one's own efforts.
Thro=
ugh knowledge, action and contemplation. The external tools may be
helpful =
in the process. But nonetheless, each of us has to undertake its
own journe=
y through its own initiative.

And since each of us is so different and so =
special, spoon-feeding and
expecting to blindly adopt any unverified truth =
would be an insult to our
being human.

*Thus all Hindu texts are mere reco=
mmendations. And they clearly state that
ultimate authority is one's own se=
lf.*

Yes, Vedas are considered Supreme in Hinduism. Some consider Gita to =
be
their guide. Some admire Ramayan and Mahabharat. But none is a compulsio=
n. *The
only compulsion is that you sincerely undertake a journey of person=
al
discovery and allow others the freedom to take a similar journey.*
*Reas=
on 8: Hinduism- synonym of practical tolerance*

That takes us to the next =
reason why Hinduism is source of my pride.
Hinduism is all about tolerance.=
 Since each one of us has to individually
take up the journey of personal d=
iscovery, and each one of us is a
different being, Hinduism acknowledges th=
at paths we choose are bound to be
different. So far there is no threat or =
deceit involved, Hinduism
encourages to respect diversity of beliefs and wa=
ys of living. *A so-called
non-Hindu is not supposed to live like a second =
class citizen in a Hindu
Rashtra or Hindu nation.*

*That is why since time=
 immemorial, Hindustan or Bharat or Aryavart or
India has been the cradle t=
hat nurtured a variety of theologies. There are
no separate rules for Hindu=
, Muslim or Christian in a Hindu code of
conduct. This is in stark contrast=
 with many religions that clearly state
that only followers of their set of=
 superstitions are the special ones.*

It is shamefully surprising to know =
that even in 21st century there are
such fanatic countries that debar peopl=
e of other faith to build their
places of worship, or visit their so-called=
 Holy cities. In such intolerant
societies, punishments for crime against w=
omen, Jews, Christians, Hindus,
Muslims are different. The rights of people=
 to hold positions of
responsibility is dependent on their religion. This h=
as been the way of the
west for last 1000 years.

India, on contrary, owing=
 to its Hindu foundation, has been an icon of
tolerance. We have had severa=
l Muslim Presidents despite more than 80%
population being Hindu. Current v=
ice-president is a Muslim. Current chief
of ruling party in India is Christ=
ian. Current Defence Minister of India is
a Christian. The captain of India=
n Cricket team for a long time has been a
Muslim. The Chief of Army has bee=
n a Christian. Head of Intelligence Bureau
is a Muslim. And these people ha=
ve been adulated by Hindus irrespective of
their religion. The Kumbh Mela 2=
013- greatest religious event of Hindu
majority of India- was led by a Musl=
im. The top Bollywood stars are Muslims.

*I am not sure how many countries=
 in world can showcase such a level of
tolerance and respect for all faiths=
. The credit goes to the Hindu
foundation of the nation.* This makes Hindus=
tan the most unique in entire
world.

*(Its a different matter that this to=
lerance sometimes is misused to
politicize it into minority appeasement. Th=
is is becoming an increasingly
serious trend in India in last few decades c=
ausing a lot of communal
disharmony. The moment a special favor is given on=
 basis of caste or
religion, that amounts to appeasement and Hinduism is st=
rongly against it.
Respect all and respect self without discrimination =E2=
=80=93 this is the mantra
of Hinduism.)*
*Reason 9: Essence over Symbols, R=
ituals and Words*

When one thinks of religion, the first thing that comes =
in mind is a
specific set of rituals and practices specific to the follower=
s of that
religion. For example, Muslims have a specific language for Namaz=
 and
Azaan, or would keep beard in specific manner, or would have a specifi=
c
variety of cap and clothing and so on. A Christian would wear a cross
aro=
und his neck, or get baptized in a particular format. In case of
Hinduism a=
s well, there are several rituals. In fact there are many more
rituals, sym=
bols and words in Hinduism than any other religion. That is
what gives Indi=
a its vibrant colors, its rich cultural heritage and makes
it the most live=
ly and diverse country in the world.

*But there is a big difference. In Hi=
nduism, no symbol, ritual or word is
static in time or place. These change =
with time and place.* So a Tamil,
Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati or Bihari Hind=
u would have different prayers,
different religious symbols, different ways=
 of worship. In some other
religion this may amount to blasphemy and call f=
or strict punishments. But
in Hinduism this is not merely accepted but enco=
uraged. Because they would
all point to same essence of seeing Supreme with=
in all and all within
Supreme. Since He has infinite qualities, the ways to=
 explore, celebrate or
remember Him must also be infinite.

This is what ma=
kes India so dynamic. This is what brings unity in
diversity. This is exact=
ly the reason why India is so culturally rich. Our
rituals, symbols and pra=
yers change from place to place and time to time
and yet we direct them to =
One. This is what makes Hinduism so fresh, so
evolving, so purposeful, so p=
ractical.

In fact the name Hindu itself is time-bound. The word does not e=
xist in
Vedas, Ramayan, Mahabharat, Upanishads or any other scripture. It i=
s a word
of recent origin. However, the essence is same =E2=80=93 to adopt =
the roots of
enlightened living. Since Hinduism is the oldest and natural r=
eligion of
every human being, there was never a reason to have a special wo=
rd for the
religion. Manushya Dharma or Maanav Dharma (Humanity) is the mor=
e accurate
term for Hinduism. Or Arya (noble person) is a good term. For ag=
es these
terms sufficed followers of natural human religion. *It was only a=
fter
people started following a specific book or God or prophet that they f=
ound
the need to discover new terms to identity their cults.* *And then the=

culture of giving names to religions erupted. So Hindu became a term to
di=
fferentiate from anyone who considers disbelief in a particular book as a
s=
in.*

But irrespective of that, and regardless of whether we call ourselves=
 Hindu
or Arya or Humans or Rational Humans, we still focus on essence over=

symbols. *Love of mother is same regardless of whether you call Amma, or
M=
ummy, or Maa. There is no sin in choosing a different name for mother or
mo=
ther religion or mother philosophy. Fools fight over symbols. Hindus love
f=
or essence.*
*Reason 10: Nothing beats the Vedas- the foundation of Hinduis=
m*

I have read in depth all major religious and philosophical texts of the=

world. They all contain great wisdom. Be it Bible or Quran or Purans- they=

all extol to see the Supreme as supreme goal and live a life of
accountabi=
lity. Hats off to writers of these books.

*But nothing beats Vedas in term=
s of variety and depth of wisdom. The
roughly 20,000 mantras of Vedas cover=
 everything that a human would ever
require* =E2=80=93 sociology, science, =
mind control, health, technology,
education, management, purpose of life, m=
ethods of analysis, finance,
economics etc. *There are no stories or histor=
y unlike other books. There
are no claims of miracles. Nor there is any thr=
eat for accepting whatever
is written.*

And yes, earth is round in Vedas. =
Sun does not move around earth in Vedas.
There are no angels and Satans in =
Vedas. There is no Adam & Eve eating some
fruit in Vedas. God does not send=
 prophets in Vedas. God is not a human
like creature sitting on a throne in=
 Vedas. There is no city called Heaven
or Hell in Vedic map of universe. Th=
ere is no test that is being conducted
on us. There is no destiny that has =
already been hardcoded for us.

On contrary, *Vedas extol to discover the t=
ruths through research &
analysis. They urge us to change our destiny throu=
gh thoughts and actions.
They demand us to be rational and scientific.*

An=
d yet, Vedas do not say that one who believes in unscientific
superstitions=
 of Heaven, Hell, Judgement Day, Angels, Satans, Adam, Eve,
Miracles etc sh=
ould be ridiculed or punished in any manner. Instead they
appeal for unity =
of all irrespective of personal or theological
beliefs. *Intent
matters, no=
t beliefs.*

I admit this may be a personal reason that you do not concur w=
ith because
you could never get a chance to study Vedas properly. But after=
 my years of
research in Vedas as well as all other major texts of world, I=
 am yet to
find a book that surpasses Vedas in its completeness, scientific=
 spirit and
life-changing power. The foundation of Hinduism is more solid, =
more strong,
more reliable, more powerful than anything else I know. And if=
 I also add
along with Vedas the other Hindu gems- Gita, Upanishads & Darsh=
ans- then
nothing comes at par for an evolved mind.

So I have no option bu=
t to be proud to be Hindu. My pride lies in my
conduct of life as per virtu=
es of patience, tolerance, self-control and
scientific temper. My pride lie=
s in loving entire humanity. My pride lies
in defending against any form of=
 injustice. My pride lies in promoting
scientific way of living to extent p=
ossible, and yet be loving of those who
disagree with me. My pride lies in =
living up to the standards of an
enlightened Hindu. My pride lies in my hon=
est humility.

Yes, I am proud to be Hindu. And I do wish that entire human=
ity embraces
its root and become proud to be Hindu.

0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px"><h3><strong>Reason 9: Ess=
ence over Symbols, Rituals and Words</strong></h3><p>When one thinks of rel=
igion, the first thing that comes in mind is a specific set of rituals and =
practices specific to the followers of that religion. For example, Muslims =
have a specific language for Namaz and Azaan, or would keep beard in specif=
ic manner, or would have a specific variety of cap and clothing and so on. =
A Christian would wear a cross around his neck, or get baptized in a partic=
ular format. In case of Hinduism as well, there are several rituals. In fac=
t there are many more rituals, symbols and words in Hinduism than any other=
 religion. That is what gives India its vibrant colors, its rich cultural h=
eritage and makes it the most lively and diverse country in the world.</p>
=
<p><strong>But there is a big difference. In Hinduism, no symbol, ritual or=
 word is static in time or place. These change with time and place.</strong=
>=A0So a Tamil, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati or Bihari Hindu would have diffe=
rent prayers, different religious symbols, different ways of worship. In so=
me other religion this may amount to blasphemy and call for strict punishme=
nts. But in Hinduism this is not merely accepted but encouraged. Because th=
ey would all point to same essence of seeing Supreme within all and all wit=
hin Supreme. Since He has infinite qualities, the ways to explore, celebrat=
e or remember Him must also be infinite.</p>
<p>This is what makes India so=
 dynamic. This is what brings unity in diversity. This is exactly the reaso=
n why India is so culturally rich. Our rituals, symbols and prayers change =
from place to place and time to time and yet we direct them to One. This is=
 what makes Hinduism so fresh, so evolving, so purposeful, so practical.</p=

</div><p style=3D"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size=
:13px">In fact the name Hindu itself is time-bound. The word does not exist=
 in Vedas, Ramayan, Mahabharat, Upanishads or any other scripture. It is a =
word of recent origin. However, the essence is same =E2=80=93 to adopt the =
roots of enlightened living. Since Hinduism is the oldest and natural relig=
ion of every human being, there was never a reason to have a special word f=
or the religion. Manushya Dharma or Maanav Dharma (Humanity) is the more ac=
curate term for Hinduism. Or Arya (noble person) is a good term. For ages t=
hese terms sufficed followers of natural human religion.=A0<strong>It was o=
nly after people started following a specific book or God or prophet that t=
hey found the need to discover new terms to identity their cults.</strong>=
=A0<strong>And then the culture of giving names to religions erupted. So Hi=
ndu became a term to differentiate from anyone who considers disbelief in a=
 particular book as a sin.</strong></p>
<div style=3D"color:rgb(0,0,0);font=
-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px"><p>But irrespective of that, and r=
egardless of whether we call ourselves Hindu or Arya or Humans or Rational =
Humans, we still focus on essence over symbols.=A0<strong>Love of mother is=
 same regardless of whether you call Amma, or Mummy, or Maa. There is no si=
n in choosing a different name for mother or mother religion or mother phil=
osophy. Fools fight over symbols. Hindus love for essence.</strong></p>

ve read in depth all major religious and philosophical texts of the world. =
They all contain great wisdom. Be it Bible or Quran or Purans- they all ext=
ol to see the Supreme as supreme goal and live a life of accountability. Ha=

<p style=3D"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-fam=

, science, mind control, health, technology, education, management, purpose=
 of life, methods of analysis, finance, economics etc.=A0<strong>There are =
no stories or history unlike other books. There are no claims of miracles. =
Nor there is any threat for accepting whatever is written.</strong></p>
<di=

>And yes, earth is round in Vedas. Sun does not move around earth in Vedas.=
 There are no angels and Satans in Vedas. There is no Adam & Eve eating=
 some fruit in Vedas. God does not send prophets in Vedas. God is not a hum=
an like creature sitting on a throne in Vedas. There is no city called Heav=
en or Hell in Vedic map of universe. There is no test that is being conduct=
ed on us. There is no destiny that has already been hardcoded for us.</p>
<=
p>On contrary,=A0<strong>Vedas extol to discover the truths through researc=
h & analysis. They urge us to change our destiny through thoughts and a=
ctions. They demand us to be rational and scientific.</strong></p><p>And ye=
t, Vedas do not say that one who believes in unscientific superstitions of =
Heaven, Hell, Judgement Day, Angels, Satans, Adam, Eve, Miracles etc should=
 be ridiculed or punished in any manner. Instead they appeal for unity of a=

t you do not concur with because you could never get a chance to study Veda=
s properly. But after my years of research in Vedas as well as all other ma=
jor texts of world, I am yet to find a book that surpasses Vedas in its com=
pleteness, scientific spirit and life-changing power. The foundation of Hin=
duism is more solid, more strong, more reliable, more powerful than anythin=
