Dear Durgesh,

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3652


Please read the mail above.

One sadhaka took 10 hours to do his first chandi homa, and another took 6.5
hours to do his first chandi homa. With time and practice, both of them
learnt the chandi text well and were able to do the homa in a much shorter
time. Some sadhakas who started like this even did more than 1 chandi homa
each day ...


> I have hindi version of Saptashati


The original text (in sanskrit) has the blessings of the rishis. This may
not be true for translations.

sasneham,

    ajit
