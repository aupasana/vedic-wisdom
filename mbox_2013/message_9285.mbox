Namaste again.

To add, I already know that the first one of the four mantr=
as below is taken from "Ganapathi Atharva Seersham" but still would like to=
 know your opinion about the other three, is their any basic difference bet=
ween the first one and the other three?

Apart from these four, I have also=
 chanted "Om Ganapataye Namah" and the effect was not comfortable.

Thanks
=
Tanvir
