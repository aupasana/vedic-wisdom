Declaring Truth Boldly
A New Video With
Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

Ther=
e are thousands of people today who claim to be legitimate spiritual
teache=
rs. But how do we actually know if any of these people really are the
excep=
tionally qualified and authentic gurus they claim to be? Who truly has the
=
right to speak for Dharma?

In this astoundingly powerful video, Sri Dharma=
 Pravartaka Acharya explains in
no-nonsense terms exactly how you can tell =
if someone really has the right to
claim to be a spiritual authority. Such =
a legitimate guru, Sri Acharyaji
explains, teaches without fear. It is the =
duty of an authentic spiritual teacher
to declare the truth boldly - regard=
less of the consequences to himself. To do
so is an act of compassion towar=
d others and the greatest service toward Dharma.

In his characteristically=
 honest and assertive style, Sri Acharyaji demonstrates
with his own person=
al example in this video precisely what it means to declare
truth boldly.
