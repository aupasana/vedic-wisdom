>>
>>Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who

>> before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!
>>
>>*        *        *

>>As another example, let us look at Lord

>>
>>He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of
>> a charitable demon king with many great qualities.
>>
>>Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is doing

>> one's discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When
>> wisdom fills one's entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are
>> completely suppressed.
>>
>>*        *        *

>>Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be understood as
