In my school curriculum there was a poem which meant like this:
"Gre=
at sadhus with their complex rituals couldn't find Lord Shiva; while they w=
ere busy worshiping the lord inside, he came to see me when i was guarding =
their footwear outside the temple!" (the poet was deemed shoodra by his cou=
nterparts)
Rituals and external objects definitely help sadhana but that sh=
ouldn't become the limiting factor to go beyond. For instance for reminding=
 myself about mind focus when i am outside i have attributed it to butterfl=
ies which are abundant around me (i live in a countryside). However when i =
don't find a butterfly it still reminds me of mind focus :)
I am not agains=
t any ritual or material leverage one relies on the sadhana while i myself =
use it. If everything is created by Mother Shakti then everything we do min=
dfully is in fact worship of the great mother. In that sense one may use a =
material object or that object can be conceived in mind 'maansik', both hav=
e similar effect. Shiva manasa pooja by Shankaracharya is indicative of thi=
s idea :).

Gautama Buddha and Sage Patanjali said "everything leads to mis=
ery". I understood the implication of this only when i went through a simil=
ar situation. Till then it was just an another negative phrase about life f=
or me. That is why even though i quote from my own life experience it still=
 is MY EXPERIENCE and not the reader's. So the salt phrase in the end :)

D=
on't hate salt because it is a potent way to cleanse negative energies from=
 our body. Try salt water bath once in a while especially when you have bee=
n out with mixed type of people :) (but don't try too often)

:) :)
