Hi all, 

Read post on grah devata on manish sirs wall. wanted to get clari=
ty on few points. 

the essence of the post was that if a  person is just i=
nterested in solving his problems he can do homam to grah devata.

1. Can p=
raying to grah devata help if the grah is debliated ? (It can certainly hel=
p of Grah is only unhappy coz of neighbour)

I thought this (debliation) is=
 a karmic issue for which pratyadhi devata can only help. from my limited k=
nowledge i just know that for physical issues grah devata can help, fro men=
tal issue adidevata can help. and for karmic pratyadhi devata can help.

le=
t me know if am missign soemthing.

regards
Priyank
