Daily Bhaskar insults Hinduism- Agniveer=92s Response

Thrashing Hinduism i=
s no more a tool for appeasement in India. It has now
ascended to the level=
 of being prerequisite to become =91intellectual=92 and
the part of =91civi=
l society=92. Being =91intellectual=92 means to swim upstream,
to go agains=
t the popular narrative, to take position that is against the
faith of comm=
on masses, to attack sentiments of people in the name of
freedom of express=
ion and openness. And this freedom is used very
selectively by some media s=
talwarts. While questioning Hindu faith,
existence of Ram, mockery of Hanum=
an- =91the monkey god=92, criticism of Ram
for Sita=92s Agnipariksha, quest=
ions on Krishna for having affairs with gopis
and thousands of wives etc (a=
ll false allegations, rebutted on agniveer.com way
back) make you an =91int=
ellectual=92 and a champion of freedom of expression,
questioning miracles,=
 prophets and their personal lives of Abrahamic
religions (minorities in In=
dia) is highly communal and makes you fascist.

We recently came across a p=
iece of work titled as- *Ancient sex cultures in
Mahabharat, Rig Vedas and =
religious scriptures *published in Daily Bhaskar,
kindly find it here
http:=
//daily.bhaskar.com/article/JM-ancient-sex-cultures-in-mahabharat-rig-vedas=
-and-religious-scriptures-4265737-PHO.html.
Author seems too intellectual t=
o give his name anywhere in the article.
Post is full of innovations on sex=
ual relations and can put even
pornographic content to shame. For example, =
the author =91proves=92 from
scriptures that, in ancient times, even mother=
 and son used to do sex.
People used to enjoy animal sex. Anyone could do s=
ex with anyone anywhere,
even in open when thousands others were watching.
=

Perverts were, are and will be there in society in all eras. *We don=92t
b=
other if one of them stands up one day and publishes stories of his
experie=
nces and fantasies in newspapers. But what bothers us is the attempt
by a p=
ervert to justify his own shameful acts by dragging in religion and
holy te=
xts of Hinduism.*

This article seems to be a way to promote pornography an=
d use denigration
of noble Hindu culture as a ploy to increase hits, confus=
e devout Hindus,
create hatred for Hindus in minds of non-Hindus and in pro=
cess, further
their own selfish goals. After all what is more welcoming to =
a media house
than something that brings controversial popularity. Sex bein=
g considered
the strongest drive among materially inclined humans, and reli=
gion being
strongest influence on typical majority of Indians, there can be=
 no better
formula for publicity than linking the two. Anyway, here is the =
point wise
response

*Author:* *There was a stage in our history, when ther=
e were no social
rules formed for sex between men and women. That was the t=
ime when no one
would care about the relationship they share with other hum=
an beings before
having sex with them. This is because there were no such r=
elationships back
then.*

*Having sex with any woman, having open sex anywh=
ere anytime like animals,
having sex with young girls and even sex with ani=
mals was a common thing
with humans. Sex was wayward that time.*

*With the=
 development of civilization, relationships, social practices and
ethical s=
tandards developed. We can understand it in historical
sociological context=
.*

*To know how sex was an integral part of our society, click on this sli=
de
show=85*

*Agniveer:*

No one knows how the author jumped to these concl=
usions. These are just
claims made by author. The author does not even stat=
e which era of history
is he talking about. As we will see in next slides (=
with vulgar images put
for obvious reasons), he is inclined to give sexual =
colors to anything
Hindu irrespective of how far or near to present it is. =
As we will also
see, these claims are based on most silly and unverified =
=91facts=92 known best
to the authors.

There have always been criminals an=
d perverts and even sex-maniacs like the
current author in all eras of civi=
lization. *If someone reads author=92s post
in Daily Bhaskar and looks at r=
ight hand side, there are links to
pictures/news (screenshot attached) of s=
emi nude prostitutes. So according
to author, Daily Bhaskar is all about pr=
ostitutes and their whereabouts!*

*If someone reads about the recent ghast=
ly Delhi Gangrape case and
concludes that =93Once upon a time, raping women=
 and killing them was a
common thing with humans. Rape was wayward that tim=
e. Rape was an integral
part of our society.=94, what would you call that p=
erson. Either too dumb or
too perverted! If there is a third option, let us=
 know.*

*Author:* *In chapter 63 of Adiparva in Mahabharat, open sex betwe=
en Rishi
Parashar and Satyavati Matsyangandha has been described. Also, in =
the 104th
chapter of Adiparva, it is mentioned that son of Utthat, Dirghtam=
a started
having sex with a woman in front of all the people.*

*Agniveer:*=


1. Firstly, the context of Rishi Parashar issue has been misquoted. Autho=
r
has lied blatantly because *the verses clearly state that there was
compl=
ete isolation, there was none around.* On top of it, whether one
endorses i=
t or not is left to individual=92s analysis. Further, the
conditions and si=
tuations of the story are unknown. Even more, whether the
verses are fully =
authentic is also a question mark. Because the same
Mahabharat says in Aadi=
 Parva, Chapter 1, verses 81, 101 and 102 that the
original Mahabharat cons=
isted of only 8800 verses which was expanded to the
one with 24000 verses f=
irst and later it became the book with more than
1,00,000 verses. It is com=
mon with all history books.

2. We don=92t know what made author bring stor=
ies of an almost unknown person
and then prove that Mahabharat sanctions ad=
ultery, that too, in open. He
could not give any Shloka in his support. Now=
 see this! Here is the same
Dirghtama, son of Utthat in the same chapter 10=
4 in Adi Parva saying- *it
is not lawful for a woman to have connection wit=
h a man other than her
husband. And she who may have such connection shall =
certainly be regarded
as fallen=85*

Here, *Dirghtama unequivocally states =
adultery as sin*. Now even if he
practiced it in the verses best known to a=
uthor, it is his moral weakness
and not a principle of Mahabharat! But thes=
e verses being contrary to what
the author was searching (pornography) in h=
ighly titillated state were
ignored completely by the author.

3. Author is=
 hell bent in proving that in Mahabharat and ancient times,
there were no r=
ules for sex. Anyone could be with anyone anywhere for this
purpose. Sex wa=
s wayward=85 Author could not give a single proof of what he
claimed. But h=
ere are some examples that prove otherwise-

a. Man who is respected most i=
n Mahabharat after Shri Krishna is Bhishma.
Do you know why, Mr/Ms/=85 Auth=
or? *Because he was a Brahmchari, a celibate,
who was respected by Rishis a=
nd masses for his self control. His vow-
Bhishma Pratigya- of being Brahmch=
ari is considered as the greatest resolve
in Mahabharat and even till today=
.* This indicates that whatever the
behaviour and conduct of common masses =
be, self control was always
considered as the greatest virtue in ancient Hi=
ndu history.

b. Mr/Ms/=85 Author! Bhagwad Geeta is the most popular litera=
ture known to
mankind on spirituality and self/mind control. =93Be master o=
f senses, not
slave=94 remains the core essence of Geeta. And coincidently,=
 *Geeta is the
part of Mahabharat- Bhishma Parva, same Mahabharat that, acc=
ording to
author, taught author=92s ancestors to do sex with anyone anywher=
e!   *

c. Mr/Ms/=85 Author says that there were no relations in the time o=
f
Mahabharat and anyone could =85. anytime anywhere with anyone, even in fr=
ont
of everyone. But we all know the reality. Author does not know that *Ar=
jun
went to a self imposed exile for few years during Vanvaas of Pandavas. =
Why?
Because of the sin he committed. What sin? Sin of entering the room of=

Yudhishthir and Draupadi when they were discussing some matters alone! And=

since Arjun thought that he has violated privacy of the two, he went to
ex=
ile of few years!* Leave alone sex, standards of morality were so high in
t=
hose times that Arjun considered it sin to even listen to the discussion
of=
 a couple. But the shameless Author found pornography in Mahabharat!

d. In=
 Mahabharat, no relations would matter in those times, sex culture was
all =
pervading, says the author. But reality was diametrically opposite. *When
t=
he king of Matsya Desh gave marriage proposal of his daughter Uttara to
Arj=
un, Arjun denied forcefully and said that how can he marry Uttara, his
disc=
iple whom he has always considered as his own daughter? Arjun, then,
had Ut=
tara married to his son Abhimanyu!  *

e. People used to=85. anywhere with =
anyone, says the author. But he forgets
why whole Mahabharat took place in =
first place! Foundations of Mahabharat
war were laid down the day Duhshasan=
 dragged Draupadi in the court and
tried to do what author foolishly believ=
es was a custom in those days. Had
it been a custom in those days to=85. wi=
th anyone, anywhere, there would be
no Mahabharat in first place!

*Author:=
* *In modern history, it is described that Maharaja Ranjit Singh
used to ha=
ve sex in a place where his elephant used to be tied for everyone
to see hi=
m. In the times of Bajirav, a game =91Ghatkancuki=92 used to play in
Pune.*=


*Also, some chosen elite men and women were made to have sex for others
e=
ntertainment. The men used to first pull the women=92s dresses and then hav=
e
sex with them in public. The sexual game would continue until every man
w=
ould have slept with every woman. *

*Agniveer:* Hatred of author for Hindu=
s-Sikhs is now exposed. He/she
started with ancient history and Mahabharat =
and suddenly jumped to Maharaja
Ranjit Singh whom most of Hindus and Sikhs =
love so much. And there is no
authentic reference to this claim is given by=
 author.  And this time
example is from Modern History. But author himself =
stated that*=93*With the
development of civilization, relationships, social=
 practices and ethical
standards developed. =94 Does it mean that these dev=
elopments happened only
in last 100 years?

It is clear that fake reference=
s from equally dubious sources are being
used to impose sexual perversion o=
f the author on the Hindu culture. *Even
if the author is able to prove tha=
t in history, some X, Y or Z persons used
to do A,B or C, that no way prove=
s that A, B or C was commonplace and
endorsed by religious norms. In matter=
s of Hinduism, the norm is Vedas.
Unless something is proven there, it has =
no significance. *

*Author:* *In Karnataka, until independence, people use=
d to organize group
sex. Here, age was not a concern at all. It is believed=
 that in ancient
times, Tamilians too used to have sex in front of everyone=
. One can find in
Vedas that people used to have open group sex in yagya bh=
oomi.*

*Agniveer:*

a. Who in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu? *In USA, many peop=
le are in asylums. In
Pakistan, many are throwing bombs. In Delhi, many rap=
es are happening. What
does that imply? That mental diseases are common in =
USA? That all
Pakistanis are terrorists as a rule? That most Delhites are r=
apists? *

b. In last line, reference to Vedas are given. Kindly provide wh=
ich verse
in Vedas state so and what is the evidence that your translation =
is
correct? On contrary we can provide innumerable examples from Vedas that=

extol that women should be respected as mother, self-control be followed,
=
monogamy be way of family, and sex etc be private matters not to be done in=

public. Here are few Mantras from Vedas that expose author=92s lies

*- In=
 Atharva Veda 7.38.4, wife says that =93You should only be mine. You
should=
 not even discuss about other women.=94*

*- Atharva Ved 3.30.2 and 14.2.64=
 appeal husband and wife to be devoted and
faithful to each other.*

*- Rig=
 Veda 10.105.8 compares existence of multiple partners with multiple
worldl=
y miseries.*

*- Rig Veda 10.101.11 states that a person with two partners =
is pressed
from both sides and weeps like a horse that neighs when pressed =
from both
sides by spokes while driving a chariot.*

*- Rig Veda 10.101.11 =
state that two partners make life aimless.*

*- Atharva Veda 3.18.2 prays t=
hat may a woman never face threat of another
co-wife.*

Author is suggested=
 to stop searching for porn in religious texts. He may
do it better elsewhe=
re. And yes, if he/she/=85 wants to know real meanings
and importance of Ve=
das, Agniveer is ready to offer authentic translations
which can be ordered=
 from our Vedic store- Agnikart!

*Author:* *Kautbik sex (incest) is mentio=
ned in ancient texts. It is
mentioned =91Harivansh=92 that the daughter of =
sage Vasishta, Shatrupa believed
him to be her husband and therefore used t=
o have sex with him. In the same
grantha it is mentioned that Daksha gave h=
er daughter to his father,
Brahmadev and Narada was born.*

*As mentioned i=
n Haribhavishya, Indra dev had sex with his great grandson=92s
(Janmejay) w=
ife Vapushtma. *

*Agniveer:*

*What is Harivansh? Which chapter and page o=
f which book? What is
Haribhavishya? The author does not even know names of=
 books he is quoting.
No such books exist in Hindu library.*

*Author:* *In=
 Mahabharat=92s Adiparva, it is said that if an unmarried woman
expresses h=
er desire to have sex, it should be fulfilled. If her wish is
not fulfilled=
, it means death of religion. Ulupi clearly says to Arjuna
that to satisfy =
a woman, it not against religion to sleep with her for one
night.*

*Agnive=
er:*

*Who is saying to whom in Mahabharat? Is it Lord Krishna saying in Ge=
eta?
Or Rishi Ved Vyas talking to author?* Mahabharat even has characters l=
ike
Duryodhan who said that women were his slaves. Does it mean that Mahabh=
arat
considers women as slaves? Just think of it. Author is referring to Ul=
upi.
Was Ulupi a sage to be able to state what is right and wrong? On contr=
ary,
author is referring to a woman who is mad in love and hence has her se=
nses
blurred to decide what is right or wrong.

If Dharma-Adharma were so c=
learly understood in Mahabharat era, how would
one explain role of Lord Kri=
shna. Millions regard him as an incarnation to
protect and establish Dharma=
. If everyone was so Dharmic, why would Krishna
have been an incarnation.

=
*Further, if free sex was so commonplace even in that era, why Arjun
refuse=
d her wish? Why would Ulupi had to justify her stand?* She would have
done =
what she wanted to do without even mentioning a word and forgetting it
late=
r. Further, it should also be known that Ulupi belonged to current
Mexico r=
egion and not Bharatvarsha. Different societies have different
cultural nor=
ms over different periods of time. History books would only
tell you about =
people. For principles, one needs knowledge books like Vedas.

*Author:* *W=
hen Urvashi told Arjuna that if the Paurva Vansh=92a any son or
grandson wa=
nts to have sex with any woman of her family including her, it
is not insul=
ting religion. However, Arjuna did not accept it and Urvashi
called him imp=
otent.*

*It is also mentioned in religious scriptures that sage Agastya ha=
d kept
his daughter with the King of Vidarbha and when she reached age of
m=
arriage, he married his own daughter. *

*Agniveer:* Again is Urvashi a sag=
e? She was supposed to be a dancing girl.
And this story proves exactly opp=
osite to what author=92s pervert mind wants
to infer. *Arjun refused Urvash=
i=92s wish!* *This example is quoted in
Mahabharat to showcase what ideal r=
eligion is =96 to consider women as mother
irrespective of her status and p=
rofession =96 the way Arjun did. Even when
Urvashi insulted Arjuna, he did =
not deter from his stand.*

*Arjuna stood to his stand of respect for women=
. He had to face curse of
Urvashi for this. But even then, he turned this c=
urse into an opportunity.
Thus, message is that under whatsoever pressure, =
one must respect women.
And even if one has to face problems due to that, i=
t will turn into
opportunity.*

Which religious scripture is second story f=
rom, is unknown. For Hindus, the
only reliable texts are Vedas. Everything =
else is to be understood,
interpreted and accepted in lines of Vedas. There=
 is a mix of facts and
allegories in Hindu texts. They are not to be taken =
literally. The
language, era and society keep changing from time to time. B=
ut what is
important is that they all point to noble tenets of Vedas as elu=
cidated in
texts like Gita and Ishopanishad.

*Author:* *In the tenth manda=
l of Rig Veda, the sexual conversation between
Yam and Yami is mentioned. H=
ere, Yami expresses her desire to have sex with
her own brother. When Yam r=
efuses to do so, she insists and says that a
sister remaining unsatisfied d=
espite her brother being around, so what is
her brother=92s use? *

*This c=
learly signifies the sexual relationship between brothers and
sisters in an=
cient times.*

*Agniveer:*

a. Firstly, Yam Yami is a deep concept referrin=
g to certain fundamental
principles of nature applicable in all situations.=
 Basically they say that
complementary entities emerging from same source m=
ust not complement each
other and instead seek to spread in world. For exam=
ple, if I have a shop
selling orange juice at Rs 10 and my brother has a sh=
op selling mango juice
at Rs 10, we should not buy and sell from each other=
. In that case, each
day we can keep drinking glasses of juice from each ot=
her and transfer only
Rs 10!

This moral has been put in allegorical langua=
ge in this sukta. The essence
is that regardless of whatsoever pressure, on=
e must respect and protect
dignity of entities coming from same source with=
out using them for personal
gains. What this sukta signifies is that relati=
onships between such
entities (that also includes brother and sister) is st=
rictly prohibited as
per Vedas =96 oldest text and foundation of Hinduism. =
The beauty of Hinduism
is that it does not impose blanket rules. Instead it=
 provides logical
intuitive reasons =96 the why =96 so that instead of bein=
g blind followers,
each of us becomes an enlightened master. This is what t=
his sukta aims. But
perverts only see vulgarity is purest of things.

b. Ev=
en if this Sukta be considered as discussion of brother and sister, *a
BIG =
NO from brother concludes it all* and establishes the rule that such
relati=
onships are not acceptable!

*Author:* *About sexual relations, ancient his=
torian Cipeve Lerhuno wrote
that people used to occasionally have sex with =
their mothers, sisters and
daughters.*

*Agniveer:*

a. *Did this historian=
 mention Hinduism ever? It is quite possible that he
might have written abo=
ut his own family or society and the author has
superimposed his confession=
s on Hinduism for ulterior motives. *

b. Who is this historian? We request=
 everyone to google this name and see
what comes!

c. Anyway, why should we=
 care about him? How is his word a gospel for us?
Maybe the author is tryin=
g to defend some sins he may have committed in a
freudian manner. Nothing e=
lse explains such baseless reference less, vulgar
allegations on Hinduism.
=

d. And now author writes- =91occasionally=92 which denies it to be a custo=
m
which is contrary to what he/she/=85 wrote in previous slides that *anyon=
e
could do anything to anyone* like animals, there were no relationships at=

all!

*Author:* *Mahabharta mentiones in Adiparva that having sex with any=
 women
is not bad and is a normal behavior. Relationships are names given t=
o know
people.*

*Agniveer:*

Who said to whom and in what context? Just bl=
anket claim. *I may say that
Author mentioned in 2010 that he was a psychop=
ath and should be thrashed
whenever he denigrates Hinduism.* Should we take=
 my statement as seriously
as author wants us to take his vulgar allegation=
s? Anyway, enough has been
discussed on Mahabharat above.

*Author:* *Duryo=
dhan had made Karna the king of Angdesh. In this desh,
woman and children w=
ere sold.*

*Agniveer:*

a. Any reference? And *neither Duryodhan nor Karna=
 was supposed to be a
sage. In fact Duryodhan was considered the main villa=
in of Mahabharat. If
Ajmal Kasab wanted to kill Indians, that does not make=
 all people in
indian-subcontinent terrorists*.

b. If this is true, then t=
his would be another reason why Mahabharat
happened. *So say thanks to nobl=
e characters in Mahabharat for fighting
against slavery instead of proving =
them and society guilty of same!*

*Author:* *Clearly, regulation of sexual=
 relations came into our society
sequentially with the development of civil=
ization and culture. However, the
primitive desire to have sex from time to=
 time in humans is strengthened.
That is why even today we hear about such =
sexual relations, which are
illegal and immoral. Such relations are wrong t=
o a civilized man, but it is
also true that sex is a primitive instinct. *
=

*Agniveer:*

No denying the fact that sex is a primitive instinct. That is=
 why Hindu
Dharma aims to reform primitive savages into sensible humans who=
 realize
purpose of their actions and act responsibly to maximize bliss for=
 entire
world.

*Questions for author*

- Why were only Hinduism and Sikhis=
m targeted in the name of history? What
about other religions that have a f=
ar wider spread and a more thoroughly
documented history in modern and midd=
le era?

- Author hurled abuses on Hindu scriptures like Vedas and Mahabhar=
at and
role models like Arjun and Maharaja Ranjit Singh without a single
re=
ference. Why single out Hinduism and Sikhism for this affection? Why no
ana=
lysis on other religions? Does it not amount to religious fundamentalism
to=
 target one single religion =96 the religion of majority =96 in a secular
c=
ountry and allow no space for other religions?

Do you think attacking Hind=
uism in India is nice job to do since Hinduism
neither has apostates nor in=
fidels nor blasphemy laws? Does all this not
smell of bias and hatred again=
st Hinduism?

Please note that we do not intend to target any religion. We =
respect all
individuals and their freedom to choose and respect whatever fa=
ith they
prefer for themselves.

After all, Hinduism, by its very nature, i=
s a forgiving and tolerant faith
open to harshest criticism.

But be brave =
not coward. Respect the culture that gives you freedom. Love
it like Mother=
.

May the truth prevail!

PS: Hindu Janajagruti Samiti has decided to take=
 up this issue. In fact
they had apprised us of this article and had reques=
ted us to write our
views. We thank them for this and request all to suppor=
t them in this cause.

We also request all to take whatever legal or social=
 action as required to
be taken against Daily Bhaskar as per law of the lan=
d so that they
apologize and publish our response.
