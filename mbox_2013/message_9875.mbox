=C2=A0Dear Ajit,

I have a small point to make here.

<<Doesn't all sadha=
na belong in the same bucket? Aren't all visualizations
 and attempts to fo=
cus on a mantra or it's devata also trying to setup a
 particular "hallucin=
atory" mental framework>>

A large part of sadhana *initially* works in the=
 realm of imagination and visualization, but that is not the final thing at=
 all. There are things beyond the mind, beyond imagination - impossible for=
 the normal mind to imagine - and that too comes to a Yogi at some stage. O=
f course, as I said, that is not an initial stage. And for most people, thi=
s initial stage continues for long, even lifetimes.

As a simple example, o=
ne cannot imagine or self hypnotize or pep-talk oneself into a state of Abs=
olutely thoughtless Silence and the things that can happen in Perfect Silen=
ce of the mind. You can try and see for yourself. That is one example. Ther=
e are others too.

Neither the soul nor the Self can be possessed by imagin=
ation. Else, every great imaginative artist would have automatically come c=
lose to realization of the soul and/.or the Self. If the mind itself is lef=
t far behind when one really comes close to either the soul or the Self, wh=
at instrument will be used for the imagination?

Having said that, I agree =
that psychological *placebos* can often help to cure various problems, spec=
ially of a mental nature. But to a Yogi, that is unhelpful..

-Regards

If some knowledge of the past=

Pop culture and "new age" proponents package things as being "easy=

 Bhairava has been

 by
 followers of Shakta/Aghor tr=

not be that easy.

estion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either =
the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to=
 the main priest stating the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, ma=

>>>>>A possession by a foreign entity, IF =
genuine, is always a very serious matter. For there are various classes and=
 kinds and types of entities which can possess an individual and some of th=

>>>>>

 people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whe=
ther any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not depends o=
n multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all =
depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and=
 what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the =
root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the perso=
n.
 Sometimes it can be
 something
 as simple as spitting somewhere (where =
this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their territory and being=
 susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, o=
r in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to =
an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one s=
top method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the=
 shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help a=
re able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit o=
f a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying =
to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.
>>>>>
>>=
>>>These things like removing possession are specializations. These do not =
fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is g=
etting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay=
 away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to
 han=
dle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time ti=
ll which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of t=
he individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve s=
ome not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spi=
rit. It is all a complex chain.
>>>>>
>>>>>[Reminds me of a particular indi=
vidual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before star=
ting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as w=
ell as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per =
the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would s=
it and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own f=
ree will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to re=
move it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is =
of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]
>>>>>
>>>>>Best thing t=
o do is a) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possessi=
on and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask fa=
mily members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kal=
i, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - a=
nd do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means=
, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree =
of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana w=
ith the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the v=
ery end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and =
then either make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on=
 him/her. And pray as hard as possible.

><div><span>I just thought of adding some clarifications.</span></div>

<di=
v><span></span> </div><div><span>First of all, when I mentioned about =
the utility of techniques of "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression" for =
handling the problem of spirit attachments as well as many other problems f=
or which we do not have reasonable explanation, my assertions were limited =
to
 the utility part only and not beyond that. I have no knowledge about wh=
ether past life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledge about an=
ything whatsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowledge of the=
 THAT...The Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sen=
se of the term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still contin=
ue with life irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. =
Though we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but =
it is the other way around, still we use sentences like "Sun rises in =
the east", "Sun sets in the west" etc. To keep life going, we kee=
p on continuing with activities which helps in keeping life go on...It is i=
n this sense that I'd mentioned about "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regress=
ion".</span></div>

<div><span></span> </div><div><span>One should not=
 comment about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life =
is full of infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we=
 just can not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited wa=
ys. Before anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=
 must first take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not m=
ean to say that if one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one=
 would definitely be convinced about the same. By saying that one shou=
ldn't make comments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that&nb=
sp;by doing so one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not o=
nly blind belief in religion and religious practices can be terme=
d as dogmatic but also in
 science if one loses the scientific temper.</spa=
n></div><div><span></span> </div><div><span>Proof of pudding is in eat=
ing it, all that I can say to the persons willing to address any of their p=
roblems. "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression" have immense utility for=
 those who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind=
. Those who are interested can read " Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Wei=
ss" to start with.</span></div>

<div><span></span> </div><div><span>T=
o respected Narasimha sir, I would like to inform that these are not "new a=
ge ideas". These were there much before in India.
 to cite concept of "Jaat=
i Smaran" of Jainism is one among them. Jainas used this technique of "Jaat=
i Smaran" to reinforce renunciation in the
 followers.</span></div><div><sp=
an></span> </div><div><span>To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform th=
at so far as my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be d=
one over phone, but however, there are so many problems which can be handle=
d even over phone. To cite one example - One girl was having one recur=
rent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she approached me for=
 the treatment. But due to my official engagements I was camping =
at a far off place for around 2 months. Her problem was getting worsen=
ed as it had  started affecting her professional career adversely=
. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone.=
 The phone session continued for around one and half an hour and she got re=
lieved from her that recurrent dream
 and also started improving her
 profe=
ssional life. Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.</span=
></div><div><span></span> </div><div><span>It all depends on the openn=
ess of the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. The universe i=
s much more than what we see,what we can see and what we can believe to see=

Namaste,<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">To add to the complexity of t=
he problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over simpli=
fied and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the s=
oul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a =
role to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a =
life where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and s=
hine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process=
. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need=
.<br clear=3D"none">

<br clear=3D"none">The Buddhists do not believe in th=
e existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our ide=
a of Atmah.
 Therefore
 their idea of reincarnation
 is very different. It =
is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together
 to =
give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegra=
ted and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these ca=
n coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can=
 simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. &=
nbsp; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, =
to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while anothe=
r part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a=
 Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his en=
ergy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnati=
ng in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with t=
heir philosophy.<br clear=3D"none">

<br clear=3D"none">Those philosophies =
which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only =
as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of
 debts/balan=
ces - rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. =
The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move in=
to a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of an=
y final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciati=
on of life and its processes.<br clear=3D"none">

<br clear=3D"none">But th=
e old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved=
 at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to anoth=
er and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul=
's influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body veh=
icle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique s=
oul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to=
 *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Li=
fe. </span><span><span> A Supreme Negation of life is 
not the ultimat=
e aim, it is only one among many possibilities.  If  moving into =
a state 
of complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitabl=
e aim,
 then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform com=
plex
 life-actions. </span>The law of Karma is here too, but it is not rest=
ricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the ide=
a of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the s=
oul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes th=
e karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and=
 real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have kille=
d hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did no=
t have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of t=
hose he had killed]. </span><span>Whereas those aspects of life 
where the =
soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by 
the law of rn=
abandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. </span></div><div style=
