Namaste Narsimha ji

First of all I want to thank you for putting the wonde=
rful documents on how to do Hawan. 
I started doing Krishna Hawan weekly fo=
r last 4 months by following your document, I must say that doing hawan imp=
roved sadhna in other aspects.

My question to you is that I read in some p=
urans that we should not do homam during Chaturmas period ( 4 months) as Lo=
rd Vishnu is sleeping. I wasn't sure so I stopped doing it. 

Do you also s=
top doing daily/weekly homam during these 4 months?

What is your recommend=
ation?

Thanks so much for guiding us.

Regards
Manisha
