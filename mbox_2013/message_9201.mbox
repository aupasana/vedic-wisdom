Subject: Deeper meaning behind celebrating 60th birthday like a marriage

Dear learned members

Is the age 60 not closer to vaanaprastham? Why repeat=
 the vows etc as we do on the occasion of marriage? Why not initiate the ma=
n (aged 60) and the woman (often a few years younger) into vaanaprastha?

B=
ut in the traditional sense, how can couples living in the West celebrate t=
his occasion? What is one can't find a priest? Does one do ayushya homam fo=
r oneself, the way one does Ganapathi homam?

Where would I find the requis=
ite procedures for ayushya homam? 

Please help.
