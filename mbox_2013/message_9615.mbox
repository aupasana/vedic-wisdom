 sure there too one can find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. <br=
><br>I have very little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfort=
unately have never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.<br><b=
r>However, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considere=
d to be of excellent potency for these kind of problems. This form of Bhair=
ava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is=
 also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References =
to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the=
 Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been invoked for centuries by followe=
rs of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spirits, and specially=
 during rituals
 of cremation ground. <br><br>The standard mantra is (there=
 are many variations of this mantra too, all are good):<span style=3D"font-=
weight: normal;"><span style=3D"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br><br>=
"Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om"<br><br><=
/span></span><span style=3D"font-weight: normal;"><span style=3D"font-famil=
y: Verdana, sans-serif;">Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should=
 be done in one sitting. And this should be continued daily till such time =
that there is some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a re=
ally genuine instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would=
 be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. Th=
ese days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of p=
ossession from a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a mu=
st for the one trying to help. So close family members, who live with =
the girl will
 have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam=
 manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra=
. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.<br><br>If=
 the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if pos=
sible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhai=
rava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the pr=
oblem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhaira=
va live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may=
 charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl =
to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temp=
le and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. Thi=
s is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what=
 came to my mind. <br><br>Hope this
 helps.<br><br>-Regards<br> Rajars=

>Namaste Sir,<br><br>A possession by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is alway=
s a very serious matter. For there are various classes and kinds and types =
of entities which can possess an individual and some of them can be downrig=
ht nasty.<br><br>Upayas are many. As so many different people have advised,=
 these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of them =
will actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors. B=
asically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind =
of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link for =
the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of ex=
actly what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can b=
e something as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), o=
r
 causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to such pos=
session by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where su=
ch entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. =
Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removing a=
nd handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, a=
nd the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate in o=
rder to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremel=
y malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an adept=
 in this, he/she may come to serious harm.<br><br>These things like removin=
g possession are specializations. These do not fall under the ambit of norm=
al sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, any sadhaka wit=
h even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every action has its =
repercussion and one must know well how to handle the same too. Again
 if a=
 spirit is removed by force before the time till which, based on previous k=
arma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individual, then that too =
starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pleasant consequen=
ces for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chai=
n.<br><br>[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some years ago who =
was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask hi=
s Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame for which t=
he spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmic link between =
the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice=
 the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promising good deeds fo=
r the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it w=
ould work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force h=
ad to be applied.]<br><br>Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who knows ex=
actly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the e=
vent the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra o=
f any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanu=
mana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficien=
t force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalis=
a may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may have to sp=
end 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/dete=
rmination to see this through to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep=
 a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the possessed indivi=
dual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possibl=
e. <br><br>Best of luck and may God help the family.<br><br>-Regards<br>&nb=

What about Kala Bhairava mantra? Can it be more efficie=
