Dear Durgesh,

Some random thoughts ...

Through the course of our day, we interact with many people. These people
really are not bothered about what you might or might not be interested in
... until it impacts them in some way.

We have diverse responsibilities to different people, institutions and
places. We have to figure out how to best follow our 'svadharma' in each of
these interactions. In some cases, we may also have to prioritize between
our various dharmas.

Doing sadhana like homam should not be a source of pride. It is not an
activity that everyone should magically 'like', or 'respect'. We are not
'better' people for having performed homam or other sadhana.

All of us sleep for many hours a day. If we give up a couple of hours of
that sleep, and do our sadhana at that time, does it really impact anyone
other than us? If we choose to give up the time that we spend doing
something for ourselves, does it really impact anyone other than us?

Often, we make bad choices in the name of sadhana. We keep doing activities
that we are attached to, and give up some other activities that we have
some amount of aversion to. This really reflects nothing more than our own
biases.

Something like homam necessarily impacts those close to you. You are giving
up some portion of time that you might spend with them. You are spending a
certain amount of money on some materials. Depending on your circumstances,
the smoke etc may physically impact others. Every one of us has to figure
out how to balance our desire to do sadhana with our other dharmic
responsibilities.

Like everything else, sadhana also presents an opportunity to inflate our
ego. When we do sadhana in a big way such that it is noticeable to others,
we are often trying to show off. We even try and fool ourselves. Real
sadhana is simple, and hidden away. It is only presented in public when it
serves some purpose.

Though we are experts at lying to ourselves, our spouses can often see
right through us.

sasneham,

    ajit
