Dear All Respected Members,

Namasthe

 

1.       I am very grateful for the time you all have taken to respond to my
earlier request pertaining to Rudraksha. As I perused through a number of
inputs from various members, what I concluded as a majority opinion is to
look for alternatives. In this light, I felt that if I could share the
jaataka raasi chart of my child, then perhaps it would give you all to fine
tune the exact alternatives. In that sense, I mention her Jaataka Raasi
chart as follows.

2.       Student's detail:  Born on 5th May 1995 at 1700 hrs. IST at
Mahendragarh, Haryana. Lat-long: 76 E 9' 0'', 28 N 17' 0''.

3.       I am so thankful for your precious information. Let me tell you the
condition of my student from the chart point of view. She is kanya lagna,
mithuna raashi, punarvasu nakshatra with surya in mesha. Her 4th and 7th
lord bruhaspathi is retrograde in 3rd (vrischika)(marana karaka sthaana).
This is a main cause for worry. Another factor for worry is, her 5th
(makara) lord Shaneeswara is in 6th house kumbha. So both 4th and 5th lord
viz bruhaspathi and shaneeswara respectively are not well placed, hampering
her cognitive ability. To compound the problem, Raahu is in 2nd house of
thula. I think this adversely affects her speaking ability, as she is not
fluent in communication; and also her formation of words and thoughts is not
sharp and precise but confused and incoherent.

To further add to the woes, 3rd (vrischika) lord of initiative mars is
debilitated in 11th house of karka. So she stays very lazy and slow to
respond or take initiative. She is suffering from severe anemia (hemoglobin
count only 5). But apart from all this, one plus point is, her lagna lord
budha is in 9th house of vrishabha, and shukra is exalted in 7th house of
pisces. 

 

She is an ardent Shivagaami(Shiva-Bhakta). She did tapasya for 12 hours
continuosly for 15 days, daily without any break, for the gaayathri jaapa
which I asked her to do 1 lakh times. She also does regular sandhya-vandhana
with sacred ash on forehead, despite her family scoffing at this.This is the
precise reason that I adopted her as my child-student, and have consciously
decided to help her overcome her cognitive limitations. I deeply and very
very humbly request all noble members to please help me in my noble pursuit
of making this child into a brilliant scholar so that she becomes a
contributor to the society, as blessed by  Shri Bharath Shastri Ji. I don't
have any words to say, what your vital guidance means to us. I just bow in
reverence and open my heart for the words of wisdom and guidance to help
this child please. Though I am trying my best, but I earnestly believe that
your experiences can be very valuable at this juncture.

 

"Thank you" seems little to convey my feelings and gratitude.

 

Deep Regards and Respect,

Kannan
