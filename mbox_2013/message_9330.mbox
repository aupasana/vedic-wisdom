Yes Phil, myself being a born explorer of the unknown, it would be fascinat=
ing to take up this spiritual quest for Apsaras, but I would have to move v=
ery cautiously on this path, keeping in mind all the helpful hints provided=
 by learned people here in this group, so as to avoid physical or mental ha=
rm. So,keeping my faith intact, I shall carry on with this, very carefully.=

and your concern for my welfare. Assuming Apsaras cannot come to us in phys=
ical form at all, then how is it that our Puranas are full of incidents lik=
e Rishis marrying Apsaras, Apsaras giving birth to children due to their ph=
ysical union with Rishis, etc.? Even some great kings are known to have had=
 the company of Apsaras. For example, Emperor Pururava was seduced by Urvas=
hi Apsara. She lived with him for one year, and then disappeared, leaving h=
im distressed. How all this can be explained? Any insightful ideas from you=
 learned ones pertaining to these incidents would be very helpful.
