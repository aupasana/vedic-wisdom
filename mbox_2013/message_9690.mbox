Namaste Sir,

=C2=A0
Where and how one is born is based on one's desires, w=
hether one has sufficient good karma to fulfil those desires and who one ha=
s rina with. It is not only what you did to others, but also what others di=
d to you that matters.
=C2=A0
Suppose a dog served a family well. Suppose i=
t saw its master while dying and thought of being a human being at the last=
 moment, it may be born as a human being and that family may have to serve =
that dog in new life as a human being.
=C2=A0
If a cow being killed by butc=
her wept at the last moment at its helplessness and wished it was a strong =
human being instead, it may be born as a human being (provided it has enoug=
h good karmas and/or karmik debts with humans - which is possible if severa=
l people enjoyed its milk for a long time and finally its flesh).
=C2=A0
It=
 is possible that many people in the world today are first time human being=
s. They may not be guaranteed a human birth in the next life.
=C2=A0

Best =
regards,
Narasimha

>Dear all gurus,
>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I heard that the souls =
which have the good karma in past lives will be born as human beings. But i=
f you observe the world past few years, very less people are doing the good=
 karma(may be i don't the what good or bad is but here what i thought good =
means which supports the dharma). So the people with good dharmic karma are=
 being lessened. But if you see the world population, It is getting increas=
ed day by day. These two are contradicting. So all respected gurus please c=
larify my doubt. Please forgive me if something wrong in ideas and narratio=
n.
