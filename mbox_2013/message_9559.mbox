This is what I do:
1) I do not reach Kavach, Keelak, Argala. Yes, there are=
 several people say with out reading Keelak, Argala, I would not get the re=
sult. But as such, I am trying to do homam with out worrying/wanting a resu=
lt. So, who cares!

2) Saptasati is split into 13 chapters or 3 charitras! =
I used to do one chapter/charitra per day.
Day 1: 1st chapter (15 min)
Day =
2: 2, 3, 4 chapters (15 min)
Day 3: 5 (10 min)
Day 4: 6 (5 min)
Day 5: 7 (5=
 min)
Day 6: 8 (8 min)
Day 7: 9 (5 min)
Day 8: 10 (8 min)
Day 9: 11 (10 min=
)
Day 10: 12 (5 min)
Day 11: 13 (5 min)

In 11 days, I will complete the Sa=
pthasathi once!
3) Now, I complete all chapters in 7 days:
Sun: 1-5
Mon: 6
=
Tue: 7
Wed: 8
Thu: 9
Fri: 10
Sat: 11, 12, 13

4) There are times when I do =
all 13 chapters on same day. Initially it used to take about 3.5 hours but =
now, I can do the same in 1 hr 45 min.

5) Initially, I actually did 1 chap=
ter per day.

Best regards,
Vijay
