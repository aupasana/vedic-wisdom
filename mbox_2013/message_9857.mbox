life or making someone else hallucinate that one remembered past life, is c=

There is a deep reason why Nature has built this mecha=

Hi Everyone=
,

 

I accidentally stumbled upon this page while searching for the meanin=
g of the Lakshmi Nursimha beeja mantra. I found a very mature and realistic=
 treatment of ghosts, paranormal beings and black magic.

 

http://www.ved=
a.harekrsna.cz/encyclopedia/ghosts_FAQ.htm

 

The summary of the FAQ is:

=
 

  - There are number of mantra's suggested. One of them is the Nursimha =
beeja mantra

      om hrim kshraum ugram viram Maha-Vishnum jvalantam sarv=
atho mukham
      Nrisimham bhishanam bhadram mrityu-mrityum namamy aham

 =
 - Playing Bhagvatgita in Sanskrit, keeping a Bhagvat Gita book in room hel=
ps

  - Doing some punya karya - e.g. chant Bhagvat Gita and donate the res=
ult to the ghost, so that it has enough punya to move on. This should be pr=
eferably done by the immediate family members.

 

It also suggests contact=
ing the following for help. The extract from the FAQ is: "There're many typ=
es of exorcism. It's officially performed e.g. by Roman-Catholic Church. It=
's also done in Orthodox Church. The simplest Catholic exorcism is a so-cal=
led release/liberation prayer which helps in easier cases. Every priest kno=
ws it. When it fails, a professional exorcist has to be approached. Catholi=
c exorcists are experienced and provide their services free of charge. Ever=
y diocese has one and a local priest should be able to provide contact.".

On a personal note, my maternal grandmother was very attached to my mom =

Namaste Sir,

 

I=
 live in greater Boston. I am not aware of any priests in this area who can=
 fix this. I know a priest who did these things before, but he is in India.=
 I was unable to contact another Boston priest related to him, who I suspec=
ted could take care of this.

 

People may give you various mantras for th=
is purpose. But they may or may not work. If Tendulkar or Dhoni tells you h=
ow you can play a good shot on a particular kind of ball, you may not be ab=
le to play that shot right away. Even if it is an easy shot, it may take a =
lot of practice for you to get it right. Even with mantras, one needs enoug=
h focused practice for them to work for one.

 

In general, it is far easi=
er (relatively) to fix weakness of mind and protect it, before it reaches a=
 crisis point like this. Hanuman, Bhairava, Chandi, Narasimha - so many dei=
ties can be worshipped for this purpose. However, fixing it after it reache=
s a crisis point requires someone who has enough shakti and knows how to di=
rect it.

 

Some replies referred to saints/swamis who are very pure/eleva=
ted etc. Even if one is pure or elevated, one may not necessarily be able t=
o help. This really requires some shakti and the ability to direct it for t=
his specific task.

 

Though I live in the area, I am not capable of doing=
 anything personally. However, if anybody in troubles like this is interest=
ed and visits me, I can give some ash from my daily homam of divine Mother.=
 They can apply it on the forehead of the person everyday. Of course, I don=
't know if it will help in any way.

 

If interested, please send a privat=
e email to pvr108@....

Namaste Sir,

I don't know about foreign c=
ountries. I am sure there too one can find good exorcists, maybe not of our=
 religion. 

I have very little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infac=
t unfortunately have never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till dat=
e.

However, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is conside=
red to be of excellent potency for these kind of problems. This form of Bha=
irava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He =
is also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. Reference=
s to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of t=
he Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been invoked for centuries by follo=
wers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spirits, and special=
ly during rituals of cremation ground. 

The standard mantra is (there are =
many variations of this mantra too, all are good):

"Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapa=
d Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om"

Generally, at least 10/11 mala=
s of the same should be done in one sitting. And this should be continued d=
aily till such time that there is some visible relief. One more thing is th=
at, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit possession, as far as I=
 have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist=
 from a distance. These days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti=
 to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physical presence in front o=
f the victim is a must for the one trying to help. So close family members,=
 who live with the girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go through the =
Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas wi=
th this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that e=
asy.

If the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them=
, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vat=
uka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest statin=
g the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas o=
f Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. =
They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and t=
he girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside =
the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually benefi=
ted. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wr=
ote what came to my mind. 

Hope this helps.

-Regards
 Rajarshi

The doctors themselves are treating this as psychiatric c=

Do you know of any particular Kali, Bhairav or=

Namaste Sir,

A possession by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is alwa=
ys a very serious matter. For there are various classes and kinds and types=
 of entities which can possess an individual and some of them can be downri=
ght nasty.

Upayas are many. As so many different people have advised, thes=
e all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of them will =
actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basica=
lly, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind of sp=
irit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link for the s=
ame is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of exactly=
 what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be som=
ething as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or cau=
sally entering into their territory and being susceptible to such possessio=
n by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where such ent=
ities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatev=
er be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removing and han=
dling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the=
 amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate in order t=
o remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely male=
volent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an adept in th=
is, he/she may come to serious harm.

These things like removing possession=
 are specializations. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. =
Unless one knows well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic=
 common sense would do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion=
 and one must know well how to handle the same too. Again if a spirit is re=
moved by force before the time till which, based on previous karma, it was =
supposed to be in possession of the individual, then that too starts a new =
karmic chain which will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the p=
erson who tried to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.

[Reminds =
me of a particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in ex=
orcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell hi=
m about the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would sta=
y in possession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the =
victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leav=
e the body of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in ret=
urn. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cas=
es where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]
=

Best thing to do is a) find someone who knows exactly how to deal with spi=
rit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not poss=
ible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably B=
hairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are=
 better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time.=
 Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on=
 the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with a=
ny sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this thro=
ugh to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copp=
er pot, and then either make the possessed individual drink the water or sp=
rinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. 

Best of luck and may =
God help the family.

-Regards
 Rajarshi

> >Recently I was staying=
 at an old house in a village. I had trouble falling asleep, because I coul=
d hear strange noises - creaking and something moving in the attic. I'm ver=
y sensitive to different energies - I don't see anything, but I feel whethe=
r something divine or rather evil is present in a certain place. That place=
 didn't feel good to me.
> >
> >I was staying there for 10 days and every n=
ight I would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I cou=
ld see them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I=
 would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could defi=
nitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight=
 to see nothing.
> >
> >This doesn't seem like sleep paralysis to me - I in=
stantly become fully aware and I can move my body.
> >
> >Can it be that sp=
irits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people =
staying at that place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it's=
 not just me.
> >
> >On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place b=
efore going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep proper=
ly.
> >
> >Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at hom=
e, feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in=
 height, I've seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of the=
 strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.
> >
> >Is there any=
 mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? Some=
thing that I can chant before going to sleep. This has been bothering me fo=
r some time now and it interferes with my life.
