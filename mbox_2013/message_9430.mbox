>From Hinduism came Buddhism and Jainism then came Christians and Islam.
Jainism and Buddhism killed as many as Islam and Christians killed. Since
Islam
Followers are killing in front of our eyes we are treating them as
terrorists etc. What I have written here is 100% true and lots of back
papers could be 
Shown as examples.
It is nothing to do with any ism for killing people. There are two kinds of
people one is tolerant another is intolerant. That is all. Every religion
has these people some are showing up now some showed earlier times.

Namaste Svarupa,

If one particular religion has existed and propagated by the virtue of the
sword, then should solution be more violence?  Isn't this contradictory?

	Yes there were some tolerant sufi saints, but what percentage of
muslins are they?
	Do we respect something because 10% of its members are tolerant?
	How much destruction and killing has islam brought?
	How much killing and destroying did mahammad do himself to spead
"the right religion"?
	
	I have no problems with other traditions/religions/path because,
other then a few encounters here and there, they can coexist together. This
	is not the case with islam. If you need examples, take a lot at how
other traditions/religions/paths are treated in any of the islamic
countries.
	
	Take care

		Namaste friends,
		 
		As the reaction below demonstrates, intolerance
promotes/begets intolerenace.
		 
		There are several sufi saints who did not talk about killing
infidels and showed great love and compassion for god and for ALL creations
of god. Some even accepted and worshiped Hindu deities. Yet, when someone
speaks of "Allah", it elicits this reaction!
		 
		I do not want to comment on whether this reaction is correct
or incorrect. After all, everyone acts uniquely based on one's conditioning
and cumulative life experiences. Moreover, I am not really a scholar on
Islam and am not familiar with various interpretations of Quran and other
scriptures of Islam.
		 
		But, all I want to say is that intolerance feeds intolerance
and love feeds love. You react to someone's intolerance with further
intolerance and that will make them react to you with further intolerance.
And so on. Unfortunately intolerance spreads much faster (like a wild fire!)
than does love.
		 
		Aparna ji, nice composition! There is something natural,
pure and beautiful about it..
		 
		Best regards,
		Narasimha

			Is this the same allah that wants to kill all the
infidels/non-believers and
			wants everyone to show absolutely no tolerance to
other's beliefs?

				Ney
				
				An empty, hollow, reed flute,
				I must become a Ney.
				So that through me unimpeded,
				Divine music Allah can play.
				
				But the wretched stubborn mind
				Must always have its own way.
				And the six enemies fight within,
				Desperate to stay.
				
				Allah none reaches You,
				Save through Your infinite Grace,
				Of the undivine now,
				Let there be no trace.
				
				Lord, the Spirit is willing,
				Though the flesh is weak.
				This life is irksome and,
				The journey long and bleak.
				
				Yet there is no room for despair,
				When one is Your own child.
				You redeemed Mira and Kabir,
				Why shall You leave the rest behind?
				
				You defeated the enemies,
				Within countless Saints of yore.
				They can be performed yet again,
				Those feats achieved before.
				
				Yea surely You shall not abandon,
				Your worthless devotee.
				Lacking in faith and intellect,
				Filled with hypocrisy.
				
				For Your compassion knows no bounds,
				And embraces one and all.
				Your Love holds the Universe,
				Ever in its thrall.
				
				Wide as the sky is Your heart,
				Limitless as the ocean is Your love,
				That ever redeems the lowly,
				And raises them up above.
