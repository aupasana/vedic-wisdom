Dear Friends,

I want to recite Dhoomavati Kavacham. But somewhere I read that one should
not pray Mahavidyas without being initiated from proper guru. So I am bit
apprehensive of bad results.

My aim is general well-being and moksha.

Do I still need to be initiated ?

If not, then is there any day I should start doing it ?

Thanks in advance
Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
