Dear Digamber,

When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was a=
ppointed by the
courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, it was poss=
ible for a
beggar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose karma is this?

=
Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king,
=
and all the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.
=

Everything is interrelated. The beggar's karma made him a king. The
elepha=
nt's karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The
minister'=
s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And
the citi=
zens' karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the
result.
=

The sanskrit word "shaapa" means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the=

curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are actually
blessi=
ngs. At the end of the day, some people with a certain amount of
purity of =
speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.

When it comes to peopl=
e and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an
assumption. We assume that =
there is a person, and separate from the person
are his many karmas. These =
karmas can 'come' to the person from time to
time. We then want someone to =
come and remove all the "bad" karmas from our
karmic pipeline.

Vasishtha t=
eaches us that a 'person' and 'karma' are the same thing. You
are your karm=
as. And you are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your
vaasanaas. In ot=
her words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.

If you can change your vaasanaa=
s, you have changed your karma. Or course,
that is easier said than done.

=
Any moment when your mind becomes quiet is a blessing. Any moment when your=

mind becomes agitated is a curse. As sadhakas, we run after quieting the
m=
ind !

sasneham,

   ajit

Dear Narasimha Ji,<br>
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 I was pondering over fe=
w things we routinely come across as a part of worship and how it manipulat=
es karma pipe line,<br>
(1) When someone gives a `curse' or does a pray=
oga such as `maran' or `uchhatan' what happens to a person who is a=
t receiving end, does his bad karma comes forward or is it a new parabdha t=
hat is created. I vaguely remember Vimalananda mentioning something about a=
 Saint's curse in Aghora trilogy.<br>


(2) On similar note, what happe=

ross lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka=
 Ganapati =96 what do this items really do if they work? Something similar =
with wearing gemstones for planets =96 do they bring forward good karmas or=
 they create new ones?<br>


(3) I recollect an episode from famous "G=
urucharitra" (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady =
cried out to Shri Guru "If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we=
 worship God at all". At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead hus=
band, but later tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma fro=
m next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am =
trying to recollect this episode from old memory]. So question I have is, d=
oes our sadhana change karmaphal to a great extent or it is just our percep=
tion that changes?<br>


Thanking you,<br>
