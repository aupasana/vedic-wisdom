Dear Ramakrishnan,

> I have been feeling hindered in my spiritual progress due to the feel of
the sacred thread on my body during my sadhana.


 If you feel that the sacred thread hinders you, your clothes and
underclothes must really, really hinder you. I'm partly joking, and partly
serious.

Search google for "ramakrishna sacred thread", and click on the book result
for "ramakrishna and his disciples". Don't just read the first 1 or 2
paragraphs. Keep reading to understand this episode in context.

Narasimha has previously written on this topic (see the link below). If you
search the archives, you will definitely find other discussions as well.

sasneham,
