Namaste,

I'm really enjoying this thread detailing various mantras of my L=
ord Ganapathi!=A0 Can I please request our esteemed moderator to comment on=
 the following mantra that I was taught by a priest years ago:

HARIDRA GAN=
APATI:-
Om Hum Gum Glaum Haridra Ganapataye Varavarada Sarvajana Hrudayam S=
tahmbaya Stahmbaya Swaha

The priest who taught me this mantra did not prov=
ide any "explanation" and I didn't even think to ask at the time=A0 I was j=
ust happy to receive the mantra.=A0 For me it was like getting a present.=
=A0 Years later another priest told me "Oh, that mantra is to get a good hu=
sband".=A0 Now I must confess that even after years of reciting that mantra=
, Lord Ganesha has not brought me a good husband.=A0 But, being that I am a=
 male myself, I don't feel the least bit disappointed.=A0 

Still...I would=
 like to know your thoughts.

Many thanks!
