Thank you very much Rajarshi. I will relay this to the parents of the victim. Even the parents wish to take her to India,  but for the time being the victim is just to unstable to travel calmly on such a long plane journey.<br><br></div><div id="yiv60047664761329960663731-sig-id">Thanks, <br>Bhupendra </div><br><hr><div><b>From:</b> "rajarshi nandy" <rajarshi14@...><br><b>To:</b> "wisdom" <vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com><br><b>Sent:</b> August 10, 2013 2:17 PM<br><b>Subject:</b> Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)<br></div><br>

      <div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Namaste Sir,<br><br>I don't know about foreign countries. I am sure there too one can find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. <br><br>I have very little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.<br><br>However, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency for these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been invoked for centuries by followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spirits, and specially during rituals
 of cremation ground. <br><br>The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this mantra too, all are good):<span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"><br><br>"Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om"<br><br></span></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting. And this should be continued daily till such time that there is some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the one trying to help. So close family members, who live with the girl
 will
 have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.<br><br>If the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. <br><br>Hope this
 helps.<br><br>-Regards<br> Rajarshi<br><br></span></span><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span><br></span></div><div> </div><div><span style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;"><br></span></div><div><i><b><div class="yiv6004766476MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;"><b><span class="yiv6004766476Apple-style-span" style="font-size:16px;"><b><span class="yiv6004766476Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(153, 153, 153);"></span></b></span></b><span class="yiv6004766476yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950">I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, /</span> Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.</span><b><span style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;"> -Sri Aurobindo</span><span

Namaste. Rajarshri,</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for your detailed response. I did post a request a few weeks ago asking if people around Boston area in US knew of any exorcist. But unfortunately received no response. So again I ask if someone knows of a good priest around Boston area, please let me know. Until then, I have to go with. The diagnosis of 2 independent remote healers in India who came to the same conclusion,using that this was a case of possession.  But none of the two have been able to do anything about it so far. They both say that this is an entity that keeps revisiting the little girl.</div><div><br></div><div>The doctors themselves are treating this as psychiatric case. Don't know what is true and what is not as no one has been able to help including the doctors.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you know of any particular Kali, Bhairav or Panchmukhi Hanuman mantra which they could recite? I could advice that they learn this
 and
 recite as u have advised.</div><div><br><div id="yiv6004766476-sig-id">Thanks, <br>Bhupendra </div><br><hr><div><b>From:</b> "rajarshi nandy" <rajarshi14@...><br><b>To:</b> "vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com" <vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com><br><b>Sent:</b> August 10, 2013 4:01 AM<br><b>Subject:</b> Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)<br></div><br>

      <div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">Namaste Sir,<br><br>A possession by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For there are various classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individual and some of them can be downright nasty.<br><br>Upayas are many. As so many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be something as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.<br><br>These things like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to handle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.<br><br>[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]<br><br>Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very end.

      <div>Thanks, I will give it a try!<br>
<br>
What about Kala Bhairava mantra? Can it be more efficient for a long-time Shiva devotee? I've heard that it can repel spirits and ghosts. Can I chant these mantras at night before going to sleep?<br>
