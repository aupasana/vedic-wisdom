Dear Hari,

Thanks for the nice story.


>> It usually takes me 15 minutes =
to complete 28 times recital silently and
without lip movement. By this tim=
ing, I really wonder how much 20-30 japas
x 108 times per japa recital must=
 have taken!


If we look at traditional texts, the sandhya time starts two=
 ghatikas, or
two nadikas before sunrise, i.e. 48 minutes before sunrise, a=
nd it ends
with the onset of sunrise. So, in general, we can assume that ab=
out 48
minutes was spent in this particular japa at each sitting. At a mode=
rate
pace, it is possible to complete 500 repetitions in that time.

I am n=
ot suggesting that you speed up, or change anything ... but a half a
minute=
 per repetition is very slow. Personally, at that speed, I would end
up "si=
nging" the mantra.

sasneham,

   ajit
