Namaste,

That's a very good point. No sense in accumulating new karmas whi=
le trying to demolish the existing ones. I fully agree that one should avoi=
d becoming complacent- life is indeed short and uncertain. I guess the conc=
lusion is to do as intense a sadhana as possible every day. Or if one belie=
ves that God does everything through one- including sadhana- then one can p=
ray to God "let the sadhana be of the intensity and nature that is pleasing=
 to You." Sadhana is likely to flow better if one thinks God is ultimately =
doing it through me (though it feels like 'I' am doing it). I have to try a=
s hard as I can but it helps to remember I'm not really in charge. To devel=
op this feeling I think it helps to remind oneself that this body through w=
hich we do things runs on a heart, lungs, brain and other vital organs that=
 we are clearly not voluntarily controlling. Clearly Nature/God has set the=
se in motion. And similarly one can infer that He also keeps the mind and '=
I' sense going. (Am in the middle of a second night shift so apologies for =
any rambling- am a bit short of sleep this week). Your point makes a lot of=
 sense - couldn't agree more.

Warm regards,

Aparna
