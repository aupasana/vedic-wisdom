God is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towards those who =
praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness to the play of=
 actions and
 fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that impartially a=
nd impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this play of ac=
tions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil=
 persons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced delive=

; The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline and will =
give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, with some=
 effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing is t=
o not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, selfish =
actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and se=
lfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are goo=
d karmas.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> When it comes to manipulating the pr=
e-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort=
 and current
 action, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are availa=
ble in shastras, but we can't be certain about the specific impact of each =
action. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has=
 to be commensurate with the karma itself.<BR>> =C3=82 <BR>> You=

 from famous "Gurucharitra" (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just wid=

trying to recollect this episode from old memory]. So question I have is, d=
