Namaste Guruji,

I was unaware of this fact so I did perform Satynarayan Vr=
atam and Vishnu
Sahasranam Homam yesterday. I want to share my experience d=
uring homam.

First of the all, the agni was getting started even after bur=
ning several
camphors. I had to really struggle to begin the homam. Even Di=
ya was also
not lighting because my wife different kind of fabric in the wi=
ck. And I
had small quarrel with my wife on this issue. So I didn't feel go=
od during
puja and homam.

After reading your post, I realized, I should no=
t have done that during
eclipse.

Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
