Respected Narasimha Ji..

Namaste !!

Since I was doing homam in room , alt=
hough door used to be open but walls of room has turned black ..I am not wo=
rrying about walls of room but some one came and said its a vastu defect as=
 all walls have turned black ...And I also have a water related thing (wash=
ing machine ) in that room whose outlet pipe goes to drain outside the room=
 ..(Connecting bathroom ). But I dont use washing machine when I do homam .=
..Its idle ..

So , I was in a doubt what should I do ??? Is it a defect th=
at walls of house shouldnt turn black ....

Also , does it matter the inten=
sity of Agni ...Big or Small in Homam..
in regards to burning of our condit=
ioning and karmas ..
 ..
If I put too less wood , I fear it will extinguish=
 ..If I put more wood , walls have turned black ..and this doubt never came=
 in my mind until I was told its a huge defect ..

Please Guide .

Thanks a=
nd Regards
