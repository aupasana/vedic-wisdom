There are several views on this and I know of a couple of them. A few years=
 ago while doing Shraadha for ancestors at Gaya in Bihar I was informed by =
the priest/paande that one can perform Shraadha ceremony for oneself while =
one is alive and this is done at Gaya.  It is possible for such services to=
 be available at Haridwaar also. This may be most suitable for those who do=
 not have children or a male child or those who know very well that their d=
escendants will not do these ceremonies once they pass on. 

Having said th=
e above, I also happened to come in contact with a highly evolved spiritual=
 saadhaka who was well versed in rituals and as per his tradition it was fo=
rbidden for him to do any tarpana for ancestors till his own father was ali=
ve.  In other words his father had responsibility to do Tarpana before him =
on behalf of the family. No again bear in mind that in this case the whole =
family is doing Saadhana and the father is doing tarpana regularly.
