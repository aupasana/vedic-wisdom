Namaste,
=C2=A0
Vaata, being a combination of air and ether, is an expansiv=
e state of being and can be ungrounding and destabilizing. Any big changes =
in lifestyle or in one's body-mind complex can aggravate vaata in people of=
 any dosha type. If one is already prone to vaata dosha, then it can be eve=
n worse.
=C2=A0<The use of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously com=
mon- I'm sure this does no good for vata.>

=C2=A0
Yes, it is a terrible id=
ea. It not only aggravates vaata heavily, but increases ama (toxic buildup)=
 in the system. Vaata is one big problem and ama is another, which mess up =
one's digestion and kill appetite. Once the digestive fire becomes weak, sy=
stem goes haywire and all other problems arise. Vaata pacifying food and he=
rbs in addition to a lifestyle that reduces toxic buildup may be helpful. D=
etoxification and things like panchakarma can be helpful. Simple habits lik=
e drinking hot Triphala tea every night can detoxify and make a big differe=
nce in overall well-being.

=C2=A0
<Can anti-psychotic medication be helpfu=
l/harmful in the kundalini 
patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems =
as "psychosis" and will 
advise anti-psychotics>
=C2=A0
Forget about one wi=
th Kundalini experiences that one could not handle/digest and in trouble no=
w. Even one with normal psychotic issues may not be well served by the toxi=
c combinations created by modern medicine, which I am afraid does not under=
stand "mind" as well as Ayurveda did. IMHO, ayurveda has better tools to tr=
eat problems of the mind. While herbs like Jataamaamsi, Shankhapushpi, Aswa=
gandha etc can do a good job of addressing the root causes of the instabili=
ty in the nervous system when administered properly, modern drugs only put =
"band-aids" on the symptoms arising from those root causes. One may do well=
 to locate a good ayurvedic doctor IMHO.

try job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems=

dhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in th=

her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been =
able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it m=

 this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. Ma=

 like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. An=
d let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ou=

safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the kundalini

      <div>That was an interesting read. But how i=
s a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Feat=
ures of both include similar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling t=
hings that others cannot experience- in other words, what doctors call "hal=
lucinations". Are these hallucinations or the result of kundalini derangeme=
nt- we have no diagnostic test. <br>
<br>
However most doctors are pretty g=
ood at detecting the attention-seeking 'fake' patients with pseudo-hallucin=
ations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and di=
fferent from the genuine "I hear voices in my head" schizophrenic or kundal=
ini patient. <br>
<br>
About vata, most of our patients have severe problem=
s with sleep and appetite. They are usually unable to sleep, umable to eat =
(poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. We try and help with this wit=
h medication and lifestyle advice. The use of Cannabis and other drugs is a=
lso notoriously common- I'm sure this does no good for vata.<br>
<br>
The G=
anapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do some on her behalf as (for ob=
vious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any patient. <br>
<br>
Can anti-=
psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalini patient? Most doct=
ors label kundalini problems as "psychosis" and will advise anti-psychotics=
 e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not harm them, though I d=
oubt it will help.<br>
<br>
Advice and thoughts from all members would be m=
uch appreciated.<br>

Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts=
 of purification of the various elements that compose the human mind-body s=
tructure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, more equan=
imity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - On=
ce and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self identi=
fy with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind =
is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very=
 helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open=
 up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some of which a=
re not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given half a c=
hance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of in=
hernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence =
constant Bhuta-suddhi
 becomes even more<br>
>  vital. 4 - While someday=
 or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekeni=
ng and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The h=
uman psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to =
deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an=
 individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us =
to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various reasons=
, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow fre=
e assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causi=
ng serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities=
 are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if=
 such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge =
to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing no=
thing more than an intelligent guess
 work.<br>

wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience o=
f a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been =
involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneou=
s awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-bo=
dy experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origi=
n and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searc=
hed for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically w=
rong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to derang=
ed kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as havin=
g a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has=
 triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. =
Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, a=
nd as we have no treatments for
 deranged<br>
>  kundalini, we struggle =
to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience=
 with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly =
wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering fr=
om the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is =
something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be t=
o her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manife=
sts as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cur=
e her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good s=
amaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not =
know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our =
sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is wh=
y the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be yo=
ur instrument" and leave the
