>>Dear Narasimha Ji and other members.For a long time I was having=
 a thought about creating a place for people to do homam outside their apar=
tments. After doing homam in apartment as well as in Homa kunda outside (we=
 built one at my native village), I felt big limitation when we do homam in=
 an apartment. One, there are limited items one can offer in fire due to it=
s size. Two, long duration homam invariably generates soot which eventually=
 goes all over the place. General disturbance if you want to do extended sa=
dhana with Homam. People staying abroad will have more issues due to fire s=
afety system also. Since I don't have any means of creating such a facility=
 at my current place in Bangalore, I thought I'll share this with other fol=
ks. If someone feels it is worth pursuing and has ability (anywhere in worl=
d), they are welcome to do so.My idea was to create a site, may be 50x50 or=
 100x100 sq ft, with 11 or 21 or 51 Homa Kunda (whatever practically
 possi=
ble). Anyone interested to do homam can come to this place anytime 24x7x365=
 days, do extended hours of homam or do 1-3-5-7 days sadhana. Bring your ow=
n stuff; spend as much as time day/night, evenings/mornings, whatever suits=
 you. The owner of the place may provide some basic needs if the site is ne=
xt to his house.Off course all this should not involve any money and should=
 be done with the sankalpa of one's spiritual progress or restoring Dharma =
in world (as Narasimha had told many times). Also, in my opinion the place =
should not be in temple premises as invariably people come with materials w=
ishes and pray. Well this is just a thought/wish; feel free to give your op=
inion. This concept could be helpful for people staying abroad too.With reg=
