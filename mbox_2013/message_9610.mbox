I guess the understanding of destiny and rebirth is totally flawed. For the=

spirit/atma there is no destination just an endless path from and to the
u=
niversal consiousness, also there is no differentiation of your
spirit/atma=
 or mine. Karma is bound only to the physical body through genes
and totall=
y plays only on your body and ego. Sadhana, bakthi etc. all tries
to use th=
e universal force to help your ego to break free of karma and seek
the para=
matma. The best of sadhanas and magic can only hasten/delay the
things in y=
our karma all the while making new karma. Thats why true gurus
are needed t=
o guide on what sadhanas should and will be fruitful based on
your karma. S=
wimming blindly in the ocean can probably take you somewhere
but it is not =
always the place you want to be.
