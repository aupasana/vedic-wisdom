could someone kindly send me the uthkeelanam and sabamokshanam mantras for =
navaakshari...i got initiated into this sadhana 20 years back...but lost to=
uch with the guru who taught me....and for whatever the reason...i simply c=
ouldnt finish a purashcharana...

i,m kind of taking it easy now...own time=
 own target...i,m aproaching it as prayer more than sadhana.....so if someo=
ne could give me the mantras i could keep at it...tnks...

and also i would=
 like the opinion of you guys on something thats been bothering me awhile..=
.i did a nadi reading with a siddhar some time back as my life has been run=
ning a bad cycle for the past 25 odd years and things are still not looking=
 up...and this sidhar is quite a famous guy and the nadi is supposed to be =
a jeva nadi...

so what he said was that i had a guru,s curse or guru sabha=
m and that no sadhanas or mantras would work for me and that even getiing 3=
 meals a day should be considered a raja yogam...and it seems that there is=
 no way to remedy such a thing...and i would have to go through it till its=
 over..

any ideas guys??my life is matching the reading...and i,m starting=
 to worry...i still keep at my practices though..whenever i can...simply ca=
use i enjoy it...i,m not expecting anything out of it..

your inputs would =
be appreciated...tnks...and god bless..
