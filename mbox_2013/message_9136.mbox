By Swami Chidananda Saraswati (disciple of Swami Sivananda, Rishikesh)

"Co=
mpassion, love of all, and kindness to all creatures is the practice of tru=
th. These constitute your real nature. These constitute the higher spiritua=
l part of you. Have, therefore, compassionate regard for your kith and kin,=
 parents and children, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbours."

"Wit=
hout this practice in your life, spiritual blessedness cannot come."

2Hars=
h speech, a sharp tongue, flashes of anger and annoyance that wound the fee=
lings of others should never be allowed. Happiness comes by increasing the =
joy in the lives of others. It comes to those who are centres of love, cent=
res of kindness and compassion, and who never entertain even remotely the t=
hought of hurting the least of God's creatures." 

"My Master says in a hum=
orous way, "Amidst all the uncertainties and insecurities of this world one=
 thing alone is certain=97you have to pass. You cannot remain here. This is=
 only a drama you are enacting. You have come from an unmanifest state into=
 an embodied, manifest state. Every second shortens the period allotted to =
you here. What that period is, no one knows. Every birthday which you celeb=
rate with so much happiness, with birthday cards, cakes and candles, takes =
one year away from the period allotted to you. Soon the allotted period has=
 to come to an end. Once again you will have to go back into that unmanifes=
t state where you will be disembodied, where you will have no personality, =
no name. You have to pass"."

"Life is very precious. Say, "I have come her=
e to realize the supreme state of blessedness and to experience the highest=
 bliss. I have been given this unique opportunity of a human birth and a hu=
man life in order to attain that Ultimate Goal"." 

"The chance is now give=
n. Who knows if the keen state of aspiration and receptivity to the highest=
 principle will last? Who knows if the keen state of devotion to the ideal =
will continue? Therefore, now is the time to make a supreme effort to reali=
ze the true purpose of life. Now is the time to make an earnest effort to a=
ttain the highest blessedness and the wondrous bliss of Realization."
