Namaste Ji

You can download the "English copy" manuals, which means that i=
n those manuals the mantras written are written in English. Then you can co=
py and paste the long words here in a message and we can try to split them =
up.

Thanks
Tanvir

ject: [vedic-wisdom] Splitting up of the long Sanskrit words in Homam manua=
l


  Namaste dear members,

  Two years ago, I came across Shri Narasimhaj=
i's website and was excited to discover the procedure for doing homams by y=
ourself. However, I felt quite intimidated, so I did not act upon them. Lat=
ely, I kept coming back to the site and decided to take it step by step to =
gain confidence, so I have started reading the text of Shri Maha Ganapathi =
homam till the word flow is fluent. I'm less intimidated by it now. I'm als=
o quite grateful to Shri Narasimhaji for making it available as I have been=
 wanting to do this for a long time. But am still not ready to start it. Th=
e reason is that certain words are so long that, to maintain a flow, I need=
 to split the word into bits that will help maintain the flow but need to k=
now where to split in order that I don't change the meaning of it. I'm foll=
owing the Sanskrit version. I want to include the words (a long list) in th=
e hope that one of you members can help me split them up in the right way, =
but my computer does not type the sanskrit words, nor am I able to copy and=
 paste the sanskrit word, it does not do allow it. How can I upload those w=
ords?

  Thanks very much,

  Alamelu
