 <div>Namaste Rakesh ji,<br>
Me not Narasimha, will try to write something =
which might interest you.<br>
<br>
Anyone reading this , can play this in a=
nother tab, to soothe your mind.<br>
<br>
<a rel=3D"nofollow" href=3D"http:=
//www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9R4hMUaymgc" target=3D"_blank">http://www.youtu=
be.com/watch?v=3D9R4hMUaymgc</a><br>
<br>
Sir, there is something about the=
se texts , that is imperative for these<br>
texts to really be of any meani=
ng to anyone. That is the "story" or the<br>
"myth" com=
ing alive "inside" of "you".<br>
<br>
Difficult concept=
 to put into words, at least for me.<br>
<br>
Let us consider Ms DS for exa=
mple, short for durga saptashati.<br>
<br>
It is a freaking long text!! at =
least for people who are initially<br>
starting out reciting it. But then t=
his the path that is not easy to<br>
begin with. And if it were easy, every=
body would be very successful with<br>
it, and not many are ( it all depend=
s on her and your madness)<br>
<br>
The main point with recitation is , tha=
t Ms DS comes "alive" "inside" of<br>
"you".<=
br>
The hell does that mean? It means that you visualize the chapters as<br=
>
they are.<br>
It means that your focus or the mind is not with the sexy g=
irl you saw<br>
in the mall, the quickfire reply you should have given to t=
he turd that<br>
slightly insulted you, or what payments you have to collec=
t tomorrow<br>
from the bank etc etc. And neither it should be somewhere si=
nging songs<br>
and just waiting for this text (DS) to end.<br>
<br>
Believ=
e you me , Rakesh ji it is tough. Insanely tough to get the mind<br>
fixed =
or visualizing the fight and all the carnage/beauty that is there<br>
in DS=
. And what aids to the fun, is if you don't know sanskrit. Ha!!<br>
<br=
>
You may know how to read the devanagri script, but dont really know what<=
br>
it means, then the real fun starts. So you are reciting a text, but<br>=

can't really visualize it because you just don't know what the hel=
l it<br>
means or what are you reading!<br>
<br>
There is a solution to tha=
t, you will need to read, re-read and re-read<br>
one chapter at a time and=
 tie in the hindi translation or an<br>
interpretation with the sanskrit te=
xt above. It will take time, an this<br>
is not a one day process. It might=
 take years or days , and varies on a<br>
case to case basis.<br>
<br>
I th=
ink the video would have ended in the other tab by now, you can play<br>
th=
is now.<br>
<br>
<a rel=3D"nofollow" href=3D"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=
=3DHReN67juhCg" target=3D"_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHReN67ju=
hCg</a><br>
<br>
Let us take Chapter 10 for example,<br>
in the beginning f=
o the chapter, once he sees that his brother is dead<br>
Gunda no 2 ( (Mr s=
humbh bhai) shouts at madameji for cheating and<br>
relying on various othe=
r ladies  for killing his brother in crime gunda<br>
no 1 ( Nishumbh bhai )=
 and cheating, and madame-ji replies with aww,<br>
those all were actually =
me and merges all the forms back and shows him.<br>
<br>
Now , when you get=
 to the tenth chapter, this visualization should be<br>
there ,when you rea=
d the specific verses about this incident and not be<br>
thinking about oh =
my god when will this end I am tired and mere paise us<br>
kutte harami ke =
paas pare hain aur woh nahin de raha hai.<br>
<br>
Over a period of time wh=
en you repeatedly visualize the entire story<br>
along with the reading, th=
en will it one day come alive inside of you<br>
and teach you further, beca=
use there are layers upon layers upon layers<br>
of meaning there and it wi=
ll be slowly taught very serenely depending on<br>
her wish and judgement.<=

"If one has to do 108 times sapatsh=

br>
<br>
If you can manage one good reading with a nice visualization going=
 on,<br>
it will be much better than 108 times of just rushing through with=
 it.<br>
<br>
1] diet ,<br>
You will want to keep it as light as possible, =
khichri does the trick,<br>
you will need all the "inner fire" fo=

a limited resource, so the more heav=
ier food you have the more it will<br>
be used for digestion and potty prep=
aration.<br>
<br>
2] can it be recited in 2 or 3 sittings in a day<br>
No p=
roblems in that, but decide the routine before you committing to<br>
madame=
- she just does not like people backing off.<br>
<br>
3] if few words are n=

Bhaiyo, 13 hi karlo theek thaak focus=

Anyways if anyone =

Its all training and the amount of hard work that you put in, in a=
