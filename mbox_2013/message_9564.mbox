=C2=A0 
Dear Sir,=C2=A0

How are you? My name is Shathish and im from Malay=
sia. Im currently 28 years old and single. I came across of your Ganapathy =
Homam video couple months a ago and it caught my attention seriously =C2=A0=
until it became my passion to perform it.

I went and consulted few priest =
in the temples and most of them discouraged me as they told me i need to le=
arn the manthars and im not eligible for it. Moreover, i went through many =
obstacles to perform this Ganapathy Homam for the last 6 months. Finally, u=
pon God`s grace i managed to prepared myself for it smoothly and came up to=
 conclusion to perform this Ganapthy Homam =C2=A0for 60 days. As for this t=
he protocols are being setup such ways below;
-Renting a house separately f=
or 2 months
-Bought all the materials needed for the Homam
-Fasting with br=
eakfast one type of fruit and milk(eat after served in front of Lord Ganesh=
a during Homam). Lunch would be one small plate of steamed Green Gram and d=
inner would be one fruit and one tumbler of cow milk. All this will be cook=
 and prepared my ownslef as im staying alone
-Sleeping using a mat and pill=
owed with paper wrapped with dhoti
-No entertainments such as movies, radio=
 stations, cinemas, smoking, consuming alcohol, etc.
-Only listen to Bhajan=
s, Manthras and read Hinduisme articles
-Wearing Malai( a type of holy chai=
n worn around during fastings) to control all my senses
- No cutting finger=
 nails and hair for this 2 months
-Wash my own clothes


The procedures app=
lies the same of yours from the beginning till the end. yhe additional part=
 is the manthars as flow below;
-Ganapathy Shodaspachara with Narayana Sukt=
ham (16 services)
-Ganapathy Moola Manthra 12X ( Aum Gam Ganapathye....)
-G=
anapathy Moola Manthra 12X ( Aum Gajanam Tuah Ganapatim Hava..)
-Ganpathy S=
totram 3X
-Ganapathy Atharavaseerasham 3X
-Ganapathy Kaari Sakti Malai 21X
=

I bought all the additional materials needed such as honey,sesame seeds, s=
ome murmura, some nuts,popped corn and other materials that can be offered =
in fire. for the daily basis i buy flowers and arugumpul (sacred grass for =
Lord Vinayaka)Moreover, for Poornahuti i will put a whole cocunut with few =
coins, 9 navaganis(types of beans used for prayers), coins, and with vibuth=
i, kunkumum, sandal wood powder, turmeric powder, etc.

I have full support=
 from my parents. They like pillars to me in this matter. In fact i do have=
 a Brahmin Iyer childhood friend who clears my doubt when it comes to Ganap=
athy Homam. He is the one who prepares all the dharbas for me, teaches me o=
ther important about Homam, teaches me how to maintain the fire. Additioanl=
ly, he is the one who suggest me to put water Pot and bath with it every mo=
rning. All this happens because of Lord Ganesha. In fact, my family, friend=
s, and other are astonished of my actions. I took 6 months to learn all the=
 manthars and actions of this homam from the manual and the videos.

Even t=
hough i fall easily tired because im working and fasting but in the end it =
gives me a kind of pleasure and self-satisfaction of the Homam completion.I=
ts just sometimes the intonation and the pronunciation compared to yours wi=
ll be different. Sometimes the coconut that i put for Poornahuti will not c=
rack till end. Sometimes i miss certain rituals. These are things actually =
makes me upset because i want to do it perfectly. Whatever it is, my devoti=
on to LORD GANESHA is divine.

As im sending this email to you today it has=
 been 21 days of performing the Ganesha Homam and 39 days to go on. On the =
56th day of this Homam will be the VInayagar Chathurti day which falls 9th =
September 2013. Im doing this =C2=A0as iam not expecting much from this out=
come rather want to challenge myself from being discipline and after the 60=
th day i want my life to have better enhancement and all ways.

Finally wha=
t i would like to extend is my gratitude to you is there is no common word =
as THANK YOU to you as you have taught me something which is been hiding fo=
r thousands of years from eye of public. Every beginning of the Homam i thi=
nk of you and your family in well-being, off course Dr. Manish Pandit, all =
the Gurus,Pandits, =C2=A0Rishis, Mahans, Munis, Thevargals, etc.


Thank Yo=
u so much Mr.PVR Narasimha Rao.

Keep in touch :)

Regards,
Shathish Rengay=
an
Selangor, Malaysia.
