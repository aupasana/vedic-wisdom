NAMASTE

The process of performing pitri tarpana is very very easy and simp=
le as described by respected P.V.R... thanks for unveiling such a simple  s=
cript...

Effects are sure to understand, there is a peace of mind after do=
ing it for the first time... 

On AMAVASYA... its perfect day for pitri tar=
pana... I have done it and little bit excited...

Some questions are in min=
d on this occasion... if anybody have the answer...

1. Is it permissible t=
o light incense stick and light a lamp?
2. Anything more?

Biswajit
