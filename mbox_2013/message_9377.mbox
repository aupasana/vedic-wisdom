i am not a big expert but i do know that only some deities can be invoked=
 irrespective of the physical purity. the bed / bedding/ unwashed clothes e=
tc are all considered impure. you can only do upasana of tara mahavidya lyi=
ng on bed. there are other forms of some deities you can safely do lying on=
 bed. this wll also count towards mantra purushcharana. 
if you do manasika=
 japa then it is believed the physical condition does not matter no matter =
where you are. this is also known as ajapa japa. the secret behind is that =
death can come anywhere (even if you are in the toilet). hence you can do m=
antra japa but typically this is mot counted  towards purushcharana of a ma=
ntra. the benefits of ajapa are immense and is beneficial for kundalini awa=
kening. a sadhaka must at all times do the ajapa of his/ her moolamantra.  =
there is no harm but the merit is somewhat slower. thats all. 

if you must=
 lie down amd do japa i would advise using a straw mat and a washed dhoti /=
 saree instead of plllow and avoid reused / unwashed linen..
