Namaste Gurujan,

I recently shifted to new apartment. Here I have put temple in North
direction of the house and in the balcony.

I have put it in balcony mainly because of space constraint. And another
reason is to avoid blackening of walls due to regular homam.

Is this placement permissible ?

Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
