Namaste Sir,
=A0
<<in gita krishna says follow svadharma, while in bhairava=
 stotram by 
sankaracharya he is described as svadharma marga nashakam , co=
uld you 
please explain this conflict, if you have the time.>>

=A0
Great q=
uestion! Hoping you don't mind, I am forwarding this reply to vedic-wisdom =
yahoogroup.

Yes, Sri Krishna did advise following swadharma (one's own =
dharma) at the beginning of Bhagavad Gita. But he also said in the last cha=
pter "Roundly give up all dharmas and surrender unto Me". When Bhairavashta=
kam says "swadharma maarga naashakam", it is getting at the same idea!
=A0
=
Based on who we are, our background, our deep desires and debts from the pa=
st (which we may not even remember now), and our current skills and resourc=
es, we all have our own personal (individual) dharmas (duties). We must ful=
fill those.
=A0
But performing swadharma is the start of sadhana. Eventuall=
y, one should be able to perform swadharma without attachment to its fruits=
 and later without even the sense of doership! Then comes a stage when one =
is not even attached to the idea that "this is my dharma. I must do this". =
Whatever Nature has placed one in a position to do, one does it detachedly,=
 with neither sadness/disappointment nor with happiness/excitement, but wit=
h the spirit of "this is what Supreme Lord is doing through me at this inst=
ant". One overcomes the notions that "I am so and so. I need to do so and s=
o", gives up one's own will and flows like a light leaf in the wind of sams=
ara. Wherever one flows and whatever objects one touches, one sees it as th=
e will of Supreme Lord and has no notions of one's own will or one's own du=
ties. That is the state of liberated enlightenment.

=A0
Bhairava is extoll=
ed in Bhairavashtakam as the one who brings that state. Krishna also teache=
s to get to that state, but he does so in the last chapter of Bhagavad Gita=
. Before you get there, however, you may have to follow the instructions in=
 previous chapters!
=A0
A lot of modern Hindu philosophy taught by many mod=
ern gurus, especially of the Vedantic bent, is based on the final target ra=
ther than the path(s) one needs to walk, to get to the target. It assumes t=
hat you are already close to the target. It ends up misleading and creating=
 wrong notions in unprepared sadhakas like "all is delusion", "everything i=
s the same", "what you do does not matter". The greatness of Bhagavad Gita =
is that it talks about the path(s) as well as the target and has something =
relevant to everyone.

=A0
Best regards,

Narasimha
