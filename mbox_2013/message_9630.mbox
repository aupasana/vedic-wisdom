Namasteji,

Thank you very much for your reply, I will check this out. Than=
k you so much for the manual, I hope with your blessings, I get full courag=
e to do it finally, after two years of yearning.

Meanwhile, not being sati=
sfied with earlier attempt, I just had an idea of highlighting in yellow th=
e sanskrit words I needed help with, in the pdf file from pages 12 to 27. I=
 was able to do that and save as a new file. But the question is, how can I=
 attach that file?

Thank you,

Alamelu
