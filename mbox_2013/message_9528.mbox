'Suffering'

Music for Background -
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DRRoYWo=
3NHxI
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DRRoYWo3NHxI>

Advisory - chant. ( i=
n tune if you feel like it)

With the recent Uttrakhand "tragedy", a lot of=
 questions by pseudo
intellectuals everywhere were raised. Questions such a=
s " how could
'god' kill so many devotees ? ; if god is there then how coul=
d this
happen? Or is god really this cruel, or does god exist and blah blah=
."

God and prosperity don't always end up in the same equation. Do they?

=
First and foremost is a need to understand what this whole suffering
busine=
ss is all about and then dealing with it. When one is born here on
this pla=
net, there is no "suffering". As a child you don't know
jack-shit or even c=
are. If your father passes away, lets say when you
were 2, you would not si=
tting in a corner wailing to the world "My
father, My Father, My father, go=
d why????" ; like most adults would.
Count the number of "My's".

If the ca=
r is stolen, you are blissfully still sucking on your toy
nipple just like =
you were sucking when your father passed away. You
wouldn't go away and sho=
ut your ass off in a police station " My car, my
car, my car, those fucking=
 thieves I'll kill them."

Count the my's again.

In time "you" grow up and=
 start with all these "my's".
My house, my wife/husband, my child, my money=
, my phone , my investment,
my profit and more. Over a period of time you g=
ot trained that this is
you, this yours, that is theirs, behave this way, t=
alk this way, stand
this way etc etc etc.

Then all this suffering crept in=
.

For a human being, suffering comes in the form of --

     =95    Lack o=
f financial resources to satiate desires and need.
     =95    Loss of some=
one close/Death of a loved one
     =95    Being cheated upon ; because you=
 claimed someone as "yours"
or perceived them to be "yeh toh meri thi, yaa =
yeh toh mera tha"
     =95    Dreams and aspirations remaining unfulfilled.=

     =95    Lack of support from fellow human beings.
     =95    Partner =
looted you.
     =95    Physical disability or some other constraint.
     =
=95    and a few more scenarios - but not much different from the
above.

T=
rue Suffering is you being a turtle, and someone turned you on your
back, a=
nd you are stuck and want to just stand. It will take you 200
years to befo=
re you die and nobody will even stop once to turn you on
your legs. Just ki=
dding.

On an average life expectancy scale, we only live for barely 60 to =
70
years, and in that short time frame ,there is so much "suffering". It is=

such a convoluted mess, and it is preposterous to say the least.

Sufferin=
g is only limited to the surface personality or the body, and is
largely ba=
sed on perception. It usually stems from the basic belief of
"me,mine and m=
e again".

For example- if lets say you lose your arm in an accident, you w=
ill
still be alive and will be able to live your life barring a little
adju=
stment. Sure there will be something which you won't be able to
do,but then=
 you are still alive. This suffering is only limited to the
body, because i=
t was going to burn anyways , arm or not. True suffering
is when the actual=
 you "the being" is tortured beyond the body post
death.

We can't calculat=
e about anyone's suffering without actually accessing
the subtle body, wher=
ein one actually has access to all the shit that
one has done in so many fo=
rms. In short, no debates, no arguments,
astrologers(most), no nothing can =
answer the question "why?", till you
have access to your own account of Kar=
mas.

Now the question is why isn't access given? The law of karma is not a=

simple tit for tat 'karma is a bitch' theory in practice and if a
"being" =
is not sufficiently detached from the current personality, all
hell can bre=
ak loose because more and more self identification with
occur with previous=
 karma's. To access that account, the level of
detachment needed is akin to=
 death in the current birth. That only comes
with a strenuous amount of pen=
ance and wish/will of god.

Suffering is limited to the surface personality=
 which is false anyways,
and all joy, happiness and sadness is related the =
personality. Thus
making that joy, happiness and sadness also false.

Comin=
g to the Uttrakhand Tragedy, a lot of naysayers stated "look what
god has d=
one, haha we told you there is no god, if god were there,
couldn't he prote=
ct all his devotees? Why all the suffering?"

Death and god are two subject=
s that are one and the same actually, but
quite a lot of people want god, b=
ut don't wish to die. Sorry doesn't
work like that.

For the people on the =
ground (referring to kedarnath), it was death of
fellow human beings. We sh=
outed, cursed and abused, because you god, you
sitting up there, you took e=
verything from us, slam dunked an entire
town, killed our fellow beings. Yo=
u killer! And that you killed those
who came to worship you.

A fundamental=
ly flawed argument.

The real situation is far different from the one above=
, and cannot be
described with the view point of the limited self personali=
ty. The
debates are useless.

God can always show you that each and everyon=
e of those beings is still
alive, their personalities are not, their bodies=
 are not. But then
he/she/it won't, we don't deserve to see that.

You won'=
t buy this if you have lost a family member in there. That is
because "you"=
 believe yourself to be "you", and the attachment to that
specific personal=
ity, false anyways, is huge.

One might argue that logic is difficult to ac=
cept and apply, nobody ever
stated that it was easy. And yes it is incredib=
ly difficult, but
everyone has to pay, and pay you must.

Mr Saturn is blam=
ed in the most absurd manner worldwide for all the
mishaps that take place =
with people.
Shani aya , bhaago, Shani ki maa ki jai, mujhe chorr de please=
.

Kyun?

Mr Saturn has only one duty, that is to take you back to the
"sou=
rce",and for that wether  "you" have to go bankrupt, your valuables
stolen,=
 "you" being ridiculed humiliated, he doesn't; stop at nothing.
For him "yo=
u" can suffer for all you can, he at the end of the day is
looking at the r=
eal you (only a small light CFL) will thank him.
Everyone does.

Basic poin=
t is trying to reach god, in the process you lose your current
personality =
via suffering, and then only do you get to meet.

For Eg - in the Amarnath =
Yatra, do you take you car, your flat, your
entire luggage, your FD's , lap=
tops and everything else up there? You
leave it all behind.

Similarly, dea=
th of your personality is inevitable during this process,
and suffering is =
the only payment of your pending dues.

Since we perceive ourselves to be "=
Mr X, Ms X" and etc etc, we perceive
ourselves to be suffering.

There is o=
nly one way out , that is to go above and beyond this
personality, and that=
 is penance. Get Started today, who knows when the
reset button is hit and =
you are back again sucking the nipple and
restarting it all over again.

Ex=
ample---
Lets say your name is  Mr Yakashmai tokoshomoto.
Just kidding, let=
s say Mr Nexus.(it is an example)
You own 10 Crores, 2 flats, one car, smal=
l business, have a settled
family, good looking man, chicks dig you, you ha=
ve dealings abroad and
are blessed with prosperity.


    * One day, your 1=
0 crores is taken away by your partners in a fraud
case, you aren't the cul=
prit, but for the time being the court has
seized assets.  ---- Suffering.
=
    * Then you get face paralysis, chicks don't dig you anymore, no easy
se=
xus for mr nexus  ----- Suffering.
    * One of your flats is taken over by=
 land sharks ---- Suffering.
    * Your family distances itself from you --=
---- Suffering.
    * You run to astrologers and start flowing daal in rive=
rs without
believing in it ---- suffering.
    * Your girlfriend is diagnos=
ed with AIDS , woh toh mari, tumhaari
sexus bhi gayi mr nexus.---- big suff=
ering.

(All of this happened over a period of 3 years, itni vaat ikathe ku=
m hi
lagti hai)

Then one day, you die, while the court case is running, wh=
ile all
disputes are unresolved, you go away. Your body is not cremated for=
 one
day ,since it was evening when you left, and you know how it is.

You =
get to meet god, and god actually shows you that you only believed
yourself=
 to be Mr Nexus, you actually aren't. Then a videotape was
played. Showing =
you that you earlier incarnated as Jack (Nexus's
mother's dog); Mr Champu (=
servant of your girlfriend's grandfather);
various chinese people, a seal i=
n the antarctic, a cow , and 598765 more
people. Then you are showed , you =
cried then, you suffered then , just
like you apparently suffered as Mr Nex=
us.

Then you raised your eyebrow looked at god and all you could say was
"=
AAU"

God only nodded in agreement.

And then snap you were back, as Mr Nex=
us, but couldn't breathe. Naak
mein rui lagi hui thi naa. You got those out=
, threw away that white
sheet , got off the fatta, your family pissed their=
 pants, and you
declared your return.

But then you remembered what you had=
 seen. There was an eternal calm
about you, you fought the case without agi=
tation, won back some money,
but neither were you happy , nor depressed.

S=
ome more losses happened, but you never got disturbed, and people
started c=
alling you a monk, a mad man who is unconcerned , not motivated
in life and=
 yada and yada. But you knew, that since you yourself (as mr
nexus) are not=
 true, and are going to die, what is the use in going mad
over things? Thin=
gs that are anyways going to go away soon. Things you
only believe to be yo=
urs.

That didn't you stopped earning, or sat idle, you worked, you worked
=
your ass off, but earned in detached manner, and whatever apparent
sufferin=
g you faced, you accepted it , and never went mad with it. And
you worshipe=
d , as much as you could.

Somebody asked you do you remain this way, inspi=
re of all the losses,
and all you replied with was in the same tone as this=
 video, you
actually sang this out.

http://youtu.be/1jIxFbRdFUs?t=3D38s

T=
hen one day you died. And were reborn later as Mr Galaxy S4. LOL, just
kidd=
ing.

Funniest thing would be going to an astrologer and her/him asking wha=
t
happened ,and one responding with "mere toh law lag gaye=85..aau".

Serio=
usly, suffering is solely perception. High level saints are almost
always d=
ead, surface level personalities are already long gone. And they
go through=
 the most amount of suffering (usually). They have gone up
like Mr Nexus,  =
and come back down as per god's will. Some don't come
back at all, that's g=
od will too.

God more often than not doesn't view us as solely us/humans. =
We might be
cribbing about the suffering in Uttrakhand/our personal lives, =
but
actually it doesn't matter from his/her point of view. Because
his/her/=
its POV is extremely different and our Percived POV is extremely
different =
and limited. Thus, the debates and questions are never
conclusive or answer=
able.

Until we can see, things from a broader perspective and not a limite=
d
viewpoint, questions and more questions will be there , which will have
n=
o answers, because truth is essentially extremely different from what
we ca=
n see, hear or perceive it is.

Time to retire now,
time to sing to god, th=
e lyrics in the following one fit,

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D49Yo4_=

<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D49Yo4_9zNQ8>

And post the above on=
e, you can play this, if you wish to die laughing
with devotion -----
