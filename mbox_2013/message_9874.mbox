Dear Ajit,

If the soul can recall, doesn't this soul now have so=

her it is subtle or gross) that survives upon death, haven't you just creat=

implicit body bound to your concept of a soul?>>

I am not sure that=
 I understood your question correctly. 


Karma "attaches" itself by settin=
g certain preconditions/circumstances based on the desires of the soul and =
lessons the egosense must learn for manifesting the soul. This process is t=
aken care of by Nature's laws. These two - desire and need - are slightly d=
ifferent. At the moment of death the soul has a specific ability to interna=
lize and project what it needs/wants to experience in the next birth. That =
gets set firmly. That counts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reactio=
n process of actions performed is the need or the consequence to be faced i=
n order that the egosense can learn to be more responsible in its actions..=
 And, here is the catch in the theory of Karma that I believe in, the react=
ion process again is exact and divided into a reaction to the body or to th=
e mind or to the life based on the instrument which was used to perform/eng=
age in a specific karma. Now since our ego-sense will identify with these t=
o hold them together, so the
 egosense will experience the reaction. We mos=
tly live from our egosense. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much d=
eeper. Now assuming suddenly that the individual in the next birth has a to=
tal spiritual transformation and is able to manifest the soul and live life=
 from it, the reactions may not come or if they do may be highly reduced in=
 nature such as not to be of any real consequences. When the soul starts go=
verning an individual instead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an =
individual becomes different from others. 


In another model of reality, i=
t is the karana sharir will hold the seeds of the karma. which is never des=
troyed. But the karana sharir is very different from the normal mind or lif=
e or body. It is more like a super subtle background process in all individ=
uals. To be able to reach consciousness the karana sharir, is a very very h=
igh spiritual achievement. Our karmas are mostly and almost always in the r=
ealm of body, life and mind. Karana is way beyond this. A typal repository =
of various things. It is infact only when a person can experience the karan=
a sharir that he/she can really enter into the realm of the Great Gods. The=
y are Beings of this karana jagat, typal and fixed in essence, never changi=
ng, like the individual karana sharir. Now one can logically ask, so if the=
 karana sharir is recording karma, is it not getting fatter? This is a prob=
lem of our logical mind which may not hold true in that realm. If=C2=A0 we =
keep adding jugs of water to the ocean,
 will it overflow? No. This is quit=
e beyond the normal mind which is limited by its own regimented logic.


Ea=
ch of the sharir is not only an individual's own but is also effectively an=
d fluidly connected to the whole world of that realm. So with the physical =
we interact and live in the physical world, with the sukshma we interact an=
d be a part of the sukshma jagat, same with the karan. Only difference bein=
g the depth, intensity and the nature of these three. The Karana is very fi=
xed and supremely subtle. Like a seed. While the sthula is the maximum chan=
geable of the three. Everything that is there in the sthula jagat is born o=
ut of a seed from the karana. As such, nothing in the sthula can go beyond =
the potentialities held by its most fundamental essence that lies in the Ka=
rana. Hence great Yogis, those who can access this realm at will, can know =
the most essential nature of a thing by experiencing what a thing is in its=
 deepest essence in this Karana jagat, and thus get to know all its possibi=
lities without ever trying to explore them in the physical realm
 or the su=
btle realm. Quite off limits for most of us.


Hope this helps.

 by
 followers of =
Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spirits, and specially durin=

 of cremation ground.

>>>>>General=
ly, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting. And thi=

possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the =

kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physi=
cal presence in front of the victim is a must for the one trying to help.=
=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl will have to do the s=
adhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will =
find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreig=
n land homas may not be that easy.
>>>>>

hen go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside th=

>>>>>
>>>>>A possession by a for=
eign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For there are var=
ious classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individua=
l and some of them can be downright nasty.
>>>>>
>>>>>Upayas are many. As s=
o many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theore=
tically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case =
or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any=
 method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed th=
e individual and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has =
to find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to ente=
r into the person.
 Sometimes it can be
 something
 as simple as spitting s=
omewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their ter=
ritory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the =
mind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send t=
o cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no=
 sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It al=
l depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those =
trying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover,=
 if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless th=
e person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to seriou=
s harm.
>>>>>
>>>>>These things like removing possession are specialization=
s. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows we=
ll what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would=
 do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know =
well how to
 handle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force be=
fore the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in=
 possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain whic=
h will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried t=
o remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.
>>>>>
>>>>>[Reminds me of a=
 particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism.=
 But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about=
 the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in po=
ssession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim.=
 Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the b=
ody of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Ne=
ver trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases wher=
e the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]
>>>>>
>=
>>>>Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with=
 spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not =
possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferab=
ly Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms=
 are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and t=
ime. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depend=
s on the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily wi=
th any sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this =
through to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a =

reconditions/circumstances based on the desires of the soul and lessons the=
 egosense must learn
 for manifesting the soul. This process is taken care =
of by Nature's
 laws. These two - desire and need - are slightly different.=
 At the moment of death the soul has a specific ability to internalize and =
project what it needs/wants to experience in the next birth. That gets set =
firmly. That counts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reaction process=
 of actions performed is the need or the consequence to be faced in order t=
hat the egosense can learn to be more responsible in its actions.. And, her=
e is the catch in the theory of Karma that I believe in, the reaction proce=
ss again is exact and divided into a reaction to the body or to the mind or=
 to the life based on the instrument which was used to perform/engage in a =
specific karma. Now since our ego-sense will identify with these to hold th=
em together, so the egosense will experience the reaction. We mostly live f=
rom our egosense. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much deeper. Now=
 assuming suddenly that the individual in the next birth has a total spirit=
ual
 transformation and is able to manifest the soul and live life from it,=
 the reactions may not come or if they do may be highly reduced in nature s=
uch as not to be of any real consequences. When the soul starts governing a=
n individual instead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an individua=
l becomes different from others. <br clear=3D"none"></div><div style=3D"col=

d the seeds of the karma. which is never destroyed. But the karana sharir i=
s very different from the normal mind or life or body. It is more like a su=
per subtle background process in all individuals. To be able
 to reach cons=
ciousness the karana sharir,
 is a very very high spiritual achievement. Ou=
r karmas are mostly and almost always in the realm of body, life and mind. =
Karana is way beyond this. A typal repository of various things. It is infa=
ct only when a person can experience the karana sharir that he/she can real=
ly enter into the realm of the Great Gods. They are Beings of this karana j=
agat, typal and fixed in essence, never changing, like the individual karan=
a sharir. Now one can logically ask, so if the karana sharir is recording k=
arma, is it not getting fatter? This is a problem of our logical mind which=
 may not hold true in that realm. If  we keep adding jugs of water to =
the ocean, will it overflow? No. This is quite beyond the normal mind which=
 is limited by its own regimented logic.<br clear=3D"none"></div><div style=

t is also effectively and fluidly connected to the whole world of that real=

an. Only difference being the depth, intensity and the nature of these thre=
e. The Karana is very fixed and supremely subtle. Like a seed. While the st=
hula is the maximum changeable of the three. Everything that is there in th=
e sthula jagat is born out of a seed from the karana. As such, nothing in t=
he sthula can go beyond the potentialities held by its most fundamental ess=
ence that lies in the Karana. Hence great Yogis, those who can access this =
realm at will, can know the most essential nature of a thing
 by experienci=

 this Karana jagat, and thus g=
