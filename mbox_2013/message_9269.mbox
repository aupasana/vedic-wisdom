Dear PVR Ji, Rajarshi Ji,
Thanks for such thoughtful insights, i really lov=
e reading your mails on such misunderstood and thought provoking subjects. =
It promt me to write first time on this group.
=A0
Regarding the concept of=
 Avatar and Vibhuti,=A0do you want to say=A0that Jesus or Nanak or Sai baba=
 or may be Budhha are Vibhutis=A0? 
Seeking the history, there might be or =
may not be very little evidence of Avatars only we rely upon=A0the literatu=
re corresponding to that. I know it is due to the time frame or Yug change =
but if we=A0consider=A0Vibhutis then we have lot of historical evidences be=
side literature. Don't we believe that Avatar is a big phenomenon and beyon=
d the scope of scriptures? because we have these scriptures transferred by =
one generation to another and might have some bias associated with them. I =
am having little knowledge about this but what i feel is that we have many =
versions of same SB or even epics like Ramayan or Mahabahrata.
Somewhere i =
like the concept of evolutionary Avatars, if we consider our frame of refer=
ence as our present Universe this concept fits well. By the way if we look =
beyond this frame of reference it might be different story. My idea is the =
frame of=A0reference is important in this context.=A0In my opinion=A0it may=
 be true that there are other "Worlds" as well which are beyond our imagina=
tion or scope, Avatars are Phenomenon of this World, our frame or reference=
, our universe. So it seems in a perfect alignment of evolution of our univ=
erse.
Considering our evolution in present Kaliyug, it might be possible th=
at Kalki Avatar will be more like a destroyer, i don't have words to explai=
n here. I remember a picture at Raghunath temple in Jammu where Kalki avata=
r is depicted like Surya or some thing similar. I hope if some one can shed=
 more light to this.
With my minuscule knowledge on this subject=A0i try to=
 add my two cents to this lovely discussion.

Dear Narasimha,
=A0=

Jai Ma!


Just to clarify, I may have a special liking for Krshna, but my =
aim is obvious not to demean Rama, or any other special form of God.=A0Just=
 clarifying incase someone gets the wrong impression. I respect Rama, but I=
 worship Krshna.
=A0
<<More importantly, if your understanding is correct, =
why isn't perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring well =

Good=A0question!=A0=A0
=A0
That is because, SB is not concerned =
with the dasavatara. It lists 22 Avataras! It=A0deals with the idea of Avat=
aran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras.=A0It also=A0lists Varah=
a Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in its list of 22. It is=
 only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and the term b=
ecomes popular. 
=A0
And ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avataras, in a fixed =
sequence=A0of appearence, that we get the popular concept of Dasavatara. El=
se no. I find the evolutionary link in this concept of 9/10 Avataras too co=
mpelling to be ignored.=A0=A0
=A0
<<After all, "entire divinity" cannot be =
encapsulated by any form>>


This, I am in total agreement with. Infact, in=
 the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various vibhutis, t=
his One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitation of concept=
ion. Hence, the One says, among those who weild weapons, it is Rama, and am=
ong the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..
=A0
<<First, he IS mentioned in SB lis=
t of avataras as well as Parasara's list. If he does not "fit" in your "sch=
eme of evolutionary Avatars", then your concept is possibly wrong and avata=
ras are perhaps not "evolutionary" as you theorize.>>

As I said, the SB li=
st contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! Th=
at is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not =
of any use. For these nine grahas, individually or in combination, will rep=
resent all Avataras, or for that matter everything else in this Universe.
=
=A0
Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then=
 what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=A0lagna is not a graha.
=A0
Or, just surmis=
ing, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends on the eart=
h, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, but once he =
does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know after the =
last Avatara comes.
=A0
Anyway, I am not looking at this main Avatars from =
the point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that matter, some traditions consid=
er Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Buddha.
=A0
=A0
The concept of Ava=
tara and Vibhutis comes from the Gita. These two are slightly different. Av=
atara is a special descent of God, Paramatma, which appears on this world=
=A0during times of severe crisis to=A0cause a drastic and fundamental=A0tra=
nsition. A Vibhuti is a limited force of God which can appear to help out, =
directly or indirectly, in any transition. A Vibuti need not be spiritual. =
It could be in any field of work.=A0Sometimes a Vibhuti may not even be awa=
re of its purpose, unlike an Avatara.
=A0
Basically, whenever we see excell=
ence in any form, in any field, it is always the energy of the One at work.=

=A0 
Namaste Rajarshi,
=A0
Very nice t=
o hear from you!
=A0
The "unmistakeable" link to the *physical* evolution o=
f life on earth does not imply an increasing sequence of *spiritual* perfec=
tion, as you cannot directly map the physical to the spiritual. More import=
antly, if your understanding is correct, why isn't perfection occurring in =
the FINAL incarnation but occurring well before?
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
First, regarding Krishna being a "poornavatar=
a", SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Paras=
ara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha an=
d Varaha are "poornavataras" (used that exact expression) while other avata=
ras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates jivat=
mamsa).
=A0
Secondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there are=
 in fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods e=
tc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then =
proceeds to say "these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.=
" I question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama=
 is not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, dem=
igods etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both=
 Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.
=A0
Third, let us ask a very fundament=
al question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is "Lord Himself"?
=A0=

*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
While SB talks of Kris=
hna being "Lord Himself" in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: "forms of Supre=
me Lord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the nature of pure consc=
iousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya". In the ne=
xt verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in ai=
r. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contai=
ns* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific =
form that descended on earth being "Lord Himself"? I am afraid people may b=
e misinterpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning..
=A0=

All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (=
living/relative being). The latter portion is dominant in us and is respons=
ible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion =
of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without =
ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasa=
ra.
=A0
They are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire di=
vinity!!!! After all, "entire divinity" cannot be encapsulated by any form =
just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama ob=
eying and executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Kr=
ishna as well as Rama.

=A0
First, he IS me=
ntioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara's list. If he does not "=
fit" in your "scheme of evolutionary Avatars", then your concept is possibl=
y wrong and avataras are perhaps not "evolutionary" as you theorize.
=A0
Se=
condly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies log=
ical mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind a=
nd its spirit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected sp=
irit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality compl=
etely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Inco=
mprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doin=
g. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Ka=
li yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this wo=
rld in this age.
=A0

=A0
If=
 you dismiss Parasara's linking of planets to avataras as a possible corrup=
tion, are you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are =
perfect? (In any case, it's a different matter that you are only taking som=
e SB verses and ignoring some as I showed!.)
=A0
The bottomline as far as I=
 am concerned is that Pararsara's list actually makes amazingly coherent es=
oteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spi=
rit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - sp=
irit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a h=
ighly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically=
 is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in =
them.
=A0
If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclus=
ions, some would conclude that Shiva is the "supreme" one and other deities=
 are "inferior"; some would conclude that Surya is the "supreme" one and ot=
her deities are "inferior"; and so on.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
On a different note, someone may think that Kali, bei=
ng Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis =
have declared them to be essentially the same and some scriptures even proh=
ibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference between th=
em is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some =
significant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting the=
ir own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=A0 per=
fectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.
=A0
If we think about it, per=
fected mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspe=
ct represented by Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishn=
a and Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their stories ma=
y be different.
=A0
One last word though. If someone truly believes that Kr=
ishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very =
happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing thin=
king/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the long run,=
 than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone o=
f us will have to go through one's own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik a=
nd saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping some fistfuls of=
 Reality. These concepts are too subtle for anyone to convince others or be=
 absolutely confident oneself!

>I have a different view point. Let me write down =
as I see it, in point by point manner.
>
>
>1. In the Bhagwata Purana, ther=
e are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara i=
s the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayan=
a,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes o=
ntu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, =
Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supr=
eme Being while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."
>
>
>2. Of these various possi=
ble Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special =
mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, special=
ly those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krs=
hna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the=
 full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All =
Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yu=
ga, as are Tantras]
>
>
>3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of ap=
pearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krsh=
na, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form an=
d sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From =
the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-=
man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possessi=
on of this earth represented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara =
of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Ram=
a, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality=
 is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressive realizatio=
n of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the cons=
ciousness and its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituali=
ty of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature's grand design fo=
r life on earth.
>
>
>4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the=
 parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one wo=
rships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of =
the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata c=
an lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars o=
f Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massi=
ve spiritual dynamos.
>
>
>
>=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are=
 most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both inside as we=
ll as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama r=
epresents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in contr=
ol of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within and wi=
thout - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. However,=
 as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though f=
ew, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when circ=
umstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected =
while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear before t=
he final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later r=
evealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama=
 tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to r=
escue her, but it was
 the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour=
. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The way =
I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki=
 for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an obs=
erver, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years o=
f tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he =
changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal considera=
tion or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a les=
son of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detach=
ment right from birth. I am not taking his=A0 supernatural feats into accou=
nt. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from people=
, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of ei=
ght, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foste=
r parents, his
 village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it wo=
uld make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his hap=
py, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. =
Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won't unders=
tand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He =
never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to=
 participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them starte=
d getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from=
 the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any s=
pecial right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept=
 dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th =
abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into his =
poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionis=
t and
 charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to thi=
nk of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed=
 his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the ene=
mies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never =
in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard, neve=
r a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his =
actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then right in=
 the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the=
 most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best i=
deal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be deject=
ed. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the inst=
rument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, =
or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to
 h=
it Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna,=
 as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be li=
ned up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of know=
ledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constan=
tly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these =
kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ram=
ayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary t=
exts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we =
have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sit=
a turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama wors=
hips her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture=
 that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Theref=
ore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of
 which is =
self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation fr=
om his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very d=
early. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when =
the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anyth=
ing in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore=
 he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left=
 him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual forc=
e in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Ava=
tars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an en=
d in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find t=
his not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them nega=
ted this world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then w=
hy send so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary
 development? If =
the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, t=
hen why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense=
. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of =
Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava trad=
itions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realizat=
ion, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside =
of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own=
 kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore=
 an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of the =
Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological fu=
nctions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most=
 people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - exclud=
ing Buddha - correspond to the full power and force
 of one of these 9 Chak=
ras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or all=
ow the consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities,=
 are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore=
 the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in numbe=
r. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on whi=
ch graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS s=
ays, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one canno=
t rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepre=
sentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not ye=
t appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora =
books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is pe=
rfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living=
 in the full and complete purity and might
 and force and strength of the A=
tmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away oppos=
ing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna =
used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kal=
ki, I am speculating, won't even need that. The white horse and that sword =
is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the variou=
s errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at th=
e story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I a=
m reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =

>=A0 
>Namaste friends, =A0 There was a discussion on Lord Vishnu's=
 Dasavataras on a limited access forum on Facebook. A learned friend wrote =
that "Krshna is the God-man", "Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stag=
e" and "Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progression =
of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna".=
 =A0 I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a =
"linear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna". =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Each avatara represents an aspect of Supre=
me in a perfected form. =A0 Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with plan=
ets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respe=
ctively. =A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Sa=
turn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/d=
rive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being hap=
py, patience/discipline,
 spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detach=
ment (respectively). =A0 Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of =
that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how=
 that aspect operates. =A0 Lord Rama's story is a perfected example of how =
soul operates. Lord Krishna's story is a perfected example of how mind oper=
ates. Lord Vamana's story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discriminati=
on operates. Lord Narasimha's story is a perfected example of how energy/dr=
ive/initiative operates. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =
* =A0 Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy =
in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/pat=
ience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Self. Howe=
ver, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has different quali=
ties and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them. =A0 We=
 MAY focus on one aspect of us first,
 perfect it and then perfect other as=
pects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Simi=
larly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in=
 a balance working together in the Cosmos. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may=
 like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated =
by the qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind oper=
ates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the sto=
ry that demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a mat=
ter of taste and subjective preference. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind.=
 Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attri=
butes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes=
. =A0 Once mind fancies a separate existence with some
 agendas/desires, so=
ul supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and s=
ees it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this=
 individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning abili=
ty, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desir=
es/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and recor=
ds all of one's agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruit=
s later on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doin=
g those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the i=
ndividualized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things=
 and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees t=
hat as its dharma and does it impassionately. =A0 Now, does this sound exci=
ting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness sup=
porting the play, may not seem interesting enough
 to some. =A0 On the othe=
r hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing tho=
se agendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what k=
eeps the individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for everythi=
ng else in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dh=
arma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and =
brings in agendas and passion and even decides/affects every entity's dharm=
a. That way, mind is really the "boss" of the individualization. No wonder =
Krishna's life appeals more to one who may be excited by this description! =
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Lord Krishna is obv=
iously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama's life in perspective. =A0 Rama's=
 life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jn=
ana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his "dharm=
a". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given
 kingdom. At t=
he last moment, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his step=
-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Th=
ough his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degree=
s, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impa=
ssionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshmana and go=
ing after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately wh=
en Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and=
 fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or f=
aulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation wi=
th no complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed R=
avana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. E=
ven as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subje=
cts that were going to disappear with Ravana! =A0 Rama
 is a perfect exampl=
e of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharg=
es one's dharma arising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT=
 is basically what soul does! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 * =A0 As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is =
a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =A0 He was b=
orn as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a chari=
table demon king with many great qualities. =A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes=
 one humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with de=
monic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one's discrimination is not ple=
ased until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one's entire conscio=
usness, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Please think about the other avatara=
s. The stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of how various a=
spects of
 our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara=
. =A0 Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately=
. Of course, if you are more attracted to one of them, please think about t=
hat avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us=
 from samsara. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 By t=
he way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are dif=
ferent schools of thought). =A0 Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology =

_151>Namaste Rajarshi,<BR> <BR>Very nice to hear from you!<BR> <B=
R>The "unmistakeable" link to the *physical* evolution of life on earth doe=
s not imply an increasing sequence of *spiritual* perfection, as you cannot=
 directly map the physical to the spiritual. More importantly, if your unde=
rstanding is correct, why isn't perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnati=
on but occurring well before?<BR> <BR>*     &=
nbsp;  *        *<BR> <BR>Firs=
t, regarding Krishna being a "poornavatara", SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not=
 say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly m=
entioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are "poornavataras" (used=
 that exact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa=
 too (though paramatmamsa dominates
 jivatmamsa).<BR> <BR>Secondly, af=
ter describing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable ava=
taras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supre=
me Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say "these a=
vataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself." I question if the dedu=
ction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It =
only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. A=
s I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are po=
ornavataras.<BR> <BR>Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: Wh=
at exactly does it mean if an avatara is "Lord Himself"?<BR> <BR>*&nbs=
p;       *      =
;  *<BR> <BR>While SB talks of Krishna being "Lord Himself" in 1.=
3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: "forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality for=
mless (arUpa) and of the
 nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are man=
ufactured by the qualities of Maya". In the next verse, it further compares=
 forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clo=
uds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them.=
 So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth =
being "Lord Himself"? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion=
 based on their fancies and conditioning..<BR> <BR>All beings are made=
 up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative bein=
g). The latter portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and=
 rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very r=
arely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion.=
 Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasara.<BR> <BR>The=
y are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! =
After all, "entire
 divinity" cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no=
 cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and =
executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as w=
ell as Rama.<BR> <BR>*        *&nbs=
p;       *<BR> <BR>> Buddha was great=
 spiritual force in this world. But I do not<BR>> see him fit in the sch=
eme of evolutionary Avatars. His<BR>> realization, the one he advocated,=
 is a static realization,<BR>> an end in a void.<BR> <BR>First, he =
IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara's list. If he does =
not "fit" in your "scheme of evolutionary Avatars", then your concept is po=
ssibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not "evolutionary" as you theorize.<B=
R> <BR>Secondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who p=
ersonifies logical mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. =
Logical mind

omprehension are </SPAN>inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of com=
prehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for =
it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensibl=
e in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However,=
 logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No=
 wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this=
 age.<BR> <BR>*        *  =
;      *<BR> <BR>If you dismiss Parasara's li=
nking of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely s=
ure that the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it'=
s a different matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring s=
ome as I
 showed!.)<BR> <BR>The bottomline as far as I am concerned is=
 that Pararsara's list actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. Th=
e nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehen=
sion, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happ=
iness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meanin=
gful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you =
really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in them.<BR>&nb=
sp;<BR>If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclusion=
s, some would conclude that Shiva is the "supreme" one and other deities ar=
e "inferior"; some would conclude that Surya is the "supreme" one and other=
 deities are "inferior"; and so on.<BR> <BR>*    &=
nbsp;   *        *<BR> <B=
R>On a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superi=
or
 to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them =
to be essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiat=
ing between them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle fo=
r even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some significant differe=
nce between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning=
. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were  perfectly detached =
and fully divine karma yogis.<BR> <BR>If we think about it, perfected =

), I am very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of=
 sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in =
the long run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the en=
d, everyone of us will have to go through one's own cycles of various tamas=
ik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping som=
e fistfuls of Reality. These concepts are too subtle for anyone to convince=
 others or be absolutely confident oneself!<BR></SPAN> </DIV>
