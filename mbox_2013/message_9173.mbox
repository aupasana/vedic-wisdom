>From what i learnt and heard from books and discourses:

1) Idol worship i=
s worshipping the god within you, idol is only a means, initial sadhaana up=
to vaanaprastha, in vaanaprastham it is maanasikopasana : Pujya sri Chaagan=
ti Koteswara Rao

2) Human body is microcosm, Mt. Meru , saptha dweepas, sa=
kala lokas, all theerthas, rushi, muni, devi devatas, all rivers, kshetras,=
 prayag, triveni exist inside, this is known by gnostics, who are on the pa=
th of attaining Brahma (aatma) gnaana: As said by Shiva(Shivaaya Gurave)

3=

MERU TANTRAM: =
6 Abodes of Sri Maha Vishnu
    1. In Water as Naaraayana
    2. In Fire , =
Agni, incl.Jhataragn
    3. Hridaya of a Yogi
    4. In Sun,as seen by Pand=

    5. In Homa
    6. For the sake of laymen, in 
        idols
Again I=

    1. Sajeev - Brahmin,cow, etc.
    2. Flora - Peepal=

Nirguna upasana(maanasika puja,=

Namaste,
 
Correct, if the mind involved is highly purified and has a goo=
d level of
shama and dama (equanimity and self-restraint).
 
When we make o=
fferings externally (e.g. to an idol), mind is distracted by
so many extern=
al things and unlikely to be fully focused on the act. When a
highly purifi=
ed mind makes offerings internally, it is possible for it to be
highly focu=
sed on the visualization. That can indeed be more effective.
 
However, unt=
il one reaches such a stage, it is quite useful (and often
unavoidable) to =
engage in external and material offerings. A mind that is
unfocused and dis=
tracted needs some objects and actions to anchor it and
make it somewhat fo=
cused and disciplined.

 
Best regards,
Narasimha

	Namaste to All,
	
	I have recently heard it said that offerings ma=

superior/more effective in manifesting desired results=
 than actual material
offerings. Any thoughts or opinions on this?
