namaste,


*> recited as SHAIYO and not SHAMYO... *


I have heard different traditions pronounce this differently. There are
several cases where the anusvara (M) is pronounced differently before
consonants. (other cases typically end up with the "gum" / "gush" type
sounds).

First, say "shaM yoH" normally a few times. Observe that to pronounce "M",
you have to close the lips -- they will come in contact which each other.
This is one way of pronouncing it.

In some traditions, when pronouncing the "M" before a "v" or "y" sound,
they don't close the lips ... i.e. they stop just before the lips come into
contact. ( to pronounce "ya" or "va", the lips cannot come into contact.
They stop pronouncing the "M" that precedes it at this "y" or "v" position).

If you pronounce "shaM yoH", and don't fully close the lips when
pronouncing "M", you'll end up with the other pronunciation that you have
heard.

sasneham,

   ajit
