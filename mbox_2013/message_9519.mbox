Another 2 cents. Not knowing more details about your situation (and this fo=
rum is not for psychological analysis and assessment of specific personal i=
ssues) such as what type of noise and source (internal mental chatter or ex=
ternal amplified noise) it is a challenge to give more suggestions. 

In my=
 experience at times, given my lower level of spiritual evolution, I have n=
oticed more energy which gets transformed to outward anger due to my mistak=
es if I do regular Homam of Urga devataas.  In such situations I have found=
 Abhishekham to be a good alternative or associated practice. 

Along with =
worship of Sri Ganesha to remove obstacles you may try Abhishekham, perhaps=
 that of Shiva or Rudra, and see the effect on your mood and anger. 

It is=
 preferred to have a calm state of mind while doing spiritual Saadhana. Thi=
s is one of reason we have brief pranayama exercise in the Homam manual pri=
or to ahoutis. You can try a longer pranayama practice also and compare res=
ults.
