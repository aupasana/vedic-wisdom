Dear learned people

The time to change yagnopavitham is less than 3 weeks =
away. 

While declaring sankalpam, one has to mention the place "bharatha v=
arshe.. bharatha khande.."

So far, I was not particular about tailoring th=
is to my exact location. Now I feel it is about time I considered this.

Ho=
w would I mention the place for central Europe?

Help, please.

Ranga
