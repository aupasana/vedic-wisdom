Dear Brothers,

As i`m performing Ganapathy Homam i used to wake up and do =
pradaksina namaskaran for one single round. However, i came across an artic=
le saying if i woke up and go out of the mat, the benefit would be transfer=
red to Lord Indra. The article goes like this;

Lord Indra worshiped Lord S=
hiva. Pleased with his devotion Lord Shiva appeared and ask Lord Indra to a=
sk for a boon. Lord Indra asked, that let he be blessed to snatch everyone'=
s fruit of bhakti/devotion, because he fear that someone will take over his=
 Kingdom by winning a boon from any God.
Lord Shiva persuaded him to ask fo=
r something else, because not everyone is seeking to ousted Lord Indra. Upo=
n his (Lord Indra's) persistence Lord Shiva and he came upon an agreement, =
that if anyone, in eternity is sitting doing any devotion, it be Japa, Tarp=
an, Marjan, Homa/Havan, Shradha or any rites, if the person stands up from =
his asana/mat and leave. Then the fruit or benefit of that ritual or undert=
aking will go to Lord Indra.
But if the person or devotee puts a drop or tw=
o of water underneath the asana/mat and touch this water, with his ring fin=
ger puts a tilak or puts a dot of that water on his forehead or between the=
 eyebrows, the benefit or fruit of that particular ritual, sadhana or devot=
ion will remain with the devotee. Lord Indra will not be able to snatch the=
 fruit of that devotion.
This simple act keeps the fruit of your devotion w=
ith you! No one can snatch the benefit from you, not even Lord Indra.
That'=
s why many a times, I have been asked why is that one is praying to God for=
 so long with no benefit or fruit of that devotion. Why God is not listenin=
g? Well, when I explain the above story to them, it raises their eyebrows. =
When they adopt this simple act, they start seeing results! The benefit or =
fruit of their devotion remain with them, forever!

Please advise me.
Thank=
 You.
