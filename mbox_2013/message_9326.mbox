Dear learned members

Please permit me to ask this slightly off-topic quest=
ion.

I am unable to explain to my European friends why one's date of birth=
 differs between the Georgian calendar and Hindu calendar. I know that thes=
e dates match on one's 19th, 38th, 57th... birthday. Why so?

I would be so=
 grateful to be able to explain this difference.

Thanks for your help
