ankha Story

  

For the benefit of those who are not on facebook, I am rep=
roducing something interesting.
 

>From Arunisha's facebook wall:
 
They sa=
y our Lord was a meek, humble and obedient student of Rishi Sandipani. He n=
ever shirked his chores and who inspired his classmates with great love. He=
 had a wonderful memory and matchless strength. When his studies were compl=
eted, it was time to give his teacher gurudakshina. Divining hidden sorrow =
in Sandipani, he asked him what he would like. Wistfully, the sage asked if=
 Krishna could possibly trace his son, kidnapped long ago by a sea monster =
called Panchajana. Straightaway, our Lord plumbed the depths of the ocean w=
here he fought and vanquished the beast. Rescuing his guru=E2=80=99s son, h=
e ground the monster=E2=80=99s bones and fashioned a fearful conch, the Paa=
nchajanya=E2=80=94=E2=80=98derived from Panchajana=E2=80=99=E2=80=94 whose =
sound thereafter struck raw terror in the hearts of evildoers.
 
My respons=
e:
 
Metaphorically, Krishna represents the dark & mysterious entity of a p=
erfected mind. Sandipani means "nice kindling". A perfected mind is all-kno=
wing and all-capable and just needs some kindling of spirit to get going.
 =

>From the kindling of spirit comes a charming sense of well-being (Madhuman=
gala, son of Sandipani). This charming sense of well-being coming from the =
kindling of spirit may be trapped by an attachment to material world. The d=
emon (tamas) Panchajana (5 beings) represent tamasik attachment to 5 elemen=
ts. He lives deep inside the ocean (samsara!).
 
Perfected mind can rescue =
this sense of well-being from the clutches of tamasik attachment to the mat=
erial world and converts the 5 elements from a tamasik attachment (demon) t=
o a conch (a call for dharmik action). This world made of pancha mahabhutas=
 is not for enjoyment and attachment, but for engaging in dharmik actions.
=
 
My 2 cents. Sorry if I took away some fun from the beautiful story! :-)

Best regards,
Narasimha
