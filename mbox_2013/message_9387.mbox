Reciting Kavachas and sahasranamas are secondary after mantra japa. In case=
 of mahavidya sahasranamas and kavachas they always contain the signature s=
aying "guhyati guhya" and if you examine the pha=C3=B8ashruti or the starti=
ng part (of kavachams) usually has warnings against reciting without permis=
sion from a guru. Ofcourse dependency on a guru for doing anything sucks - =
but it is the case unfortunately. At the lease you can circumvent these in =
case of more "amiable" deities like ganapati and mahavishnu.

Vishnu SN and=
 Varaha Kavacam (i hope you have not meant varahI) are okay to recite witho=
ut a guru and that is the reason why they are so popular. Very strictly spe=
aking Vishnu sahasranamam also has a "lock" - referred to as Shankhabhrnand=
akichakriti keelkam" in the purva bhagam of vishnu sahasranamam. Every saha=
sranamam is actually one mantra (ShrI VishnOr divya sahasranamastrotra maha=
mantrasya" and you can recite it as a devotional strotra or as a highly pow=
erful mantra if one knows the specific prayoga vidhi.

I once read a blog p=
ost on how continuous recitation of VS cured a terminally ill cancer patien=
t. Its glory is immense. For best effects I would advise 108 japa of Om nam=
o narayanaya (the 8 letter mantra of mahavishnu) before sahasranamam. I am =
sure that would have much higher effects.=C2=A0

Best,

Dear Krishnan Sir,
=

I got Dhoomavati Kavacham from internet and I did recite it once normally =
as I used to do with other Mantras. But after reciting it once, I felt alto=
gether different kind of energy within. So I got suspect and wanted to ask =
the learned people of the group.

I am really thankful for your suggestions=
. I will keep it in mind.

By the way, I daily recite Varah Kavacham and Vi=
shnu Sahasranaam. I hope, there is no issue with reciting Varaah and Nrisim=
h Kavacham.

Thanks and Regards
Durgesh O Mishra
