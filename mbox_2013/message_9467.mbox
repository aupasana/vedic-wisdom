As s understood by me it is the hora lord in the tithi pravesha chart which=
 shows the focus of the year. But in the lectures uploaded by shri sanjay r=
ath ji, where he explains that the hora lord shows the focus and future pla=
ns. It is the vara lord that shows the past life karma coming in to focus.
=

Now pundit ji in his lectures takes the vara lord to predict that is going=
 to happen in that year and not the hora lord. 

Now since the vara lord is=
 ioening uo the past life karma it is certain to happen and the horavlord s=
hows ones focus which may or may not happen. Is thos interpretation correct=
 or wrong?

Need to clearly understand difference between interpreting infl=
uence of vara lord and the hora lord in the chart.=A0 How are these two dif=
ferent in terms of giving results in the tithi pravesha chart. 

Please dis=
cuss and clarify. Thanks. 

I am looking forward for clarification and guid=
ance from narsimha sir. 

Thanks
