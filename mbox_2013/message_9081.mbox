and sanchitha and agami are what we going to do  . Prarabda karma need=
 not be the karma which was done yesterday or some 10 days or months b=
ack . A   soul goes through millions of births and deat=
hs and in  each  birth   goes through millions  of=
 experiences . In that sojourn there could be many good and bad deeds . The=
 nature's law  is nothing goes waste . Each and every  thing =
; ,whether by words or thoughts or by actions is recorded  and has to =
be accounted for .Soul is immortal and imperishable .So it has to repay for=
 its doings ,and thus the karmic debts have to be paid and in some areas ka=
rmic credits have to be received . A chain is a chain whether it is of gold=
 or of iron .Hence we
 are  bound by our deeds  some in the form =
of punishments ,some in the form of rewards .In astrology these traits are =
shown in good periods and bad periods .  So after doing remedial =
 measures we can reduce to certain extent the intensity of the effect of ba=
d karma ,but totally we can't get rid of the bad effect in case of prarabda=
 karma . But for every thing there is an exception and we are not taking th=
e case of exceptions . In so far as sanchitha and agami karmas are concerne=
d ,that is what we are accumulating and going to accumulate ,our =
Ishtadevatha , stands by us and our intense trust and faith in her and the =
sadhana we do  ,will burn away the seeds of vasanas. What we do day be=
come vasana at a later date. Vasanas lead to samskarams ,samskarams lead to=
 actions again actions become vasanas ,thus this is all an endless circle .=
If we are in deep debts and while repaying the debts ,if we donot incur fur=
ther debts we
 become finally  free of debts . Alternatively in some e=
xtraordinary cases we may get a help from known or unknown quarters which h=
elps us to get rid of our debts .That is possible ,though  the chances=
 are very rare . Ishtadevatha stands by us in doing this ,by burning the va=
sanas ,by making not to commit mistake further and by giving strebgth in fa=
cing the ordeals  and  by going in the righteous path against all=
 odds .  regards         =
