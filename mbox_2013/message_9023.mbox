arry Dossey]

In science, we have largely ignored how consciousness manifes=
ts in our
existence. We=E2=80=99ve done this by assuming that the brain pro=
duces
consciousness, although how it might do so has never been explained a=
nd can
hardly be imagined. The polite term for this trick is =E2=80=9Cemerg=
ence.=E2=80=9D At a
certain stage of biological complexity, evolutionary bi=
ologists claim,
consciousness pops out of the brain like a rabbit from a ma=
gician=E2=80=99s hat.
Yet this claim rests on no direct evidence whatsoever=
. As Rutgers
University philosopher Jerry A. Fodo flatly states, =E2=80=9CN=
obody has the
slightest idea how anything material could be conscious. So m=
uch for our
philosophy of consciousness.=E2=80=9D

In spite of the complete=
 absence of evidence, the belief that the brain
produces consciousness endu=
res and has ossified into dogma. Many scientists
realize the limitations of=
 this belief. One way of getting around the lack
of evidence is simply to d=
eclare that what we call consciousness is the
brain itself. That way, nothi=
ng is produced, and the magic of =E2=80=9Cemergence=E2=80=9D
is avoided. As=
 astronomer Carl Sagan expressed his position, =E2=80=9CMy
fundamental prem=
ise about the brain is that its workings =E2=80=93 what we
sometimes call m=
ind =E2=80=93 are a consequence of anatomy and physiology, and
nothing more=
.=E2=80=9D Nobelist Francis Crick agreed, saying =E2=80=9C[A] person=E2=80=
=99s mental
activities are entirely due to the behavior of nerve cells, gli=
al cells,
and the atoms, ions, and molecules that make up and influence the=
m.=E2=80=9D

This =E2=80=9Cidentity theory=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 mind equals b=
rain =E2=80=93 has led legions of scientists
and philosophers to regard con=
sciousness as an unnecessary, superfluous
concept. Some go out of their way=
 to deny the existence of consciousness
altogether, almost as if they bear =
a grudge against it. Tufts University
cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett sa=
ys, =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re all zombies. Nobody is
conscious.=E2=80=9D Denne=
tt includes himself in this extraordinary claim, and he
seems proud of it.
=

Consciousness can operate beyond the brain, body, and the present, as
hund=
reds of experiments and millions of testimonials affirm. Consciousness
cann=
ot, therefore, be identical with the brain.

Others suggest that there are =
no mental states at all, such as love,
courage, or patriotism, but only ele=
ctrochemical brain fluxes that should
not be described with such inflated l=
anguage. They dismiss thoughts and
beliefs for the same reasons. This led N=
obel neurophysiologist Sir John
Eccles to remark that =E2=80=9Cprofessional=
 philosophers and psychologists think up
the notion that there are no thoug=
hts, come to believe that there are no
beliefs, and feel strongly that ther=
e are no feelings.=E2=80=9D Eccles was
emphasizing the absurdities that hav=
e crept into the debates about
consciousness. They are not hard to spot. So=
me of the oddest experiences I
recall are attending conferences where one s=
peaker after another employs
his consciousness to denounce the existence of=
 consciousness, ignoring the
fact that he consciously chose to register for=
 the meeting, make travel
plans, prepare his talks, and so on.

Many scient=
ists concede that there are huge gaps in their knowledge of how
the brain m=
akes consciousness, but they are certain they will be filled in
as science =
progresses. Eccles and philosopher of science Karl Popper
branded this atti=
tude =E2=80=9Cpromissory materialism.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9C[P]romissary materi=
alism
[is] a superstition without a rational foundation,=E2=80=9D Eccles sa=
ys. =E2=80=9C[It] is
simply a religious belief held by dogmatic materialist=
s . . .who confuse
their religion with their science. It has all the featur=
es of a messianic
prophecy.=E2=80=9D

The arguments about the origins and n=
ature of consciousness are central to
premonitions. For if the promissory m=
aterialists are correct =E2=80=93 if
consciousness is indeed identical with=
 the brain =E2=80=93 the curtain closes on
premonitions. The reason is that=
 the brain is a local phenomenon =E2=80=93 i.e., it
is localized to the bra=
in and body, and to the present. This prohibits
premonitions in principle, =
because accordingly the brain cannot operate
outside the body and the here-=
and-now. But consciousness can operate beyond
the brain, body, and the pres=
ent, as hundreds of experiments and millions
of testimonials affirm. Consci=
ousness cannot, therefore, be identical with
the brain.

In science, we hav=
e largely ignored how consciousness manifests in our
existence. We=E2=80=99=
ve done this by assuming that the brain produces
consciousness, although ho=
w it might do so has never been explained and can
hardly be imagined.

Thes=
e assertions are not hyperbolic, but conservative. They are consistent
with=
 the entire span of human history, throughout which all cultures of
which w=
e have record believed that human perception extends beyond the
reach of th=
e senses. This belief might be dismissed as superstition but for
the fact t=
hat modern research has established its validity beyond
reasonable doubt to=
 anyone whose reasoning has not clotted into hardened
skepticism. To reiter=
ate a single example =E2=80=93 the evidence supporting
foreknowledge =E2=80=
=93 psi researchers Charles Honorton and Diane Ferrari examined
309 precogn=
ition experiments carried out by sixty-two investigators
involving 50,000 p=
articipants in more than two million trials. Thirty
percent of these studie=
s were significant in showing that people can
describe future events, when =
only five percent would be expected to
demonstrate such results by chance. =
The odds that these results were not
due to chance was greater than 10 to t=
he twentieth power to one.

One of the first modern thinkers to endorse an =
outside-the-brain view of
consciousness was William James, who is considere=
d the father of American
psychology. In his 1898 Ingersoll Lecture at Harva=
rd University, James took
a courageous stand against what he called =E2=80=
=9Cthe fangs of cerebralism and the
idea that consciousness is produced by =
the brain. He acknowledged that
arrested brain development in childhood can=
 lead to mental retardation,
that strokes or blows to the head can abolish =
memory or consciousness, and
that certain chemicals can change the quality =
of thought. But to consider
this as proof that the brain actually makes con=
sciousness, James said, is
irrational.

[image: Why Consciousness is Not th=
e Brain - The Science of Premonitions -
Larry Dossey]

Why irrational? Cons=
ider a radio, an invention that was introduced during
James=E2=80=99s lifet=
ime, and which he used to illustrate the mind-brain
relationship. If one ba=
ngs a radio with a hammer, it ceases to function.
But that does not mean th=
at the origin of the sounds was the radio itself;
the sound originated from=
 outside it in the form of an electromagnetic
signal. The radio received, m=
odified, and amplified the external signal
into something recognizable as s=
ound. Just so, the brain can be damaged in
various ways that distort the qu=
ality of consciousness =E2=80=93 trauma, stroke,
nutritional deficiencies, =
dementia, etc. But this does not necessarily mean
the brain =E2=80=9Cmade=
=E2=80=9D the consciousness that is now disturbed, or that
consciousness is=
 identical to the brain.

British philosopher Chris Carter endorses this an=
alogy. Equating mind and
brain is irrational, he says as listening to music=
 on a radio, smashing the
radio=E2=80=99s receiver, and thereby concluding =
that the radio was producing the
music.

To update the analogy, consider a =
television set. We can damage a
television set so severely that we lose the=
 image on the screen, but this
doesn=E2=80=99t prove that the TV actually p=
roduced the image. We know that David
Letterman does not live behind the TV=
 screen on which he appears; yet the
contention that brain equals conscious=
ness is as absurd as if he did.

My conclusion is that consciousness is not=
 a thing or substance, but is a
nonlocal phenomenon. Nonlocal is merely a f=
ancy word for infinite. If
something is nonlocal, it is not localized to sp=
ecific points in space,
such as brains or bodies, or to specific points in =
time, such as the
present.

The radio and TV analogies can be misleading, h=
owever, because
consciousness does not behave like an electromagnetic signa=
l.
Electromagnetic (EM) signals display certain characteristics. The farthe=
r
away they get from their source, the weaker they become. Not so with
cons=
ciousness; its effects do not attenuate with increasing distance. For
examp=
le, in the hundreds of healing experiments that have been done in both
huma=
ns and animals, healing intentions work equally well from the other
side of=
 the earth as at the bedside of the sick individual. Moreover, EM
signals c=
an be blocked partially or completely, but the effects of
conscious intenti=
on cannot be blocked by any known substance. For instance,
sea water is kno=
wn to block EM signals completely at certain depths, yet
experiments in rem=
ote viewing have been successfully carried out beyond
such depths, demonstr=
ating that the long-distance communication between the
involved individuals=
 cannot depend on EM-type signals. In addition, EM
signals require travel t=
ime from their source to a receiver, yet thoughts
can be perceived simultan=
eously between individuals across global
distances. Thoughts can be displac=
ed in time, operating into both past and
future. In precognitive remoteview=
ing experiments =E2=80=93 for example, the
hundreds of such experiments by =
the PEAR Lab at Princeton University =E2=80=93 the
receiver gets a future t=
hought before it is ever sent. Furthermore,
consciousness can operate into =
the past, as in the experiments involving
retroactive intentions. Electroma=
gnetic signals are not capable of these
feats. From these differences, we c=
an conclude that consciousness is not an
electric signal.

Then what is it?=
 My conclusion is that consciousness is not a thing or
substance, but is a =
*nonlocal* phenomenon.*Nonlocal* is merely a fancy word
for *infinite*. If =
something is nonlocal, it is not localized to specific
points in space, suc=
h as brains or bodies, or to specific points in time,
such as the present. =
Nonlocal events are *immediate*; they require no
travel time. They are unme=
diated; they require no energetic signal to
=E2=80=9Ccarry=E2=80=9D them. T=
hey are*unmitigated*; they do not become weaker with
increasing distance. N=
onlocal phenomena are *omnipresent*, everywhere at
once. This means there i=
s no necessity for them to go anywhere; they are
already there. They are in=
finite in time as well, present at all moments,
past present and future, me=
aning they are *eternal*.

Researcher Dean Radin, whose presentiment experi=
ments provide profound
evidence for future knowing, believes that the nonlo=
cal events in the
subatomic, quantum domain underlie the nonlocal events we=
 experience at the
human level. He invokes the concept of entanglement as a=
 bridging
hypothesis uniting the small- and large-scale happenings. Quantum=

entanglement and quantum nonlocality are indeed potent possibilities that
=
may eventually explain our nonlocal experiences, but only further research
=
will tell. Meanwhile, there is a gathering tide of opinion favoring these
a=
pproaches. As physicist Chris Clarke, of the University of Southampton,
say=
s, =E2=80=9COn one hand, Mind is inherently non-local. On the other, the wo=
rld
is governed by a quantum physics that is inherently non-local. This is =
no
accident, but a precise correspondence ...[Mind and the world are] aspec=
ts
of the same thing...The way ahead, I believe, has to place mind first as=

the key aspect of the universe...We have to start exploring how we can tal=
k
about mind in terms of a quantum picture...Only then will we be able to
m=
ake a genuine bridge between physics and physiology.=E2=80=9D

When scienti=
sts muster the courage to face this evidence unflinchingly, the
greatest su=
perstition of our age =E2=80=93 the notion that the brain generates
conscio=
usness or is identical with it =E2=80=93 will topple. In its place will
ari=
se a nonlocal picture of the mind.

Whatever their explanation proves to be=
, the experiments documenting
premonitions are real. They must be reckoned =
with. And when scientists
muster the courage to face this evidence unflinch=
ingly, the greatest
superstition of our age =E2=80=93 the notion that the b=
rain generates consciousness
or is identical with it =E2=80=93 will topple.=
 In its place will arise a nonlocal
picture of the mind. This view will aff=
irm that consciousness is
fundamental, omnipresent and eternal =E2=80=93 a =
model that is as cordial to
premonitions as the materialistic, brain-based =
view is hostile.

e of the first modern thinkers to endorse an outside-the-brain view of cons=

urageous stand against what he called =E2=80=9Cthe fangs of cerebralism and=
 the idea that consciousness is produced by the brain. He acknowledged that=
 arrested brain development in childhood can lead to mental retardation, th=
at strokes or blows to the head can abolish memory or consciousness, and th=
at certain chemicals can change the quality of thought. But to consider thi=
s as proof that the brain actually makes consciousness, James said, is irra=

analogies can be misleading, however, because consciousness does not behave=
 like an electromagnetic signal. Electromagnetic (EM) signals display certa=
in characteristics. The farther away they get from their source, the weaker=
 they become. Not so with consciousness; its effects do not attenuate with =
increasing distance. For example, in the hundreds of healing experiments th=
at have been done in both humans and animals, healing intentions work equal=
ly well from the other side of the earth as at the bedside of the sick indi=
vidual. Moreover, EM signals can be blocked partially or completely, but th=
e effects of conscious intention cannot be blocked by any known substance. =
For instance, sea water is known to block EM signals completely at certain =
depths, yet experiments in remote viewing have been successfully carried ou=
t beyond such depths, demonstrating that the long-distance communication be=
tween the involved individuals cannot depend on EM-type signals. In additio=
n, EM signals require travel time from their source to a receiver, yet thou=

ances. Thoughts can be displaced in time, operating into both past and futu=
re. In precognitive remoteviewing experiments =E2=80=93 for example, the hu=
ndreds of such experiments by the PEAR Lab at Princeton University =E2=80=
=93 the receiver gets a future thought before it is ever sent. Furthermore,=
 consciousness can operate into the past, as in the experiments involving r=
