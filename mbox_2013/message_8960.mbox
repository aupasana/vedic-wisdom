namaste,

There are many traditional texts which encourge us to do 1008 repetitions
of the gayatri per sitting, i.e. 3000 repetitions per day. At a half a
minute per repetition, it would take 1500 minutes. The only problem is that
there are only 1440 minuted in a day :-).

You are right ... for spiritual progress, the absolute number is not
important. Day by day, each of us tries to spend more time in better
quality sadhana. That is all that matters.


> Number is not really a big consideration.


If, at the same pace, someone doubles the number of repetitions, there is a
good chance that their personal progress will also speed up. Though the
absolute numbers don't matter, the relative numbers certainly do.

The size of the fire matters. The amount of time spent in sadhana matters.
The cleanliness of thoughts matters.


> at which 5 places do we need to stop


There are three parts in the gayatri mantra. Some people add two more --
"aum" and "bhuuH...". Basically, you are asked to stop at the end of each
part. With 5 parts, you have 5 pauses.

Some people may recite the mantra without pauses (In fact, this is
specifically done in some daily rituals like brahma-yagya). In that case,
the mantra is recited slightly differently ... there are minor changes to
the svaras when there are no pauses.

sasneham,

   ajit
