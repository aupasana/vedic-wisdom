for these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known a=
s Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one =
whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in =
the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhai=
rava has been
 invoked for centuries
 by
 followers of Shakta/Aghor traditi=
ons for protection against spirits, and specially during rituals
 of cremat=

>>>>>
>>>>>Generally, at least 10/11 m=
alas of the same should be done in one sitting. And this should be continue=
d daily till such time that there is some visible relief. One more thing is=
 that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit possession, as far a=
s I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorc=
ist from a distance. These days almost no one has that kind of terrific sha=
kti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physical presence in fron=
t of the victim is a must for the one trying to help.=C2=A0So close family =
members, who live with the girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go thro=
ugh the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing =
homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not b=
e that easy.
>>>>>
>>>>>If the family visits India, then I have a suggestio=
n. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the K=
alabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the =
main priest stating the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many ex=
cellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of ne=
gative influence. They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask=
 the parents and the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific=
 day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know ha=
ve actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other meth=
ods too. I just wrote what came to my mind.

 any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not depends on mu=

t their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root=
, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person.
 =
Sometimes it can be
 something
 as simple as spitting somewhere (where this=
 being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their territory and being sus=
ceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in=
 some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an i=
ndividual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop =
method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the sha=
kti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are a=
ble to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a =
violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to r=
emove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.
>>>>>
>>>>>T=
hese things like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall=
 under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getti=
ng into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay awa=
y. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to
 handle =
the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time till w=
hich, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the i=
ndividual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some =
not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit.=
 It is all a complex chain.
>>>>>
>>>>>[Reminds me of a particular individu=
al I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting=
 any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well =
as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the =
previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit a=
nd do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free =
will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove=
 it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a=
 very violent nature, force had to be applied.]
>>>>>
>>>>>Best thing to do=
 is a) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession a=
nd hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family=
 members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, C=
handi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and d=
o it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a =
10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of p=
ossession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with =
the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very =
end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then=
 either make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him=

an>I just thought of adding some clarifications.</span></div>

<div><span><=
/span> </div><div><span>First of all, when I mentioned about the utili=
ty of techniques of "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression" for handling =
the problem of spirit attachments as well as many other problems for which =
we do not have reasonable explanation, my assertions were limited to
 the u=
tility part only and not beyond that. I have no knowledge about whether pas=
t life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledge about anything wh=
atsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...T=
he Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the=
 term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still continue with l=
ife irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. Though we=
 know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but it is the=
 other way around, still we use sentences like "Sun rises in the east"=
, "Sun sets in the west" etc. To keep life going, we keep on cont=
inuing with activities which helps in keeping life go on...It is in this se=
nse that I'd mentioned about "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression".</sp=
an></div>

<div><span></span> </div><div><span>One should not comment =
about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full o=
f infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just can=
 not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited ways. Befor=
e anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one mus=
t first take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to sa=
y that if one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one would de=
finitely be convinced about the same. By saying that one shouldn't mak=
e comments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that by doi=
ng so one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only =
blind belief in religion and religious practices can be termed as dogm=
atic but also in
 science if one loses the scientific temper.</span></div><=
div><span></span> </div><div><span>Proof of pudding is in eating it, a=
ll that I can say to the persons willing to address any of their problems. =
"Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression" have immense utility for tho=
se who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind. Those w=
ho are interested can read " Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss" to st=
art with.</span></div>

<div><span></span> </div><div><span>To respect=
ed Narasimha sir, I would like to inform that these are not "new age ideas"=
. These were there much before in India.
 to cite concept of "Jaati Smaran"=
 of Jainism is one among them. Jainas used this technique of "Jaati Smaran"=
 to reinforce renunciation in the
 followers.</span></div><div><span></span=
> </div><div><span>To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that s=
o far as my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over =
phone, but however, there are so many problems which can be handled even ov=
er phone. To cite one example - One girl was having one recurrent bad =
horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she approached me for the trea=
tment. But due to my official engagements I was camping at a far =
off place for around 2 months. Her problem was getting worsened as it&=
nbsp;had  started affecting her professional career adversely. So havi=
ng left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone. The phon=
e session continued for around one and half an hour and she got relieved fr=
om her that recurrent dream
 and also started improving her
 professional l=
ife. Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.</span></div><d=
iv><span></span> </div><div><span>It all depends on the openness of th=
e mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. The universe is much mo=
re than what we see,what we can see and what we can believe to see.</span><=

Namaste,<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">To add to the complexity of t=
he problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over simpli=
fied and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the s=
oul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a =
role to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a =
life where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and s=
hine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process=
. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need=
.<br clear=3D"none">

<br clear=3D"none">The Buddhists do not believe in th=
e existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our ide=
a of Atmah.
 Therefore
 their idea of reincarnation
 is very different. It =
is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together
 to =
give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegra=
ted and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these ca=
n coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can=
 simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. &=
nbsp; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, =
to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while anothe=
r part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a=
 Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his en=
ergy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnati=
ng in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with t=
heir philosophy.<br clear=3D"none">

<br clear=3D"none">Those philosophies =
which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only =
as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of
 debts/balan=
ces - rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. =
The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move in=
to a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of an=
y final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciati=
on of life and its processes.<br clear=3D"none">

<br clear=3D"none">But th=
e old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved=
 at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to anoth=
er and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul=
's influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body veh=
icle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique s=
oul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to=
 *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Li=
fe. </span><span><span> A Supreme Negation of life is 
not the ultimat=
e aim, it is only one among many possibilities.  If  moving into =
a state 
of complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitabl=
e aim,
 then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform com=
plex
 life-actions. </span>The law of Karma is here too, but it is not rest=
ricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the ide=
a of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the s=
oul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes th=
e karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and=
 real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have kille=
d hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did no=
t have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of t=
hose he had killed]. </span><span>Whereas those aspects of life 
where the =
soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by 
the law of rn=
abandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. </span></div><div style=
