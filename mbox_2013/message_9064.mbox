My idea was to do the homam as a prayer rather than as an act of my persona=
l will to cure. It was more to say "Thy will be done, not my will be done. =
But please consider healing this person, or giving them the strength to bea=
r this suffering which is awful". 

I wasn't planning to cure her by doing =
the homam. I wanted to do the homam as a worship of God, and ask Him to int=
ervene in whatever way He thinks best. I can understand that if I willfully=
 interfere in someone's karma, then that would be wrong as I do not have th=
e wisdom or the right to do that. 

But surely I have the right to pray to =
God to alleviate the suffering of others, just as I would pray for the reli=
ef of my own suffering. I would hope that if I were unfortunate enough to b=
e in her shoes oneday, somebody would take pity on me, and pray to God for =
me too. Do as you would be done by as they say. 

If it is God's will that =
her suffering must continue, then so be it. But one has to try to alleviate=
 it- it is impossible to do nothing. If her karma comes to me, then so be i=
t. I'll trust in God to guide me. :p 

Incidentally, my father recently had=
 a severe heart attack and I had to visit India to care for him on emergenc=
y leave(last month). I did Mahamrityunjaya homam on his behalf, and also ja=
pa for his physical, mental and spiritual well-being- asking God to help me=
 accept whatever happens. Through God's Grace he is recovering well. I do p=
ray that my faith grows stronger day-by-day regardless of the good and bad =
that happens to me. If I didn't care about my father's karma coming to me, =
I shouldn't care about this woman's karma coming to me either as, on a spir=
itual level, she is family too. :)
 
My thanks to you and to the others who=
 have replied too. Very helpful insights, and good advice regarding diet an=
d lifestyle measures to calm the nervous system and deranged kundalini.
