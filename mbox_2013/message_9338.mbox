Ramayan, text that introduced Lord Rama to the world! Masterpiece by
Maharishi Valmiki that keeps enlightening the world even after thousands of
years! Commentary of world famous epic Ramayan in Hindi by Late Swami
Jagdishwaranand Saraswati that dispels all myths and removes interpolated
verses and interpretations that denigrate the greatest role model known to
humanity.

Read and realize why Lord Rama was hailed as Maryada Purushottam (Best
among self-controlled noble humans).

Jai Shri Ram!



Do you know that in Mahabharat:

Lord Krishna was the greatest icon of self-control. The stories of his
romantic flirting with Gopis and women is a disgusting myth denigrating
character of perhaps the greatest role model of history.

Draupadi had only one husband. The propagated story of 5 husbands of
Draupadi is a myth based on fake verses to denigrate our role models.

Lord Krishna never performed any miracles to win battles or impress people.
Instead, this wizard used his sharp intellect and technology to create
success from most impossible situations.

Read this translation to dispel all myths and be proud of our real
heritage. We present Hindi translation of the accounts of world's greatest
battle found in the recorded human history! First text that introduced Lord
Krishna to humanity! All the interpolated verses have been meticulously
removed by the Translator Late Swami Jagdishwarananda Saraswati, renowned
Vedic Scholar, to make sure that people know their true history and are not
misguided by notions based on myths. A gem that shuns the popular
misconceptions regarding Mahabharat.
