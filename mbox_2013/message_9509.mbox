My two cents on similar lines,

When something is stolen, it means, you are=
 not able to access and utilize
it. For example, if your car is stolen then=
 you will not be able to access
it or use it. Extending the same analogy to=
 vedas, when vedas were stolen,
it meant people were not able to put it to =
use. As it is happening in
current time, Vedas are lost over a period of ti=
me. Or in other words, it
is stolen by the Devil (collective cosmic conscio=
usness of all the bad
qualities in humans) in the course of time.

The stea=
ling can have also manifested by mental conditioning wherein human
race sei=
zes to have faith in Vedas and its philosophy. Those who truly
believe in V=
edas and philosophy of Karma, they don't fall prey to bad
habits because th=
ey know that karma is accruing somewhere to be repent
later in this birth o=
r next one. Out of mental conditioning people lose
faith in Vedas and it re=
sults in manifestation of several evil qualities in
them. Collectively it c=
an be called the Devil has taken over and Vedas are
'stolen'.

In order to =
rescue, the divine consciousness manifests through Krishna or
Matsya or Ram=
 or Kalkin and teaches the path of righteousness and Dharma.
This results i=
n people regaining faith in Vedas and its philosophies.
