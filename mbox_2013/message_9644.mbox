Thank you so much for your encouragement and sharing your experience with d=
oing homams, Srinivas Sir. I don't feel so bad now.

I'm glad you understan=
d how daunting it can be. For two years, I kept circling back to Narasimha =
Sir's website! I was very happy to discover it but at the same time very ve=
xed. At that time, I did not know this group existed. I was looking at a lo=
t of past messages, I see a lot of support among members. Anyway, better la=
te than never. I love our Prayers and Scriptures and may be familiar with t=
hem but it is very difficult for me to be fluent and knowledgeable in them.=
 I put myself at 10%, I wish to reach 80%! I wish I can read and understand=
 them in Sanskrit. 

Actually, I took a look at the iTrans as suggested by =
Narasimha Sir but I could not understand how to work it properly, so I gave=
 up on that. So right now, I'm in the midst of hyphenating difficult words.=
 The way I'm doing it is by using Abby screenreader and take a snapshot of =
the Sanskrit words, take it to Adobe Photoshop, separating the test into se=
parate layers and adding text to the words I want. It's a laborious process=
 but I think I should be done tomorrow. I'll then post it. I'll also listen=
 to the MP3 side by side with it, to aid my progress. 

As you say, with de=
dication, Lord Ganesha's help will arrive for  where I need to improve it. =
Thanks again.

Alamelu
