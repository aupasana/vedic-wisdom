Dear Ajit,

Thanks for the explanations. Very interesting.

This reminds me=
 of an incident with a good friend of mine. There is an individual I know, =
who had never chanted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever. He used to feel, as =
per his own confession, no special love or attraction for this mantra and b=
eing born in a non-brahmin family, there was no religious-cultural occasion=
 where he was formally introduced to this mantra. 

One day while meditatin=
g on some Tantrik mantras, he got a random inspiration to meditate on the G=
ayatri mantra. He had a vague idea of what the Gayatri mantra meant, and no=
 idea at all of correct swara or intonation. So he started chanting, mental=
ly and soundlessly, the Savitur Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 japa=
s of the mantra, he felt/saw - and I describe it as he told me - an unbroke=
n steam of tremendous, pure, flood of Golden Light above his head. Like a w=
orld above and outside our world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The eve=
ntual idea, he told me, was to enter into that stream of Light above and se=
e things from that perspective. But as long as there are impurities in the =
mind and body, it is not possible to enter into that realm easily. The guna=
s must be in a stable equilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor the i=
mpatience of rajas is conducive for it, but the stable, illuminating, self-=
assurance of satwa leading to a deeper
 equanimity in mind and life is need=
ed.

Apparently, he also realized that there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma=
 which serve a similar purpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take a person to=
 the spiritual planes above.

So I asked him why did you not continue the m=
editation or japa of Gayatri mantra, since there was a nice experience. He =
said it would have pulled him in and he would not have been able to continu=
e the spiritual practices which he was already doing for some time, and lea=
ving something half way is not good.


Reading the explanation your provide=
d below, that is : 

"We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prach=
odayaat) our (naH) 
thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. =
Without his 
light, we would not be able to distinguish different objects. =
This is 
explained in the Aitaterya Upanishad=C2=A0=E2=80=9CThe sun, having=
 become eyesight, 
entered the eyes=E2=80=9D. He thus blesses all living be=
ings."

.. matches with the description that I had heard from my friend. Qu=
ite interesting!

-Regards
