I enjoyed reading the conversation between student and teacher....very funn=
y. Poor student! Not easy, the spirtual life.

On the topic of sleep, I tho=
ught I would try to practice the first of Swami Sivananada's 20 spiritual i=
nstructions (which he says leads to liberation) on Sunday. i.e. wake up at =
4 am, Brahmamuhurta (the idea being to meditate of course). I usually wake =
at 6:30. My plan was to cut down sleep to 6 hours in the new year (I normal=
ly sleep 7-8 hrs).

It was a bit over ambitious, and I ended up with a migr=
aine that lasted 2 days (am prone to these, especially when sleep is poor).=
 Needless to say, meditation/japa was impossible, and my good intentions ba=
ckfired badly. 

So I agree that one ought not oversleep. But one should ta=
ke great care while cutting down...basically do it gradually.

My policy is=
 now to get to bed early i.e. around 10 pm, so I naturally wake up at 4 am =
feeling fresh. I notice I wake early without needing an alarm when I go to =
bed by 10. I tend to need about 7 hours sleep though.

Celibacy is an inter=
esting one. Especially, if you're into it and your other half isn't. Of cou=
rse it isn't fair to impose celibacy on others so sexual restraint rather t=
han complete celibacy may be the best that some of us can aim for. 

Aparna=
