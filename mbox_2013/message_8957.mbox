It depends on one's anusandhana (i.e. the meaning and the form one meditate=
s upon during Japa).
Whats slow for one is just right for another.
It takes=
 half a min for me too as Gayatri as one such special Mantra loaded with me=
anings that has to be "chewed" well and the form has to be fully visualized=
.
Number is not really a big consideration.
Getting the state of mind where=
 other thoughts are zero and totally being lost in the mantra and dhyeya ru=
pa becomes important.

Also, I think it is Brihadaranyaka Upanishat that te=
lls one has to stop Gayatri at 5 places during each chant. Add that up and =
30 seconds is not really a big thing :-)

Regards,
Srikanth
