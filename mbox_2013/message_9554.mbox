Dear Sir,=A0

How are you? My name is Shathish and im from Malaysia. Im cur=
rently 28 years old and single. I came across of your Ganapathy Homam video=
 couple months a ago and it caught my attention seriously =A0until it becam=
e my passion to perform it.

I went and consulted few priest in the temples=
 and most of them discouraged me as they told me i need to learn the mantha=
rs and im not eligible for it. Moreover, i went through many obstacles to p=
erform this Ganapathy Homam for the last 6 months. Finally, upon God`s grac=
e i managed to prepared myself for it smoothly and came up to conclusion to=
 perform this Ganapthy Homam =A0for 60 days. As for this the protocols are =
being setup such ways below;
-Renting a house separately for 2 months
-Boug=
ht all the materials needed for the Homam
-Fasting with breakfast one type =
of fruit and milk(eat after served in front of Lord Ganesha during Homam). =
Lunch would be one small plate of steamed Green Gram and dinner would be on=
e fruit and one tumbler of cow milk. All this will be cook and prepared my =
ownslef as im staying alone
-Sleeping using a mat and pillowed with paper w=
rapped with dhoti
-No entertainments such as movies, radio stations, cinema=
s, smoking, consuming alcohol, etc.
-Only listen to Bhajans, Manthras and r=
ead Hinduisme articles
-Wearing Malai( a type of holy chain worn around dur=
ing fastings) to control all my senses
- No cutting finger nails and hair f=
or this 2 months
-Wash my own clothes


The procedures applies the same of =
yours from the beginning till the end. yhe additional part is the manthars =
as flow below;
-Ganapathy Shodaspachara with Narayana Suktham (16 services)=

-Ganapathy Moola Manthra 12X ( Aum Gam Ganapathye....)
-Ganapathy Moola Ma=
nthra 12X ( Aum Gajanam Tuah Ganapatim Hava..)
-Ganpathy Stotram 3X
-Ganapa=
thy Atharavaseerasham 3X
-Ganapathy Kaari Sakti Malai 21X

I bought all the=
 additional materials needed such as honey,sesame seeds, some murmura, some=
 nuts,popped corn and other materials that can be offered in fire. for the =
daily basis i buy flowers and arugumpul (sacred grass for Lord Vinayaka)Mor=
eover, for Poornahuti i will put a whole cocunut with few coins, 9 navagani=
s(types of beans used for prayers), coins, and with vibuthi, kunkumum, sand=
al wood powder, turmeric powder, etc.

I have full support from my parents.=
 They like pillars to me in this matter. In fact i do have a Brahmin Iyer c=
hildhood friend who clears my doubt when it comes to Ganapathy Homam. He is=
 the one who prepares all the dharbas for me, teaches me other important ab=
out Homam, teaches me how to maintain the fire. Additioanlly, he is the one=
 who suggest me to put water Pot and bath with it every morning. All this h=
appens because of Lord Ganesha. In fact, my family, friends, and other are =
astonished of my actions. I took 6 months to learn all the manthars and act=
ions of this homam from the manual and the videos.

Even though i fall easi=
ly tired because im working and fasting but in the end it gives me a kind o=
f pleasure and self-satisfaction of the Homam completion.Its just sometimes=
 the intonation and the pronunciation compared to yours will be different. =
Sometimes the coconut that i put for Poornahuti will not crack till end. So=
metimes i miss certain rituals. These are things actually makes me upset be=
cause i want to do it perfectly. Whatever it is, my devotion to LORD GANESH=
A is divine.

As im sending this email to you today it has been 21 days of =
performing the Ganesha Homam and 39 days to go on. On the 56th day of this =
Homam will be the VInayagar Chathurti day which falls 9th September 2013. I=
m doing this =A0as iam not expecting much from this outcome rather want to =
challenge myself from being discipline and after the 60th day i want my lif=
e to have better enhancement and all ways.

Finally what i would like to ex=
tend is my gratitude to you is there is no common word as THANK YOU to you =
as you have taught me something which is been hiding for thousands of years=
 from eye of public. Every beginning of the Homam i think of you and your f=
amily in well-being, off course Dr. Manish Pandit, all the Gurus,Pandits, =
=A0Rishis, Mahans, Munis, Thevargals, etc.


Thank You so much Mr.PVR Naras=
imha Rao.

Keep in touch :)

Regards,
Shathish Rengayan
Selangor, Malaysia.
