Om Gurave Namah=C2=A0

Respected Narasimha Ji=C2=A0

I am really grateful t=
o yo from my heart =C2=A0for clarification . We have learnt so much from yo=
u .One more piece of advise ...I studied in manuals that havan should nt be=
 performed in iron kund (saturn =C2=A0).My room where I have been performin=
g homam , has all residues of black smoke (Should I also take it as indicat=
ion of saturn )..I really wonder how people manage to do homam daily withou=
t room turning black due to smoke ...Should I get it painted ....

But I ha=
ve gained one benefit at physical level from homam , without worrying about=
 room turning black ...I visited eye specialist and he informed me my eye s=
ight has improved ...He asked me any special diet ..and it was only homam t=
hat I did ...that my eye sight number improved after almost 15 years ...

A=
lso , one more question ..how studying Of jyotish shastra elevates our soul=
 . Does it or not ..

We get knowledge about tithis and muhurats and consci=
ousness expands as we dont judge people or circumstances ...Its part of jan=
ana yoga ..But once we have understood the things =C2=A0, does studying ast=
rology help at spritual level ?? Sometimes , I=C2=A0
really get confused an=
d I feel I should stop studying astrology books till I really practice medi=
tation , homam and evolve my soul ...and get=C2=A0my answers in meditation =
...

Regards=C2=A0
Spritual seeker .

Dear Rajarshi,

"Devil" is quite resourceful these days, even without a learned "adv=
ocate" like you! ;-)
=C2=A0
Yes, you are fundamentally correct - in the end=
, rituals are filled with symbols and repeated mental associations result i=
n external actions/factors resonating internally in particular ways. Ritual=
s are indeed mind games geared towards eventually evolving a useful mental =
reality.

=C2=A0
At the same time, things are not completely arbitrary eith=
er, i.e. the symbols are not just empty symbols. There is some basic struct=
ure to things. The process of evolving our mental reality is not 100% under=
 our control and needs to obey some basic cosmic laws, many of which may no=
t yet be apparent to our limited minds.=C2=A0

Yes, w=
ater and air may be symbols of divinity too, but fire IS different. Continu=
ed visualization of divine presence in water or air, though possible, requi=
res far more effort from us than in fire. Anyone meditating in front of hom=
am fire should know it.

=C2=A0
There is a story in Ma=
habharata. When Indra gets the terrible sin of Brahma hatya (killing a know=
er of Self) for killing Vritra, Brahma asks him to share it with some other=
 deities who will then distribute it among people when they do certain bad =
acts. Among those distributors is Agni. Agni was asked to pass on parts of =
his portion of the sin to people whose offerings in a fire ritual are unbur=
nt and flames go off.
=C2=A0
If there are still flames, it means there are =
offerings that can burn further. If one extinguishes the flames, one theore=
tically gets a part of the sin of
 Brahma hatya. :-(
=C2=A0

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =
*
=C2=A0
Of course, this makes some intuitive sense. If I am able to percei=
ve various divine entities within myself, I don't need fire ritual. Because=
 I am unable to do so, I am taking help from Agni, the "original Priest" of=
 Veda, and seeking his help to allow me to perceive various divine entities=
 in Him. This priest obliges anybody who seeks such help without asking que=
stions or charging any fee and the least you can do is to let him eat in pe=
ace what you yourself served him in the first place and allow him to leave =
by Himself! If you "kill" the priest who facilitated your worship by summon=
ing deities within him, of course it makes sense why it should be akin to "=
Brahma hatya"..
=C2=A0
BTW, if you extinguished homam fire forcefully befor=
e, don't worry too much. Agni distributes his portion of the Brahma hatya s=
in among so many that it's quite diluted. We anyway do commit so many sins.=
 Nevertheless, don't knowingly do it anymore, for things can add up.
=C2=A0=

Bottomline: As most of you know, I am quite a liberal guy when it comes to=
 orthodoxy in rituals. However, IMHO, extinguishing homam fire forcefully i=
s a serious matter and avoidable. Please try to avoid it. At least, don't t=
each others that it's ok.

Water has a diffe=
