Tarjini (index finger) represents one's ego/Ahamkara hence while doing Jaap=

with beads, bead should not touch index finger. This I understand from
tra=
dition. When we point index figner towards somebody it symbolizes our
inten=
se ego. Thats the reason while meditation we restrain index finger
from poi=
nting towards cosmos.
