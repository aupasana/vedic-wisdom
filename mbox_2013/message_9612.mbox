Namaste Sir,

A possession by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is always a ver=
y serious matter. For there are various classes and kinds and types of enti=
ties which can possess an individual and some of them can be downright nast=
y.

Upayas are many. As so many different people have advised, these all sa=
dhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actually=
 work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, the=
re is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/=
being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link for the same is. =
By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what ac=
tion allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be something a=
s simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or causally en=
tering into their territory and being susceptible to such possession by cer=
tain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entities ar=
e deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be th=
e source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handling su=
ch a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the
 amount=
 of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate in order to remov=
e the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent =
nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/=
she may come to serious harm.

These things like removing possession are sp=
ecializations. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless =
one knows well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common=
 sense would do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and on=
e must know well how to handle the same too. Again if a spirit is removed b=
y force before the time till which, based on previous karma, it was suppose=
d to be in possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic =
chain which will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person w=
ho tried to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.

[Reminds me of a=
 particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism.=
 But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about=
 the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in po=
ssession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim.=
 Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the b=
ody of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Ne=
ver trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases wher=
e the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]

Best t=
hing to do is a) find someone who knows exactly how to deal with spirit pos=
session and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, a=
sk family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava=
, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better=
) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which =
means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the de=
gree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadh=
ana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to =
the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot,=
 and then either make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle =
it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. 

Best of luck and may God hel=
p the family.

-Regards

Dear Bhupendraji,

I feel the family should recite if possib=
le whole Chandi-Path for few days or at least the Chandi-Kavach everyday (i=
ts better if they take sankalpa everyday before beginning that they are cha=
nting to protect the girl from all negative energies, beings etc and free h=

Namaste Bhupendra ji,

I pity the =
family and also the girl. Try calling rudraksha-ratna....they deal with sev=
ere voodoo/black magic cases and might be able to help. Alternatively did y=
ou try homams? Long time back I had moved to an apartment which was haunted=
. I cleansed it through rigorous prayers. =C2=A0I literally chanted god's n=
ame 24/7. I also know of someone who has/is tackling extremely dangerous bl=
ackmagic through regular homams. The details of her life will scare anyone.=
 Today she has reduced the impact drastically just with homams. =C2=A0

=C2=

I will send out my prayers to th=
e family.
Good luck and best regards,=C2=A0

Namaste All,
I am very interested in this ema=
il thread. I know of a family in Boston where one of the family members is =
posessed. I had asked for help in this forum but did not get any response. =
If someone could provide some guidance, that would be great.
The situation =
is very bad and the family is virtually broke becuase of this spending on m=
edical treatment because so far, no other help. In absence of any other sol=
ution,  this os being treated as medical condition.
Thanks, 
Bhupendra

Thanks, I will give it a try!

What about Ka=

 I've heard that it can repel spirits and ghosts. Can I chant these mantras=
 at night before going to sleep?

What about Kala Bhairava mantra? Can it be more efficient for a=
 long-time Shiva devotee? I've heard that it can repel spirits and ghosts. =
Can I chant these mantras at night before going to sleep?<br>
