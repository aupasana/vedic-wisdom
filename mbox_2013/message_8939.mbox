Me too enjoyed the conversation between guru-shishya !!! It surely clarifi=
ed some of my doubts (important ones).

 I tried limiting food, sleep and b=
eing celibate for a while now (since a year). Thus is my observation:

1. S=
leep: Logically the meditation itself should reduce our sleep requirements.=
 However, sleep increases in the early stages since meditation agitates the=
 mind initially. This continues till the mind gets into the habit of relaxi=
ng and being still. Once this barrier is crossed one can sleep for even les=
s than 6 hrs without side-effects.  
Quickfix: Somewhere i read tat sleepin=
g in a totally dark room helps improve the sleep quality and quickly get in=
to deep sleep. This also reduces the need to sleep for long hours. I sleep =
with a cloth wrapped around my eyes since its not possible to make my room =
totally dark.

2. Food: How much exactly should one eat so tat it is consid=
ered limited? While having food we normally burp at least twice or more. Th=
e first burp indicates that the stomach is half full and the second burp co=
mes when it is three-fourth full. Sadhaks should stop eating at the first b=
urp itself and drink water to fill the next quarter of the stomach. If one =
properly chews the food and eats slowly one will surely get these burps and=
 will not feel tired after having food. The second burp is a warning even f=
or the sansariks, they should stop eating at this point and leave the rest =
else they invite digestion related ailments in the long-run. (Source: Healt=
h in your hands book + Hathayoga Pradipika of Svataraman)

Nourishment: Mil=
k and clarified butter (Ghee) is a satvik food for sadhaks and also a good =
source of nourishment. One may also learn 'Kechari Mudra' which has a heali=
ng effect on the body. Meanwhile since spicy foods hamper progress, one may=
 gradually reduce its intake(since they agitate body, the mind also starts =
moving incessantly).

3.Celibacy: This seems to be the toughest of the thre=
e. Retaining the ojhas looks totally tricky since we lose it during sleep w=
ithout warning. Doing 'Pada Paschimottanasana' from 30 seconds to 15 minute=
s everyday enhances the retention ability and also cleans our nadis. Amla C=
hoorn is to be mixed with rock candy in the ratio of 1:2. One tablespoon of=
 this mixture can be taken half an hour before sleep along with water. This=
 not only increases retention power but also drives away wet dreams and the=
 veerya is cleansed. (Source: Magazine by Asharam Bapuji).
Married: Vajroli=
 Mudra (or vajroli kriya or bandha) helps to get orgasm without ejecting an=
d thereby protecting the ojhas even while satisfying the partner. Since one=
 does not eject one does not get easily tired and sadhana is not much affec=
ted. However, learning this technique is a painstaking process and requires=
 complete cooperation of the partner.

I request that experts of this group=
 enlighten people with regard to the techniques used by them to overcome th=
ese factors.
