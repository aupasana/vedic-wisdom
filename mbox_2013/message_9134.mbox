Dear Narsimhaji,

Thank you sooo much for sharing this.I cannot claim an=
ything much spiritually but yes, you have articulated exactly how I feel. I=
 wonder at how sure I was about things earlier,and how I cannot get into ar=
guments anymore because my thought is "what exactly is the whole truth?'.St=
rangely, I have become more vocal and firm when I feel something is wrong.I=
 lacked this confidence earlier.
Because of my husbands profession,I am req=
uired to socialize a lot and often feel as if I am disconnected and watchin=
g a film.Every second person sings songs about his achievements and greatne=
ss-all I can do is nod and smile (which incidently is enough encouragement =
for them to go on!). I feel like an outsider (though that doesn't upset me =
in any way). I do worry about how we will continue for several years more w=
ithout paying a price professionally.But I am grateful for "Their" grace an=
d am confident that "They" will give us the wisdom to deal with it.

Regard=
s,
Tilottama
