I agree with you 100%. I enjoyed reading your line - "This forgetfulness pr=
olongs the game very much and makes it far more interesting."

There are ma=

I know those who are excited by these new age ideas=

 me state my view.

=C2=A0
It is possible to remember past life. 
However, =
if such memory does not come at a very young age due to some deep 
desires =
from past life or an unnatural death before, it is not easy to get it later=
. Even for a great yogi with tremendous self-control, calming the mind down=
 to suppress 
current conditioning sufficiently to remember past life is no=
t easy.
=C2=A0
For example, at least 3 saints/yogis of a high spiritual cal=
iber claimed to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. If such sain=
ts cannot accurately know their own past life, anybody thinking that someon=
e else can make one aware of one's past life is just kidding oneself.
=C2=
=A0
Remembering past life or making someone else do so, is not at all easy.=
 In comparison, hallucinating that one remembered past life or making someo=
ne else 
hallucinate that one remembered past life, is certainly very easy!=
 In fact, I suspect that is what happens in most past life regressions..

=
=C2=A0
There is a deep reason why 
Nature has built this mechanism of forge=
tting a life when another life 
starts. Otherwise, this game will end very =
quickly. This forgetfulness prolongs the game very much and makes it far mo=
re interesting.

>>>If the family visits India, then I have a suggestion=
. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Ka=
labhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the m=

ellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of neg=

the parents and the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific =
day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know hav=

>>>A possession by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is always a =
very serious matter. For there are various classes and kinds and types of e=

>>>
>>>Upayas are many. As so many different people have advised, the=
se all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of them will=
 actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basic=
ally, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind of s=

same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of exactl=
y what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be
 s=
omething
 as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
=
 causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to such posse=
ssion by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where such=
 entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Wh=
atever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removing and=
 handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and=
 the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate in ord=
er to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely =
malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an adept i=
n this, he/she may come to serious harm.
>>>
>>>These things like removing =
possession are specializations. These do not fall under the ambit of normal=
 sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with =
even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every action has its re=
percussion and one must know well how to
 handle the same too. Again
 if a =
spirit is removed by force before the time till which, based on previous ka=
rma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individual, then that too s=
tarts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pleasant consequenc=
es for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain=
.
>>>
>>>[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some years ago who w=
as an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask his=
 Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame for which th=
e spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmic link between t=
he spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice =
the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promising good deeds for=
 the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it wo=
uld work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force ha=
d to be applied.]
>>>
>>>Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who knows exa=
ctly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the ev=
ent the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of=
 any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanum=
ana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient=
 force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa=
 may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may have to spe=

mination to see this through to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep =
a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the possessed individ=

 to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of th=

 the same should be done in one sitting. And this should be continued daily=
 till such time that there is some visible relief. One more thing is that, =
IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit possession, as far as I hav=
e seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist fro=
m a distance. These days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to =
cure a case of possession from a distance. Physical presence in front of th=
e victim is a must for
 the one trying to help. So close family member=
s, who live with the girl
 will
 have to do the sadhana. If you go through =
the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homa=
s with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be th=
at easy.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">If the family visits India, t=
hen I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and t=
hen go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside th=
e temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these two tem=
ples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in r=
emoving any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fee for t=
he ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some specific =
samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their r=
ituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure =
their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. <br clear=
