The shifting of the structure could have caused some change in the environm=
ental balance of the region. To mark the boundary, a temple was created so =
that out of respect or fear noboby breaches that spot. For centuries it had=
 worked well.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *


Speaking of Kaali and =
Her destruction, every act of destruction, which is one way of transformati=
on, is Her doing. Only when One can appreciate this entirely and completely=
, then one starts to appreciate Her a little bit. Which means not just this=
 tragedy, but in earlier eras when Hindu temples were destroyed that too wa=
s Her energy. 


Her vision is vast and far-reaching, impossible for the hu=
man mind and logic to fathom, Her reasons and intervention - even if painfu=
l and mostly tragic - is ALWAYS designed to start long term changes which i=
s not apparently understandable at that point by people. When we say She pu=
nishes evil, it is but a simplified moralistic understanding. She punishes =
none, She rewards none. She loves all, She is all, but neither Her love nor=
 Her favor clouds Her judgement on the Truth of things. To understand Her m=
otives, one has to raise oneself - by Her grace of course and sincere effor=
t - to Her real realm. The causal and greater-causal planes. Not easy. Not =
easy at all. She chooses whom She admits into Her domain and whom She allow=
s to languish in the delusions of the normal mind.=C2=A0

Yes, ALL destruct=
ion ANYWHERE of ANYTHING is by Her energy. But never be in a hurry to judge=
. The mind cannot fathom Her reasons. One has to go way way beyond the norm=
al mind to have Her range and depth of Vision. When She sees a person or a =
place or a situation, She sees not just that moment but the build up to the=
 moment from an ancient past, what it was for fantastic length of time in p=
reviously and what it can become, if Her energy intervenes at that instant,=
 for fantastic lengths of time in the future. Human minds simply have no cl=
ue of this kind of an all encompassing vision. All we can do is create and =
manufacture reasons based on our own conditioning and beliefs, or self-delu=
de ourselves into believing we have understood Her. She destroys what is no=
t conducive for large-scale spiritual growth, or adharma, but the judgement=
 is entirely Hers. What we believe to be dharma and adharma is more often a=
n over simplified perspective, rarely cosmic or
 universal in nature. Until=
 the mind expands and connects to the Cosmic, for which a great detachment =
must be established in the mind and body at all times, universal understand=
ing of Dharma never comes to a seeker.

=C2=A0 
This whole unive=
rse is manifestation of Divine Mother (Ma Lalita), she is the nature, the p=
rakriti. And Ma Kali is the ugra form of mother meant to punish the ill dee=
ds. Government meddles with the nature causing ecological imbalance. And th=
is ensues the whole fiasco. Dhari devi shifting was the trigger point to th=
e tragedy, as if she was waiting for the humans to cross the last line. The=
 nature has corrected itself by this tragedy. And why not punish the people=
 ? They are the one who elect the government ?

>That is a variation satisfying the metre. But it is less apt, for t=
he following reasons:
>=C2=A0
>(1) The word "tu" indicates some irony or co=
ntrast. If you say "He rules the bridge of dharma. Then again, he destroys =
the path of adharma", there is no such contrast. Basically, I see "tu" as a=

>(2) Bhairava is not necessarily a deity destroying adharma.=
 In fact, he stands more for liberation and for destroying the distinction =
in one's mind between dharma and adharma. For example, he is depicted as ro=
aming around naked drinking wine.
>=C2=A0
>BTW, observe the imagery. Line b=
efore says "dharma setu pAlakaM" - the ruler of the bridge of dharma. Dharm=
a is merely seen as a bridge here. Bridge to what? Obviously bridge over th=
e sea of samsara and into infinite freedom. Bhairava not only controls the =
bridge, but his main purpose is to take one into infinite freedom from that=
 bridge. Thus, swadharma mArga nAshakaM fits nicely following that line.
>=
=C2=A0
>BTW, some people may be tempted to worship and Bhairava and emulate=
 him by drinking wine or roaming naked in a smashan. That may not necessari=
ly liberate one. Please note that Bhairava is not free becausehe drinks win=
e and roams naked. He is already free and does those things becausehe is fr=
ee. In any case, even Bhairava, the deity of destroying right-wrong distinc=
tions in mind and ringing in liberation is described as "dharma setu palaka=
"! Dharma is very important. Until you reach the shore of infinite freedom,=
 you HAVE to stay afloat of the ocean of samsara, by getting atop the bridg=
e of dharma! Otherwise you will sink in the ocean of samara, toppled by the=
 waves of delusion. Though one needs to jump off the bridge in the end, "th=

e it!

Re=
spected sir,<br>With due regards I request you to shed some light upon the =
recent Uttarakhand tragedy. After the tragedy it is now believed that the t=
ragedy was due to shifting of Dhari devi temple at Alaknanda river. I read =
some post by shri Manish ji and blog of shri sanjay rath ji.  <br>
My doubt=
 is that, in present context how much it is relevant that such tragedies do=
 happen by a Devi wrath. As per our believe God is merciful and even in som=
e of your post previously you have said that it is not worthwhile to connec=
t tragedies with God or faith for Him?<br>
Hope you can elaborate this.<br>=

<span>BTW, observe the imagery. Line before
 says
 "dharma setu pAlakaM" =
- the ruler of the bridge of dharma. Dharma is merely seen as a bridge here=
. Bridge to what? Obviously bridge over the sea of samsara and into infinit=
e freedom. Bhairava not only controls the bridge, but his main purpose is t=
o take one into infinite freedom from that bridge. Thus, swadharma mArga nA=
shakaM fits nicely following that line.</span></div>

<span>BTW, some people may be tempted to worship=
 and Bhairava and emulate him by drinking wine or roaming naked in a smasha=
n. That may not necessarily liberate one. Please note that Bhairava is not =
free <span style=3D"font-style:italic;">because</span><span> he drinks wine=

 and roams naked. He is already free and does those things <span style=3D"=

ase, even Bhairava, the deity of destroying right-wrong distinctions in min=
d and ringing in liberation is described as "dharma setu palaka"! Dharma is=
 very important. Until you reach the shore of infinite freedom, you HAVE to=
 stay afloat of the ocean of samsara, by getting atop the bridge of dharma!=
 Otherwise you will sink in the ocean of samara, toppled by the waves of de=
lusion. Though one needs to jump off the bridge in the end, "the end" is no=
t anywhere near for most people on earth and they better realize it!<br>

A lot of modern
 Hindu philo=
sophy taught by many modern gurus, especially of the Vedantic bent, is base=
d on the final target rather than the path(s) one needs to walk, to get to =
the target. It assumes that you are already close to the target. It ends up=
 misleading and creating wrong notions in unprepared sadhakas like "all is =
delusion", "everything is the same", "what you do does not matter". The gre=
atness of Bhagavad Gita is that it talks about the path(s) as well as the t=
arget and has something relevant to everyone.<br>
