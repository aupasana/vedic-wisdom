I have seen some of the videos of Cymatics wherein they study effects of
so=
und on nearby objects. In one of the experiment, they chanted Om and took
v=
ideo of a tiny water bubble. The surface of bubble turned into Sri Yantra.
=

In general, I believe chanting it loud has three fold effect than chanting=

in mind.
1) The sound of mantra cleanses the other living and non living t=
hings
nearby.
2) The sound of mantra is heard to your own self also. So the=
re is benefit
of hearing the mantra.
3) And of course, the benefit of verba=
lly chanting the mantra.

My experience is as follows,

1) When I chant ver=
bally, my mind wanders and I get some intuitive feelings
about the problems=
 of life and at times the things which are going to
happen. All at the same=
 time, while my tongue keeps chanting the mantra.
After chanting for 1 hr o=
r so, I get physically exhausted so I have to
switch to mental mode.

2) Wh=
en I chant mentally, my mind get extremely focussed on the mantra
itself. B=
ut then after 1 hr or so, I get mentally exhausted. But Physically
I don't =
feel quite satisfied. I don't feel like I have done any puja.

Ideally I wa=
nt to by heart the whole mantra and do it mentally siting in
yogic position=
. So that I can concentrate for a longer duration. But it
feels difficult t=
o by heart the complete Vishnu Sahsranam and Lalita
Sahasranam. Does anybod=
y tried that ?
