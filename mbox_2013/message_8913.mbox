Dear All,

All these are for the novice.

When you transcend, there is no difference between Him and you !

Dont be like the Bible people who quote from verses, highlighting the page, without understanding what is implied.

I am not decrying Nama Japa.

Namamanu Adbhutha Swargam
Namamanu Punarbaham
Namamanu Maha Siddhi
Namamanu Samasthavum

All these techniques are a great preparation for Liberation ( Aurobindo ). Not the End itself .

They are all means to an end. What Jesus said or others said matter not, it is your Self Realisation which is important ! All Books are Docta Ignorantia or Learned Ignorance, they cannot define Him !

Work out your Salvation with diligence !




With warm regards,


G Kumar

  Just wanted to add 2 cents before anybody takes this name equivalence literally and goes on a wild goose chase.

  The arithmetic of one name being equivalent to 1000 other names are just phala shruti/artha-vada. Hence they are never meant to be taken literally ever. They are meant to encourage the devotee to pursue a particular path.

  1. The Rama Rameti shloka tells one Rama name equals 100 names of Vishnu. (This shloka is from Padma Purana)

  2. Next we have Brahmanda Purana that says:
  sahasra-namnam punyanam, trir-avrttya tu yat phalam;
  ekavrttya tu krsnasya, namaikam tat prayacchati

  one Krishna Japa = 3 Rama Japa

  3. What more, the same anushashasana parva in which Vishnu Sahasra Nama is present in Mahabharata has Krishna saying this :

  yO mAm nama sahasrena stotumicchati pandava
  yohamekena shlokena stuta eva na samshaya 

  By saying this Krishna is implying that one can get the same punya os saying entire Vishnu sahasra nama just by saying one shloka of Vishnu Sahasra nama.. Now each shloka of VSN is equivalent to entire VSN itself.. 
  Now we have circular reference in the equation that can never be satisfied !! (Much like GNU stands for GNU is not UNIX !!)

  Hence this one name being equivalent to N other names is a wild goose chase. As PVRji said, its all in the state of mind.

  But there is a specific meditation technique that can be specifically applied to Vishnu Sahasra nama and it is mentioned in preface of VSN itself (yaani naamaani gauNani vikhyaataani mahatmanah). Here gauNa does not mean minor. It means "being related to guna". It means each name extolls one (several actually) attributes of Vishnu. One can ponder over that quality of Vishnu as that name comes up. It takes up time to practice such technique and requires quite a bit of cross reference reading. It is to be slowly developed over time. But it is very effective.

  Regards,
  Srikanth
