    <di=

      <p><br>
You were on your way home w=
hen you died.<br>
It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, b=
ut fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a pai=
nless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your b=
ody was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.<br>
<br>
And th=
at's when you met me.<br>
"What=E2=80=A6 what happened?" You =
asked. "Where am I?"<br>
"You died," I said, matter-of-=
factly. No point in mincing words.<br>
"There was a=E2=80=A6 a truck a=
nd it was skidding=E2=80=A6"<br>
"Yup," I said.<br>
"I=
=E2=80=A6 I died?"<br>
"Yup. But don't feel bad about it. Eve=
ryone dies," I said.<br>
You looked around. There was nothingness. Jus=
t you and me. "What is this place?" You asked. "Is this the =
afterlife?"<br>
"More or less," I said.<br>
"Are you go=
d?" You asked.<br>
"Yup," I replied. "I'm God."=
;<br>
"My kids=E2=80=A6 my wife," you said.<br>
"What about =
them?"<br>
"Will they be all right?"<br>
"That's wh=
at I like to see," I said. "You just died and your main concern i=
s for your family. That's good stuff right there."<br>
<br>
You lo=
oked at me with fascination. To you, I didn't look like God. I just loo=
ked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe.=
 More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.<br>
"Don't wo=
rry," I said. "They'll be fine. Your kids will remember you a=
s perfect in every way. They didn't have time to grow contempt for you.=
 Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fa=
ir, your marriage was falling apart. If it's any consolation, she'l=
l feel very guilty for feeling relieved."<br>
"Oh," you said=
. "So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?"<=
br>
"Neither," I said. "You'll be reincarnated."<br=
>
"Ah," you said. "So the Hindus were right,"<br>
"=
;All religions are right in their own way," I said. "Walk with me=
."<br>
<br>
You followed along as we strode through the void. "Wh=
ere are we going?"<br>
"Nowhere in particular," I said. &quo=
t;It's just nice to walk while we talk."<br>
"So what's t=
he point, then?" You asked. "When I get reborn, I'll just be =
a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in=
 this life won't matter."<br>
"Not so!" I said. "Yo=
u have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives.=
 You just don't remember them right now."<br>
I stopped walking an=
d took you by the shoulders. "Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful=
, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain=
 a tiny fraction of what you are. It's like sticking your finger in a g=
lass of water to see if it's hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourse=
lf into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you've gained all t=
he experiences it had.<br>
"You've been in a human for the last 48=
 years, so you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your imme=
nse consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you'd start rem=
embering everything. But there's no point to doing that between each li=
fe."<br>
"How many times have I been reincarnated, then?"<br=
>
"Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives." I s=
aid. "This time around, you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD=
."<br>
"Wait, what?" You stammered. "You're sending=
 me back in time?"<br>
"Well, I guess technically. Time, as you k=
now it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come fro=
m."<br>
"Where you come from?" You said.<br>
"Oh sure,&=
quot; I explained "I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there ar=
e others like me. I know you'll want to know what it's like there, =
but honestly you wouldn't understand."<br>
"Oh," you sai=
d, a little let down. "But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places=
 in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point."<br>
&quo=
t;Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own l=
ifespan you don't even know it's happening."<br>
"So what=
's the point of it all?"<br>
"Seriously?" I asked. "=
;Seriously? You're asking me for the meaning of life? Isn't that a =
little stereotypical?"<br>
"Well it's a reasonable question,&=
quot; you persisted.<br>
<br>
I looked you in the eye. "The meaning of=
 life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature."<b=
r>
"You mean mankind? You want us to mature?"<br>
"No, just =
you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and ma=
ture and become a larger and greater intellect."<br>
"Just me? Wh=
at about everyone else?"<br>
"There is no one else," I said.=
 "In this universe, there's just you and me."<br>
You stared =
blankly at me. "But all the people on earth=E2=80=A6"<br>
"A=
ll you. Different incarnations of you."<br>
"Wait. I'm everyo=
ne!?"<br>
"Now you're getting it," I said, with a congra=
tulatory slap on the back.<br>
"I'm every human being who ever liv=
ed?"<br>
"Or who will ever live, yes."<br>
"I'm Abr=
aham Lincoln?"<br>
"And you're John Wilkes Booth, too," =
I added.<br>
"I'm Hitler?" You said, appalled.<br>
"And =
you're the millions he killed."<br>
"I'm Jesus?"<br>=

"And you're everyone who followed him."<br>
You fell silent.=
<br>
<br>
"Every time you victimized someone," I said, "you =
were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you've done, you'v=
e done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any huma=
n was, or will be, experienced by you."<br>
You thought for a long tim=
e.<br>
"Why?" You asked me. "Why do all this?"<br>
&quo=
t;Because someday, you will become like me. Because that's what you are=
. You're one of my kind. You're my child."<br>
"Whoa,&quo=
t; you said, incredulous. "You mean I'm a god?"<br>
"No.=
 Not yet. You're a fetus. You're still growing. Once you've liv=
ed every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be b=
orn."<br>
"So the whole universe," you said, "it's =
just=E2=80=A6"<br>
"An egg." I answered. "Now it's =
time for you to move on to your next life."<br>
And I sent you on your=
 way.<br>
