Namaste friends,
=A0
I
 will give another example, in more detail. Bhargava=
 Rama is Venus as 
per Maharshi Pararsara. Venus is the spirit of happiness=
 within us. I 
will explain how Bhargava Rama's life demonstrates how the 
=
sense of happiness operates in its perfected form.
=A0
This kind of subtle =
esoteric understanding is difficult to put in words, but I will try my best=
.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Jamadagni
 (jamat=
+agni=3Dconstantly consuming fire) stands for divine awareness. 
Renuka (re=
nu=3Dparticle) stands for matter. She was so pure that she could
 hold wate=
r in a pot made of unbaked clay. When purified matter is 
infused with divi=
ne awareness, it gives rise to a perfected form of 
happiness or bliss.
=A0=

This happiness is liberating in nature and 
so Bhargava Rama is a brahmana=
 and a rishi. This perfected form of 
happiness is also too powerful and te=
nds to dominate over other forces 
within one. So Bhargava Rama also had ks=
hatriya qualities & 
ancestry.
=A0
When Renuka was enamored by a gandharva =
called 
Chitraratha (chitra=3Dstrange, ratha=3Ddesire), Jamadagni ordered B=
hargava 
Rama to kill her. When the material that was instrumental in givin=
g rise
 to bliss is tainted with strange attachment, it needs to be cut off=
 and
 be recreated pure. Bhargava Rama made Renuka alive again by asking 
J=
amadagni for a boon after obeying his word.
=A0
Later, Jamadagni 
was kille=
d by Kartavirya Arjuna, a great king, and that greatly 
disturbed Bharga Ra=
ma. Kartavirya means "coming from Kritavirya". 
Kritavirya means one who ha=
s engaged in bravery. Coming from the verb 
rij (be firm and steady), Arjun=
a stands for steadiness and firmness. 
"Kartavirya Arjuna" stands for firmn=
ess and confidence coming from 
having engaged in bravery. When that cuts o=
ff the constant fire of 
divine awareness (Jamadagni) in one, that greatly =
disturbs the poise of 
one's bliss (Bhargava Rama). One's bliss returns to =
normal only after 
destroying all instincts of domination, pride, control a=
nd power inside 
one (kshatriyas). Such instincts and bliss do not go toget=
her well. So 
Bhargava Rama disliked kshatriyas for ever.
=A0
However, Lord=
 Rama 
was one kshatriya who Bhargava Rama had to bow to. As discussed befo=
re, 
Lord Rama is Sun (soul). Supreme are the power and command of soul, 
w=
hich keeps on magnanimously supporting various aspects of 
individualized c=
onsciouness in their pursuits. It is immensely strong 
and powerful and no =
wonder Rama was a kshatriya. Despite the supremely 
heroic work done by sou=
l in supporting its subjects, it is perfect in 
detachment and has no agend=
as of its own. Finally Bhargava Rama met a 
kshatriya who was not only stro=
ng and heroic, but also had Brahma Tejas.
 He had to bow. Similarly, bliss =
may be averse to instincts of heroic 
strength and control as they tend to =
disturb bliss, but, when bliss 
meets soul, it sees a powerful hero with pe=
rfect abandon, who is the 
source of various kinds of bliss.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Similarly,
 story of Lord Koorma =
demonstrates how persistence/patience in us 
operates in its perfected form=
, its nature, challenges it faces etc. 
Story of Lord Narasimha demonstrate=
s how energy/drive in us operates in 
its perfected form, its nature, chall=
enges it faces etc. And so on.
=A0
Our
 scriptures are not filled with mean=
ingless stories. They are true 
stories of events in some other realms of b=
eing. They also 
metaphorically represent great inner truths that may occur=
 within us. 
They can help us understand ourselves, how we can perfect vari=
ous 
aspects of our personalities and how we can progress.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
Chanting a deity's name or doing =
other rituals to a deity, are the first step. If a mantra is working, a cor=
responding aspect of our personality will become purified and perfected ove=
r time.

a representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It i=

>=A0
>Once mind=
 fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, soul supports the =
individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dh=
arma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized =
consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, d=
iscipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes=
/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one's =
agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later
 on. It =
does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas =
nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized c=
onsciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and begetting =
the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its dhar=

 not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supporting the p=
lay, may not seem interesting enough to some.

He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At the la=
st moment, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his step-moth=
er and his step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though =
his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he=
 himself supported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impassion=
ately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest
 with Lakshmana and going =
after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately when S=
ita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fou=
ght the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or fault=
ed Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation with n=
o complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravan=
a, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even =
as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects =
that were going to disappear with Ravana!

hnu's Dasavataras on a limited access forum on Facebook. A learned friend w=
rote that "Krshna is the God-man", "Previous Avatars are a build-up to this=
 stage" and "Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progres=
sion of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krs=
hna".<br> <br>I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Da=
savatars of a "linear progression of spirituality..upto
 Krshna".<br> =
<br>*        *    &n=
bsp;   *<br> <br>Each avatara represents an aspect of Suprem=
e in a perfected form.<br> <br>Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras w=
ith planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mar=
s, respectively.<br> <br>We also
 know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, =
Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, e=
nergy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of e=
njoyment/being happy, patience/discipline, spirit of innovation/breaking ba=
rriers and detachment (respectively).<br> <br>Correspondingly, each av=
atara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each =
story is an example of how that aspect operates.<br> <br>Lord Rama's s=
tory is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna's story is a=
 perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana's story is a perfected=
 example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha's story is a=
 perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates.<br> <br>*&=
nbsp;       *     &n=
bsp;  *<br> <br>Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us,=
 mind in us, energy in us,
 learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness =
in us, discipline/patience in us - all these are different manifestations o=
f the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, i=
t has different qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison=
 between them.<br> <br>We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect=
 it and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance between=
 all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Bein=
g are incomparable and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.<br>=
 <br>*        *   &n=
bsp;    *<br> <br>One who is fascinated by the qualitie=
s of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who i=
s fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrates =
how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may=
 like the story that
 demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this=
 is just a matter of taste and subjective preference.<br> <br>* &=
nbsp;      *      &n=
bsp; *<br> <br>Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. S=
oul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attribu=
tes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.<=
br> <br>Once mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desir=
es, soul supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy=
 and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect o=
f this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning=
 ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no=
 desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and=
 records all of one's agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper=
 fruits later
 on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neith=
er doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects o=
f the individualized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing=
 things and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It=
 sees that as its dharma and does it impassionately.<br> <br>Now, does=
 this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassio=
nate witness supporting the play, may not seem interesting enough to some.<=
br> <br>On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is=
 constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achieving things. Mo=
vement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! Though soul is =
the support for everything else in the individualized consciousness, soul i=
s a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the indi=
vidualization going and brings in agendas and passion and even decides/affe=
cts
 every entity's dharma. That way, mind is really the "boss" of the indi=
vidualization. No wonder Krishna's life appeals more to one who may be exci=
ted by this description!<br> <br>*      =
  *        *<br> <br>Lord Kris=
hna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama's life in perspective.<=
br> <br>Rama's life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he=
 received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did what=
ever was his "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was g=
iven kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the =
behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had=
 no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty=
 to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and follow=
ed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest
 wi=
th Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did i=
t impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he s=
earched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing hi=
m to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted ever=
y life situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. =
Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his imp=
assionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully=
 learned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana!<br> <=
br>Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas =
who impassionately discharges one's dharma arising from the momentum of kar=
mas before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!<br> <br>*&nbs=
p;       *      =
;  *<br> <br>As another example, let us look at Lord
 Vaamana. Hi=
s story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates.<b=
r> <br>He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to =
rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qualities.<br> <b=
r>Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is doing =
good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), on=
e's discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When wisd=
om fills one's entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are completely =
suppressed.<br> <br>*        * =
;       *<br> <br>Please think about the=
 other avataras. The stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of=
 how various aspects of our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maha=
rshi Parasara.<br> <br>Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate e=
ach of them separately. Of course, if you are more
 attracted to one of the=
m, please think about that avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL =
capable of relieving us from samsara.<br> <br>*    =
;    *        *<br> =
<br>By the way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there=
 are different schools of thought).<br> <br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha=
