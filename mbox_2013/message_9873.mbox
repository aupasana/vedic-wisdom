Dear Ajit,

If =
the soul can recall, doesn't this soul now have some sort of a body and/or =
mind? Instead of explicitly admitting a body (whether it is subtle or gross=
) that survives upon death, haven't you just created an 
implicit body boun=
d to your concept of a soul?>>

I am not sure that I understood your questi=
on correctly. 


Karma "attaches" itself by setting certain preconditions/c=
ircumstances based on the desires of the soul and lessons the egosense must=
 learn for manifesting the soul. This process is taken care of by Nature's =
laws. These two - desire and need - are slightly different. At the moment o=
f death the soul has a specific ability to internalize and project what it =
needs/wants to experience in the next birth. That gets set firmly. That cou=
nts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reaction process of actions perf=
ormed is the need or the consequence to be faced in order that the egosense=
 can learn to be more responsible in its actions.. And, here is the catch i=
n the theory of Karma that I believe in, the reaction process again is exac=
t and divided into a reaction to the body or to the mind or to the life bas=
ed on the instrument which was used to perform/engage in a specific karma. =
Now since our ego-sense will identify with these to hold them together, so =
the
 egosense will experience the reaction. We mostly live from our egosens=
e. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much deeper. Now assuming sudde=
nly that the individual in the next birth has a total spiritual transformat=
ion and is able to manifest the soul and live life from it, the reactions m=
ay not come or if they do may be highly reduced in nature such as not to be=
 of any real consequences. When the soul starts governing an individual ins=
tead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an individual becomes differ=
ent from others. 


In another model of reality, it is the karana sharir wi=
ll hold the seeds of the karma. which is never destroyed. But the karana sh=
arir is very different from the normal mind or life or body. It is more lik=
e a super subtle background process in all individuals. To be able to reach=
 consciousness the karana sharir, is a very very high spiritual achievement=
. Our karmas are mostly and almost always in the realm of body, life and mi=
nd. Karana is way beyond this. A typal repository of various things. It is =
infact only when a person can experience the karana sharir that he/she can =
really enter into the realm of the Great Gods. They are Beings of this kara=
na jagat, typal and fixed in essence, never changing, like the individual k=
arana sharir. Now one can logically ask, so if the karana sharir is recordi=
ng karma, is it not getting fatter? This is a problem of our logical mind w=
hich may not hold true in that realm. If=C2=A0 we keep adding jugs of water=
 to the ocean,
 will it overflow? No. This is quite beyond the normal mind =
which is limited by its own regimented logic.


Each of the sharir is not o=
nly an individual's own but is also effectively and fluidly connected to th=
e whole world of that realm. So with the physical we interact and live in t=
he physical world, with the sukshma we interact and be a part of the sukshm=
a jagat, same with the karan. Only difference being the depth, intensity an=
d the nature of these three. The Karana is very fixed and supremely subtle.=
 Like a seed. While the sthula is the maximum changeable of the three. Ever=
ything that is there in the sthula jagat is born out of a seed from the kar=
ana. As such, nothing in the sthula can go beyond the potentialities held b=
y its most fundamental essence that lies in the Karana. Hence great Yogis, =
those who can access this realm at will, can know the most essential nature=
 of a thing by experiencing what a thing is in its deepest essence in this =
Karana jagat, and thus get to know all its possibilities without ever tryin=
g to explore them in the physical realm
 or the subtle realm. Quite off lim=
its for most of us.


Hope this helps.

>>>>>
>>>>>I have very little knowledge about =
Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever tried any sadhan=
a of Lord Hanumana till date.
>>>>>
>>>>>However, there is a particular man=
tra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency for the=
se kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuk=
a. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one whose m=
other is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in the Rud=
rayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava ha=
s been
 invoked for centuries
 by
 followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for=
 protection against spirits, and specially during rituals
 of cremation gro=
und. 
>>>>>
>>>>>The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this =
mantra too, all are good):
>>>>>
>>>>>"Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay=
 Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om"
>>>>>
>>>>>Generally, at least 10/11 malas of=
 the same should be done in one sitting. And this should be continued daily=
 till such time that there is some visible relief. One more thing is that, =
IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit possession, as far as I hav=
e seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist fro=
m a distance. These days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to =
cure a case of possession from a distance. Physical presence in front of th=
e victim is a must for the one trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members=
, who live with the girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go through the=
 Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas w=
ith this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that =
easy.
>>>>>
>>>>>If the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Plea=
se ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhai=
rava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main pr=
iest stating the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent=
 sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative =
influence. They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the pa=
rents and the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/ti=
thi inside the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actu=
ally benefited. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too=
. I just wrote what came to my mind.

>Namaste Sir,
>>>>>
>>>>>A possession by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is a=
lways a very serious matter. For there are various classes and kinds and ty=
pes of entities which can possess an individual and some of them can be dow=
nright nasty.
>>>>>
>>>>>Upayas are many. As so many different people have =
advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one =
of them will actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple fa=
ctors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on wh=
at kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their l=
ink for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or sour=
ce of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person.
 Sometimes=
 it can be
 something
 as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s)=
 reside), or
 causally entering into their territory and being susceptible =
to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cas=
es where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual=
, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of=
 removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of th=
e spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to ge=
nerate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent a=
nd extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it =
is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.
>>>>>
>>>>>These thin=
gs like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall under th=
e ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, =
any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every =
action has its repercussion and one must know well how to
 handle the same =
too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which, bas=
ed on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individual=
, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pl=
easant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is al=
l a complex chain.
>>>>>
>>>>>[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew=
 some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exor=
cism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the ti=
me frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous =
karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rit=
uals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, pro=
mising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by fo=
rce. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very vio=
lent nature, force had to be applied.]
>>>>>
>>>>>Best thing to do is a) fi=
nd someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope f=
or the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family members =
to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Na=
rasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with=
 samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 min=
s path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession=
. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the menta=
l belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. Whil=
e doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either m=
ake the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And=
 pray as hard as possible.

aches" itself by setting certain preconditions/circumstances based on the d=
esires of the soul and lessons the egosense must learn
 for manifesting the=
 soul. This process is taken care of by Nature's
 laws. These two - desire =
and need - are slightly different. At the moment of death the soul has a sp=
ecific ability to internalize and project what it needs/wants to experience=
 in the next birth. That gets set firmly. That counts as a desire of the so=
ul. And the basic reaction process of actions performed is the need or the =
consequence to be faced in order that the egosense can learn to be more res=
ponsible in its actions.. And, here is the catch in the theory of Karma tha=
t I believe in, the reaction process again is exact and divided into a reac=
tion to the body or to the mind or to the life based on the instrument whic=
h was used to perform/engage in a specific karma. Now since our ego-sense w=
ill identify with these to hold them together, so the egosense will experie=
nce the reaction. We mostly live from our egosense. But soul is hardly the =
ego. It lies much much deeper. Now assuming suddenly that the individual in=
 the next birth has a total spiritual
 transformation and is able to manife=
st the soul and live life from it, the reactions may not come or if they do=
 may be highly reduced in nature such as not to be of any real consequences=
. When the soul starts governing an individual instead of his/her egosense,=
 Nature laws for such an individual becomes different from others. <br clea=
