 focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Consta=
nt efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the human m=
ind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, =
more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc e=
tc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening
 happens, one has to now =
self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more in=
tense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good g=
uru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it ca=
n also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some=
 of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and giv=
en half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take=
 hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the s=
ame. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more> vital. 4 - While someda=
y or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti aweken=
ing and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The =
human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to=
 deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of a=
n individual, which protects us from
 various subtle influences and helps u=
s to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various reaso=
ns, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow f=
ree assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of cau=
sing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possibliti=
es are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even =
if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledg=
e to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing =
nothing more than an intelligent guess work.> Sometimes it will have result=
s, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sou=
nd mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in c=
orpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi > >>>>> >>>>> >>>>awaktam wyaktimApann=

ed to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a =
patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been invo=
lved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous aw=
akening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body e=
xperiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin an=
d had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched =
for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong=
 with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged k=
undalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a =
spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has tri=
ggered interest and
 research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unf=
ortunately these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and =
as we have no treatments for deranged> kundalini, we struggle to help them.=
 Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this la=
dy confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This=
 woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the derang=
ed energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she=
 cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem=
. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the ku=
ndalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or giv=
e her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans amo=
ng you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- the=
ir suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as=
 not to end
 up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti=
 marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrumen=

<DIV>That wa=

om non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experiences, s=

er words, what doctors call "hallucinations". Are these hallucinations or t=
he result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. <WBR><WBR>H=
owever most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking 'fak=

tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine "I hear voices in =
my head" schizophrenic or kundalini patient. <WBR><WBR>About vata, most of =
our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually=
 unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangemen=

of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common-
 I'm sure this does=

 Kundalini, on=
e needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purificat=
ion of the various elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In =
simpler words this translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more n=
on-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a g=
enuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the D=
evata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The =
Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As =
Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind =
and body to various other things and entities, some of which are not postiv=
e in nature while some of them are useless, and given half a chance can mak=
e use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakn=
ess in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhut=
a-suddhi becomes even more<WBR>> vital. 4 - While
 someday or other ever=
y sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising =
up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The human psycholog=
y as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal with vari=
ous things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, w=
hich protects us from various subtle influences and helps us to remain as f=
unctional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various reasons, high stress,=
 or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of va=
rious entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing serious hav=
oc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities are there, it=
 is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagno=
sis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the=
 situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing more tha=
n an intelligent guess work.<WBR>>
 Sometimes it will have results, some=
times not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind=
 in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore =
sano. -Regards  Rajarshi <WBR>> >>>><WBR>> >>&=

rn people of kundalini syndrome based
 on my recent experience of a patient=
 of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in=
 the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening=
 of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experien=
ces and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had n=
ever heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an =
explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with h=
er (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalin=
i. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritu=
al crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered =
interest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunate=
ly these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we ha=
ve no treatments for deranged<WBR>> kundalini, we struggle to help them.=
 Many yogis try to forcibly
 waken the kundalini. My experience with this l=
ady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. Thi=
s woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deran=
ged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something sh=
e cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her proble=
m. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the k=
undalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or gi=
ve her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans am=
ong you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- th=
eir suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so a=
s not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti=
 marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrumen=
t" and leave the kundalini<WBR>> rising bit to God's will. Om Dum Durgay=
