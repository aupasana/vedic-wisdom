Dear Narsimha ji,
namaste

Very good explanantion but as we normal human be=
ing and can not determine , how much is intesity of bad karma to overcome i=
t by prayer.
Now you are astroloer also and might have seen thousands of ku=
ndlis and might have seen  intesnsity of bad planets ,
so for benefit of gp=
 can u pls suggest general remedy like how much time a day one shud spend i=
n  prayer (naam jap or sapatshati path or else) to get protected and can u =
pls give some examples where u found problems in kundli and by prayer
 peop=
le overtook bad impact

thanks
rakesh

 When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting=
 karmaphala, through conscious effort and current action, yes, it is possib=
