Regarding (1): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is present in several beings=
 such a planets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the wor=
ld appearance in consciousness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So they =
stand for different qualities of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance. =
So Vishnu's avataras are associated with grahas. But Pararsara said that av=
ataras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings (e=
.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre und=
erstanding what various deities stand for, what forces play a role in creat=
ing, sustaining and destroying the world appearance in consciousness. Peopl=

ing answers as to why these 9 are considered in the list of Dasavataras and=
 NOT others like Mohini or Danwantari who are also mentioned as Avataras, I=
 am afraid the world will keep getting more and more convinced that this sp=
ecific list of dasavataras represent a parable of evoluion, where One Being=
 comes in 9 different forms, in 9 different times, for 9 different purposes=
 to guide the process of evolution of life and consciousness in the manifes=
ted world on planet earth.

=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they =
represent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which socie=
ty can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the sta=
ge of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how=
 to transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a c=
onstructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full S=
attwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it i=
s static in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As =
per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita i=
n the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana=
, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the =
Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dis=
passionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it
>  was t=
he Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharm=
a of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epi=
c, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the th=
ings as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding hi=
s own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama =
faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most di=
spassionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or pass=
ions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leade=
r must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I=
 am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singula=
r and constant detachment from situations, from people, from environment, f=
rom circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to le=
ave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,
>  his vil=
lage-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense f=
or him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village=
 life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to rea=
son with them, then he understood that they won't understand, he promised h=
e will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Lat=
er, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in the=
ir dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous a=
nd possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying =
that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over h=
im. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers o=
n the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he =
swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bhu=
rishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist
>  and charlatan,=
 Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as a=
nother black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roo=
pa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The ver=
y next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Maha=
bharata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade =
of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespec=
tive of what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of th=
e greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spi=
ritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yog=
a. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossi=
ble. Neither the action nor the results belong to the instrument. When runn=
ing away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising =
Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema
>  to hit Duryodhana b=
elow the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some =
Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which wo=
uld cause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot co=
me by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and conscio=
usly connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex=
 situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of cours=
e, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retell=
ing, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 hea=
ded demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Ad=
ya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But i=
f we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges i=
s very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays=
 all the great characteristics of satwa, chief
>  of which is self-control,=
 as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife S=
ita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa =
guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability=
 is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this w=
orld - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never=
 affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him
