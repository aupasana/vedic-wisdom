Dear Narasimha,

I am exploring some edges and partly playing the devil's a=
dvocate here.

I never extinguish my homa fire forcible. 

<<First of all, =
milk is 
not a symbol of pure consciousness. Milk has a specific taste and =
color 
(sweetness and white) and not really a symbol of guna-less pure 
con=
sciousness. Secondly, fire is the symbol of Divinity>>

=C2=A0If milk is no=
t a symbol of pure consciousness can one use distilled water 
instead, if a=
vailable?=C2=A0 That is as close to being devoid of attributes 
as it is po=
ssible for something to be so in this physical world.

In
 my view, whateve=
r little I have understood in the last 5/6 years, a 
symbol is a subjective=
 concept. It is the person using the symbol who 
gives life and meaning and=
 value to it. So in that sense, depending on 
the person who is using the s=
ymbol, it will or will not have a value. A 
very creative, imaginative and =
pure soul can use anything as a symbol of
 anything, because the actual pro=
cess of activating a symbol happens 
within. 

The process of using symbols=
 in any ritual is to create a
 particular conditioning of the mind to help =
it to remove some other 
troublesome conditioning so that in a moment of de=
-conditoned passivity,
 maybe enter into a higher consciousness. Thus a sym=
bol gains force by 
repeatation and association.

If
 one keeps doing fire =
rituals from day one with the belief that by 
pouring milk or water or some=
thing a higher consciousness is coming into
 the procedure, is that going t=
o hamper his progress or "burn less 
karmas"? I honestly do not think so. I=
t is all a matter of mental 
association.

OTOH, a yogi who is conditioned =
to see fire as a 
living entity and a symbol of the Higher Consciousness, w=
ould never like
 to torture the fire or force it into doing something that =
is violent in
 nature. The thing with pouring water or extinguishing a fire=
 is that it
 evokes a sense of violence and torture *inside* the seeker, *s=
pecially*
 if s/he has learnt to connect the fire to his consciousness. Tha=
t is 
the seekers way of connecting.=C2=A0 And a way of connecting is build=
 by 
endless repeatations.

It is all a matter of how the association 
has =
been build internally over time. Initially when a person does a homa
 as me=
chanical exercise,and who has no preconditioning about this 
matter, that i=
s whether fire is to be kept or extinguished, it will make
 no palpable dif=
ference to him either way. Just a mechanical process.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

There
 are two kinds of rituals. In Tantra, the kriyas -=
 those which are aimed
 for a specific benefit. Or those which are done for=
 spiritual progress.
 The former is firm and fixed in its rituals and rules=
 and regulations. 
We can't do much about it. 

The later though is more fl=
uid. Here 
the idea is we burn karmas and progress.But what is burning of k=
armas 
really? Is it not a simplistic, allegorical description of an inner =

process, with or without an external fire? I mean one can very well burn
 =
karmas even with a rudrabhisekh of a shiva linga, if one connect to it 
int=
ernally. And there is no fire in it, only water and fluids.

Similarly,
 I =
believe if one has so trained his mind, one may also burn karmas by 
pourin=
g milk at the end of a homa, when the flames have died down and 
the fire i=
s in a state of sleep, embers, if one has trained his mind for
 it.

Fire i=
s a living symbol of Divinity. But so is almost anything, no? Water, Air ..=
. 

What
 is interesting about Fire is its very dynamic and engaging nature=
. 
Water has a different nature, just like Air, or Earth. It is for the 
se=
eker to find the pervading Divinity within any of these elements, and 
to t=
he extent he is able to connect, to that extent he benefits. And 
this prin=
ciple works in the whole Universe!

I never extinguish my
 own homa fire fo=
r I am conditioned not to do it. By now the 
conditioning is firmly set. Ha=
d I chosen a different conditioning, that 
of say pouring water or milk int=
o fire, and persisted with it for years,
 that too could have, theoreticall=
y speaking, created a nice synergy in 
the brain and caused some nice exper=
iences eventually.

To really and objectively judge if the other method wor=
ks or not, one has to try it out for sufficient period of time as well.

I
=
 never have and I probably never will, for my own method is now firmly 
set=
. But that may not mean that someone else cannot make it work..

-Regards

Namaste Sir,

Yes, this is the w=
ebsite I was discussing.

=C2=A0
You can invoke various beings in Fire and =
recall them from Fire as you may want, but Fire itself is a living entity o=

As explained below, if you are under time pressure,=
 plan things such that fire goes off by itself by the required time. But do=

If you call me to your =

I will be on my way out when I am done with what you serve me. If you serve=
