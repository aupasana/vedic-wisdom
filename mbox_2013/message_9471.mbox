namaste,

Nice mail :-)

For what it's worth, here are some foolish words ...

Yoga Vasishtha describes moksha as vaasanaa-taanavam (reducing the field of
mental impressions). Put another way, this basically means "go with the
flow" (this is a mental state of mind, and doesn't imply a lack of effort).

This "go with the [divine] flow" vaasanaa-taanavam is the gist of the
spiritual path.

Objectively, it's difficult to talk about the creation of the world or how
we got here. But, I think we can all agree that vaasanaa-taanavam is good
from any perspective. Our Rishis have described different things in the
land of vaasanaa-taanavam. But, who knows if their words have been handed
down without corruption, and if we are correctly interpreting their words
...

How do we reach this vaasanaa-taavanam? Some brave souls can get there by
themselves, by sheer willpower. They may not use any mantras, or believe in
any concept of ishwara. If you try to follow this path, you'll quickly see
the problem with this type of sadhana.

The rest of us use mantra and tantra. These are paths to certain mental
states, which also help with vaasanaa-taanavam. Perhaps they existed from
the beginning of time, or perhaps certain Rishis visualized some of these
paths after creation. They are a collection of shakti ... each mantra holds
the combined mental focus of every rishi and normal being that has focused
their mental shakti on the mantras. Over time, as millions of sadhakas
projected their mental focus on these mantras, their mental shakti was
added to the mantra. Techniques like mantra and tantra may be true in an
absolute sense, or they may be therapeutic myths. In either case, those who
have gone before us (in previous eons and in the current generation) have
told us that these techniques work. So, we use them.

You are correct ... you can't have bhakti for something until you
experience it. So, what are we all doing? Following the age old technique
-- "fake it until you make it". This is why, in the sankalpa, many bhaktas
add the following words "achanchala-niShkapaTa-bhakti-siddhyartham" ...
they ask for the generation of unwavering, guileless bhakti. It isn't easy.

The rishis took the divine light and gave it to us in digestible forms. In
essence, they have given us a box of matches. We are all babies with no
control over our limbs. We flail all over the place while trying to light
the match. We try our best not to be disheartened when nothing happens, and
we try not to get distracted by the sparks and smoke of failed attempts.
Once the match is lit ... well, someone who has lit their match can talk
about it :-)

sasneham,

    ajit
