Namaste,

Not easy to do option three (trying and failing). Is anyone tryin=
g option three? Making everything into sadhana is not easy. A monk at Sivan=
anda Ashram in Rishikesh told me talking to God is also a 'meditation'. 

S=
o if you say, Ok God, let's go to work, let's drive, let's eat a meal, let'=
s repeat your name, let's discuss all my day-to-day concerns (I need to dis=
cuss them with someone, why not you), I'm doing all these sustained by you.=
..I guess it's a form of remembrance and hence a kind of meditation.....eve=
n if there are times when you can't believe with the same conviction that G=
od is listening. It's a bit disheartening though when it feels like a monol=
ogue (I've never heard God reply....but I'm probably a bit spiritually deaf=
) and even more disheartening when you sometimes think people would think y=
ou're such an odd person (if they ever found out). 

But as the yogis say, =
you go to whatever you think of. Think of God and you go to God. So I guess=
 it's worth the incredible  effort it takes (as a beginner) with the whole =
remembrance thing. I've thought of setting a watch alarm to go off every ho=
ur as a reminder to pause for a couple of minutes to do mental mantra repet=
ition (no matter what I'm doing, if possible)- this is a technique to try t=
o integrate a bit of japa into my mundane worldly life. (For those of us in=
 whom spontaneous love/remembrance is yet to develop, this is probably not =
a bad technique). Any one have any other ideas/techniques that they use to =
develop the remembrance/make daily activities a sadhana?

Any thoughts/sugg=
estions would be much appreciated.

Aparna

Similarly, if you do sadhana for an hour, you may feel better, but the norm=

 driving back, cooking, eating, talking to people, etc) into sadhana. At so=
