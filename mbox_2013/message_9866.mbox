 Therefore
 their idea of reincarnation
 is very different. =
It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together

But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dis=

 another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop thi=

There are many mantras, kavachas and prayers to shield from the vibrations =

><span>Namaste,<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">To add to the complexi=
ty of the problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over=
 simplified and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, an=
d the soul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul=
 had a role to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has l=
ived a life where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come fort=
h and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete =
process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based =
on need.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">The Buddhists do not believe =
in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to ou=
r idea of
 Atmah.
 Therefore
 their idea of reincarnation
 is very differen=
t. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces togethe=
r
 to give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disi=
ntegrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of th=
ese can coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other par=
ts can simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different p=
art.   Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarna=
tion, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while =
another part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. =
Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while =
his energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body inc=
arnating in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits =
with their philosophy.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Those philosoph=
ies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe o=
nly as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of
 debts/b=
alances - rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this te=
rm. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and mov=
e into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is o=
f any final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunc=
iation of life and its processes.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">But =
the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolv=
ed at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to ano=
ther and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this so=
ul's influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body v=
ehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique=
 soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able =
to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine =
Life. </span><span><span> A Supreme Negation of life is 
not the ultim=
ate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.  If  moving int=
o a state 
of complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevita=
ble aim,
 then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform c=
omplex
 life-actions. </span>The law of Karma is here too, but it is not re=
stricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the i=
dea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the=
 soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes =
the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing a=
nd real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have kil=
led hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did =
not have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of=
 those he had killed]. </span><span>Whereas those aspects of life 
where th=

the law of =
rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. </span></div><div clas=
