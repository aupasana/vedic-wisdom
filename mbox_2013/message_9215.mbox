Aum Shri Gurubhyo Namah
Respected Sirs,
=C2=A0I have a small doubt in this =
regard.
For example take the avtars of shri parasu rama & shri rama. Both h=
ave great respect for their fathers. Shri prasu rama beheaded his mother as=
 per his father's advice & Shri rama went to forest to oblige pitru vakya p=
aripalanam. But take the case of shri prahlada. He never listened to his fa=
ther's advice & continued to chant the shri narayana mantra. So in one case=
 it is pitru vakya paripalanam & in another it is disobeying pitru vakya. C=
an any this discrepancy be kindly explained.
With respectful regards,
Surya=
narayanan Modhukur.

 aspects, it has different qualities and plays different roles. There is no=
 comparison between them.=C2=A0We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perf=

 perfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance bet=

self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.=C2=A0Once mind fancies a sep=

its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one's agendas and k=
armas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that =
despite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving =
the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness e=

mind that keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passi=

ctive.=C2=A0Rama's life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he =
received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whate=
ver was his "dharma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was gi=
ven kingdom. At the last moment, his father
 banished him to forest at the =
behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had=
 no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty=
 to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and follow=
ed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest wit=
h Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it=
 impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he se=
arched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him=
 to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every=
 life situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. E=
ven as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impa=
ssionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully =
learned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana!=C2=A0Rama i=
s a perfect example of a liberated man
 with no desires or agendas who impa=
ssionately discharges one's dharma arising from the momentum of karmas befo=
re liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

ble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qu=
alities (e.g. pride or attachment), one's discrimination is not pleased unt=
