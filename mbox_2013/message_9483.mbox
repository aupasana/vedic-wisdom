Hi Aman,

This is not correct group for such queries.
Please ask this on vedic-astrology@yahoo...

Also, the answer to your question seems more logical than astrological.

93 falls before 96. Marriage would have likely taken place in 96 if he did
not marry in 93.

If there are five likely dates of an event happening - it may happen on any
of them. It is hard to say when will it take place exactly.
It also does not indicate that event will take place every time it is
likely. If marriage has happened once, the next likely time may indicate
something related to the relationship or marital life, or some other
business partnership or some other thing indicated by 7th house.

Regards,
Ujjwal
