Why I don=92t eat meat?

**

*Article on Agniveer that made hundreds stop e=
ating meat within 24 hours!*

Agniveer]<http://i2.wp.com/agniveer.=
com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/notomeat.jpg>
*

*Most polluting industry*

=
Because meat and livestock is one of the *most polluting industries of the
=
world*. Whatever ecological damage we face today can be attributed
signific=
antly to this non-essential industry. (refer United Nations
document on mea=
t industry being culprit for climate change, land pollution,
water depletio=
n and loss of biodiversity at
http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00=
.htm)



*Cause of hunger and poverty*

Because *meat is cause of hunger an=
d poverty in the world.* Just as I
myself hate being hungry and under-nutri=
tioned, I feel the same for
millions of my brothers and sisters born from s=
ame mother earth. If I could
have killed myself to satisfy their hunger, I =
would have gladly done so.

But for all I know, if people stop eating meat =
and adopt vegetarian ways, *they
could feed at least 10 times more people u=
sing the same efforts and
energy.*This is based on the principle of energy-=
pyramid which states
that the at
least 10 units of vegetation is consumed t=
o prepare 1 unit of meat by
feeding the meat-producing animals. Refer any t=
ext on food chain or energy
pyramid. In fact for most of the commercially p=
roduced meat that humans eat
currently, energy losses are much higher.

Thu=
s each person who stops eating meat is feeding at least 9 more people
apart=
 from himself. *What could be a greater form of charity than simply
avoidin=
g meat! *And what could be a greater sin for me than forcing at
least 9 peo=
ple to die from hunger because I love the taste of
mutton! Moreover, meat i=
ndustry also significantly depletes water.

Since I consider entire humanit=
y as my own family, I cannot sleep
peacefully with the guilt of being a cau=
se of hunger and thirst for my
dearest brothers and sisters and innocent ch=
ildren in my global home.



*Vegetarian alternatives exist*

Because in to=
day=92s era, I don=92t see anybody hunting to survive like the
lions in Afr=
ica. Meat is simply a non-essential addiction. *There is no
meat-product fo=
r which a healthier vegetarian alternative does not exist.*



*Meat is non=
-renewable*

Because meat is non-renewable. An animal once killed cannot gr=
ow more
animals. But a plant, even when uprooted, can grow a new plant from=
 its
roots, shoots and seeds. Thus the hunger and thirst caused by meat-eat=
ing
is much more longer term and intense than that discussed earlier.



*L=
ife is Beautiful*

Because I consider my life to be dearest to me. I consid=
er life of my near
and dear ones to be most precious. I see all humans cons=
idering lives of
their near and dear ones equally precious. If I kill any o=
f them, *I am
deemed a murderer because I snatched the most precious gift o=
f life.*

So how can I commit the same crime on other species who too have =
a face and
brain like me, who also love their life so much, who also face t=
he same
fear when they approach death, who also express happiness and grief=
 like me
and my dear ones? Simply because I do not understand their languag=
e or
consider them less intelligent? By this logic, even killing of
mental-=
patients should also be legitimized. Killing of coma patients should
also b=
e legitimized. Eating orphans should also be legitimized.

And since they a=
re not, even meat eating is a crime of same order for me.



*Question: The=
n should you not stop eating plants also? After all, even
they have life, a=
s proved by science.*

*Answer*: Research has only proved that plants also =
demonstrate similar
processes and cellular structures that are found in ani=
mals. Science does
not say that plants have a personality like animals. The=
re is no way to
prove that plants exhibit same form of sorrow or joy or put=
 efforts like
animals. Plants don=92t reproduce in a manner similar to anim=
als or stop
being able to reproduce more plants like animals after they are=
 killed. *There
are significant differences in plants and animals, and that=
 is why even
science of biology clearly differentiates study of botany and =
zoology. *

So I do not consider plants to have a soul that feels =93I am t=
his mango
tree=94. This coupled with reasons discussed above justify eating=
 of plants,
but not of animals.

But even if we assume that plants can feel=
 pain like animals. Still, we can
live without eating animals. *But we cann=
ot live without eating plants.* We
simply do not have a choice here. And by=
 eating plants, at least 10 times
more humans in our family can get food to=
 eat and water to drink that by
tasting a beef-steak. Thus commonsense and =
basic humanity demands that we
show mercy on those at least whom we can all=
ow to live without killing
ourselves and torturing our family members. Or e=
lse, same reason may be
given tomorrow to justify cannibalism as well.



*=
Question: Even lions and tigers eat meat. So what is wrong if humans eat?*
=

*Answer*: Lions and tigers and other carnivorous animals eat meat because =
*they
are designed by nature to do so.* If they do not eat so, they would d=
ie.
They are not in a position to think, analyze, choose and decide what to=

eat, what not to eat, whether to eat in a plate or in a bowl, whether to
c=
ook or not cook, whether to mix 5 varieties of meat with some toppings or
e=
at plain and raw, whether to cook in Tandoor or roast. Since humans
possess=
 this finesse, *question of right and wrong also is relevant to
humans alon=
e.*

Now humans have a choice of food =96 animals or plants. There is 100%
=
evidence that eating of animals causes hunger, pollutes nature and is at
pa=
r with eating humans. Further eating animals is optional. So a sensible
per=
son like me will not eat animals. On plants, there is controversy.
People l=
ike me believe that they are chemical reactions and not souls with
personal=
ities. Others may differ. But in absence of conclusive proof for
latter, it=
 would be still wiser to prefer them for food instead of animals
and be les=
s criminals in worst case. Further we do not even have a choice
in this cas=
e.

Say you are forced to drink from one of the two bottles. One is confirm=
ed
to contain deadly poison. And opening the bottle will definitely kill 10=

other people. For other, there is a confusion on it being poison and no on=
e
else gets killed. What would you choose? *At least, I would choose the
se=
cond bottle without second thoughts.* Same is that case with eating
plants =
=96 the natural, humane way of eating.



*Question: But I am an atheist. I=
 do not believe in soul or God. So plants
or animals are all similar bioche=
mical reactions. Why should I
differentiate?*

*Answer*: If you are an athe=
ist or agnostic, *there is all the more reason
why you should eat plants bu=
t not animals.* Because I assume you admit that
you are a human. And being =
a human, I assume, you agree that hurting other
humans is not acceptable in=
 any rational society. I assume that you love
your fellow human beings. I a=
ssume you consider humanity to be your own
family. I assume you care for ea=
ch and every innocent human being. And
hence, I assume you would want to ke=
ep at least 9 people hungry and thirsty
while you relish on chicken-tikka. =
And you would not like our future
generations to be permanently diseased an=
d in poverty simply because we
have been screwing up the environment. I ass=
ume that you indeed love your
children and would love to gift them with ble=
ssings than curse them with
hatred. If my assumptions are correct, then an =
atheist must be frontrunner
for =93Say No to Meat=94 campaign. *If my assum=
ptions are wrong, then even
eating up an atheist is equally justified.*



=
*Question: Then even domestication of animals and drinking milk should be
c=
rime?*

*Answer*: Well, these are ambiguous topics. There can be views and =
counter
views. One can discuss and debate on these. But regardless of that,=
 at
least this is certain that if these were to be crime, *then killing of
=
animals is bound to be a crime of much muchbhigher magnitude.* So at least
=
we should avoid conducting such great crimes against nature, humanity and
a=
nimals, even if we differ on these few issues.

For example, we cannot just=
ify killing of human beings on pretext that a
lesser crime called =91corpor=
ate fraud=92 is not clearly defined in law. For
someone who raises a questi=
on that domestication of animals and drinking of
milk are also crimes, ther=
e is all the more reason why such a person should
be torch-bearer of moveme=
nt for compassion on animals and promote
vegetarianism.



*Question: What =
will I eat if I am in a place where I only get meat? For
example, if I am s=
tranded on an island or am in Antarctica.*

*Answer*: This is a very intere=
sting question! Tell me, how many times you
have actually been in Antarctic=
a or have been stranded on an island like
Robinson Crusoe? This very questi=
on implies that you agree that
*EXCEPT*when you are stranded on an island o=
r a place where you must
eat meat to
survive, in all other situations, you =
should not eat meat.

OK So we give you this concession. When you become Ro=
binson Crusoe, eat
meat if you indeed believe so. But 99.9999% of human inh=
abitations and
situations don=92t demand you to be a Robinson Crusoe! You g=
et ample non-meat
food in almost all locations where humans live as a socie=
ty. After all the
animals they eat also eventually have to eat plants. (All=
 food-chains do
begin with plants. There is no animal that converts solar e=
nergy into
bio-energy. Only plants can do that.)



*Question: What about e=
ggs? Eggs are good for health and even government
promotes eating of eggs.*=


*Answer*: Government is also mired in scam charges. Just because governme=
nt
promotes something does not make it rational. Had that been the case, th=
ere
would have been never a movement against scams and for change of govern=
ance!

Coming to eggs, have you ever been in a poultry farm? The way these =
eggs
are produced by ruthlessly torturing the chickens can raise your hairs=

(assuming you have compassion). Further, it is one of the most unhygienic
=
locations. If you consider that humans should also be motivated to eat shit=

after picking from comode and serving on a beautiful plate, then perhaps
y=
ou have at least one lame reason to defend egg-eating. Because the most
mod=
ern and expensive egg-farms are no more hygienic than a dirty toilet in
a d=
irty bus-stop of Karachi. *(By the way, the most hygienic of the
meat-farms=
 are even more dirty.)*

Also, there is no special nutrient in eggs that is=
 not available in plants
in ample. In fact eggs don=92t even come close to =
be termed nutritious
compared to common plant food.* Eating pulses would be=
 a much wiser* and
nature-friendly option than invite diseases and destroy =
environment for
eating womb of a bird.



*Question: If we stop eating anim=
als, will not their numbers grow up and
fill the entire earth? We must kill=
 animals to preserve natural balance.*

*Answer*: This is perhaps the *cute=
st cruel question* I have ever heard in
my life. Cute because it seems as i=
f an innocent child who first learnt
about nature in his pre-school has fra=
med the question. Cruel because one
is attempting to project himself as Rob=
inhood who kills to save the planet!

But let=92s face the reality. *How ma=
ny if us actually eat animals because of
our genuine concern for nature?* H=
ow many of us are indeed
environmentalists? Or is it merely tingling of our=
 taste-buds that we want
to satisfy by hook or crook?

Coming to facts, thi=
s argument would have been valid had humans as a race
would have been eatin=
g meat exclusively through hunting like lions and
tigers. Now lions and tig=
ers do not create farmhouses to rear deer and
sheep so that they can have a=
 ready supply of food.

Humans on contrary have created a huge commercial i=
ndustry to
*PRODUCE*meat-providing animals and then kill them to fulfil the=
ir
tastes. 99% of
humans actually *GROW* the animals they kill. And in proc=
ess of this
growth, they destroy the nature like anything.

Thus this cruel=
 question puts the enquirer at par with Osama Bin Laden who
justifies his t=
error attacks as service to humanity! *(This is a hard truth
that most terr=
orists seriously believe that they are serving humanity and
God by killing =
others!)*

By the way, humans do not eat all the animals and birds. Humans =
don=92t eat
carnivorous animals for example. Most humans don=92t eat crows,=
 vultures,
jackals or scorpions. Why they have not filled the entire earth =
then?

Also, this line of thinking can be extended to allow cooking up term=
inally
ill and aged humans. After all, we all are trained since childhood t=
o cite
population as the greatest problem facing us.

Someone who has studi=
ed ecology at even basic level will not give such
unscientific arguments an=
d invite ridicule.

On contrary meat industry has endangered many species t=
o extinction. So if
preservation of natural balance of population be the ov=
erriding selfless
goal, then do not think even a second to adopt vegetarian=
ism.



*Question: To kill other animals is a natural phenomenon. All power=
ful
animals kill to eat. So what is wrong if humans also act naturally?*

*=
Answer*: First, as discussed earlier, no animal ever grows animals. No
anim=
al constructs poultry farms and butcher houses. They simply follow
their hu=
nger instincts on need basis.

Second, the most powerful animals are primar=
ily vegetarians. Be it
elephant, or horse, or hippopotamus, or wild buffalo=
, or rhino, or gorilla.

Third, animals also live nude, do not read poems, =
do not clean their parts
after shit and do not do a lot of things that huma=
ns do. They also do not
cook meat before eating. If meat-eating was so natu=
ral for humans, then
most of us would have been relishing raw meat without =
using spoons and
forks.

*Humans were designed to be intelligent*. To be ab=
le to judge and decide
what is wrong and what is right. To be compassionate=
. To be loyal. To be
rational. *Thus, if indeed humans want to be =91natura=
l=92, they should protect
and not torture animals.*

And if this logic be c=
onsidered seriously, then even cannibalism is also
natural if practiced by =
powerful humans. Of course, there remains no basis
for anti-corruption move=
ment. After all it is natural for the more powerful
to trample those who ar=
e less powerful, as per the enquirer!

But lets be human.

Lets accept it, =
this is a *beast-mindset* and not human way of thinking.
Humanity is about =
analysis, *love, compassion and urge to protect the less
powerful.* These t=
raits alone make humans so special and different from
animals.



*Question=
: Biologically, humans are designed to eat animals. Look at our
teeth, our =
intestines. We don=92t have organs to digest cellulose like
herbivorous ani=
mals. Hence are we not designed to eat animals?*

*Answer*: Yet another lam=
e excuse to justify cravings of tongue. Humans are
designed to be separate =
from both herbivores and carnivores. Unlike
herbivores, humans cannot diges=
t grass. That is why we are not
grass-eaters. But unlike carnivores, we are=
 also not designed to eat raw
meat. So we don=92t have huge canines like li=
on and tiger. Human canines are
at best good for peeling sugarcanes *(Consu=
lt your dentist before you
attempt so though. If you have been eating too m=
uch of junk, then sugarcane
may peel off your teeth instead!)*.

If meat wa=
s so natural to us, we would have naturally been eating uncooked
meat. By c=
hasing, hunting, killing and eating away an animal using
fingernails and te=
eth alone. We would not have required to tie or imprison
the animal and the=
n kill it using special weapons. No animal does that.

On contrary, fruits =
and vegetables can be eaten uncooked. In fact many
health-regimes focus on =
purely uncooked-diet. But meat demands use of fire.
The fire is used so tha=
t meat is converted to a more acceptable form. These
days a raw meat concep=
t is on rage in some places. But medical advice is to
have it cooked to ens=
ure there is no infection. And most humans find even
the mention of raw mea=
t very disgusting. After all we were designed by
nature to be not cruel.

*=
So if biology is your inspiration, be a vegetarian*. Our brain, body,
intel=
lect and emotions were designed only to be compassionate humans.



*Questi=
on: But I live in a family and society where meat is predominant
food. How =
can I suddenly stop eating meat and appear crazy in my group?*

*Answer*: T=
his is a more honest question. It is indeed an issue with many
genuine hone=
st people who are forced to eat meat due to peer pressure. The
way out is t=
o rethink the same issue from a different perspective.

*J**ust assume for =
a second that you are among a group of cannibals who
want to eat your famil=
y members. *Would you enjoy feasting with them and
eating away leg of your =
daughter, finger of your mother and intestine of
your brother with masala c=
urry?

A rational human being considers all living beings as his own family=
. But
even if you consider all humans as your own family, still meat eating=
 means
you are killing at least ten of your own family members.

Thus, *if =
we simply start considering the Mother Nature as our mother
indeed, problem=
 is solved. *Then we care for Mother Nature like we care for
our own mother=
. Then we are deeply touched at hunger and poverty of our own
brothers and =
sisters across the globe, and would not be party to anything
that makes so =
many innocents die and suffer due to lack of food. So instead
of being some=
one ashamed of your honesty, you become an agent of positive
change. Instea=
d of fearing that you appear crazy, you feel proud that you
are the most se=
nsible.



*Question: Does it mean all meat-eaters are murderers and should=
 be hated?*

*Answer*: Technically, first part of the question is yes. Anyo=
ne who is in
anyway instrumental to death of an innocent is indeed a  culpr=
it. But we
disagree that they should be hated. Meat-eating is a cultural is=
sue today.
Cultural issues are tackled through sensitisation and awareness =
and not
through Talibanization and hatred. Remember, the entire foundation =
of
movement against meat-eating lies in *compassion and genuine concern for=

all living beings*. So we should eradicate this brutal practice through
hu=
mane means.

We do agree that law should be appropriately formulated to dis=
courage
meat-eating and promote healthy environment-friendly human-friendly=
 habits
like plant-eating. But not through any feeling of hatred towards an=
yone. We
all humans are one single family. We should love each other and en=
courage
each other for improvements. So even if you eat meat, I still love =
you as a
mother loves her new-born calf. And that is why I appeal to you to=
 say not
to meat.



*Question: What would then happen of so many meat-rear=
ing farms and
industries? Would it not cause people in these industries to =
become
unemployed?*

*Answer*: No, they would become even more productive. =
Instead of meat, if
they start producing plant food, they can feed at least=
 10 times more
people with same investments. And hence this would boost the=
 economy like
anything and bring prosperity to all. And future generations =
will thank
them for gifting them a less-polluted environment and a less-hun=
gry life.



*Question: If meat-eating was so unnatural, why humans started=
 eating meat
in first place?*

*Answer*: Exactly the same question can be p=
osed for crimes like murder,
fraud, racism, gender-discrimination, terroris=
m and rape. Any evil breeds
on ignorance and lack of education. Even if you=
 look into Bible, it states
that originally all humans were plant-eaters (G=
enesis 1.29 for example).

Vedas =96 *the oldest books known to humanity* =
=96 vociferously suggest
non-meat diet for humans. The first mantra of Yaju=
rveda itself begins with
an advise to protect the animals.

Over ages, due =
to lack of wisdom, lack of development, violent periods etc,
there was an i=
ncentive to focus only on immediate needs than think smartly.
Or blindly ap=
e old customs in name of religion or culture. Hence
meat-eating became as p=
revalent as gender-discrimination or racism etc.

When we plan our present =
and future, we are not at all bothered about why
we did not do something in=
 past. We simply rationally evaluate the benefits
in present and future, an=
d plan accordingly. That is why we use laptops,
speak on mobile phones, wat=
ch TV and travel in planes and trains even
though human civilisation never =
had these ever before. *What we should be
bothered today is not why somethi=
ng happened in past.* We should instead
focus on what we need to do right n=
ow to save our lovely planet and bring
nourishment for teeming billions tha=
t are facing punishment for our
cravings of tongue. We should focus on what=
 we must do today to not be a
villain torturing our own lovely children tom=
orrow.



*Question: I thought you would argue as animal-rights activist an=
d I would
question why you are not being a plants-right activist. You inste=
ad started
arguing as human-rights activist. How do I counter you then?*

*=
Answer*:

1. The way Supreme Lord has designed this world, if one genuinely=
 starts
caring for humans alone, then care for animals would chip in automa=
tically.
After all this is just a marvellously symbiotic world where everyt=
hing is
interrelated. *You get back what you give. *

2. Why do you need to=
 counter something which is so obvious and intuitive?
Let us admit that *me=
at-eating is a social-evil* that thrives from
dark-ages like gender discrim=
ination, racism etc. It is hardly a century
ago that we gave voting rights =
to women. Racism and casteism were legally
uprooted hardly a few decades ag=
o. Still movement against these evils
continue. So we are not as evolved as=
 technological advances may make us
believe. Let us take meat-eating as nex=
t evil to tackle, given the
appalling situation of environment and given th=
e poverty statistics of the
world. *We should realise that each bite of mea=
t we relish makes one poor
die somewhere in world. And making earth closer =
to hell for our children
whom we love the most.*

3. For those who indeed a=
re rational and compassionate, this is indeed also
an animal-rights issues.=
 We inherited this *tribal mentality somehow that
the whole world is design=
ed exclusively for us =96 the humans. *This lust
made us destroy the enviro=
nment and start considering the entire earth as
our personal consort. And w=
ithin last century, the situation has turned so
worse that scientists are n=
ow worried about what would happen about our
basic necessities of food, lan=
d and water in times to come.

In medieval times, the lust made us to disre=
gard women as inferior to men
in name of even religion. Women, like animals=
, were considered by many
priests to have no soul. Others considered them t=
o be half-intelligent than
men and impure.

Many other people, like =93blac=
ks=94 were considered fit to be slave alone.
Then in last few decades, the =
enlightened ones took a journey backwards to
rectify the blunders. We thus =
uprooted racism and casteism. We started
considering women as equal to men =
in social, intellectual and political
rights. And now it is time to take th=
e journey a step further and show our
concern for animals as well. All thes=
e concerns =96 human-rights,
gender-rights, animal-rights =96 are part of s=
ame spectrum and caused out of
same ignorance in human mind. *So the evolve=
d ones should work to take this
next step.*

And even those societies that =
are yet to do their homework on gender-rights
and human-rights also could e=
xpedite their progress if they holistically
incorporate animal-rights as we=
ll.

But even if they do not, the dangerous situations of today force any
r=
ational person to embrace animal-rights. As a means to fulfil demands of
gr=
ave human-rights issues like poverty of teeming billions and damage of
envi=
ronment guaranteeing a dangerous future for our children.

So do not counte=
r the light of truth. Be honest, be humble and be rational.
Love others as =
you expect others to love you. The least you can do to
showcase your love f=
or your own brothers and sisters and children of future
is to replace that =
chicken-soup with tomato-soup.

*Be human, love humans.*

*Say no to meat!*=


And remember, *you get back what you give.*

Vedas, the oldest texts know=
n to humans and divine word for millions
categorically state that animals a=
re to be loved, not killed. Hundreds of
Mantras in Vedas clearly assert tha=
t only vegetarian diet is meant for
humans. The very first Mantra of Yajurv=
eda commands all nobles to defend
animals. You may visit this link to get c=
opy of complete set of 4 Vedas in

PS: We did not take up the issue of healt=
h hazards of eating meat. This has
been amply covered in many researches. T=
o summarise, meat eating is cause
of dreaded diseases like swine flu, mad c=
ow and bird flu. It increases risk
of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. A=
 habit that takes innocent lives,
promotes hunger, destroys future of child=
ren cannot bring positive impact
in our lives. You cannot meditate properly=
 if you eat meat. Food has
greatest impact on state of your mind, after you=
r deeds. What we suggest is
to think simple and honest. In world, you get b=
ack what you give.* So give
compassion and humanity and get back prosperity=
, health and happiness.* Be
human, love humans. Say no to meat!

<p><span style=3D"text-decoration:underline"><stron=
g>Most polluting industry</strong></span></p>
<p>Because meat and livestock=
 is one of the <b>most polluting industries of the world</b>.
 Whatever eco=
logical damage we face today can be attributed 
significantly to this non-e=
ssential industry. (refer United Nations 
document on meat industry being c=
ulprit for climate change, land 
pollution, water depletion and loss of bio=
diversity at=A0<a href=3D"http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm=

<p>=
<span style=3D"text-decoration:underline"><strong>Cause of hunger and pover=
ty</strong></span></p>
<p>Because <b>meat is cause of hunger and poverty in=
 the world.</b> Just
 as I myself hate being hungry and under-nutritioned, =
I feel the same 
for millions of my brothers and sisters born from same mot=
her earth. If I
 could have killed myself to satisfy their hunger, I would =
have gladly 
done so.</p>
<p>But for all I know, if people stop eating meat=
 and adopt vegetarian ways, <b>they could feed at least 10 times more peopl=
e using the same efforts and energy.</b>
 This is based on the principle of=
 energy-pyramid which states that the 
at least 10 units of vegetation is c=
onsumed to prepare 1 unit of meat by
 feeding the meat-producing animals. R=
efer any text on food chain or 
energy pyramid. In fact for most of the com=
mercially produced meat that 
humans eat currently, energy losses are much =
higher.</p>
<p>Thus each person who stops eating meat is feeding at least 9=
 more people apart from himself. <b>What could be a greater form of charity=
 than simply avoiding meat! </b>And
 what could be a greater sin for me tha=
n forcing at least 9 people to 
die from hunger because I love the taste of=
 mutton!=A0Moreover, meat 
industry also significantly depletes water.</p>
=
<p>Since I consider entire humanity as my own family, I cannot sleep 
peace=
fully with the guilt of being a cause of hunger and thirst for my 
dearest =
brothers and sisters and innocent children in my global home.</p>
<p>=A0</p=
>
<p><span style=3D"text-decoration:underline"><strong>Vegetarian alternati=
ves exist</strong></span></p>
<p>Because in today=92s era, I don=92t see an=
ybody hunting to survive like 
the lions in Africa. Meat is simply a non-es=
sential addiction. <b>There is no meat-product for which a healthier vegeta=
rian alternative does not exist.</b></p>
<p>=A0</p>
<p><span style=3D"text-=
decoration:underline"><strong>Meat is non-renewable</strong></span></p>
<p>=
Because meat is non-renewable. An animal once killed cannot grow more
 anim=
als. But a plant, even when uprooted, can grow a new plant from its
 roots,=
 shoots and seeds. Thus the hunger and thirst caused by 
meat-eating is muc=
h more longer term and intense than that discussed 
earlier.</p>
<p>=A0</p>=

<p><span style=3D"text-decoration:underline"><strong>Life is Beautiful</st=
rong></span></p>
<p>Because I consider my life to be dearest to me. I consi=
der life of my
 near and dear ones to be most precious. I see all humans co=
nsidering 
lives of their near and dear ones equally precious. If I kill an=
y of 
them, <b>I am deemed a murderer because I snatched the most precious =
gift of life.</b></p>
<p>So how can I commit the same crime on other specie=
s who too have a 
face and brain like me, who also love their life so much,=
 who also face 
the same fear when they approach death, who also express ha=
ppiness and 
grief like me and my dear ones? Simply because I do not unders=
tand their
 language or consider them less intelligent? By this logic, even=
 killing
 of mental-patients should also be legitimized. Killing of coma pa=
tients
 should also be legitimized. Eating orphans should also be legitimiz=
ed.</p>
<p>And since they are not, even meat eating is a crime of same orde=
r for me.</p>
<p>=A0</p>
<p><b>Question: Then should you not stop eating pl=
ants also? After all, even they have life, as proved by science.</b></p>
<p=
><strong>Answer</strong>: Research has only proved that plants also 
demons=
trate similar processes and cellular structures that are found in 
animals.=
 Science does not say that plants have a personality like 
animals. There i=
s no way to prove that plants exhibit same form of 
sorrow or joy or put ef=
forts like animals. Plants don=92t reproduce in a 
manner similar to animal=
s or stop being able to reproduce more plants 
like animals after they are =
killed. <b>There are significant differences
 in plants and animals, and th=
at is why even science of biology clearly 
differentiates study of botany a=
nd zoology.=A0</b></p>
<p>So I do not consider plants to have a soul that f=
eels =93I am this 
mango tree=94. This coupled with reasons discussed above=
 justify eating of
 plants, but not of animals.</p>
<p>But even if we assum=
e that plants can feel pain like animals. Still, we can live without eating=
 animals. <b>But we cannot live without eating plants.</b>=A0We
 simply do =
not have a choice here. And by eating plants, at least 10 
times more human=
s in our family can get food to eat and water to drink 
that by tasting a b=
eef-steak. Thus commonsense and basic humanity 
demands that we show mercy =
on those at least whom we can allow to live 
without killing ourselves and =
torturing our family members. Or else, 
same reason may be given tomorrow t=
o justify cannibalism as well.</p>
<p>=A0</p>
<p><b>Question: Even lions an=
d tigers eat meat. So what is wrong if humans eat?</b></p>
<p><strong>Answe=
r</strong>: Lions and tigers and other carnivorous animals eat meat because=
 <b>they are designed by nature to do so.</b>
 If they do not eat so, they =
would die. They are not in a position to 
think, analyze, choose and decide=
 what to eat, what not to eat, whether 
to eat in a plate or in a bowl, whe=
ther to cook or not cook, whether to 
mix 5 varieties of meat with some top=
pings or eat plain and raw, whether
 to cook in Tandoor or roast. Since hum=
ans possess this finesse, <b>question of right and wrong also is relevant t=
o humans alone.</b></p>
<p>Now humans have a choice of food =96 animals or =
plants. There is 100% 
evidence that eating of animals causes hunger, pollu=
tes nature and is at
 par with eating humans. Further eating animals is opt=
ional. So a 
sensible person like me will not eat animals. On plants, there=
 is 
controversy. People like me believe that they are chemical reactions a=
nd
 not souls with personalities. Others may differ. But in absence of 
con=
clusive proof for latter, it would be still wiser to prefer them for 
food =
instead of animals and be less criminals in worst case.=A0Further we 
do no=
t even have a choice in this case.</p>
<p>Say you are forced to drink from =
one of the two bottles. One is 
confirmed to contain deadly poison. And ope=
ning the bottle will 
definitely kill 10 other people. For other, there is =
a confusion on it 
being poison and no one else gets killed. What would you=
 choose? <strong>At least, I would choose the second bottle without second =
thoughts.</strong> Same is that case with eating plants =96 the natural, hu=
mane way of eating.</p>

<p>=A0</p>
<p><b>Question: But I am an atheist. I =
do not believe in soul or God. So
 plants or animals are all similar bioche=
mical reactions. Why should I 
differentiate?</b></p>
<p><strong>Answer</st=
rong>: If you are an atheist or agnostic, <b>there is all the more reason w=
hy you should eat plants but not animals.</b>
 Because I assume you admit t=
hat you are a human. And being a human, I 
assume, you agree that hurting o=
ther humans is not acceptable in any 
rational society. I assume that you l=
ove your fellow human beings. I 
assume you consider humanity to be your ow=
n family. I assume you care 
for each and every innocent human being. And h=
ence, I assume you would 
want to keep at least 9 people hungry and thirsty=
 while you relish on 
chicken-tikka. And you would not like our future gene=
rations to be 
permanently diseased and in poverty simply because we have b=
een screwing
 up the environment. I assume that you indeed love your childr=
en and 
would love to gift them with blessings than curse them with hatred.=
 If 
my assumptions are correct, then an atheist must be frontrunner for =
=93Say
 No to Meat=94 campaign. <strong>If my assumptions are wrong, then e=
ven eating up an atheist is equally justified.</strong></p>
<p>=A0</p>
<p><=
b>Question: Then even domestication of animals and drinking milk should be =
crime?</b></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Well, these are ambiguous topics=
. There can 
be views and counter views. One can discuss and debate on thes=
e. But 
regardless of that, at least this is certain that if these were to =
be 
crime, <b>then killing of animals is bound to be a crime of much muchbh=
igher magnitude.</b>
 So at least we should avoid conducting such great cri=
mes against 
nature, humanity and animals, even if we differ on these few i=
ssues.</p>
<p>For example, we cannot justify killing of human beings on pre=
text 
that a lesser crime called =91corporate fraud=92 is not clearly defin=
ed in 
law. For someone who raises a question that domestication of animals=
 and
 drinking of milk are also crimes, there is all the more reason why su=
ch
 a person should be torch-bearer of movement for compassion on animals 
=
and promote vegetarianism.</p>
<p>=A0</p>
<p><b>Question: What will I eat i=
f I am in a place where I only get 
meat? For example, if I am stranded on =
an island or am in Antarctica.</b></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: This is =
a very interesting question! Tell 
me, how many times you have actually bee=
n in Antarctica or have been 
stranded on an island like Robinson Crusoe? T=
his very question implies 
that you agree that <strong>EXCEPT</strong> when=
 you are stranded on an 
island or a place where you must eat meat to survi=
ve, in all other 
situations, you should not eat meat.</p>
<p>OK So we give=
 you this concession. When you become Robinson Crusoe, 
eat meat if you ind=
eed believe so. But 99.9999% of human inhabitations 
and situations don=92t=
 demand you to be a Robinson Crusoe! You get ample 
non-meat food in almost=
 all locations where humans live as a society. 
After all the animals they =
eat also eventually have to eat plants. (All 
food-chains do begin with pla=
nts. There is no animal that converts solar
 energy into bio-energy. Only p=
lants can do that.)</p>
<p>=A0</p>
<p><b>Question: What about eggs? Eggs ar=
e good for health and even government promotes eating of eggs.</b></p>
<p><=
strong>Answer</strong>: Government is also mired in scam charges. 
Just bec=
ause government promotes something does not make it rational. 
Had that bee=
n the case, there would have been never a movement against 
scams and for c=
hange of governance!</p>
<p>Coming to eggs, have you ever been in a poultry=
 farm? The way these 
eggs are produced by ruthlessly torturing the chicken=
s can raise your 
hairs (assuming you have compassion). Further, it is one =
of the most 
unhygienic locations. If you consider that humans should also =
be 
motivated to eat shit after picking from comode and serving on a 
beaut=
iful plate, then perhaps you have at least one lame reason to 
defend egg-e=
ating. Because the most modern and expensive egg-farms are 
no more hygieni=
c than a dirty toilet in a dirty bus-stop of Karachi.=A0<i>(By the way, the=
 most=A0hygienic=A0of the meat-farms are even more dirty.)</i></p>
<p>Also,=
 there is no special nutrient in eggs that is not available in 
plants in a=
mple. In fact eggs don=92t even come close to be termed 
nutritious compare=
d to common plant food.<strong> Eating pulses would be a much wiser</strong=
> and nature-friendly option than invite diseases and destroy environment f=
or eating womb of a bird.</p>
<p>=A0</p>
<p><b>Question: If we stop eating =
animals, will not their numbers grow 
up and fill the entire earth? We must=
 kill animals to preserve natural 
balance.</b></p>
<p><strong>Answer</stro=
ng>: This is perhaps the <b>cutest cruel question</b>
 I have ever heard in=
 my life. Cute because it seems as if an innocent 
child who first learnt a=
bout nature in his pre-school has framed the 
question. Cruel because one i=
s attempting to project himself as 
Robinhood who kills to save the planet!=
</p>
<p>But let=92s face the reality. <b>How many if us actually eat animal=
s because of our genuine concern for nature?</b>=A0How
 many of us are inde=
ed environmentalists? Or is it merely tingling of 
our taste-buds that we w=
ant to satisfy by hook or crook?</p>
<p>Coming to facts, this argument woul=
d have been valid had humans as a 
race would have been eating meat exclusi=
vely through hunting like lions 
and tigers. Now lions and tigers do not cr=
eate farmhouses to rear deer 
and sheep so that they can have a ready suppl=
y of food.</p>
<p>Humans on contrary have created a huge commercial industr=
y to <strong>PRODUCE</strong> meat-providing animals and then kill them to =
fulfil their tastes. 99% of humans actually <strong>GROW</strong> the anima=
ls they kill. And in process of this growth, they destroy the nature like a=
nything.</p>

<p>Thus this cruel question puts the enquirer at par with Osa=
ma Bin Laden who justifies his terror attacks as service to humanity! <em>(=
This is a hard truth that most terrorists seriously believe that they are s=
erving humanity and God by killing others!)</em></p>

<p>By the way, humans=
 do not eat all the animals and birds. Humans don=92t
 eat carnivorous anim=
als for example. Most humans don=92t eat crows, 
vultures, jackals or scorp=
ions. Why they have not filled the entire 
earth then?</p>
<p>Also, this li=
ne of thinking can be extended to allow cooking up 
terminally ill and aged=
 humans. After all, we all are trained since 
childhood to cite population =
as the greatest problem facing us.</p>
<p>Someone who has studied ecology a=
t even basic level will not give such unscientific arguments and invite rid=
icule.</p>
<p>On contrary meat industry has endangered many species to exti=
nction. 
So=A0if preservation of natural balance of population be the overr=
iding 
selfless goal, then do not think even a second to adopt vegetarianis=
m.</p>
<p>=A0</p>
<p><b>Question: To kill other animals is a natural phenom=
enon. All 
powerful animals kill to eat. So what is wrong if humans also ac=
t 
naturally?</b></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: First, as discussed earli=
er, no animal ever 
grows animals. No animal constructs poultry farms and b=
utcher houses. 
They simply follow their hunger instincts on need basis.</p=
>
<p>Second, the most powerful animals are primarily vegetarians. Be it 
el=
ephant, or horse, or hippopotamus, or wild buffalo, or rhino, or 
gorilla.<=
/p>
<p>Third, animals also live nude, do not read poems, do not clean their=
 
parts after shit and do not do a lot of things that humans do. They also
=
 do not cook meat before eating. If meat-eating was so natural for 
humans,=
 then most of us would have been relishing raw meat without using
 spoons a=
nd forks.</p>
<p><strong>Humans were designed to be intelligent</strong>. T=
o be able to judge and decide what is wrong and what is right. To be compas=
sionate. To be loyal. To be rational. <strong>Thus, if indeed humans want t=
o be =91natural=92, they should protect and not torture animals.</strong></=
p>

<p>And if this logic be considered seriously, then even=A0cannibalism i=
s 
also natural if practiced by powerful humans. Of course, there remains 
=
no basis for anti-corruption movement. After all it is natural for the 
mor=
e powerful to trample those who are less powerful, as per the 
enquirer!</p=
>
<p>But lets be human.</p>
<p>Lets accept it, this is a <strong>beast-mind=
set</strong> and not human way of thinking. Humanity is about analysis,=A0<=
strong>love, compassion and urge to protect the less powerful.</strong> The=
se traits alone make humans so special and different from animals.</p>

=A0</p>
<p><b>Question: Biologically, humans are designed to eat animals. L=
ook 
at our teeth, our intestines. We don=92t have organs to digest cellulo=
se 
like herbivorous animals. Hence are we not designed to eat animals?</b>=
</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yet another lame excuse to justify craving=
s 
of tongue. Humans are designed to be separate from both herbivores and 
=
carnivores. Unlike herbivores, humans cannot digest grass. That is why 
we =
are not grass-eaters. But unlike carnivores, we are also not designed
 to e=
at raw meat. So we don=92t have huge canines like lion and tiger. 
Human ca=
nines are at best good for peeling sugarcanes <em>(Consult your 
dentist be=
fore you attempt so though. If you have been eating too much 
of junk, then=
 sugarcane may peel off your teeth instead!)</em>.</p>
<p>If meat was so na=
tural to us, we would have naturally been eating 
uncooked meat. By chasing=
, hunting, killing and eating away an animal 
using fingernails and teeth a=
lone. We would not have required to tie or 
imprison the animal and then ki=
ll it using special weapons. No animal 
does that.</p>
<p>On contrary, frui=
ts and vegetables can be eaten uncooked. In fact 
many health-regimes focus=
 on purely uncooked-diet. But meat demands use 
of fire. The fire is used s=
o that meat is converted to a more acceptable
 form. These days a raw meat =
concept is on rage in some places. But 
medical advice is to have it cooked=
 to ensure there is no infection. And
 most humans find even the mention of=
 raw meat very disgusting. After 
all we were designed by nature to be not =
cruel.</p>
<p><strong>So if biology is your inspiration, be a vegetarian</s=
trong>. Our brain, body, intellect and emotions were designed only to be co=
mpassionate humans.</p>
<p>=A0</p>
<p><b>Question: But I live in a family a=
nd society where meat is 
predominant food. How can I suddenly stop eating =
meat and appear crazy 
in my group?</b></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Thi=
s is a more honest question. It is indeed
 an issue with many genuine hones=
t people who are forced to eat meat due
 to peer pressure. The way out is t=
o rethink the same issue from a 
different perspective.</p>
<p><strong>J</s=
trong><b>ust assume for a second that you are among a group of cannibals wh=
o want to eat your family members. </b>Would
 you enjoy feasting with them =
and eating away leg of your daughter, 
finger of your mother and intestine =
of your brother with masala curry?</p>
<p>A rational human being considers =
all living beings as his own family.
 But even if you consider all humans a=
s your own family, still meat 
eating means you are killing at least ten of=
 your own family members.</p>
<p>Thus, <b>if we simply start considering th=
e Mother Nature as our mother indeed, problem is solved. </b>Then
 we care =
for Mother Nature like we care for our own mother. Then we are 
deeply touc=
hed at hunger and poverty of our own brothers and sisters 
across the globe=
, and would not be party to anything that makes so many

suffer due to lack of food. So instead of being

p>
<p><b>Question: Does it mean all meat-eaters are murderers and should be=
 hated?</b></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Technically, first part of the =
question is 
yes. Anyone who is in anyway instrumental to death of an innoc=
ent is 
indeed a =A0culprit. But we disagree that they should be hated. 
Me=
at-eating is a cultural issue today. Cultural issues are tackled 
through s=
ensitisation and awareness and not through Talibanization and 
hatred. Reme=
mber, the entire foundation of movement against meat-eating 
lies in <b>com=
passion and genuine concern for all living beings</b>. So we should eradica=
te this brutal practice through humane means.</p>
<p>We do agree that law s=
hould be appropriately formulated to discourage
 meat-eating and promote he=
althy environment-friendly human-friendly 
habits like plant-eating. But no=
t through any feeling of hatred towards 
anyone. We all humans are one sing=

<p><b>Question: What would then happen of so many meat-rearing farms an=

<p><b>Question: If meat-eating =
was so unnatural, why humans started eating meat in first place?</b></p>
<p=

crime=
s like murder, fraud, racism, gender-discrimination, terrorism and 
rape. A=
ny evil breeds on ignorance and lack of education. Even if you

ra of

p>Over ages, due to lack of wisdom, lack of development, violent 
periods e=

p>When we plan our present and future, we are not at all bothered about

p><b>Question: I thought you would argue as animal-rights activist and I
 w=
ould question why you are not being a plants-right activist. You 
instead s=
tarted arguing as human-rights activist. How do I counter you 
then?</b></p=
>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>1. The way Supreme Lord has designed t=
his world, if one genuinely 
starts caring for humans alone, then care for =
animals would chip in 
automatically. After all this is just a marvellously=
 symbiotic world 
where everything is interrelated. <b>You get back what yo=
u give.=A0</b></p>
<p>2. Why do you need to counter something which is so o=
bvious and intuitive? Let us admit that <b>meat-eating is a social-evil</b>=

 that thrives from dark-ages like gender discrimination, racism etc. It 
i=
s hardly a century ago that we gave voting rights to women. Racism and 
cas=
teism were legally uprooted hardly a few decades ago. Still movement 
again=
st these evils continue. So we are not as evolved as technological 
advance=
s may make us believe. Let us take meat-eating as next evil to 
tackle, giv=

poverty statistics=
 of the world. <b>We should realise that each bite of 
meat we relish makes=
 one poor die somewhere in world. And making earth 
closer to hell for our =
children whom we love the most.</b></p>
<p>3. For those who indeed are rati=
onal and compassionate, this is indeed also an animal-rights issues. We inh=
erited this <b>tribal mentality somehow that the whole world is designed ex=
clusively for us =96 the humans. </b>This
 lust made us destroy the environ=
ment and start considering the entire 
earth as our personal consort. And w=
ithin last century, the situation 
has turned so worse that scientists are =
now worried about what would 
happen about our basic necessities of food, l=
and and water in times to 
come.</p>
<p>In medieval times, the lust made us=
 to disregard women as inferior to
 men in name of even religion. Women, li=
ke animals, were considered by 
many priests to have no soul. Others consid=
ered them to be 
half-intelligent than men and impure.</p>
<p>Many other pe=
ople, like =93blacks=94 were considered fit to be slave 
alone. Then in las=
t few decades, the enlightened ones took a journey 
backwards to rectify th=
e blunders. We thus uprooted racism and casteism.
 We started considering w=
omen as equal to men in social, intellectual 
and political rights. And now=
 it is time to take the journey a step 
further and show our concern for an=
imals as well. All these concerns =96 
human-rights, gender-rights, animal-=
rights =96 are part of same spectrum 
and caused out of same ignorance in h=
uman mind. <b>So the evolved ones should work to take this next step.</b></=
p>
<p>And even those societies that are yet to do their homework on 
gender=
-rights and human-rights also could expedite their progress if 
they holist=
ically incorporate animal-rights as well.</p>
<p>But even if they do not, t=
he dangerous situations of today force any 
rational person to embrace anim=
al-rights. As a means to fulfil demands 
of grave human-rights issues like =
poverty of teeming billions and damage
 of environment guaranteeing a dange=
rous future for our children.</p>
<p>So do not counter the light of truth. =
Be honest, be humble and be 
rational. Love others as you expect others to =
love you. The least you 
can do to showcase your love for your own brothers=
 and sisters and 
children of future is to replace that chicken-soup with t=
omato-soup.</p>
<p><strong>Be human, love humans.</strong></p>
<p><strong>S=
ay no to meat!</strong></p>
<p>And remember, <strong>you get back what you =
give.</strong></p>
<p>Vedas, the oldest texts known to humans and divine wo=
rd for millions categorically state that animals are to be loved, not kille=
d. Hundreds of Mantras in Vedas clearly assert that only vegetarian diet is=
 meant for humans. The very first Mantra of Yajurveda commands all nobles t=
o defend animals. You may visit this link to get copy of complete set of 4 =

<p>PS: We did not take up the issue of healt=
h hazards of eating meat. 
This has been amply covered in many researches. =
To summarise, meat 
eating is cause of dreaded diseases like swine flu, mad=
 cow and bird 
flu. It increases risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes=
. A habit 
that takes innocent lives, promotes hunger, destroys future of c=
hildren 
cannot bring positive impact in our lives. You cannot meditate pro=
perly 
if you eat meat. Food has greatest impact on state of your mind, aft=
er 
your deeds. What we suggest is to think simple and honest.=A0In world, =
you
 get back what you give.<strong>=A0So give compassion and humanity and =
get back prosperity, health and happiness.</strong> Be human, love humans.=
=A0Say no to meat!</p><br><br clear=3D"all"><div>with best wishes<br><br>Va=
