ds a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification o=
f the various elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpl=
er words this translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-re=
activeness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuin=
e Kundalini awakening
 happens, one has to now self identify with the Devat=
a with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Deva=
ta then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shak=
ti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and =
body to various other things and entities, some of which are not postive in=
 nature while some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make us=
e of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness =
in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-su=
ddhi becomes even more> vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka wil=
l have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all m=
aladies of psychology are because of this. The human psychology as understo=
od by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. I=
t is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects=
 us from
 various subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional en=
tities, can get "ruptured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconven=
tional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entiti=
es inside the mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since al=
l these are very complex and various possiblities are there, it is not poss=
ible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is corre=
ctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. =
Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelli=
gent guess work.> Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all th=
ese to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as =
