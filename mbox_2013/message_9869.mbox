 Therefore
 their idea of reincarn=

 is very different. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body=

 to give the impression of an individual being, wh=

body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnatin=

al and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find ou=
t the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the=
 person.
 Sometimes it can be
 something
 as simple as spitting somewhere (=
where this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into their territory and=
 being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and b=
ody, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause ha=
rm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot=
 one stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends =
on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to =
help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the sp=
irit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person t=
rying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.

=
 handle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by force before the tim=
e till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession =
of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will invol=

r the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would=
 sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own=
 free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to =
remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit i=

 who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possessi=

i, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - a=

, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree =
of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana w=

problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over simplifie=
d and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul=
 will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a rol=
e to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a lif=
e where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shin=
e, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process. B=
ody, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.<b=
r clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">The Buddhists do not believe in the exi=
stence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our idea of
=
 Atmah.
 Therefore
 their idea of reincarnation
 is very different. It is l=
ike an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together
 to give=
 the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegrated =
and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can co=
alesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can sim=
ultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part.  =
; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to h=
ave the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while another pa=
rt of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lam=
a may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his energy=
 of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnating i=
n another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with their=
 philosophy.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Those philosophies which =
believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a c=
onstant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of
 debts/balances - =
rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. The fi=
nal aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move into a S=
upreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of any fina=
l importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciation of =
life and its processes.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">But the old Ve=
dantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at deat=
h unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to another and t=
he chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul's influ=
ence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for=
 this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul - fo=
r no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *consci=
ously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life. =
;</span><span><span> A Supreme Negation of life is 
not the ultimate aim, i=
t is only one among many possibilities.  If  moving into a state =

of complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim,
 =
then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex
 li=
fe-actions. </span>The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted t=
o only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rna=
bandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the soul to u=
nfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic=
 equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-ti=
me algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundre=
ds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have t=
o actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he =
had killed]. </span><span>Whereas those aspects of life 
where the soul has=
 no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by 
the law of rnabandhan=
