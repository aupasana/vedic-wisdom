Dear Ajit, namaste

[?]. Whatever the method we use, let us all hope that t=
he Gayatri mantra
enlightens us. It is possible that in an exalted state of=
 mind, the japa
can proceed much faster than is conventionally believed. Su=
ch an inference
is mentioned by Sringeri Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyateerth=
a mahaswamigal.

best regards
Hari
