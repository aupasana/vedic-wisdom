That was an interesting read. But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini r=
ises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experie=
nces, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience-=
 in other words, what doctors call "hallucinations". Are these hallucinatio=
ns or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. 

Ho=
wever most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking 'fake=
' patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories t=
end to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine "I hear voices in m=
y head" schizophrenic or kundalini patient. 

About vata, most of our patie=
nts have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually unable t=
o sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. We try=
 and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use of Cannab=
is and other drugs is also notoriously common- I'm sure this does no good f=
or vata.

The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do some on her be=
half as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any patient. 

Ca=
n anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalini patient? Mo=
st doctors label kundalini problems as "psychosis" and will advise anti-psy=
chotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not harm them, tho=
ugh I doubt it will help.

Advice and thoughts from all members would be mu=
ch appreciated.

If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are inco=

undalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts =
of purification of the various elements that compose the human mind-body st=
ructure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, more equani=
mity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Onc=
e and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self identif=
y with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind i=
s must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very =
helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open =
up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some of which ar=
e not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given half a ch=
ance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of inh=

 every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and ri=
sing up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The human psyc=
hology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal with=
 various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individu=
al, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us to remain=
 as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various reasons, high st=
ress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess =
of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing seriou=
s havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities are ther=
e, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a d=
iagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to rectif=
y the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing mor=
e than an intelligent guess work.

t wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience=
 of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have bee=

ous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-=
body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian ori=
gin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she sea=
rched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically=
 wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to dera=

this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakene=

 deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is someth=

problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as=
 the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her,=
 or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samarit=
ans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know o=
