Namaste,

No,no,no.........just no.

I have observed this logic to be preva=
lent in a lot of people.
It is similar in nature to, "Oh I moved from my so=
fa, sachin got out, I
should have never moved."
Next time, even if I have t=
o go to potty, I won't because Sachin would
get out!
Well Sachin isn't comi=
ng to wash your pants, whether he gets out or not.

Coming to
"Is it possib=
le for Gods to be angry for fasting ?"
Yeah think about it from god's persp=
ective.

*Assumes godly voice*
"Just because Ms Mishra completed 4 fasts an=
d they weren't good quality,
I'll take away 3 people from her family"
*Wave=
s Khadag*
*orders to minions---- get me those 3 , I'll show her, Yee Haw*

=

Think about it, if your wife's fasting can actually kill off 3 people,
Daw=
ood would hire her in a flash.
You would be a very very rich man.

Spare yo=
urself this bullshit.
Get on to spending time with god.

Tell her she can f=
ast as much as she can/likes and her fasts are not
WhatsApp messages to the=
 lord of death that offend him/her/it.

Cheers!
