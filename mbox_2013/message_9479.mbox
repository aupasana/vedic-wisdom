namo namaH,



> Sorry to hear you're feeling lost. It's a feeling that mos=
t seekers go through time and again...."dark night of the soul" as some say=
. Not an easy place to be.
=C2=A0
Please go through this longish article:
h=
ttps://sites.google.com/site/colonialconsciousness/howtospeakforindiantradi=
tions

A similar condition is expressed in the above cited article:
"Much l=
ike the medieval monk, this middle-aged person too experiences a shattering=
 of his sense of agency, but here all further similarities cease. The reaso=
n lies in how this 
shattering is further experienced and what it consists =
of. To the 
middle-aged man, this experience comes as a =E2=80=98revelation=
=E2=80=99: it is as 
though a cloak is lifted from his eyes and he is looki=
ng at the world 
for the first time. He realises that he was never an agent=
, even though 
he always thought he was one. His breakdown provides him wit=
h this 
knowledge, and he recognises it as such because of his tradition. H=
e is 
now enlightened, and if he pursues this path, he pursues the path of =

enlightenment. He sought eudaimonia, and he has found it in knowledge.5 Ev=
en though many people had repeatedly spoken of the same =E2=80=98knowledge=
=E2=80=99 
from his tradition, it did not appear to help him before his que=
st 
began. That is because this knowledge is of another type: it is an expe=
riential knowledge that involves his situation.  
In other words, this pers=
on realises that all his endeavours, projects, 
dreams, desires and frustra=
tions were never really =E2=80=98his=E2=80=99. His 
unhappiness arose not b=
ecause these projects were pursued, but because 
he thought they were =E2=
=80=98his=E2=80=99. He has still to work out many things: whose 
projects w=
ere they, if they were not =E2=80=98his=E2=80=99 projects? Why and from whe=
re 
did he have the experience of being an agent? etc. The important point =

here too is that the Indian tradition steered the middle-aged person in a =
particular way, helped him set up a loop, and generated a breakdown. 
The m=
iddle-aged man must now emerge out of it, and use his insight to 
reconstit=
ute his personality in a way that is in consonance with his 
experience."
