I would not quite agree. Any diety =
is approachable through Bhakthi yoga.

Why not propotiate Sukra and Rahu di=
rectly?
While it is a good idea to pray to Sukra and Rahu directly, we shou=
ld also keep in mind there are different ways of looking at things. If a ba=
d person is teasing you and bullying you, will you simply pray to him and a=
sk him not to trouble you? How will you please him? The bad persons seeks p=
leasure by troubling you and nothing else will please him. Say there is a p=
owerfull yet good person in the same village who can be pleased in other wa=
ys (like singing, painting, sweets etc.). Won't we consider approaching the=
 powerful person, please him/her and then seek a favor from him to control =
the bad person who is troubling us?

Praying to different deities to get ov=
er worldly pains is similar to that situations. The deities are powerful an=
d can control the extent of ill powers planets can inflict upon us.

If we =
look at it objectively, all the Gods are one and the same. However, dependi=
ng on our level of spiritual progress and karma, we seek different forms of=
 the God.

For Rahu afflictions one can seek Narasimha, Chandi, Kali, Veera=
bhadra etc. For Venus, we can look at Lakshmi, Siva (Venus is an ordent Siv=
a devotee).

I would have choosen Veera Bhadra/Kala Bhairava but Durga is a=
lso a good choice.

Best regards,
Vijay
