<br>
Recently I was staying at an old house in a=
 village. I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises=
 - =C2=A0creaking and something moving in the attic. I'm very sensitive=
 to different energies - I don't see anything, but I feel whether somet=
hing divine or rather evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#=
39;t feel good to me.<br>




<br>
I was staying there for 10 days and ever=
y night I would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I =
could see them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometime=
s I would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could d=
efinitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashli=
ght to see nothing.<br>




<br>
This doesn't seem like sleep paralysis=
 to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my body.<br>
<br>
Ca=
n it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a f=
ew more people staying at that place and everybody had severe problems with=
 sleep, so it's not just me.<br>
<br>
On the last night I chanted Sri R=
udram at that place before going to sleep and this was the only night I was=
 able to sleep properly.<br>
<br>
Upon coming back home from that place I s=
tarted waking up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short=
 beings (up to 50 cm in height, I've seen them before here though); Onc=
e the sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peac=
efully.<br>




<br>
Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kind=
s of astral beings at night? Something that I can chant before going to sle=
ep. This has been bothering me for some time now and it interferes with my =
life.<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance!<br>
