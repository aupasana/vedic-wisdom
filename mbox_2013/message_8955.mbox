Gayatri is an Intellectual Brilliance Mantra.

This mantra is capable of en=
dowing intellectual brilliance, as experienced by Aurobindo and others.

Th=
e brain becomes sharp and is exalted by the Mantra. We can call it the Wisd=
om Mantra !

Glory to Gayatri, gayantam trayathe ithi gayatri !

With warm =
regards,

Astrologer G Kumar

 It usually takes me 15 minutes to complete 28 times recital silently and w=

 108 times per japa recital must have taken!

     
    If we look at tradi=
tional texts, the sandhya time starts two ghatikas, or two nadikas before s=
unrise, i.e. 48 minutes before sunrise, and it ends with the onset of sunri=
se. So, in general, we can assume that about 48 minutes was spent in this p=
articular japa at each sitting. At a moderate pace, it is possible to compl=
ete 500 repetitions in that time.

    I am not suggesting that you speed u=
p, or change anything ... but a half a minute per repetition is very slow. =
Personally, at that speed, I would end up "singing" the mantra.

    sasneh=

        Dear Ajit,

        Thanks for the explanatio=
ns. Very interesting.

        This reminds me of an incident with a good f=
riend of mine. There is an individual I know, who had never chanted the Sav=
itur-Gayatri mantra ever. He used to feel, as per his own confession, no sp=
ecial love or attraction for this mantra and being born in a non-brahmin fa=
mily, there was no religious-cultural occasion where he was formally introd=
uced to this mantra. 

        One day while meditating on some Tantrik man=
tras, he got a random inspiration to meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had=
 a vague idea of what the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea at all of corre=
ct swara or intonation. So he started chanting, mentally and soundlessly, t=
he Savitur Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 japas of the mantra, he f=
elt/saw - and I describe it as he told me - an unbroken steam of tremendous=
, pure, flood of Golden Light above his head. Like a world above and outsid=
e our world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The eventual idea, he told m=
e, was to enter into that stream of Light above and see things from that pe=
rspective. But as long as there are impurities in the mind and body, it is =
not possible to enter into that realm easily. The gunas must be in a stable=
 equilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience of rajas is=
 conducive for it, but the stable, illuminating, self-assurance of satwa le=
ading to a deeper equanimity in mind and life is needed.

        Apparentl=
y, he also realized that there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma which serve a=
 similar purpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take a person to the spiritual=
 planes above.

        So I asked him why did you not continue the meditat=
ion or japa of Gayatri mantra, since there was a nice experience. He said i=
t would have pulled him in and he would not have been able to continue the =
spiritual practices which he was already doing for some time, and leaving s=
omething half way is not good.


        Reading the explanation your provi=
ded below, that is : 

        "We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who imp=
els (prachodayaat) our (naH) thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle e=
yesight. Without his light, we would not be able to distinguish different o=
bjects. This is explained in the Aitaterya Upanishad =93The sun, having bec=
ome eyesight, entered the eyes=94. He thus blesses all living beings."

   =
     .. matches with the description that I had heard from my friend. Quite=
 interesting!

        Namaste,

        =
Painganadu Ganapati Shastri was a well known aasthaana vidvaan of the Kanch=
i Peetham. He wrote a simple, lucid commentary on the Gayatri mantra. It st=
arts with a summary in 32 shlokas, followed by an introduction. He then giv=
es 4 explanations / meditations on the mantra -- (1) gayatri, (2) narayana,=
 (3) paramashiva and (4) paramatma.

        I am not attempting a literal =
or scholarly translation ... I=92ll try to summarize the main point, from a=
 practical point of view. I=92ll start with the first of the meditations, o=
n Gayatri.

         ----

        The first meditation is the =93common=94=
 understanding of the Gayatri mantra, with the Sun as the devata. This foll=
ows the famous verse from the Agastya Smriti -- =93yo devaH savitA  .asmAka=
m dhiyo dharmAdigocarAH. prerayet tasya yad bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe=
=94. 

        We meditate upon (dhiimahi) the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) o=
f the deva (devasya) that is the Sun (savituH). This tejas is the light of =
the sun, which is experienced by all living beings, and is thus easy to med=
itate upon.

        Whatever is experienced is easy to meditate upon, and =
that which is not experienced can be difficult to meditate upon. Everyone c=
an meditate upon the light of the Sun. This is why this meaning for the Gay=
atri mantra is always taken first. 

        vareNyam =3D whatever we can a=
sk / desire. Through all karmas and upaasanaas, whatever fruits we may ask =
for is vareNyam. =93Savitaa" is the fruit of all karmas ... this is taught =
in the Chandogya Upanishad. [ A long explanation follows, which is omitted =
here ].  We meditate upon the splendor of the sun, which is vareNyam.

    =
    We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH)=
 thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his light, =
we would not be able to distinguish different objects. This is explained in=
 the Aitaterya Upanishad =93The sun, having become eyesight, entered the ey=
es=94. He thus blesses all living beings.

        impurities in the mind and body, it=
 is not possible to enter into that 
        realm easily. The gunas must b=

        laziness of Tamas, nor the =
impatience of rajas is conducive for it, but 
        the stable, illuminat=
