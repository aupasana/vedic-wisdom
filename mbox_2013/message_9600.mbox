namaste,

> if its in my destiny to be poor for my whole life


Maybe you've been walking towards the south pole for months. Now you decide
that you want to go to the north pole. Certainly, your destiny does not
allow you to reach the north pole for months. If this saddens you and
prevents you from walking north, that *new* decision of yours may cause
your 'destiny' to prevent you from reaching the north pole for years.

Yoga Vasishtha tells us that Brahma became Brahma through self-effort.
Vishnu became Vishnu through self-effort. If one can become Brahma or
Vishnu through self-effort, than surely everything is achievable.

The key is to stop looking at things from the perspective of a single
lifetime.

sasneham,

    ajit

hi guys....I would really like your input on something I,ve be=

<br>
its about karma,destiny and mantras....the issue goes like this....if=

<br>
which is it??according to ou=

<br>
because if I did s=

<br>
it doesn=
