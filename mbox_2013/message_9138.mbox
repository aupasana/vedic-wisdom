Extracts from - Autobiography of a Yogi


"Kriya Yoga is an instrument thro=
ugh which human evolution can be quickened," Sri Yukteswar explained to his=
 students. "The ancient yogis discovered that the secret of cosmic consciou=
sness is intimately linked with breath mastery. This is India's unique and =
deathless contribution to the world's treasury of knowledge. 

The life for=
ce, which is ordinarily absorbed in maintaining the heart-pump, must be fre=
ed for higher activities by a method of calming and stilling the ceaseless =
demands of the breath." The Kriya Yogi mentally directs his life energy to =
revolve, upward and downward, around the six spinal centers (medullary, cer=
vical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses) which correspond to =
the twelve astral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man. One-half mi=
nute of revolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effect=
s subtle progress in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one ye=
ar of natural spiritual unfoldment.
 
The astral system of a human being, w=
ith six (twelve by polarity) inner constellations revolving around the sun =
of the omniscient spiritual eye, is interrelated with the physical sun and =
the twelve zodiacal signs. All men are thus affected by an inner and an out=
er universe. The ancient rishis discovered that man's earthly and heavenly =
environment, in twelve-year cycles, push him forward on his natural path. T=
he scriptures aver that man requires a million years of normal, diseaseless=
 evolution to perfect his human brain sufficiently to express cosmic consci=
ousness. 

One thousand Kriya practiced in eight hours gives the yogi, in o=
ne day, the equivalent of one thousand years of natural evolution: 365,000 =
years of evolution in one year. In three years, a Kriya Yogi can thus accom=
plish by intelligent self-effort the same result which nature brings to pas=
s in a million years. The Kriya short cut, of course, can be taken only by =
deeply developed yogis. With the guidance of a guru, such yogis have carefu=
lly prepared their bodies and brains to receive the power created by intens=
ive practice.
 
The Kriya beginner employs his yogic exercise only fourteen=
 to twenty-eight times, twice daily. A number of yogis achieve emancipation=
 in six or twelve or twenty-four or forty-eight years. A yogi who dies befo=
re achieving full realization carries with him the good karma of his past K=
riya effort; in his new life he is harmoniously propelled toward his Infini=
te Goal. 

The body of the average man is like a fifty-watt lamp, which can=
not accommodate the billion watts of power roused by an excessive practice =
of Kriya. Through gradual and regular increase of the simple and "foolproof=
" methods of Kriya, man's body becomes astrally transformed day by day, and=
 is finally fitted to express the infinite potentials of cosmic energy=97th=
e first materially active expression of Spirit. 

Kriya Yoga has nothing in=
 common with the unscientific breathing exercises taught by a number of mis=
guided zealots. Their attempts to forcibly hold breath in the lungs is not =
only unnatural but decidedly unpleasant. Kriya, on the other hand, is accom=
panied from the very beginning by an accession of peace, and by soothing se=
nsations of regenerative effect in the spine. The ancient yogic technique c=
onverts the breath into mind. By spiritual advancement, one is able to cogn=
ize the breath as an act of mind=97a dream-breath. 

Many illustrations cou=
ld be given of the mathematical relationship between man's respiratory rate=
 and the variations in his states of consciousness. A person whose attentio=
n is wholly engrossed, as in following some closely knit intellectual argum=
ent, or in attempting some delicate or difficult physical feat, automatical=
ly breathes very slowly. Fixity of attention depends on slow breathing; qui=
ck or uneven breaths are an inevitable accompaniment of harmful emotional s=
tates: fear, lust, anger. 

The restless monkey breathes at the rate of 32 =
times a minute, in contrast to man's average of 18 times. The elephant, tor=
toise, snake and other animals noted for their longevity have a respiratory=
 rate which is less than man's. The tortoise, for instance, who may attain =
the age of 300 years,* breathes only 4 times per minute.
