In Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going.

1 - Bhuta =
Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compo=
se the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into mor=
e detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lus=
t, greed etc etc.

2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, o=
ne has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of=
 a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey=
.

3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it real=
ly does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and=
 entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are u=
seless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own =
ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss=
-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more vital.

4=
 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalin=
i Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are becaus=
e of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and =
insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes tha=
t the aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influenc=
es and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to=
 various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. Th=
at can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have =
chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and vari=
ous possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. M=
oreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the =
right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, ar=
e often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.
 Sometimes it wi=
ll have results, sometimes not.

For all these to be achieved, the starting=
 point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say -=
 Mens sana in corpore sano.

=C2=A0 
Dear all,=


Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent exper=
ience of a patient of mine.

I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and ha=
ve been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had a sp=
ontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved o=
ut-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indi=
an origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and s=
he searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything phys=
ically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due t=
o deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves =
as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- =
this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream psyc=
hiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western med=
icine, and as we have no treatments for deranged kundalini, we struggle to =
help them.

Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience w=
ith this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wa=
kened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from=
 the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is so=
mething she cannot escape from.

I wondered what solution there could be to=
 her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifes=
ts as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure=
 her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good sa=
maritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not k=
now of)- their suffering really is pitiable. 

And let us be careful in our=
 sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is w=
hy the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be y=
our instrument" and leave the kundalini rising bit to God's will.

Om Dum D=
urgayai Namaha

Aparna
