Sir,
Thanks for your kind reply. I believe Apsaras are Devata Sthrees or ce=
lestial maidens, and if we do Apsara Sadhana, we can make them our companio=
ns. All this info is what I have found in certain blogs related to Apsara S=
adhana. I really don't know if all this is true, but I'm chanting this mant=
ra with all faith and devotion to Apsaras. If you have any deeper understan=
ding of this, plz enlighten me with the same.
