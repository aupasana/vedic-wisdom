Sorry to hear you're feeling lost. It's a feeling that most seekers go thro=
ugh time and again...."dark night of the soul" as some say. Not an easy pla=
ce to be.

Key thing is to keep going. 

Trying many paths to find one is g=
reat. But ultimately you need to find and then stick with one practice. As =
the saying goes, if you want water from the ground, you have to dig deeply =
in one place. No point digging a little here and a little there....Got to p=
ersevere at the same place. Perseverance is key on the path.

All the best =
to you. I pray God (or whatever you like to call it) helps you find your wa=
y...

Aparna
