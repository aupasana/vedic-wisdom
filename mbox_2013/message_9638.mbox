I had problem with excessive smoke during homam. In order to avoid it, I
us=
ed excessive Ghee with Cow dung slabs.

I have a small havan kund in which =
I perform scaled down havan daily.

When fire extinguishes, there is excess=
ive smoke. So you should make sure
all the materials are burned down comple=
tely. And this can be done by
putting excessive Ghee which keeps fire for l=
ong time.

Durgesh O Mishra

Since I was doing homam in room , although d=

If I put too less wood , I f=
