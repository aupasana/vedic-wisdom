Dear=C2=A0Jamnadas Ji,

These are shabar mantras,=C2=A0they are highly powe=
rful mantras and bring the results very soon. It is believed that these man=
tras are basically written by Guru Gorakhnath ji.=C2=A0A shabar mantra is q=
uite different from a classical or Vedic mantra. One needs to attain siddhi=
 to use a Vedic mantra but it is nothing like this in case of a shabar mant=
ra. Shabar mantras are auto-energized and can be used even by a common man =
easily to bring his wishes true. The mantra which i mentioned earlier do ha=
ve samput of Beej akshra which can push the evil energy and force it to lea=
ve the body of the affected person.

I have personally used some of them fo=
r healing purpose, they brought me instant results!

Have faith and convey =
the family to perform this ritual.

Thanks & regards,
Saurabh kaushik

Namaste All,
I =

The situation is very bad and the family is virtually broke=

Thanks,

<br>
> ><br>
> >Recently I was staying at an old house in a vil=
lage. I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises -  =
creaking and something moving in the attic. I'm very sensitive to different=
 energies - I don't see anything, but I feel whether something divine or ra=
ther evil is present in a certain place. That place didn't feel good to me.=
<br>
> ><br>
> >I was staying there for 10 days and every night=
 I would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could s=
ee them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I wou=
ld wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definite=
ly hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to =
see nothing.<br>
> ><br>
> >This doesn't seem like sleep paraly=
sis to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my body.<br>
>=
 ><br>
> >Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my =
sleep? There were a few more people staying at that place and everybody had=
 severe problems with sleep, so it's not just me.<br>
> ><br>
> &g=
t;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before going to slee=
p and this was the only night I was able to sleep properly.<br>
> ><b=
r>
> >Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at ho=
me, feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm i=
n height, I've seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of th=
e strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.<br>
> ><br>
=
> >Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral =
beings at night? Something that I can chant before going to sleep. This has=
 been bothering me for some time now and it interferes with my life.<br>
