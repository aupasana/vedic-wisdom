You were on your way home when you died.
It was a car accident. Nothing pa=
rticularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and tw=
o children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you,=
 but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, t=
rust me.

And that's when you met me.
"What=85 what happened?" You asked. "=
Where am I?"
"You died," I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing word=
s.
"There was a=85 a truck and it was skidding=85"
"Yup," I said.
"I=85 I d=
ied?"
"Yup. But don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies," I said.
You looked=
 around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. "What is this place?" You =
asked. "Is this the afterlife?"
"More or less," I said.
"Are you god?" You =
asked.
"Yup," I replied. "I'm God."
"My kids=85 my wife," you said.
"What a=
bout them?"
"Will they be all right?"
"That's what I like to see," I said. =
"You just died and your main concern is for your family. That's good stuff =
right there."

You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn't look lik=
e God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authori=
ty figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.
"Don'=
t worry," I said. "They'll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect =
in every way. They didn't have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife wil=
l cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marri=
age was falling apart. If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for=
 feeling relieved."
"Oh," you said. "So what happens now? Do I go to heaven=
 or hell or something?"
"Neither," I said. "You'll be reincarnated."
"Ah," =
you said. "So the Hindus were right,"
"All religions are right in their own=
 way," I said. "Walk with me."

You followed along as we strode through the=
 void. "Where are we going?"
"Nowhere in particular," I said. "It's just ni=
ce to walk while we talk."
"So what's the point, then?" You asked. "When I =
get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experience=
s and everything I did in this life won't matter."
"Not so!" I said. "You h=
ave within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. Yo=
u just don't remember them right now."
I stopped walking and took you by th=
e shoulders. "Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than y=
ou can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of w=
hat you are. It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if i=
t's hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when =
you bring it back out, you've gained all the experiences it had.
"You've be=
en in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven't stretched out yet and f=
elt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long en=
ough, you'd start remembering everything. But there's no point to doing tha=
t between each life."
"How many times have I been reincarnated, then?"
"Oh =
lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives." I said. "This time =
around, you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD."
"Wait, what?" You stam=
mered. "You're sending me back in time?"
"Well, I guess technically. Time, =
as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I =
come from."
"Where you come from?" You said.
"Oh sure," I explained "I come=
 from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you'l=
l want to know what it's like there, but honestly you wouldn't understand."=

"Oh," you said, a little let down. "But wait. If I get reincarnated to oth=
er places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point."
"Sur=
e. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifesp=
an you don't even know it's happening."
"So what's the point of it all?"
"S=
eriously?" I asked. "Seriously? You're asking me for the meaning of life? I=
sn't that a little stereotypical?"
"Well it's a reasonable question," you p=
ersisted.

I looked you in the eye. "The meaning of life, the reason I made=
 this whole universe, is for you to mature."
"You mean mankind? You want us=
 to mature?"
"No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each n=
ew life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect."
"Ju=
st me? What about everyone else?"
"There is no one else," I said. "In this =
universe, there's just you and me."
You stared blankly at me. "But all the =
people on earth=85"
"All you. Different incarnations of you."
"Wait. I'm ev=
eryone!?"
"Now you're getting it," I said, with a congratulatory slap on th=
e back.
"I'm every human being who ever lived?"
"Or who will ever live, yes=
."
"I'm Abraham Lincoln?"
"And you're John Wilkes Booth, too," I added.
"I'=
m Hitler?" You said, appalled.
"And you're the millions he killed."
"I'm Je=
sus?"
"And you're everyone who followed him."
You fell silent.

"Every time=
 you victimized someone," I said, "you were victimizing yourself. Every act=
 of kindness you've done, you've done to yourself. Every happy and sad mome=
nt ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you."
You =
thought for a long time.
"Why?" You asked me. "Why do all this?"
"Because s=
omeday, you will become like me. Because that's what you are. You're one of=
 my kind. You're my child."
"Whoa," you said, incredulous. "You mean I'm a =
god?"
"No. Not yet. You're a fetus. You're still growing. Once you've lived=
 every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be bor=
n."
"So the whole universe," you said, "it's just=85"
"An egg." I answered.=
 "Now it's time for you to move on to your next life."
And I sent you on yo=
ur way.
