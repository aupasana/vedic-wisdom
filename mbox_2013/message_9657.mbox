Namaste friends,
=A0
I am cc'ing this to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup because of=
 the spiritual content.
=A0
I agree with Vishnu ji's comment on a specific =
point in Maja ji's nice write-up:
=A0
> > *Also, one is supposed to choose =
only one ayana for one lifetime and
> > master it to as perfect as possible=
. *
> 
>=A0 I am not entirely sure if the above statement is correct. It is=
 very much
> possible and in fact is a measure of self realized people.
=A0=

Indeed, one can carve one's own niche by combining multiple paths. They ar=
e not meant to be mutually exclusive.
=A0
I'll quote Swami Vivekananda from=
 his book "Raja Yoga" where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:
=A0
"Each so=
ul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by c=
ontrolling nature: external and internal. Do this either by work or worship=
 or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and=
 be free."
=A0
Here are my 2 cents.
=A0
Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophi=
zation and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga =
emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devo=
tion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and =
try to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control=
 and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these q=
ualities develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Fin=
ally, a realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these=
 qualities fully blossomed.
=A0
Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, =
nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja y=
oga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised against it. Controlling b=
ody and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requir=
es strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, wat=
er and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga c=
an be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly =
taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO=
). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught=
 it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.
=A0
Jnan=
a yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the del=
usional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/sm=
art enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman.=
 Whatever I do, it's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion anyway" wi=
thout fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in c=
onsciousness every instant. Kind of like declaring wisely in a movie that "=
it's just a movie and not reality", but flinching in every scary scene, cry=
ing in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earnest=
ness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant contemplat=
ion and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the en=
d.
=A0
IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are th=
e most suitable and safest.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
