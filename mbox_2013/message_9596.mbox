Negativity is the prime killer in any mission. Mantras helps remove this
ne=
gativity, mental biases and fills your mind with lot of positive energy.
Fo=
r example, If you are running a partnership firm of 4 people and you get
so=
me project which is very difficult in nature. The three partners are
opposi=
ng to take up this work. But you are filled with positive energy that
it ca=
n be done. Mantras help you fetch that positive energy from Divine.

There =
is no substitute to hard work. Mantras, Tantras, Devotion everything
is jus=
t make you do the right things. To get the results in this world of
Maya, y=
ou have to do it.

When the hard work fructifies, it results in materialist=
ic results.
Materialistic results like big house, luxury cars and millions =
in bank
accounts creates greed. This greed may drive one towards wrong mean=
s.
Again, here Mantras comes to save the person of ill-doings. Pure devotio=
n
leads you towards righteousness.

Now the main question of 'Can the desti=
ny be altered?"

Astrology tells you "The environment you are going to face=
 at certain point
of time. ", "It also tells you about your reactions to th=
e environment".
You still have the free will to do whatever you want.

If t=
here are bad Yogas like being poor for life in your chart then it not
only =
means that you will remain poor but also it means you will lack the
energy =
to overcome this poverty. Basically the 'lack of energy' is
important here.=
 It may mean, even if you take up any work, you may loose
energy after some=
 time so that it is not finished and never fructifies.

Even if there is si=
ngle well placed planet in your chart, it can bring you
success after Mantr=
a chanting and diligent work.

      <div>hi guys....I would really like your input on somet=
hing I,ve been thinking about and talking with some fellow seekers for a wh=
ile now.<br>
<br>
its about karma,destiny and mantras....the issue goes lik=
e this....if its in my destiny to be poor for my whole life........and I co=
me across and do a sadhana for swarnakarshana bbhairava..and if it works..i=
 would get rich right?..assuming such sadhanas work of course...which is an=
other issue.<br>

<br>
now the issue is did I cheat fate?...as some people =
would claim is possible through tantra and mantra sadhanas?<br>
<br>
or som=
e others would say that it already was in my destiny to get rich....just th=
at it had to happen through a certain sadhana.??<br>
<br>
which is it??acco=
rding to our shastras??..what is the truth of this matter?<br>
<br>
because=
 if I did swarnkarshana,sati,kamadeva,and what not sadhanas...I can basical=
ly be rich,blessed with the most wonderfull beautiful wife,be perfectly hea=
lthy,wealthy,and all round success ,happiness and perfection......<br>

<br=
>
it doesn't make sense at all...because if that was the case....india =
would be paradise by now.....<br>
<br>
so whats your take on this issue of =
using mantras..and tantric sadhanas?....<br>
<br>
to what extant does it wo=
rk?if it works at all?...and how?....and what about destiny?...and how much=
 can we truly alter it??if at all??<br>
<br>
I tried a karna yakshini sadha=
na once...just as an experiment to see if works...and nothing happened apar=
t from hurting myself physicaly by sitting in japa for 6 hours from 12 to 6=
 am for 21 days...but later I found out the so called guru who taught me wa=
s an absolute fake...so I cant say if the sadhana truly works or not.....<b=
r>

<br>
in order to prevent further mishaps like this for myself and other=
s....would those with experience in these things kindly share your wisdom..=
...<br>
<br>
tnks...<br>
