>>>Namaste friends, =C2=A0=
 Bhakti yoga or the path of surrender and devotion is indeed more suitable =
in this age. I did not mean to say otherwise. =C2=A0 But just having an ish=
ta devata is not enough to be "protected" from deep and troublesome instabi=
lities when one's body-mind complex goes through a big transformation. Not =
every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all,=
 out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for "psychological disorder", t=
he second lady "did much sadhana of Srirama". Even those who think of a dei=
ty and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, mental and spiritual=
 disorders, wrong (colored by one's conditioning and desires!) interpretati=
on of internal/external experiences and even madness. =C2=A0 True surrender=
/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but cultivating it i=
s as difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true surr=
ender and detachment are almost the same. =C2=A0 This is
 why I said that *=
lightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One with dense cond=
itioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god are ready t=
o help. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Now, the question is: How do we reduce=
 our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking=
 of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be=
 augmented by regular introspection and self-improvement. =C2=A0 Taking min=
d away from its current pre-occupations (e.g. "I am smart", "I am doing goo=
d sadhana", "I am mad at X", "I did not get what I deserve in Y", "I am bet=
ter than X", "I must have Y at any cost" etc etc) is key to eventually over=
coming conditioning, for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning=
! =C2=A0 To reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/v=
isualization may work better for some people. =C2=A0 One approach is to con=
template god whenever possible, in the middle of
 any activity. You can ima=
gine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle=
/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinati=
ng for the mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects ar=
ound that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever m=
ind is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can=
 try to contemplate god instead. =C2=A0 Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says i=
n the movie "Life of Pi" about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can't be=
 transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits! =C2=
=A0 Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks "the omnipre=
sent God is enjoying this thru this instrument" and starts contemplating th=
e qualities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sense ob=
jects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Wheneve=
r one is angry at someone for what they did, if
 one thinks "the omnipresen=
t God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument" and starts=
 contemplating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone,=
 one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on. =
=C2=A0 In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. =
Every now and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than=
 about god ("*I* am doing this nice bhajan", "*I* am doing this nice homam"=
, "I think *I* am making progress through this"). With effort and persevera=
nce, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the supr=
eme power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long time to train a wild =
animal, it takes a long time to train mind! =C2=A0 Try to develop devotion =
and surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/p=
rinciple of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate t=
hat concept as frequently as possible, especially
 when meditating. When mi=
nd veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don't spend too much =
time dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into co=
ntemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself. =C2=
=A0 The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it ab=
out themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try =
to break free from it. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Finally, one can try to=
 overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions that ben=
efit a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from truly loving g=
od is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* n=
otion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way to overco=
me that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people around us are=
 as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love =
them and give them unconditionally,
 how can we ever hope to transcend the =
limited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God? =C2=A0

 one does not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient effor=

>>>>>=C2=A0
>>>>>As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too =
many specific desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desire=
s (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising fr=
om YOUR OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want =
LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one m=
ay pray for great wealth one's whole life and be born as a rich but very si=
ck man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for =
health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any k=
nowledge or money. In another case, one may deeply desire to act in a famou=

 not really enjoy that experience. Basically, people keep going in circles =

our weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emph=
asize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people aro=
und you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative =
attachment. =C2=A0
>>>>>Don't worry about whether your Kundalini rises or n=
ot. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripu=
s) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or not. If your ability to resist them is =
increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep,=
 you are still making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalin=
i (your self-awareness) will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her L=
ord (true Self).

>>>>>One word on s=
urrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most peo=
ple do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may be =
offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.
>>>>>=C2=A0
>>>>>"I =
want X, I will pray to you and please give it to me", "I am scared of Kunda=
lini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me" - all this is just a b=
usiness deal. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surr=
ender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surr=
ender is losing oneself in one's fascination for the qualities of Lord. Tru=
e surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one's way (whether it is plea=
surable or highly painful) as Lord's prasad and accepting it gratefully. Tr=
ue surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the=
 face of (and during) Death.
>>>>>=C2=A0
>>>>>If one without true surrender=
 and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one =
may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that go=
d does not want to "protect" one as said below. It is not about protecting =
or endangering. If you go back to my "chipmunk glued to mouse trap" example=
 above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one's con=
ditioning makes one *run away* from God's protection! God's protection may =
seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!=

of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all=
 this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have a=
nd keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only d=
etachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislike=
s etc) can protect one as one's Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy co=
nditioning and impurities in one's nadis will distract rising Kundalini (se=
lf-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.

>In Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta =
Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compo=

t, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, on=
e has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of =
a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey.=
 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really=
 does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and e=

less, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own en=

 While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini =

of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and in=

the aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences=
 and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to v=

 can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have ch=

my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at p=

e has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This =
has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She =
is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms=
 started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find=
 anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that=
 this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill descri=
be themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundali=

ainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood =
by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged
 kundalini, =
we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. M=

be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the =
suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her=

 we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be car=

 Bhakti yoga or the path of surrender and devotion is indeed more suitable =
in this age. I did not mean to say otherwise.   But just having an ish=
ta devata is not enough to be "protected" from deep and troublesome instabi=
lities when one's body-mind complex goes through a big transformation. Not =
every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After all,=
 out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for "psychological disorder", t=
he second lady "did much sadhana of Srirama". Even those who think of a dei=
ty and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, mental and spiritual=
 disorders, wrong (colored by one's conditioning and desires!) interpretati=
on of internal/external experiences and even madness.   True surrender=
/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but cultivating it i=
s as
 difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true sur=
render and detachment are almost the same.   This is why I said that *=
lightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One with dense cond=
itioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god are ready t=
o help.   *        *  &nb=
sp;     *   Now, the question is: How do we reduce=
 our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Thinking=
 of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to be=
 augmented by regular introspection and self-improvement.   Taking min=
d away from its current pre-occupations (e.g. "I am smart", "I am doing goo=
d sadhana", "I am mad at X", "I did not get what I deserve in Y", "I am bet=
ter than X", "I must have Y at any cost" etc etc) is key to eventually over=
coming conditioning, for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the
 conditionin=
g!   To reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different imagery/=
visualization may work better for some people.   One approach is to co=
ntemplate god whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can ima=
gine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a principle=
/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascinati=
ng for the mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects ar=
ound that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever m=
ind is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one can=
 try to contemplate god instead.   Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says i=
n the movie "Life of Pi" about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can't be=
 transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits! &nb=
sp; Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one thinks "the omnipre=
sent God is enjoying this thru this instrument" and
 starts contemplating t=
he qualities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sense o=
bjects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whenev=
er one is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks "the omnipresen=
t God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument" and starts=
 contemplating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someone,=
 one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on. &n=
bsp; In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego. Ev=
ery now and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather than a=
bout god ("*I* am doing this nice bhajan", "*I* am doing this nice homam", =
"I think *I* am making progress through this"). With effort and perseveranc=
e, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the suprem=
e power that runs the show. Just as it takes a long time to train a wild an=
imal, it takes a long time to train mind!
   Try to develop devotion a=
nd surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept/pr=
inciple of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate th=
at concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When mind=
 veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don't spend too much ti=
me dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into cont=
emplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself.   =
The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it about =
themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try to b=
reak free from it.   *        *&nbs=
p;       *   Finally, one can try to ove=
rcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions that benefit=
 a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from truly loving god i=
s our deep and sub-conscious love

on of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way to overcome =
that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people around us are as=
 much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love the=
