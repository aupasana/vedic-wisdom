Sri Rama Tirtha

"Can a householder, a man living with his wife and childre=
n, or with his relatives or friends,=97in other words, can an ordinary man =
of the world ever realize Truth or the true Self? This is the question.

We=
 shall take up one aspect of the question, Vedanta simply asks, "Can a swor=
d kill your enemies?"

If this question may be answered in the affirmative,=
 then the question "as to whether a worldly householder can realize Truth p=
erfectly," can also be answered in the affirmative; it all depends upon the=
 use we make of the sword or of the family ties. We can make the same sword=
 kill or protect us from outside attacks: so a man by the misuse of family =
ties or family relations can kill himself, or retard his spiritual growth, =
or by the right use of the family relations he can elevate himself, and rea=
lize God within him. Thus the question is similarly answered.".............=


........"There was a very good man who kept a very naughty and wicked ser=
vant. He used to do everything in a wrong way; he used to carry out the com=
mands of his master in a curious way; in fact his way of doing things was s=
uch as to upset even the most serious man. This faithful master was never a=
nnoyed, but always treated the servant in a most charming manner. At one ti=
me one of the guests remonstrated against the servant; he was very much ann=
oyed and displeased with his actions and asked the master to dismiss him. T=
he master said, "Your advice is very good, and it is given with the best in=
tention; I know that you wish me well; I know that you want my work and bus=
iness to prosper, and it is on that account that you give me this advice; b=
ut I know better, I know that my work is being spoiled, I know that my busi=
ness suffers. But I keep this servant on the very ground or from the very f=
act of his being so unfaithful; it is his bad conduct and his wicked habits=
 which make him so dear to me. I love him the more because he is a sinner, =
a wicked and unfaithful servant". This was a very strange way of speaking.
=

The master said, "This servant is the only person in the world or with who=
m I come in contact, that disobeys me; he is the only person who does thing=
s which are uncomplimentary, derogatory or detrimental to me. All others wi=
th whom I come in contact are so gentle, so pleasant, so loving that they d=
are not offend me, and so this man is out of the ordinary; he is a kind of =
dumbbells, a kind of special training to my spiritual Self. Just as many pe=
ople use dumb-bells, pulleys, or heavy weights to exercise the muscles in o=
rder to develop their physical strength, so this servant serves as a kind o=
f weight or dumb-bells by which my spiritual body is strengthened. Through =
this servant I get strength. I am compelled to do a kind of wrestling with =
this servant, which brings strength".......

.........."The earth revolves =
round the sun. The earth must revolve. The moon wants to cling: to the eart=
h. What is the earth to do? The earth can take up the moon and satellites, =
and together with them the earth can revolve round the sun. 

So, O man or =
woman, if you have set up the task of being drawn towards the Sun of suns, =
take your companion with you, as the earth does the moon, and with your com=
panion, like the moon, go on revolving round the Sun of suns, the Light of =
lights. Thus instead of making this one little body partake of the glory, l=
ight and lustre of the Sun, you can make your companion share with you the =
glory and light and lustre of the same Sun. Thus instead of drawing but one=
 soul, you can draw other souls. Instead of working through just one body, =
you can work through many bodies. They are all yours. All those bodies (as =
one body belongs to you) can belong to God, can glorify God. When a man goe=
s to a place and takes only one body with him, but he does not leave the he=
ad, the hands, the nose, the eyes, the ears, &c. behind; they all go. Simil=
arly, Vedanta tells you that when you approach the knowledge of heaven, whe=
n you realize the Truth, instead of carrying one-half of you to the knowled=
ge of heaven, you can take all; you can take the wife and children, you can=
 take along your head, your heart, your hands, as it were.".......

An old =
lady came to a saint in India and asked if it was advisable for her to leav=
e her house and her family, and to retire to Brindaban (in India), where Kr=
ishna was born. Was it advisaable for her to break her family ties, and sev=
er all her relations with each and all, and retire to that lovely city, Bri=
ndaban, the Jerusalem of India?

This lady had her grandson with her. The s=
age replied, "See please, mark please, what is it that looks into your eyes=
 through the eyes of your grandson? What force, what energy, what I divinit=
y is it that looks at you from every pore of the body of this child?"The la=
dy said, "It must be God. In this dear little baby there is no thought of t=
emptation or wickedness. This dear little baby is innocent and pure. When h=
e cries, in his wailing is the voice of God and nothing else."Again the sag=
e said, "When you go to Brindaban, you shall have to cling to the one image=
 of Krishna. There in the Jerusalem of India, and there in that image of Di=
vinity, you must worship the Divinity. Is not the body of the child just as=
 good an image of Krishna as the image you shall have to see in that Jerusa=
lem of India.?"The lady was surprised a little; and after thinking and refl=
ecting, she came to the conclusion that she might just as well worship Kris=
hna through the body of this child, by regarding this child as the incarnat=
ion of Krishna. For God it is that looks through the eyes of the child; God=
 it is that gives the child its power; God it is that works through the ear=
s of the child; God it is that makes the child's hair grow; God it is that =
works through every pore of his body; it is Divinity.

According to the dir=
ection of the saint, she must no longer regard the child as her grandson, o=
r look upon him as related to her in any way, but must regard him as God, a=
nd thus break all family and worldly ties. The only tie should be the tie o=
f Godliness or Godhead. This is the way to Renunciation.

Renunciation does=
 not mean asceticism. Renunciation means making everything holy. Renouncing=
 the child does not mean giving up all connection with the child but thinki=
ng the child, the grandson, to be God. Realizing the Divinity in each and a=
ll: this is Renunciation according to Vedanta. Vedanta asks you to give up =
your wife or your husband and other relations. Vedanta says, a Give up the =
wife as related to you, give up the wife as the wife, but realize the true =
Self, the Divinity within her. Give up the enemy as the enemy, see only the=
 God in the enemy; give up the friend as a friend, but realize the Godlines=
s or Godhead in the friend."
