Namaste. Probably you meant symbolism than imagination :-)

ia-a344118

Actually it has to be both, symbolism and real. Anyways, I too =
do not agree with most of the symbolic make-outs as they seem to be made up=
 to justify something. 
Madhu-kaitabha, yes, is both symbolic and real.

When it comes to subtle meanings, use your discretion. I have seen some rea=
lly sublime ones and nonsensical ones (as judged by my own conditioned inte=
lligence). Use your discretion in accepting/rejecting something.

 (3) For why higher wisdom is expressed by rishis in stories/imageries with=
 layered meanings, please read a nice exposition by Sri Aurobindo at the be=
ginning of "Secret of Veda".
