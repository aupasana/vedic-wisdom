Good Morning!

Cr=
ystal Meditation and the Full Snow Moon

Embracing the energies of the moon=
 can be a great tool when you are doing any kind of empowerment work. The m=
oon has a powerful relationship to our lives. The moon's influence can be s=
een by its connection to the Earth's tides. There is a connection to the mo=
on and the intuitive aspect of one's nature. The phases of the moon relate =
to seasons, color, menstrual cycles, life cycles and along with
the sun, th=
e moon's energy is a higher conductor and amplifier of our moods and emotio=
ns.

The Full Snow Moon - February - Since the heaviest snow usually falls =
during this month, native tribes of the north and east most often called Fe=
bruary's Storm Moon or Full Snow Moon. Some tribes also referred to this Mo=
on as the Full Hunger Moon, since harsh weather conditions in their areas m=
ade hunting very difficult. Also known to the Celts as the Moon of Ice and =
the Chinese as the Budding Moon. February 1 is the Imbolc, or fire festival=
 celebrating mid point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. =
A day also dedicated to the Celtic goddess, Brigid. Imbolic means "in the b=
elly" and is a time honoring creativity, fertility and receptive, feminine =
energy. Candles are often tools used to celebrate this Celtic holiday. It i=
s also a time we celebrate love! 

The reflective light of the full moon gi=
ves a wonderful and magical sense of harmony and peacefulness. Meditating i=
n its light gives an etheric and positively enchanting feeling of oneness a=
nd unity with nature and sky. 

Meditating With A Crystal

When you sitin y=
our meditation pose,cross your legs and place your hands on your knees. You=
 can sit with your palms open and place a crystal in both of them.

Conside=
r these stones:

Moonstone:

Honors the Goddess in all women, Dieting, Gard=
ening, Psychic
Awareness, Meditation. Soothes stress, anxiety, women's horm=
ones/menstrual imbalance, lymph. Enhances intuitive sensitivity via feeling=
s and less overwhelmed by personal feelings. Greater flexibility and flow w=
ith life. Connects 2nd and 6th Chakra and Pineal for emotional balance, gra=
cefulness. Helps all be more comfortable with our gentler feminine/yin rece=
iving side. Especially for water signs. Used for protection against the per=
ils of travel.
Known to be of ancient spiritual significance in their conne=
ction to the moon and the intuitive aspect of one's nature. Helps cool, soo=
the, and calm over-reactions to emotional and personal situations. Makes on=
e conscious of the fact that all things are part of a cycle of constant cha=
nge. They open us up to the feminine and are associated with sensitivity, i=
ntuition, and clairvoyance. Beneficial for those involved in agriculture. 
=

Snowflake Obsidian: 

This obsidian stone, which has inclusions of phynocr=
yst, gives it the snowflake pattern on it's surface, and allows us to recog=
nize unnecessary patterns in our lives. Promotes self-esteem and confidence=
. Clairaudience and owning our lower aspects for growth; Healthy balance. A=
llows us to be more sensitive and aware of the beauty and love that is arou=
nd us. 

Selenite: 

This is the mineral gypsum. Its white/clear striated c=
rystaline body is a sheer source of calming, spiritual light. It works with=
 the higher spiritual Chakra in accessing our higer consciousness, spirit g=
uides and the angelic realm. Beacuse of its striations, like tourmaline, it=
 works along the spinal column grounding and anchoring our Earth vibration =
and utilizing kundalini to rise freely up our light body stimulating each c=
enter as it vibrates. This stone is highly recommended for meditation and w=
orking on the sacred spiritual in your life. Through meditation with seleni=
te, growth and mental focus is attainable. People find selenite to be a luc=
k stone. Considered a centuries-old recordkeeper of events/information, its=
 information is gained through telepathic means. 

Pearl:

In tune with emo=
tions, water, and women, especially pregnant women, pearls are a symbol of =
pure heart and mind; innocence and faith. Because it is from the sea, it ha=
s watery and lunar elements, therefore it is used for balancing emotions, e=
specially for water signs. Absorbing by nature, this mineral absorbs though=
ts and emotions and because of this, must be used with caution. If you feel=
 excessively negative while wearing a pearl, it will hold that energy until=
 it is cleansed. Remember, Pearl is the result of layer upon
layer of subst=
ance produced to combat irritation. Pearl can cool and soothe. It is very n=
urturing. 

Snow River Quartz, Seer Quartz or Gazing Quartz:

These stones =
have been used for seeing into the future and discovering our congenital pa=
st. These clear quartz balls are amazing in their clarity on the inside and=
 covered with a beautiful white frost on the outside. The ends are sliced o=
ff so that you can see into it's deep translucent center. These "picture wi=
ndow" crystals are originally from the riverbeds of Brazil. The crystals ar=
e washed down out of the mountains and tumbled over and over by violent sur=
ging waters. This natural process gives the crystals their frosted look. Th=
ey are the "gazing" stone. Also found in quartz points, even though each cr=
ystal has the basic six-sided crystal shape and may be terminated, there is=
 an additional flat plane or window, usually diamond-shaped, that gives a v=
iew of the inner chamber of the crystal point. It teaches the importance of=
 looking within ourselves, even if the view into our own soul is clouded an=
d imperfect. 

Meditation

Slowly take three deep breaths. With each one co=
nsciously release the mental, emotional and physical tensions. Visualize ou=
r radiant light reaching out and connecting with every other focus under th=
e light of the full moon. Know that we are connected with individuals and g=
roups everywhere throughout the world who are contemplating on the unity of=
 all life and who are working, each in their own way, for the expansion of =
love and awareness on our planet. Visualize our radiant light reaching out =
even further as we realize that we are also connected to the great fellowsh=
ip of enlightened teachers who have been with us through the ages guiding u=
s to awaken and live by the law of love. 

Sit quietly with your mind recep=
tive, and open to receive spiritual energies. Do all that you can to feel t=
he light of the full moon upon you. Feel how your crystals vibrate in your =
hands.

Make mental notations on thoughts or ideas that come to you. These =
can appear as knowledge, wisdom, understanding, or inspiration. Even if you=
 think nothing happened, you may find that in a few days new ideas will app=
ear to you. Assume that some kind of impression has been received in your h=
igher mind and it is circling overhead waiting for a place to land. 

Devel=
op the ability to listen within as you go about your expansive meditation. =
This is a similar process as remembering an important dream. The frequencie=
s of dream realities are different than the rational concrete mind. This tr=
ansference process requires stillness and patience, along with an optimisti=
c attitude. Once your conscious brain can align with the higher mind and so=
ul the stream of light can reach you as words and picture symbols. Feel the=
 light bathe your physical body as you allow it to penetrate deeper inside,=
 reaching 
In this meditation you can become part of the Universal Flow tha=
t brings Peace, Compassion, Love, Humility, and Gratitude into our human co=
nsciousness. As you become more spiritually grounded, you can become more o=
f your true self. The blessings of the Earth surround you. The magnificent =
energy of Life unfolds all around you. You are a part of this. Strive to br=
ing honor to your place in this Miracle of Light in all that you do.
