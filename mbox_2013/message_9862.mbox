Hello! Everyone,
=C2=A0
I just thought of adding some clarifications.
=C2=
=A0
First of all, when I mentioned about the utility of techniques of "Hypn=
otherapy" and "Past Life Regression" for handling the problem of spirit att=
achments as well as many other problems for which we do not have reasonable=
 explanation, my assertions were limited to the utility part only and not b=
eyond that. I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or not, in f=
act I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, an=
y knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half kno=
wledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in our thi=
s empirical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of the fa=
ct of having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that the Su=
n does not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, still w=
e use sentences like "Sun rises=C2=A0in the east", "Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in t=
he west" etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with activities whi=
ch helps
 in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I'd mentioned ab=
out "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression".
=C2=A0
One should not commen=
t about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full=
 of infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just c=
an not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited ways. Bef=
ore anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=C2=A0m=
ust first take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to =
say that if=C2=A0one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one would =
definitely be convinced about the same.=C2=A0By saying that one shouldn't m=
ake comments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=C2=A0by d=
oing so one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=C2=
=A0blind belief in religion and religious practices=C2=A0can be termed as d=
ogmatic but also in science if one loses the scientific temper.
=C2=A0
Proo=
f of pudding is in eating it, all that I can say to the persons willing to =
address any of their problems. "Hypnotherapy" and "Past Life Regression" ha=
ve immense utility for=C2=A0those who are desirous of addressing their prob=
lems with an open mind. Those who are interested can read " Many Lives, Man=
y Masters by Brian Weiss" to start with.
=C2=A0
To respected Narasimha sir,=
 I would like to inform that these are not "new age ideas". These were ther=
e much before in India. to cite concept of "Jaati Smaran" of Jainism is one=
 among them. Jainas used this technique of "Jaati Smaran" to reinforce renu=
nciation in the followers.
=C2=A0
To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform t=
hat=C2=A0so far as my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be =
done over phone, but however, there are so many problems which can be handl=
ed even over phone. To cite one example - One girl was having=C2=A0one recu=
rrent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she=C2=A0approached me fo=
r the treatment.=C2=A0But due to my=C2=A0official engagements I was camping=
 at a far off place for around 2 months.=C2=A0Her problem was getting worse=
ned as it=C2=A0had=C2=A0 started affecting her professional career adversel=
y. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone=
. The phone session continued for around one and half an hour and she got r=
elieved from her that recurrent dream and also started improving her profes=
sional life. Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.
=C2=A0=

It all depends on the openness of the mind, the strength of the desire to =
overcome etc. The universe is much more than what we see,what we can see an=
d what we can believe to see.

Namaste,

To add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understa=
nding of the reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems=
. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific mom=
ents from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external consc=
iousness. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any opp=
ortunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be =
recalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolv=
ed and new set is generated based on need.

The Buddhists do not believe in=
 the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our =
idea of Atmah. Therefore
 their idea of reincarnation
 is very different. I=
t is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together
 t=
o give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disinteg=
rated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these =
can coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts c=
an simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part.=
 =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation=
, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while anot=
her part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like=
 a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his =
energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarna=
ting in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with=
 their philosophy.

Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a rei=
ncarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governe=
d only by a supreme law of
 debts/balances - rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain =
scriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get =
rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirva=
na. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tenden=
cy towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.

But t=
he old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolve=
d at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to anot=
her and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this sou=
l's influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body ve=
hicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique =
soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able t=
o *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine L=
ife.=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is 
not the ultimate aim, it is only o=
ne among many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state 
of complet=
e negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then there w=
as just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex life-actions. T=
he law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of gi=
ve and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The import=
ant thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth=
 to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediate=
ly. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That i=
s why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can tra=
nsform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born =
a hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. Whereas=
 those aspects of life 
where the soul has no play or no scope of play, are=
 firmly governed by 
the law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take o=
f energy. 

Now since the soul is what remembers and everything else being =
perishable, the only indestructible link between past life and present life=
, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete =
cinematic biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there have be=
en lives when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all, then t=
hose are dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. For Nature,=
 those lives serve no purpose at all. 


Moreover all these are possible ON=
LY if and when an individual starts living in and through the soul in a ver=
y very strong manner. That is not easy.

Namaste,
=C2=A0
I know those who ar=
e excited by these new age ideas like "past life regression" will be badly =
upset with honest views, but let me state my view.

=C2=A0
It is possible t=
o remember past life. 
However, if such memory does not come at a very youn=
g age due to some deep 
desires from past life or an unnatural death before=
, it is not easy to get it later. Even for a great yogi with tremendous sel=
f-control, calming the mind down to suppress 
current conditioning sufficie=
ntly to remember past life is not easy.
=C2=A0
For example, at least 3 sain=
ts/yogis of a high spiritual caliber claimed to be re-incarnations of Ramak=
rishna Paramahamsa. If such saints cannot accurately know their own past li=
fe, anybody thinking that someone else can make one aware of one's past lif=
e is just kidding oneself.
=C2=A0
Remembering past life or making someone e=
lse do so, is not at all easy. In comparison, hallucinating that one rememb=
ered past life or making someone else 
hallucinate that one remembered past=
 life, is certainly very easy! In fact, I suspect that is what happens in m=
ost past life regressions..

=C2=A0
There is a deep reason why 
Nature has =
built this mechanism of forgetting a life when another life 
starts. Otherw=
ise, this game will end very quickly. This forgetfulness prolongs the game =
very much and makes it far more interesting.
=C2=A0

the girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam =
manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra.=
 But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.

>>>If =
the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if poss=
ible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhair=
ava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the pro=
blem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairav=
a live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may =
charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl t=
o come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the templ=
e and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This=
 is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what =
came to my mind.

>>>Namaste Sir,
>>>
>>>A possess=
ion by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For t=
here are various classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess =
an individual and some of them can be downright nasty.
>>>
>>>Upayas are ma=
ny. As so many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work=
, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a specif=
ic case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarante=
e of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has poss=
essed the individual and what their link for the same is. By link it means =
one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them=
 to enter into the person.
 Sometimes it can be
 something
 as simple as sp=
itting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or
 causally entering into t=
heir territory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness=
 in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberatel=
y send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, the=
re is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situatio=
n. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti tha=
t those trying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.M=
oreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then u=
nless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come t=
o serious harm.
>>>
>>>These things like removing possession are specializa=
tions. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one know=
s well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense w=
ould do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must k=
now well how to
 handle the same too. Again
 if a spirit is removed by forc=
e before the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to b=
e in possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain =
which will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tri=
ed to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.
>>>
>>>[Reminds me of a=
 particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism.=
 But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about=
 the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in po=
ssession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim.=
 Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the b=
ody of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Ne=
ver trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases wher=
e the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]
>>>
>>>=
Best thing to do is a) find someone
 who knows exactly how to deal with spi=
rit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not poss=
ible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably B=
hairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are=
 better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time.=
 Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on=
 the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with a=
ny sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this thro=
ugh to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copp=
er pot, and then either make the possessed individual drink the water or sp=
rinkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible.

complexity of the problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation=
 is over simplified and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the =
soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments from past lives when =
the soul had a role to play on the external consciousness. Which means if o=
ne has lived a life where there never was any opportunity for the soul to c=
ome forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a c=
omplete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generate=
d based on need.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">The Buddhists do not =
believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is simil=
ar to our idea of Atmah.
 Therefore
 their idea of reincarnation
 is very d=
ifferent. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces =
together
 to give the impression of an individual being, which upon death g=
et disintegrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s=
) of these can coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some ot=
her parts can simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a diff=
erent part.   Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of re=
incarnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body=
 while another part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneo=
usly*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person,=
 while his energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of b=
ody incarnating in another person and all these happening simultaneously! I=
t fits with their philosophy.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Those ph=
ilosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Uni=
verse only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of
 =
debts/balances - rna. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with =
this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life =
and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here th=
at is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal=
 renunciation of life and its processes.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"non=
e">But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not =
dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life=
 to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop =
this soul's influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind=
/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and=
 unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, b=
e able to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a =
Divine Life. </span><span><span> A Supreme Negation of life is 
not th=
e ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities.  If  mov=
ing into a state 
of complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and =
inevitable aim,
 then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and pe=
rform complex
 life-actions. </span>The law of Karma is here too, but it is=
 not restricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case o=
f the idea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is help=
ing the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it c=
hanges the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfa=
iling and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must h=
ave killed hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ =
he did not have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the h=
ands of those he had killed]. </span><span>Whereas those aspects of life 
w=
here the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by 
the =
law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. </span></div><d=
