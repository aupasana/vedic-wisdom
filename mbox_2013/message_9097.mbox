The most important question raising again and again is why should we postpo=

=C2=A0 
Namaste,
=C2=A0
Some quick miscellaneous replies to a few select=
ed questions/comments that came in response to my writeup yesterday.
=C2=A0=

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

Comment 1: "If the remedial measures can only push=
 the karma phala down to manifest 
at a later date/birth then isn't it a fu=
tile=C2=A0exercise. Why not accept 
whatever comes our way as 'PRASAD' from=
 Isvara and move on."
=C2=A0
My response: The final goal is indeed to reach=
 a state of mind where one can accept the fruits of all karmas as prasad of=
 Lord, with an equanimous mind. However, it is not easy. When we receive th=
e fruits of some really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agita=
ted that we lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This may r=
esult in further bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused state=
.
=C2=A0
Thus, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really bad impending=
 karmas when one is still in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer s=
tate of mind in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad fruit=
s better. It is even possible theoretically that one pushes off a really ba=
d karma, makes progress during that borrowed
 time, reaches an equanimous s=
tate of mind, becomes liberated and then faces the karma as a liberated bei=
ng with a totally equanimous mind that does not get agitated.

=C2=A0
Comment 2: Prarabda karma is which was already done and =
sanchitha and agami are what we going to do.
=C2=A0
My Response: Actually s=
anchita karmas are also karmas already done. Sanchita means "piled up". Pra=
rabdha karmas are different in the sense that their fructification has alre=
ady begun. The verb "prArabh" means "to begin". Its noun form "prArambha" m=
eans "beginning" and its gerund noun form "prArabdha" means "the [one that =
was] begun". Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process of reaction=
 has already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled u=
p karmas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed ind=
efinitely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic S=
elf without experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fruits of =
prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced eve=
n by a liberated being.
=C2=A0
Though fruits of prarabdha karmas are alread=
y in the pipeline, even they can actually be delayed or manipulated. Bottom=
line is that there are agents of delivery at the physical and subtle level =
even for things deep in the pipeline and hence some limited adjustment is p=
ossible.

Comment 3:How does nishkam karma wo=
rks? In other words, when a doer detaches himself from an action, where doe=
s the reaction goes?
=C2=A0
My Response: If one identifies with a body-mind=
 complex and a limited sense of self-identification and pursues its selfish=
 agenda, one keeps accumulating karmas. But, if one has minimal identificat=
ion with a body-mind complex to just sustain it, pursues no agenda and enga=
ges in whatever action is natural in the situation one is in (but not drive=
n by any conditioning, i.e. agendas or desires or likes/dislikes), then one=
 is untouched by karmas performed in that state.
=C2=A0
In the words of Swa=
mi Sivananda of Hrishikesh, "The accumulated and current actions of a Jnani=
 take shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti". In other words, Sanchita karmas (pile=
d up actions from past that have not yet begun fructifying) and aagami karm=
as (actions being performed right now) of a liberated being take shelted in=

 Cosmic Kinetic Consciousness (Brahmanda Prakriti).

=C2=A0
Comment 4: If my destiny is to suffer, why should I pray to God? A=
nd if i am being 
punished for some kind of bad karma from the past, why am=
 i not aware of it? It is like getting punishment without knowing your bad =
deeds.
=C2=A0
My Response: One need not pray to God.All one needs to do is =
to stop engaging in problematic karmas to add to the pile of such karmas fr=
om the past. More importantly, one needs to reach a calm and sustainable st=
ate of mind in which that can be maintained even in the middle of a tumulto=
us hurricane caused in one's life due to serious bad karmas from the past. =
Once serious troubles set in or mind focuses on sense objects, material wor=
ld and one's pleasures and pains, mind tends to lose its balance and judgme=
nt, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas and starts performing even =
more bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and contemplating various ideals and =
qualities that God represents can give a shelter to the mind in which it ca=
n maintain some calmness, balance and judgment. If that is not the case for=
 one, perhaps one needs to perfect it further.
=C2=A0
God has no agenda to =
either punish you or hide the reason. God is an impartial balancer of react=
ions to all actions. If there is something unreasonable about the reaction =
you are getting, it means your action had a similar unreasonableness.

=C2=
=A0Let me turn around your question on being "aware" and ask a simple quest=
ion. When we cause loss or hurt to someone, do we always tell that person w=
hy we are doing it? If not, how can we expect someone to tell us before cau=
sing loss or hurt to us? If I caused terrible strife to someone pious and p=
ure for no reason, then Nature will use someone in future to cause terrible=
 strife to me despite my piety and purity and apparently for no reason.
=C2=
=A0
In fact, what will you achieve by knowing exactly what was the action t=
hat caused what is happening to you right now? Why is that useful? More use=
ful is your conscience (a representation of God in each heart) that tells y=
ou right from wrong. It constantly gives guidance on which actions will giv=
e good reactions *in future*.

Comment 5: Vasa=
na can be for wealth, fame, power, domination (a struggle for power!) etc. =
Many ripus, many reasons...!
=C2=A0
My Response: Well-said. Though we are d=
iscussing karma and karma phala here, the root cause of karma is vasana in =
chittaakasha. (Chidaakaasha is the space of pure consciousness and chittaak=
aasha is the space of conditioned consciousness that has likes, dislikes, d=
esires, agendas etc.) Vasishtha defined liberation as overcoming vasanas in=
 Yoga Vaasishtham and Patanjali defined yoga as "chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yo=
gaH" (resisting the working of conditioning is oneness with Cosmic Self) in=
 Yoga Sutras. Until we overcome our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense a=
nd some are very subtle. But all of them bind us.

Comment 6:1. As per Shri Vimalananda, you may also offer all the kar=
mas as Homa to inner 
devas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is less=
er of suffering if 
you do that. Who gets the remaining delta suffering?
=
=C2=A0
My Response: Karmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of th=
at karma alone. It is a function of that karma and one's current state of m=
ind. If someone serves spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half =
day or diaria for a week. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the s=
ame karmaphala set in motion by the same external agents of delivery (physi=
cal & subtle) can cause different reaction inside one, depending on one's c=
urrent state of mind.
=C2=A0
An idle mind is devil's workshop. Our minds ke=
ep vibrating with various notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfi=
sh desires and unnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effec=
ts of one's environment (through which fruits of karmas are
 administered).=

=C2=A0
If one thinks of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates vario=
us ideals and qualities of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik ene=
rgy, it absorbs the negative effects of one's environment better or at leas=
t does not amplify them.

phala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of deliv=

mas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the sa=

>=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses =
one, with sufficient mental force behind it (this is the key), the same thi=

>>>(3) I recollect an episode from famous "Gurucha=
ritra" (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out t=
o Shri Guru "If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at =
all". At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells=
 his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please=
 excuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to recollect t=
his episode from old memory]. So question I have is, does our sadhana chang=
e karmaphal to a great extent or it is just our perception that changes?

rmas are also karmas already done. Sanchita means "piled up". Prarabdha kar=
mas are different in the sense that their fructification has
 <span style=
=3D"font-style:italic;">already begun</span>. The verb "prArabh" means "to =
begin". Its noun form "prArambha" means "beginning" and its gerund noun for=
m "prArabdha" means "the [one that was] begun". Prarabdha karmas are action=
s for which the process of reaction has already begun and in the pipeline. =
Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up karmas that have not kicked off their =
fruits yet. They can be delayed indefinitely. If one becomes liberated whil=
e living, one can merge in Cosmic Self without experiencing the fruits of s=
anchita karmas. However, fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipe=
line and need to be experienced even by a liberated being.<br> <br>Tho=
ugh fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline, even they can a=
ctually be delayed or manipulated. Bottomline is that there are agents of d=
elivery at the physical and subtle level even for things deep in the pipeli=

Dear Narasimha Ji,<br>
        I was=
 pondering over few things we routinely come across as a part of worship an=
d how it manipulates karma pipe line,<br>
(1) When someone gives a `curse' =
or does a prayoga such as `maran' or `uchhatan' what happens to a person wh=
o is at receiving end, does his bad karma comes forward or is it a new para=
bdha that is created. I vaguely remember Vimalananda mentioning something a=
bout a Saint's curse in Aghora trilogy.<br>


(2) On similar note, what hap=
pens when you get `blessings' say from a saint or elders? We also come acro=
ss lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka G=
anapati =E2=80=93 what do this items really do if they work? Something simi=
lar with wearing gemstones for planets =E2=80=93 do they bring forward good=
 karmas or they create new ones?<br>


(3) I recollect an episode from famo=
us "Gurucharitra" (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady =
cried out to Shri Guru "If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we wors=
hip God at all". At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but =
later tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next bir=
th. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to =
recollect this episode from old memory]. So question I have is, does our sa=
dhana change karmaphal to a great extent or it is just our perception that =
changes?<br>


Thanking you,<br>
