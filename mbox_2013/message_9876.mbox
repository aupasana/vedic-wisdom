Dear Ajit,
=C2=A0
Great point. However, a genuine siddhi and a hallucinatio=
n cannot be painted with the same brush.
=C2=A0
If a yogi with Kundalini in=
 a higher chakra obtains a special siddhi and a hasty newbie hallucinates g=
etting the same siddhi, they are of course not the same, though both are st=
uck in Maya (the delusory power of the field of duality)!
=C2=A0
Suppose ev=
eryone in a room (field of duality) sees a rope (Self) as a snake (world ap=
pearance). They are all under the influence of Maya. Suppose one person in =
the room makes the snake seem (to everyone in the room) to have 10 heads. S=
uppose another person imagines the snake to have 10 heads and that everyone=
 sees 10 heads, while everyone actually sees only one head.
=C2=A0
In an *a=
bsolute* non-dualistic sense, both are in delusion because it is not a snak=
e in the first place and a rope. But, in a *relative* dualistic sense, the =
latter is hallucinating and the former is mastering the dynamics of the roo=
m.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Having said that, I must re-emphasize tha=
t it is silly to pursue any siddhis. Seeking the ability to make the rope t=
hat everyone sees as snake appear to have 4 heads or 10 heads to all is a s=
illy goal.
=C2=A0
A true seeker will seek the ability to always see as rope=
 what everyone sees as snake. That is the only meaningful "ability". During=
 the process of acquiring that ability, one may get other abilities (e.g. t=
he above one). Some seekers get attached to them and get stuck. Some reject=
 them and keep progressing.

=C2=A0
When a Ramakrishna=
 told a few of his disciples who they were in a past life, one might not ha=
ve been able to know FOR SURE if he was correct or not. Nevertheless, there=
 are a few things to note: (1) He was not operating with any selfish agenda=
s or seeking money/power/something else. (2) His words gave confidence and =
got his disciples through the most challenging times of their lives, i.e. t=
hey served a purpose. (3) Most importantly, those disciples ended up, a few=
 decades later, living a life of exemplary renunciation and selfless servic=
e to society and disseminated sublime wisdom. One could conclude that his v=
isions were perhaps genuinely inspired.
=C2=A0
There has to be a sense of s=
aattwik purpose and lack of selfish agendas behind any knowledge that comes=
 to one, for one to benefit from it spiritually. Knowledge coming from a vi=
sit to a commercial psychotherapist is hardly likely to be that way.
=C2=A0=
In any case, my basic point is that it is not at all easy to know past life=
 of oneself or others. It requires a seeker of great caliber.

=A0=C2=A0 * 

=C2=A0Of course, you are right - the nice feeling one may obt=
ain in homam or meditation or any activity may be qualitatively same. If a =
regular practice eventually lessens one's conditioning, then only it can be=
 said to be working.
=C2=A0
However, most practices do help one in the long=
 run (may be years or lives, depending on the denseness of one's conditioni=
ng), if they are done with *regularity*. Despite wrong attitude and misstep=
s in the beginning, one does find one's path if one sticks to a sadhana. Th=
at is why I am a fan of regular practices instead of one-off practices.
=C2=
=A0
A one-off practice can also transform one tremendously if one's conditi=
oning is sufficiently light already. However, we do not encounter such peop=
le anymore. That is why I downplay one-off practices and emphasize regular =
practice.
=C2=A0
Whether it's homam or japam or a kriya, just do it regular=
ly with as sincere and devoted a mind as possible.

=

=C2=A0Knowing details of past life/lives is mostly useless. If there is a =

serious debt that needs to be paid back, we do get a chance in this life t=
o pay it back, whether or not we know its cause. If there is a really 
good=
 deed we did, we do get its fruit, whether or not we know its cause.

=A0=C2=A0 * 

=C2=A0There is nothing higher than the ability to listen to 
=
one's own conscience, even when inconvenient. That conscience is the 
repre=
sentation of god in us. It is the highest guru, highest astrologer one can =
consult and the highest psychotherapist. It doesn't tell you all the logic,=
 formulas and calculations it uses, but it always gives the perfect advice!=


Normally we suppress the voice of conscience and follow the voice of cond=
itioned mind. But, as we listen to it more, the voice of conscience becomes=
 
louder and clearer..
=C2=A0
Best regards,

Narasimha

I do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, any kn=
