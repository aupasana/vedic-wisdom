Namaste Narasinhaji..!!!

Thank you for your elaborate reply.

I learned to=
 chant vedic hymns using recordings by others.

really loved the vibrations=
 (still only understand few words of Sanskirt
though!)

enjoyed it more lik=
e a piece of sacred music...

then i read about importance of pronunciation=
 in Vedic hymns in Aghora
trilogy.

Aghori Vimalananda , in fact, says NOT =
to say aloud vedic hymns , as no
mortals (or very few) today can actually p=
ronounce it correctly.

intonation and pronunciation seemed to matter more =
for Vedic mantras

but as you said, devotional aspects outweight all of thi=
s in Kali Yug!

<span>For example=
, the lifeless consonant hanging on as an extension at the end of the previ=
ous syllable (e.g. t at the end of "prachodayAt") is given life a=

word "prachodayAt" is pronounced as "prachodayAtU" by m=

<span>Probably som=

 better and sishyas learnt it that way and propagated that way. A
 lifeless=

and prachodayAp sound pretty much the same to ears without super-fine atten=

<span>The other corr=

<span>Also, the &quo=

 and then say a, you are supposed to get ra. The way south Indians say it, =
you get ru+a=3Drva. The way north Indians say it, you get ri+a=3Drya. Both =
are incorrect. Moreover, vi in "vikRti" is supposed to be a laghu=

 </font>  <br><div><span>Namaste friends,<br>
=A0<br>Some people are confus=
ed with the "sh" sound as in "shiva" or "shrI rAma=
" or "shava". I want to clarify it.<br>=A0<br>There
 are thr=
ee s-sounds in Sanskrita - sha, Sha and sa (using iTrans 
notation). They a=
ppear in alphabet in that order. The middle one is 
written in Devanagari s=
cript like "pa" with a cross line through it. The
 first letter &=
quot;sha" (as in shiva) is pronounced by some as "Sha" and b=
y 
some as "sa" and both are incorrect.<br>=A0<br>First some back=
ground..<br>=A0<br>Consider
 the five Sanskrit letters "ka" (k as=
 in in kavi - poet), "cha" (ch as 
in chaNDI or church), "Ta=
" (T as in Tom or Tapori), "ta" (t as in 
tantra) and "=
pa" (p as an pass). Pronounce them in quick succession a 
few times - =
"ka cha Ta ta pa". Note the point where tongue touches the 
upper=
 palate/surface of mouth when
 you say these. For "ka", it will b=
e way back in mouth, near the throat.
 For "cha", it will move to=
wards the front, but still in the back. For 
"Ta", it will move f=
urther towards the front and tongue will touch a 
little above teeth. For &=
quot;ta", tongue will touch teeth. For "pa", tongue 
will no=
t touch anything, but lips will touch each other.<br>=A0<br>Say "ka
 c=
ha Ta ta pa" several times and notice the progression from the back of=

 mouth to lips. Get a feel for the position of "cha Ta ta". Say =
"cha Ta 
ta" several times.<br>=A0<br>Now, the pronunciation of &=
quot;sha Sha sa" (sh as
 in shiva, shrI etc, Sh as in uShA, veSha etc,=
 s as in satya, sama) is 
very similar to that of "cha Ta ta". In=
 the latter 3 sounds, tongue 
touches the upper palate of mouth at 3 places=
 (for which you just got a 
feel). In the former 3 sounds, tongue comes clo=
se to touching in the 
same 3 places, but does not actually touch. It comes=
 close to touching 
and there is some
 gap.<br>=A0<br>With this understandi=
ng, now practice saying "cha sha" 
several times, "Ta Sha&qu=
ot; several times and "ta sa" several times. You 
will see that e=
ach pair is pronounced at the same place. If tongue 
touches mouth's up=
per palate at one position for the first sound and 
comes close to touching=
 at a *different* position for the second sound 
in the same pair, you are =
making a mistake. Try again.<br>=A0<br>No wonder
 that visarga becomes sh, =
Sh and s if ch, T and t (respectively) come 
after it, as per sandhi rules =
of grammar. Sanskrit grammar is very 
logical and based on phonology (study=
 of sounds).<br></span>=A0</div><div style=3D"font-style:normal;font-size:1=
