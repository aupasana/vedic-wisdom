Is this the same allah that wants to kill all the infidels/non-believers and
wants everyone to show absolutely no tolerance to other's beliefs?

Ney

An empty, hollow, reed flute,
I must become a Ney.
So that through me unimpeded,
Divine music Allah can play.

But the wretched stubborn mind
Must always have its own way.
And the six enemies fight within,
Desperate to stay.

Allah none reaches You,
Save through Your infinite Grace,
Of the undivine now,
Let there be no trace.

Lord, the Spirit is willing,
Though the flesh is weak.
This life is irksome and,
The journey long and bleak.

Yet there is no room for despair,
When one is Your own child.
You redeemed Mira and Kabir,
Why shall You leave the rest behind?

You defeated the enemies,
Within countless Saints of yore.
They can be performed yet again,
Those feats achieved before.

Yea surely You shall not abandon,
Your worthless devotee.
Lacking in faith and intellect,
Filled with hypocrisy.

For Your compassion knows no bounds,
And embraces one and all.
Your Love holds the Universe,
Ever in its thrall.

Wide as the sky is Your heart,
Limitless as the ocean is Your love,
That ever redeems the lowly,
And raises them up above.
