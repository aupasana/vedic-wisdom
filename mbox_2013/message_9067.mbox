What is the difference between these 'two types' ? These are concepts of =
the mind.
The bhakti of an enlightened one or any other helpless devotee's =
bhakti are not different. Even an enlightened one feels helpless at times. =
But on a deeper level, the conviction that only the Reaity exists, remains =
all along.
Bhakti is a progressive detachment from material objects. As lon=
g as there is some form of definition, contamination, attachment and condit=
ioning, Bhakti has never reached its full maturity.=C2=A0 Until a certain p=
oint, attachment to the deity remains and eventually the deity vanishes too=
. The world dissolves into the deity and the deity in light and light in Om=
 and the Om in void.
And then only silence remains.
Absolute silence.

>>Namaste friends, =C2=A0 Bhakti yoga or the path of surrend=
er and devotion is indeed more suitable in this age. I did not mean to say =
otherwise. =C2=A0 But just having an ishta devata is not enough to be "prot=
ected" from deep and troublesome instabilities when one's body-mind complex=
 goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring devotee becomes a Pr=
ahlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji ga=
ve below for "psychological disorder", the second lady "did much sadhana of=
 Srirama". Even those who think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up w=
ith hallucinations, mental and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one's=
 conditioning and desires!) interpretation of internal/external experiences=
 and even madness. =C2=A0 True surrender/devotion to ishta devata will defi=
nitely protect one, but cultivating it is as difficult as cultivating detac=
hment through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment are almost the=
 same. =C2=A0 This is
 why I said that *lightness of conditioning* is the m=
ost important thing. One with dense conditioning will find SOME way to fail=
 even if a great guru or god are ready to help. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=

=A0 Now, the question is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortunately,=
 there is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japa=
m, homam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by regular introspecti=
on and self-improvement. =C2=A0 Taking mind away from its current pre-occup=
ations (e.g. "I am smart", "I am doing good sadhana", "I am mad at X", "I d=
id not get what I deserve in Y", "I am better than X", "I must have Y at an=
y cost" etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for these th=
oughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning! =C2=A0 To reduce the regular pr=
e-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualization may work better for =
some people. =C2=A0 One approach is to contemplate god whenever possible, i=
n the middle of
 any activity. You can imagine a being in your mind, either=
 as an ideal/able person or as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in man=
y beings, that is so perfect and fascinating for the mind to contemplate th=
at it does not care about other objects around that are making shadripus an=
d ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its reg=
ular debilitating pre-occupations, one can try to contemplate god instead. =
=C2=A0 Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says in the movie "Life of Pi" about th=
e tiger on the boat, wild animals can't be transformed or domesticated, but=
 they can be trained into some habits! =C2=A0 Whenever one is enjoying a se=
nsual pleasure, if one thinks "the omnipresent God is enjoying this thru th=
is instrument" and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead o=
f thinking too much about limited sense objects, one is better placed to re=
duce the damage done by shadripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for wha=
t they did, if
 one thinks "the omnipresent God is giving me the fruits of =
my karmas thru that instrument" and starts contemplating the qualities of t=
hat god instead of being angry at someone, one is better placed to reduce t=
he damage done by shadripus. And so on. =C2=A0 In the beginning, even conte=
mplation of god becomes laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity en=
ds up becoming about oneself rather than about god ("*I* am doing this nice=
 bhajan", "*I* am doing this nice homam", "I think *I* am making progress t=
hrough this"). With effort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about =
oneself and keep it centered on the supreme power that runs the show. Just =
as it takes a long time to train a wild animal, it takes a long time to tra=
in mind! =C2=A0 Try to develop devotion and surrender. Based on all that yo=
u read and heard, develop of a concept/principle of god that is so superb a=
nd fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that concept as frequently as possib=
le, especially
 when meditating. When mind veers off into other things, gen=
tly steer it back. Don't spend too much time dissecting what mind is doing =
and why. Just put it back gently into contemplating god. Try to make it abo=
ut god rather than about yourself. =C2=A0 The main drawback of the sadhana =
of most people is that they make it about themselves at some level or the o=
ther. Though that is unavoidable, try to break free from it. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Finally, one can try to overcome the limited sense of self =
and engage in selfless actions that benefit a larger set of people than one=
self. What stops us from truly loving god is our deep and sub-conscious lov=
e for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* notion of self that drives the curren=
t body-mind complex). One way to overcome that is to selflessly love others=
. After all, other people around us are as much replicas of god as we are. =
If we cannot empathize with them, love them and give them unconditionally,
=
 how can we ever hope to transcend the limited sense of Self and truly love=
 omnipresent God? =C2=A0

>>>>>>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome=
 based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatr=
y job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems t=
o think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childh=
ood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the =
body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until he=
r symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been ab=
le to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it mig=
ht be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally =
ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneo=
us kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this =
topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-u=
nderstood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged
 k=
undalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the ku=
ndalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini s=
hould not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times be=
cause the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will c=
onsume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what sol=
ution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Div=
ine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this=
 woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I r=
equest that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like=
 her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let=
 us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselv=
es. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safes=

ial, helvetica, sans-serif;COLOR:#000;FONT-SIZE:10pt;">Namaste friends, &nb=
sp; Bhakti yoga or the path of surrender and devotion is indeed more suitab=
le in this age. I did not mean to say otherwise.   But just having an =
ishta devata is not enough to be "protected" from deep and troublesome inst=
abilities when one's body-mind complex goes through a big transformation. N=
ot every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After a=
ll, out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for "psychological disorder"=
, the second lady "did much sadhana of Srirama". Even those who think of a =
deity and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, mental and spirit=
ual disorders, wrong (colored by one's conditioning and desires!) interpret=
ation of internal/external experiences and even madness.   True surren=
der/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but
 cultivating =
it is as difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true =
surrender and detachment are almost the same.   This is why I said tha=
t *lightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One with dense c=
onditioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god are read=
y to help.   *        *  =
      *   Now, the question is: How do we red=
uce our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Think=
ing of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to=
 be augmented by regular introspection and self-improvement.   Taking =
mind away from its current pre-occupations (e.g. "I am smart", "I am doing =
good sadhana", "I am mad at X", "I did not get what I deserve in Y", "I am =
better than X", "I must have Y at any cost" etc etc) is key to eventually o=
vercoming conditioning,
 for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditio=
ning!   To reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different image=
ry/visualization may work better for some people.   One approach is to=
 contemplate god whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can =
imagine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a princi=
ple/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascin=
ating for the mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects=
 around that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Wheneve=
r mind is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one =
can try to contemplate god instead.   Mind is a wild animal. As Pi say=
s in the movie "Life of Pi" about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can't=
 be transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits! =
  Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one
 thinks "the omn=
ipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument" and starts contemplatin=
g the qualities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sens=
e objects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whe=
never one is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks "the omnipre=
sent God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument" and sta=
rts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someo=
ne, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on.=
   In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego.=
 Every now and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather tha=
n about god ("*I* am doing this nice bhajan", "*I* am doing this nice homam=
", "I think *I* am making progress through this"). With effort and persever=
ance, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the sup=
reme power that runs the show. Just as it
 takes a long time to train a wil=
d animal, it takes a long time to train mind!   Try to develop devotio=
n and surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept=
/principle of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate=
 that concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When m=
ind veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don't spend too much=
 time dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into c=
ontemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself. &nbs=
p; The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it abo=
ut themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try t=
o break free from it.   *        *&=
nbsp;       *   Finally, one can try to =
overcome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions that bene=
fit
 a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from truly loving g=
od is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* n=
otion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way to overco=
me that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people around us are=
 as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love =
them and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to transcend the l=
imited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God?

;<br>Someone with psychiatric problems may expereience what sounds like a K=
undalini rise, but it may or may not be one.<br> <br>It must be conced=
ed though that Kundalini spontaneously rising through various nadis without=
 one having gone through proper preparation in this life (i.e. fine-tuning =
of one's attitude and development of detachment) CAN create havoc!<br> =
;<br>One may wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in a layman with n=
o sadhana, while many serious sadhakas may not experience it.<br> <br>=
Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL STEP in o=
vercoming one's current limited identity.<br> <br>Let me give an analo=
gy. One wanting to move from one's small dilapidated house (this body-mind =
complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace ov=
er time and
 move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasion=
ally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out=
 of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact,=
 it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in=
 it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without =
any out of body experiences. These are not my word's, but Maharshi Vasishth=
a's words to Lord Rama.<br> <br>Secondly, one does not get something w=
ithout wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have de=
eply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough ef=
fort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (an=
d ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.<br> <b=
r>As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Nature has=
 a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints on what=

 Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous actions). S=
o Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it=
 or want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one's w=
hole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not=
 enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, =
one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. </span><span =

2_19_1362067846619_89">In Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few th=
ings going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the vario=
us elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words th=
is translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness,=
 control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini=
 awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with great=
er force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then take=
s care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens -=
 IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to vari=
ous other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature whil=
e some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make
 use of the in=
dividual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=
r and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=
s even more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an ex=
perience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of p=
sychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west t=
oday is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also po=
ssible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from var=
ious subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can g=
et "ruptured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifest=
yles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the=
 mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are v=
ery complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list =
down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis
 is correctly done, v=
ery few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who cla=
im they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess w=
ork. Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be ach=
ieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient G=
