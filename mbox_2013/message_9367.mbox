All night, a man called "Allah"
Until his lips were bleeding.
Then the Devi=
l said, "Hey ! Mr Gullible !
How come you've been calling all night and nev=
er once heard Allah say, "Here, I am" ?
You call out so earnestly and, in r=
eply, what ?
I'll tell you what. Nothing !

The man suddenly felt empty and=
 abandoned.
Depressed, he threw himself on the ground and fell into a deep =
sleep.
In a dream, he met Abraham, who asked,
"Why are you regretting prais=
ing Allah ?"

The man said, " I called and called,
But Allah never replied,=
 "Here I am."
Abraham explained, "Allah has said,
"Your calling my name is =
My reply.
Your longing for Me is My message to you.
All your attempts to re=
ach Me
Are in reality My attempts to reach you.
Your fear and love are a no=
ose to catch Me.
In the silence surrounding every call of "Allah"
Waits a t=
housand replies of "Here I am."

~ Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi
