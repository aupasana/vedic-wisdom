OM SHRI GANESHAYA NAMAHA

Dear Fellow Spiritual Aspirants,

I am 45 years o=
f age. For the past few years, I have been feeling hindered in my spiritual=
 progress due to the feel of the sacred thread on my body during my sadhana=
. In fact, from as far back as I can remember, I have been averse to wearin=
g any metal on self, having been very sensitive to any prolonged foreign to=
uch on my body. I have experimented with removing my thread during sadhana =
and I find increased levels of consciousness and 'going within' through enh=
anced focus and concentration due to lesser distraction and irritation. Has=
 anyone experienced something like this? Why is this so? Is it only physiol=
ogical in origin or is there something more to it?

Can you provide me your=
 insights on what our sacred texts say about a 'born brahmin' not wearing a=
nd forsaking the sacred thread? I had started feeling many years back that =
wearing it has become only symbolic, especially given the lack of time to p=
erform the prescribed rituals, and of little practical relevance to a spiri=
tual aspirant. Also, the yearly community-level (mass) 'avani avittams' tha=
t we Tamil Iyers have been performing have become quite meaningless since e=
ven the priests do not carry out the entire ritual with the rigour, purity,=
 and devotion that is required for this. Please keep in mind that these are=
 only my personal observations and opinions and are not intended to hurt an=
yone's sentiments. =A0

Is there any authoritative ancient text which can t=
hrow light on this and solve my dilemma, since I continue donning the threa=
d only in respectful memory of my late father who had got the ritual perfor=
med at the appropriate age? My spiritual pursuits, I feel, can be given a f=
illip if I manage to overcome all these bonds.

Awaiting some informed comm=
ents, especially from Narasimha-ji, who always provides refreshingly scient=
ific arguments that are spiritual to the core.

Best wishes,
K. Ramakrishna=
