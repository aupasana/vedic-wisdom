Namaste Tanvirji,

Yes, that's why I was hesitating. Your method is interes=
ting for breaking down the words. My mother tongue is Tamil. I can speak an=
d understand Tamil but unfortunately cannot read it. That is why I did not =
download Tamil manual.

>>>>>It might be wrong in the meaning IN THE WAY YO=
U WRITE, however when you memorize it and by always putting hyphen in betwe=
en you know they form a single word, after memorizing you say it together v=
ery fast so there should not be any problem from the point of meaning WHEN =
YOU SAY IT.

OK, you're giving me the courage to do that. The key thing her=
e as you say, is to memorize it, because I should not pause in between to r=
emember it! With practice, it should become easier.

I would like to upload=
 a hyphenated version - with long words hyphenated in a way that'll be easi=
er for me to say together fast. I'm just curious to think what your opinion=
 of that would be.

Thanks again,

Alamelu

 Since I don't know Sanskrit, I cannot solve each of the words but I can de=

 in my own writing I put hyphen(s) between the two/three/four parts so when=
 memorizing, and even after memorizing is done, I always know that these pa=

 It might be wrong in the meaning IN THE WAY YOU WRITE, however when you me=
morize it and by always putting hyphen in between you know they form a sing=
le word, after memorizing you say it together very fast so there should not=
 be any problem from the point of meaning WHEN YOU SAY IT.

op of all I want to assure you : Once you break the words and memorize the =
mantra, you will find the whole big word to be very easy and you will have =
absolutely no problem anymore to remember and utter the whole big word very=
 easily. So don't fear, just memorize it by breaking in a way convenient to=
 you! :-)
