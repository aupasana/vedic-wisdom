Namaste,
=A0
Minds stuck on earth without bodies can vibrate with thoughts =
(often 
negative) and those vibrations can cause resonance in people's mind=
s and 
cause similar vibrations in them, to various degrees based on the st=
rength of people's minds.

=A0
There are many mantras, kavachas and prayers=
 to shield from the vibrations of such spirits, but the simplest and best I=
MHO is Hanuman Chalisa or any mantras of Hanuman. Chant Hanuman Chalisa and=
 contemplate on Lord Hanuman for 5 minutes, just before sleeping.
=A0Hanuma=
n's 12 name prayer is also good for chanting a few times before sleeping.It=
 is given in the Hanuman homam manual at http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/hom=
am. Among the several options given for pradhana homam, it is the two verse=
s starting with "hanumAn aMjanAsUnuH".
=A0
Best regards,

Narasimha

      <div>Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
Recently I was staying at an ol=
d house in a village. I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear st=
range noises -  creaking and something moving in the attic. I'm very sensit=
ive to different energies - I don't see anything, but I feel whether someth=
ing divine or rather evil is present in a certain place. That place didn't =
feel good to me.<br>
<br>
I was staying there for 10 days and every night I=
 would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see=
 them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would=
 wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely=
 hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to se=
e nothing.<br>
<br>
This doesn't seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instan=
tly become fully aware and I can move my body.<br>
<br>
Can it be that spir=
its live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people st=
aying at that place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it's n=
ot just me.<br>
<br>
On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place b=
efore going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep proper=
ly.<br>
<br>
Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at h=
ome, feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm =
in height, I've seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of t=
he strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.<br>
<br>
Is there=
 any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? =
Something that I can chant before going to sleep. This has been bothering m=
e for some time now and it interferes with my life.<br>
<br>
Thank you in a=
dvance!<br>
