Dear Durgesh,

> So don't keep the count. Jaap with devotion is of utmost importance.


Yes, bhakti is paramount. Focus / intensity is important. Duration also
matters :-)

Keeping count can be counter-productive if it is used as a race to the
finish. For example, maybe someone is doing 10 minutes of daily japa, and
does approximately 100 repetitions. They want to make sure that they do 108
repetitions, keep count, and end up finishing everything in super speed in
5 minutes, losing bhakti and focus in the process. Here it is the wrong
trade-off.

Maybe the same person who is doing 10 minutes of daily japa decides to do
1008 repetitions. With the eyes closed, after the normal 10 minutes of
daily japa, every extra minute feels like 10 minutes have passed. So, this
person decides to keep count, but does not try to speed up or otherwise
'cheat'. At first, focus is on the count and the 1008 repetitions are
mechanical. But slowly, the focus moves to the right place. Here, keeping
count is a good tool. And this same person may later decide to stop keeping
count while during a much longer japa.

There are no absolutes. Different techniques may be appropriate for
different people at different times.

> Some mantras are already in debt.


As soon as we start thinking of mantras and devatas in terms of debts and
benefits, it is no longer ideal for spiritual progress. What we want is to
thin the field of vasanas. If a mantra is in debt, and we obtain some
mantra siddhi, but it doesn't lessen our vasanas, how useful is that
mantra, to us, in the final analysis?

sasneham,

    ajit
