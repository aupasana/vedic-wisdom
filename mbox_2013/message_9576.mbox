Namaste All,

I am very interested in this email thread. I know of a family=
 in Boston where one of the family members is posessed. I had asked for hel=
p in this forum but did not get any response. If someone could provide some=
 guidance, that would be great.

The situation is very bad and the family i=
s virtually broke becuase of this spending on medical treatment because so =
far, no other help. In absence of any other solution,=A0 this os being trea=
ted as medical condition.

Thanks, 
Bhupendra

      <p>Thanks, I will give it a try!<br>
<br>
What about Kala Bhairava =
mantra? Can it be more efficient for a long-time Shiva devotee? I've he=
ard that it can repel spirits and ghosts. Can I chant these mantras at nigh=
t before going to sleep?<br>
