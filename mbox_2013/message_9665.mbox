Sir=
=C2=A0

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Thanks for your response and the beautif=
ul explanation you have given of all the four paths of self realization. Le=
t me try to put all this into a perspective here.=C2=A0

Now my understandi=
ng is that all these four different path lead to the same point or the end =
result and that is self realization. No matter what path or approach you ta=
ke the end result or the truth has to be the same. It cannot be two differe=
nt thing for two different people and in that case it is not the Truth. The=
 path one adopts may be of hindu persuasion or some other religious persuas=
ion the end result has to be the same. Not only the end result one has to c=
ome to a point where one has an insight or a perception that finishes the e=
go or self directed activity.=C2=A0

Karma is a natural result of the freed=
om that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning without freedom =
to act. I do mistakes and create imbalance only when I have freedom to act =
and as such I have pay it back and restore balance in Nature. To have the f=
reedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect sense to me.=
=C2=A0

Now due to karmic overload it may become very hard for large number=
s of people to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if Nature allows one to=
 be free of this attachment without a payback. Now there is a train of thou=
ght which says that one can look into the whole nature of this attachment a=
t one shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one thing after another=
 look at this whole thing to the root , have a perception and get out of it=
. In a sense our ancestors were intelligent that they devised some way to c=
lear this Karma but it seems like for large numbers of people these will be=
come crutches rather than help to get out of the karmic cycle and lead an e=
xistence where one is free to act. If my previous karma is influencing my a=
ction then I am not free.=C2=A0

Is it possible for someone to look into th=
is whole process of attachment and have an insight and be free of it right =
now....

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
> Dont you think all these yo=
gas are NOT an end in itself but to prepare the mind for awakening??
=C2=A0=

Correct. These paths get one started in the walk towards the same end poin=
t - Self-realization.

=C2=A0
> To be free is to be awakened.
=C2=A0
Not ex=
actly. Awakening is just a step towards freedom. Freedom comes in the end a=
fter walking a path for enough time after awakening.
=C2=A0
An unawakened s=
adhaka practicing jnana yoga reads books and talks eloquently about how eve=
rything is god, but looks at different people, objects and experiences with=
 a different attitude. He becomes happy (if not externally, atleast interna=
lly) when people praise him and becomes upset when people criticize him, an=
d so on. An awakened sadhaka practicing jnana yoga starts to honestly conte=
mplate one's actions, words, thoughts (and even instincts finally) and slow=
ly weeds out conditioning that makes one look at different transient things=
 differently. As his equanimity increases, still there will be episodes of =
getting carried away. As he employs contemplation and self-correction more =
and more, such episodes will become less and less frequent and one will bec=
ome liberated in the end.
=C2=A0
An unawakened sadhaka practicing karma yog=
a passionately engages in dharmik actions for the benefit of others. He get=
s elated and feels proud when good results come and becomes upset when bad =
results come. An awakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga starts to have deta=
chment to results. When something happens which makes him elated, proud, as=
hamed or upset, he will not think much about it, take it as god's prasad an=
d think about what is the right action for him right now. As his detachment=
 increases, still there will be episodes of getting carried away. As one be=
comes more and more detached (to results of actions), such episodes will be=
come less and less frequent and one will become liberated in the end.
=C2=
=A0
An unawakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga goes through yama, niyama, p=
ratyahara, dhyana, dharana etc. His psychic life force may even arise and a=
scend. He may have various experiences and may feel proud or become attache=
d to them. An awakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga will not not lose self-=
control in the face of anything and will keep the focus on samadhi. He will=
 not be distracted by anything that comes on the way and keep perfecting co=
ncentration and self-control so that samadhi (deep concentration on the unc=
onditioned Self) comes. In the beginning, one may be in samadhi state now a=
nd then. As practice is perfected, one can be in it all the time and become=
 liberated.
=C2=A0
An unawkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga is devoted t=
o god and worships him/her as much as one can, but will project his ego, co=
nditioning and desires onto his worship and hence onto the god he worships.=
 For example, he may think "I worship the highest god while that person wor=
ships a lower god. I am better" or "I am worshipping god everyday. I will g=
et so and so result" or "I worship god more than that person. I am better".=
 An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga has little expectation, pride et=
c. Worship becomes not about him but about god! He worships god and marvels=
 at the power that holds this cosmos together - the power that runs things =
infinitismally smaller than a boson and infinitely larger than a galaxy. He=
 will look at himself as a fully insignificant particle in front a supreme =
power. His desires, likes, dislikes, conditioning and agendas start to seem=
 too insignificant in front of contemplating about that supreme power. Even=
 as that
 devotional spirit increases, there will be episodes when one beco=
mes self-centered in one's worship. But with practice, one loses oneself co=
mpletely and surrenders completely to the supreme power and become liberate=
d in the end.
=C2=A0
In each path, one may walk the path without making any=
 significant progress for a long time. As one starts to imbibe the inherent=
 qualities of the path, some internal transformation will kick in. Yet, the=
 force of prior conditioning, coming from many lives, is too strong to over=
come. One keeps walking..

>Forget about =
horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I str=

 against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic life fo=

n this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts =
of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, b=
ut what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one of th=

>=C2=A0
>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a dis=

 to the same point or the end result and that is self realization. No=

 <br>"Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this di=
vinity
 within by controlling
 nature: external and internal. Do this eithe=
r by work or worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, o=
r all of these - and be free."<br> <br>Here are my 2 cents.<br> <=
br>Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasi=
zes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-m=
astery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One ca=
n pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However,=
 wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not=
 mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, othe=
rs will automatically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in =
"Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.<br> =
<br>Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespecti=
ve of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Eve=
n Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing th=
e psychic life force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama a=
nd clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumula=
te great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is no=
t just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel of Ramakr=
ishna" (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several o=
f his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did=
 not encourage even him to practice it.<br> <br>Jnana yoga is brillian=
t, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the delusional trap of ps=
eudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it.=
 It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it=
's ok - it doesn't matter. It's all a delusion anyway" without fully overco=
ming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in consciousness every=
 instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a movie that "it's just a movie=
 and not reality", but flinching in every scary scene, crying in every sad =
scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga =
can be problematic too. A long path of constant contemplation and self-corr=
ection can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the end.<br> <br>I=
MHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most s=
uitable and safest.<br> <br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<br>--------<br>=
