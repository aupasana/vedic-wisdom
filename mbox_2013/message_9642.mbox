Alamelu Garu,

I empathize with your situation. The first time I attempted =
the MahaGanapati Homam, I was not able to get beyond the first sentence of =
the "Anjunaa" mantram itself. It had been 20 years since I last read Devana=
gri script, leave alone Sanskrit. Instead of abandoning the homam, I used t=
he MahaGanapati Homam MP3 by Narasimha Sir to get through.

I struggled wit=
h both the pronunciation of iTrans text and the  homam steps. I created a q=
uick reference step by step "Cheat Sheet" in plain English/Roman text for m=
y  reference. I then referred to Narasimha Sir's MahaGanapati homam MP3 to =
split the long mantra words to more manageable hyphenated words.

Hope this=
 document will be of help to you and others. The PDF file is at http://grou=
ps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/files/ and is named MahaGanapatiHomam.Cheat=
Sheet.pdf.

My personal experience is that "getting on with it" is the best=
 approach. The first one or two times, just use the MP3 to get comfortable =
with the homam vidhi. Then you can start on chanting the mantra's by yourse=
lf, keeping the MP3 as backup.

Do it with full dedication, and Lord Ganesh=
a will himself give you subtle hints and ideas, *very gently*, on what to i=
mprove in the next homam.

Srinivas.

 I came across Shri Narasimhaji's website and was excited to discover the p=
rocedure for doing homams by yourself. However, I felt quite intimidated, s=
o I did not act upon them. Lately, I kept coming back to the site and decid=
ed to take it step by step to gain confidence, so I have started reading th=
e text of Shri Maha Ganapathi homam till the word flow is fluent. I'm less =
intimidated by it now. I'm also quite grateful to Shri Narasimhaji for maki=
ng it available as I have been wanting to do this for a long time. But am s=
till not ready to start it. The reason is that certain words are so long th=
at, to maintain a flow, I need to split the word into bits that will help m=
aintain the flow but need to know where to split in order that I don't chan=
ge the meaning of it. I'm following the Sanskrit version. I want to include=
 the words (a long list) in the hope that one of you members can help me sp=
lit them up in the right way, but my computer
