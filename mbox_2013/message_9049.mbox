=C2=A0 
Namaste friends=
,
=C2=A0
Someone with psychiatric problems may expereience what sounds like=
 a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not be one.
=C2=A0
It must be conceded=
 though that Kundalini spontaneously rising through various nadis without o=
ne having gone through proper preparation in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of=
 one's attitude and development of detachment) CAN create havoc!
=C2=A0
One=
 may wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in a layman with no sadhan=
a, while many serious sadhakas may not experience it.
=C2=A0
Firstly, Kunda=
lini rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL
 STEP in overcoming one=
's current limited identity.
=C2=A0
Let me give an analogy. One wanting to =
move from one's small dilapidated house (this
 body-mind complex) to a huge=
 palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move i=
nto it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays=
 in the palace still under construction (analogy for out of body experience=
s due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risk=
s. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one=
 can progress towards complete Self-realization without any out of body exp=
eriences. These are not my word's, but Maharshi Vasishtha's words to Lord R=
ama.
=C2=A0
Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and put=
ting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini =
rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one ma=
y be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even=
 want it!) when it comes in this life.
=C2=A0
As you do sadhana, try not to=
 fancy too many specific
 desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting=
 your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right now=
, arising from YOUR
 OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you w=
hat you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For e=
xample, one may pray for great wealth one's whole life and be born as a ric=
h but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray wh=
ole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but n=
ot have any knowledge or money. In another 
case, one may deeply desire to =
act in a famous film. One may be reborn 
as a tiger or a dog and act in a f=
amous film, but not really enjoy that 
experience. Basically, people keep g=
oing in circles through various lives, always "seeking" something they are =
"missing".
=C2=A0
Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires a=
n out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one's previous kar=
mas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life=
 with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik =
force behind it).

Kundalini rise is not nec=
essarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and=
 detachment.
=C2=A0
Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to =
free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to =
save it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!
=
=C2=A0
We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-=
mind complex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!
=C2=A0
=
If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are inco=
rrect and if we are this "infinite Self" as shastras say, won't a complete =
realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind co=
mplex, without being scared?

=C2=A0
Kundalini rise =
after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than
 Kundal=
ini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left in =
one's system.
=C2=A0
When one transcends one problematic notion about who o=
ne is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciou=
sness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notio=
n "I am the body", there may be another notion in one's body-mind complex t=
hat one's awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a gr=
eat scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a=
 hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy =
that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one's=
 self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can =
cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and yet remain in i=
gnorance and get stuck badly.
=C2=A0
An awakened Kundalini in a system with=
 undesirable conditioning may accentuate one's weaknesses and wrong notions=
 heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.
=C2=A0

=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms o=
f Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your
 weaknesses and im=
prove your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment=
 is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is t=
he other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.
=C2=A0

D=
on't worry about 
whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether =
you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta=
 pashas) or 
not. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are mak=
ing progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making p=
rogress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness)=
 
will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).
=C2=

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
One word on surrendering to a personal deity. T=
hough true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do=
 business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the =
plain and bare fact.
=C2=A0
"I want X, I will pray to you and please give i=
t to me", "I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please pro=
tect me" - all this is just a business deal. There is something you want an=
d you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, dem=
ands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one's fascination=
 for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throw=
s one's way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord's prasad =
and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascin=
ation and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.
=C2=A0
If one w=
ithout true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a=
 Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal g=
od. It is not that god does not want to "protect" one as said below. It is =
not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my "chipmunk glued t=
o mouse trap" example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared.=
 Similarly, one's conditioning makes one *run away* from God's
 protection!=
 God's protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one=
 should run away from!
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Whether through the pat=
h of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that a=
ll this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have=
 and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only=
 detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, disli=
kes etc) can protect one as one's Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy =
conditioning and impurities in one's nadis will distract rising Kundalini (=
self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.
=C2=A0
The real key is=
 how light your conditioning is.

>>In Tantra, to focu=
s on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant ef=
forts of purification of the various elements that compose the human mind-b=
ody structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, more =
equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2=
 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self i=
dentify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense =
kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is=
 very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also=
 open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some of wh=
ich are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given hal=
f a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold =
of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. H=
ence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more
 vital. 4 - While someday or o=
ther every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening an=
d rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The human =
psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal =
with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an indi=
vidual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us to re=
main as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to various reasons, hig=
h stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free ass=
ess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing se=
rious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities are =
there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such=
 a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to re=
ctify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing=
 more than an intelligent guess work.
 Sometimes it will have results, some=
times not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind=
 in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore =
sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi

>>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kunda=
lini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doin=
g a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someon=
e who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini=
 since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of e=
nergy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kunda=
lini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We hav=
e not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests norma=
l)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we c=
all mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwan=
ted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and resear=
ch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients a=
re not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments fo=
r deranged kundalini,
 we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly=
 waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling tha=
t kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill hersel=
f at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She fe=
els it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wond=
ered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pr=
ay to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suff=
ering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear =
this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and fo=
r others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is piti=
able. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situ=
ation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is =
perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the kundalini r=
ising bit to
 God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna

words this translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-react=
iveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine K=

th greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata t=
hen takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti a=
wakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body=
 to various other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nat=
ure while some of them are useless, and

 =
of the
 individual
 for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness =
in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-su=
ddhi becomes even more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will=
 have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all ma=
ladies of psychology are because of this. The human psychology as understoo=

r all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent =
experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, an=
d have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had =
a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involv=
ed out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of =
Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started a=
nd she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything =
physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is d=
ue to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themsel=
ves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakeni=
ng- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream =
psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western=
 medicine, and as we have no treatments
 for deranged kundalini, we struggl=
e to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experien=
ce with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibl=
y wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering =
from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it i=
s something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be=
 to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who mani=
fests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either c=
ure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good=
 samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may no=
t know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in ou=
r sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is =
why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let me be =
your
 instrument" and leave the kundalini rising bit to God's will. Om Dum =
