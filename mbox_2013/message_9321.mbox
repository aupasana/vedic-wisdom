Sir,

Thanks a lot for this very valuable info and your concern for my welf=
are. Assuming Apsaras cannot come to us in physical form at all, then how i=
s it that our Puranas are full of incidents like Rishis marrying Apsaras, A=
psaras giving birth to children due to their physical union with Rishis, et=
c.? Even some great kings are known to have had the company of Apsaras. For=
 example, Emperor Pururava was seduced by Urvashi Apsara. She lived with hi=
m for one year, and then disappeared, leaving him distressed. How all this =
can be explained? Any insightful ideas from you learned ones pertaining to =
these incidents would be very helpful.
