America's First Hindu Think Tank

The Center for the Study
of Dharma and Ci=
vilization

http://dharmacivilization.com/submissions/


Seeking Paper Subm=
issions

We are seeking papers to publish on our website, and that may even=
tually be
published in printed form.

We are exclusively interested in pape=
rs that firmly contrast any civilizational
aspect of Sanatana Dharma with a=
ny juxtaposing aspect of a non-Dharmic belief
system, theological stance, p=
hilosophy, ideology, or idea. In other words:
Hinduism versus X.

The goal =
of your paper must be to demonstratively establish the preeminence of
Sanat=
ana Dharma over the non-Dharmic philosophical proposition you are comparing=

it to. We are not interested in purely historical, hagiographical, philolo=
gical,
or needlessly abstract papers =96 but only papers that directly inte=
rface Sanatana
Dharma with modernity in a polemically engaged manner.

You =
can submit papers online at: http://dharmacivilization.com/submissions/

Th=
e Center for the Study of Dharma and Civilization (CSDC) is the very first
=
academic think tank of the Sanatana Dharma tradition ever created in Americ=
an
history. Established by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Ph.D.) in May of =
2002, the CSDC
brings together several of the most prominent Hindu scholars=
 in America with the
singular purpose of academically affirming the preemin=
ence of the philosophy,
practice and culture of Sanatana Dharma in the inte=
llectual realm.

Please share this important information.
