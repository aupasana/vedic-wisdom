Namaste,

Jai Ma!


I have a different view point. Let me write down as I s=
ee it, in point by point manner.

1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a li=
st of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd =
Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa De=
va himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mentio=
n that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says=
 all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being =
while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."

2. Of these various possible Avataras, =
10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and si=
gnificance across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which=
 were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive,=
 it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect o=
f Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were c=
omposed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tan=
tras]

3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, =
Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and K=
alki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence of thes=
e main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to th=
e amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf =
man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of this earth r=
epresented by Vamana's 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama mov=
ing around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna =
Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to be sepa=
rated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the various m=
anifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness and its =
development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and ev=
olution go hand in hand. That is Nature's grand design for life on earth.

=
4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the parable of these main=
 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worships say Matysa Avat=
ara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the na=
ture of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to an=
y depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-real=
ized in their own way and can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.
=


=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because the=
y represent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which soc=
iety can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the s=
tage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known h=
ow to transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a=
 constructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full=
 Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it=
 is static in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. A=
s per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita=
 in the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Rava=
na, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of th=
e Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most d=
ispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was
 t=
he Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharm=
a of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epi=
c, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the th=
ings as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding hi=
s own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama =
faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most di=
spassionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or pass=
ions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leade=
r must be!

Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. =
I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singul=
ar and constant detachment from situations, from people, from environment, =
from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to l=
eave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his villa=
ge-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for=
 him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village l=
ife and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reaso=
n with them, then he understood that they won't understand, he promised he =
will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later=
, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their=
 dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and=
 possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying th=
at he
 belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over hi=
m. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on=
 the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he s=
wiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bhur=
ishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and charlatan, Krs=
hna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as anoth=
er black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa i=
n the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very ne=
xt moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabhar=
ata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of d=
epression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective=
 of what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the gr=
eatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime
 spirit=
ual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. =
For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible=
. Neither the action nor the results belong to the instrument. When running=
 away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bhe=
ema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to hit Duryodhana below t=
he waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine=
 Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would ca=
use the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by =
the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously c=
onnected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situa=
tions in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if =
we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, w=
e get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a
 1000 headed d=
emon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Sh=
akti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we =
take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is ver=
y clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all =
the great characteristics of satwa, chief of which is self-control, as well=
 as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom=
, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna cre=
ates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shak=
en. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - m=
an, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affecte=
d any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most=
 trying situations.

6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But=
 I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realizatio=
n, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is=
 clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with=
 what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If n=
egation of this world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avat=
ars at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact =
on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or =
Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in =
the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in =
a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of In=
dia, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete a=
nd holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as in=
side of life.
 That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual p=
hilosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of revere=
nce and realization.

7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to =
mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside t=
he human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seeke=
rs. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - corres=
pond to the full power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the =
9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness=
 to explore and express itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. Th=
e lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars w=
ho represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of =
the sequence is yet to come.

8. I cannot comment on which graha would typi=
cally represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is=
 my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some dee=
p-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepresentation in this K=
ali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will=
 be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka =
- the stainless one. There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, =
the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and co=
mplete purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer d=
int of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this w=
orld and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at va=
rious points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating=
, won't even need that. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He wi=
ll be the only one
 capable enough to rectify the various errors and corrup=
tions that beset our age. 

Well, this is how I look at the story of Avatar=
as. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sang=
uine now that this is what is closer to truth.

Dasavataras!
 


=C2=A0 
Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
There was a discussion on =
Lord Vishnu's Dasavataras on a limited access forum on Facebook. A learned =
friend wrote that "Krshna is the God-man", "Previous Avatars are a build-up=
 to this stage" and "Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear=
 progression of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other =
upto Krshna".
=C2=A0
I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that =
Dasavatars of a "linear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna".

Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a per=
fected form.
=C2=A0
Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For=
 example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.=

=C2=A0
We also
 know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn=
, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive=
, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, =
patience/discipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment =
(respectively).
=C2=A0
Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of th=
at aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how t=
hat aspect operates.
=C2=A0
Lord Rama's story is a perfected example of how=
 soul operates. Lord Krishna's story is a perfected example of how mind ope=

Now, let us rememb=

in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these=
 are different manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifest=
s as these different aspects, it has different qualities and plays differen=
t roles. There is no comparison between them.
=C2=A0
We MAY focus on one as=
pect of us first, perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But=
, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these differen=

=C2=A0
Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind.=
 Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attri=
butes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes=
.
=C2=A0
Once mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, =
soul supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and=
 sees it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of th=
is individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning abi=
lity, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no des=
ires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and rec=
ords all of one's agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fru=
its later
 on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither d=
oing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of th=
e individualized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing thi=
ngs and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It see=
s that as its dharma and does it impassionately.
=C2=A0
Now, does this soun=
d exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witne=
ss supporting the play, may not seem interesting enough to some.
=C2=A0
On =
the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly purs=
uing those agendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind i=
s what keeps the individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for =
everything else in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doin=
g its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization go=
ing and brings in agendas and passion and even decides/affects
 every entit=
y's dharma. That way, mind is really the "boss" of the individualization. N=
o wonder Krishna's life appeals more to one who may be excited by this desc=
ription!

=C2=A0
Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspi=
ring, but let me put Rama's life in perspective.
=C2=A0
Rama's life demonst=
rates how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasi=
shtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his "dharma". He helped=
 Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment=
, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and hi=
s step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his fathe=
r, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself =
supported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Th=
ough he knew leaving Sita in the forest
 with Lakshmana and going after the=
 golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insis=
ted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the b=
attle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshm=
ana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation with no complai=
nts and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did=
 so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana=
 was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were=
 going to disappear with Ravana!
=C2=A0
Rama is a perfect example of a libe=
rated man with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one's dh=
arma arising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basical=
ly what soul does!

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
As another example, let us=
 look at Lord
 Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/=
discrimination operates.
=C2=A0
He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled t=
he entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qu=
alities.
=C2=A0
Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When=
 one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or a=
ttachment), one's discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppres=
sed. When wisdom fills one's entire consciousness, then demonic qualities a=
re completely suppressed.

=C2=A0
Please think about=
 the other avataras. The stories can be understood as perfect demonstration=
s of how various aspects of our consciousness operate, based on clues from =
Maharshi Parasara.
=C2=A0
Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate eac=
h of them separately. Of course, if you are more
 attracted to one of them,=
 please think about that avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL ca=
pable of relieving us from samsara.

wata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22,=
 Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatr=
eya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagaw=
ata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In=
 the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are =
amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is "swayam Bhagawan."</div><div sty=

0, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and sig=
nificance across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which =
were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, =
it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect of=
 Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were co=
mposed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tant=

 background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;">3. These 10/9 Avataras=
 have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vam=
ana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeab=
le connection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolu=
tion of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-anim=
al, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form wh=
o immediately takes possession of this earth represented by Vamana's 3 step=
s), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to th=
e Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this=
 indicates that spirituality is not to be separated into another world, but=
 is a progressive realization of the various manifestation and potentials t=
hat lie inherent in the consciousness and its development through various l=
ife-forms. Larger
 spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. Tha=
t is Nature's grand design for life on earth.</div><div style=3D"color: rgb=

able of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worshi=
ps say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the =
soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can l=
ead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vi=
shnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massive s=
piritual dynamos.<br></div><div style=3D"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16=

sp;5. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they rep=
resent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society =
can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage =
of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to=
 transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a cons=
tructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Satt=
wa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is s=
tatic in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per=
 the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in t=
he forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, w=
hich was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun=
 to Rama.
 At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispa=
ssionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was the Dh=
arma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of =
that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, an=
d I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things =
as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own=
 preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced=
 which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispass=
ionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions =
can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader mus=
t be!<br><br>Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth.=
 I am not taking his  supernatural feats into account. It is his singu=
lar and constant detachment from situations, from people, from environment,=

 from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to=
 leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his vil=
lage-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense f=
or him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village=
 life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to rea=
son with them, then he understood that they won't understand, he promised h=
e will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Lat=
er, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in the=
ir dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous a=
nd possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying =
that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over h=
im. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers o=
n the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was
 over, he=
 swiftly cut off Shishupala's head and was back into his poise. But when Bh=
urishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and charlatan, K=
rshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as ano=
ther black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa=
 in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very =
next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabh=
arata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of=
 depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespecti=
ve of what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the =
greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiri=
tual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga.=
 For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossibl=
e. Neither the action nor the results belong to the
 instrument. When runni=
ng away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising B=
heema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to hit Duryodhana below=
 the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divi=
ne Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would =
cause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come b=
y the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously=
 connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex sit=
uations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, i=
f we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling,=
 we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed =
demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya S=
hakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we=
 take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,
 the picture that emerges is v=
ery clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays al=
l the great characteristics of satwa, chief of which is self-control, as we=
ll as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita wh=
om, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna c=
reates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is sh=
aken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world -=
 man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affec=
ted any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the mo=
st trying situations.<br><br>6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this wo=
rld. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His re=
alization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void.=
 This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in t=
une with what either Rama or Krshna
 espoused. None of them negated this wo=
rld. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then why send so =
many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If the spiritua=
l impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not =
Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do the=
y fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana ind=
icate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in pa=
rts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be c=
omplete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as w=
ell as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spi=
ritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object o=
f reverence and realization.<br><br>7. The original literature of the Nath =
Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functio=
ns. 6 inside the human body
 and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most peo=
ple, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding =
Buddha - correspond to the full power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. =
Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow th=
e consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities, are =
9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the =
chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. An=
d the ninth of the sequence is yet to come.<br><br>8. I cannot comment on w=
hich graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS=
 says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one can=
not rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrep=
resentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not =
yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghor=
a books, Nishkalanka
 - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is=
 perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes liv=
ing in the full and complete purity and might and force and strength of the=
 Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opp=
osing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshn=
a used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. K=
alki, I am speculating, won't even need that. The white horse and that swor=
d is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the vari=
ous errors and corruptions that beset our age. <br><br>Well, this is how I =
look at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my view=
s, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth.<b=

te friends,<br> <br>There was a discussion on Lord Vishnu's Dasavatara=
s on a limited access forum on Facebook. A learned friend wrote that "Krshn=
a is the God-man", "Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage" and "Bud=
dha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of spiritua=
lity that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna".<br> <=
br>I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a "l=
inear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna".<br> <br>*  =
      *        =
*<br> <br>Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected =
form.<br> <br>Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For =
example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.<=
br> <br>We also
 know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, S=
aturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/=
drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being ha=
ppy, patience/discipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detach=
ment (respectively).<br> <br>Correspondingly, each avatara is an expre=
ssion of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an examp=
le of how that aspect operates.<br> <br>Lord Rama's story is a perfect=
ed example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna's story is a perfected exampl=
e of how mind operates. Lord Vamana's story is a perfected example of how w=
isdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha's story is a perfected exampl=
e of how energy/drive/initiative operates.<br> <br>*   =
     *        *<br>&=
nbsp;<br>Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, ener=
gy in us,
 learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline=
/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Self. =
However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has different q=
ualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.<br=
> <br>We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect it and then perf=
ect other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in t=
he end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparabl=
e and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.<br> <br>* =
       *      &=
nbsp; *<br> <br>One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may lik=
e the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by t=
he qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates=
, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story t=
hat
 demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter=
 of taste and subjective preference.<br> <br>*    =
    *        *<br> <=
br>Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a =
representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is =
the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.<br> <br>Once=
 mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, soul supports=
 the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as i=
ts dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individual=
ized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyme=
nt, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/=
likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of o=
ne's agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later
 on=
. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those ka=
rmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individuali=
zed consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and beget=
ting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its=
 dharma and does it impassionately.<br> <br>Now, does this sound excit=
ing? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supp=
orting the play, may not seem interesting enough to some.<br> <br>On t=
he other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursu=
ing those agendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is=
 what keeps the individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for e=
verything else in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing=
 its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization goi=
ng and brings in agendas and passion and even decides/affects
 every entity=
's dharma. That way, mind is really the "boss" of the individualization. No=
 wonder Krishna's life appeals more to one who may be excited by this descr=
iption!<br> <br>*        * &nb=
sp;      *<br> <br>Lord Krishna is obviously =
awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama's life in perspective.<br> <br>Rama=
's life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma =
Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his "dha=
rma". He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At =
the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his ste=
p-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. T=
hough his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degre=
es, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed his dharma imp=
assionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest
 with Lakshmana and =
going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately =
when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her a=
nd fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or=
 faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation =
with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed=
 Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma.=
 Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some sub=
jects that were going to disappear with Ravana!<br> <br>Rama is a perf=
ect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impassionatel=
y discharges one's dharma arising from the momentum of karmas before libera=
tion. THAT is basically what soul does!<br> <br>*   &nb=
sp;    *        *<br>&nbs=
p;<br>As another example, let us look at Lord
 Vaamana. His story is a perf=
ect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates.<br> <br>He wa=
s born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a ch=
aritable demon king with many great qualities.<br> <br>Wisdom/discrimi=
nation makes one humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tai=
nted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one's discriminatio=
n is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one's en=
tire consciousness, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed.<br>&n=
bsp;<br>*        *   &nbs=
p;    *<br> <br>Please think about the other avataras. =
The stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspe=
cts of our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara.<br=
> <br>Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separ=
ately. Of course, if you are more
 attracted to one of them, please think a=
bout that avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of reliev=
ing us from samsara.<br> <br>*      &nbs=
