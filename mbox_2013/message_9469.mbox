does anyone know...who what and why we are her???.....so far I guess most o=
f us are going with the idea that some kind of primordial consciousness exp=
ressed duality....and projected ...created...or manifested what we know of =
as reality....and we presume a spark of it is us...so to speak....and it go=
es through a long process to merge back with the whole...and its like the j=
ourney never took place.....call it the cosmic dream if u will...

so we co=
nceive of duality as shiva and or sakthi..or yin and yang if u will....and =
at a certain moment in our existence...we feel some kind of urge to transce=
nd.....and we try all methods to get there....

now all I know is.....somet=
hing exists...I cant say within or without me...I don't know even what me d=
enotes..there is a body....and what could be labelled a mind....something t=
hat proceses thoughts and emotions...but all if it is running bye itself...=
.there doesn't seem to be an entity or what not in charge.....observe close=
ly and u will get what I,m saying.......

now I guess the question is...wha=
t is the gist of this so called spiritual path???......could it not be that=
 like snowflakes of nature...each one of us is no more than a momentary exp=
ression of consciousness?....why do we assume reincarnation to be true???

=
to whom do we worship???and what exactly does worship mean???and who is doi=
ng the worship?.....

repeating some mystical mantra or name of something t=
hat obviously cant be encapsulated in sound is considered by many to be spi=
rituality..when obviously the mind that is repeating and running around at =
the same time is both one and the same...the whole process seems to me like=
 a mind game....and we feel good about theses games....like we have done so=
mething to get 1 step closer to divinity..can we get closer????isn't the ce=
sspool of sludge we make in the morning just as divine....and all the time =
in the colon with us???....those who get the last statement would get it...=
the rest plse ignore...

and how come we have this idea that by japa,ing a =
gazillion times some sari clad woman on a tiger is going to appear in a vis=
ion or in front of us and make our existence free of suffering..and basical=
ly make everything O.K.?....

too many tamil movies perhaps?...u can also s=
ubstitute the sari clad woman for a man in blue with 4 arms...or a young st=
ud on a peacock...ur preference....

and all for what?most of us are truly =
at the end of the day motivated by some kind of gain...touch ur heart and t=
ell me it is not so???no carrot in front of the donkey it wont move......

=
tell me honestly....how can u have love for something u don't know and have=
 not experienced in any way???your bakthi is probably something u conjured =
up in ur head....and at best....an expression of ur existantial longings...=
.

we are all lonely and miserable at heart....and add to that the sufferin=
g of being human.....

so shall end this rant...with the question I began w=
ith....what the f is going on guys???who what and where r we???????????????=
?????????????????????that is the question isn't it....and maybe also why...=
...the day we stop asking,and accept someone elses idea as truth.....we sto=
pped seeking.

the search isn't over till the fat cosmic lady sings........=
god bless.......whatever that means..............
