Hello Friends!

Am interested in doing Shiva Homam as per manual by Shri Narasimha.

Instead of the mantras prescribed there, I wanted to do the Rudram+Chamakam
.

So, Do I just chant and say 'Swaha' after every Anuvaka?

Is  the intonation of Swaha changing with every ending or is it the same.?

Or are there more things to be kept in mind?

Thank You,
Siddharth
