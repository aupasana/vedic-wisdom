Namaste Guruji,

In Art of Living there is a process called as eternity pro=
cess by which we can know our past 7 life's. One of my close friend & teach=
er of Art of living went through the process found it very useful. He had a=
 very severe head ache since childhood & he had tried everything but no med=
icines worked to bring down his pain. When he went through the eternity pro=
cess he saw that in one of his life he was shot dead by a bullet in his hea=
d. After knowing this his head ache reduced considerably. For going through=
 this process we need to practice sudarshan kriya regularly for 60 days. I =
also went through the process but i did not remember anything, but i felt v=
ery very peaceful when i was going through the process.

Regards

Vinayak

 Therefore
 their idea of reincarnation
 is very different. I=

There are many mantras, kavachas and prayers to shield from the vibrations =

 and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul =
will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a role=

 where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shine=

Atmah.
 Therefore
 their idea of reincarnation
 is very different. It is li=
ke an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together
 to give =
the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegrated a=
nd and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coa=
lesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can simu=
ltaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part.  =
 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to ha=
ve the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while another par=
t of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama=
 may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his energy =
of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnating in=
 another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with their =
philosophy.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">Those philosophies which b=
elieved in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a co=
nstant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of
 debts/balances - r=
na. Hence
 rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. The fin=
al aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move into a Su=
preme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of any final=
 importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciation of l=
ife and its processes.<br clear=3D"none"><br clear=3D"none">But the old Ved=
antic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at death=
 unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to another and th=
e chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul's influe=
nce on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for =
this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul - for=
 no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *conscio=
usly* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life. =

not the ultimate aim, it=
 is only one among many possibilities.  If  moving into a state

of complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim,
 t=

 lif=
e-actions. </span>The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to=
 only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnab=
andhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the soul to un=
furl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic =
equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-tim=
e algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundred=

 actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he h=
