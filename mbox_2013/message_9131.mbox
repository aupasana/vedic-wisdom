No textual corruption=
 in Vedas

(READ THIS CAREFULLY IF YOU HAVE QUERY ON HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT =
VEDAS ARE
UNALTERABLE SINCE AGES. We are thankful to several scholars whose=
 source we
could not track but whose works were used for creation of this a=
rticle.)

*On how Vedas have been preserved in pristine state, here are som=
e
analytical, unbiased and objective pointers. We provide here some details=

on how Vedas have been preserved so purely and how its not possible to
alt=
er even a single syllable. No other text in the world can claim to have
suc=
h fail-safe method of preservation.*

Our forefathers devised a number of m=
ethods to preserve the unwritten Vedas
in their original form, to safeguard=
 their tonal and verbal purity.
*Swara Protection of Vedas*

They laid down=
 rules to make sure that not even a syllable was changed in
chanting, not e=
ven a svara was altered. In this way they ensured that the
full benefits we=
re derived from intoning the mantras. They fixed the time
taken to enunciat=
e each syllable of a word and called this unit of time or
time interval =93=
matra=94.

How we must regulate our breathing to produce the desired vibrat=
ion in a
particular part of our body so that the sound of the syllable enun=
ciated is
produced in its pure form: this science is explained in the Vedan=
ga called
Shiksha.

If you see a Vedic mantra in the Samhita, you would fin=
d certain marks
after syllables. For example see the following image:

<htt=
p://cdn.agniveer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rigveda2.gif>

These marks =
called Swara Chinha depict the method of pronunciation. These
markers ensur=
e that not even a single syllable can be altered from any
Vedic mantra.

In=
 traditional gurukuls, pupils memorize the locations of these Swaras
throug=
h specific hand or head movements. Thus you would see them moving
their han=
ds or head while reciting the Vedic mantras. And if a slightest
error in Sw=
ara is found in recitation, they would easily pin-point it.

Further, diffe=
rent gurukuls specialize in studying different Patha methods
(explained aft=
er this section) would still have the same Swara system in
place, thereby e=
asily tracking accuracy of each Vedic mantra to last
syllable.

   *Paatha Protection of Vedas*

A remarkable method was devis=
ed to make sure that words and syllables are
not altered. According to this=
 the words of a mantra are strung together in
different patterns like =93va=
kya=94, =93pada=94, =93karma=94, =93jata=94, =93mala=94, =93sikha=94,
=93re=
kha=94, =93dhvaja=94, =93danda=94, =93ratha=94, =93ghana=94. These represen=
t different
permutations of reciting words of a Vedic Mantra.

We call some=
 Vedic scholars =93ghanapathins=94, don=92t we? It means they have
learnt t=
he chanting of the scripture up to the advanced stage called
=93ghana=94. =
=93Pathin=94 means one who has learnt the =93patha=94. When we listen to
gh=
anapathins chant the ghana, we notice that they intone a few words of a
man=
tra in different ways, back and forth.

It is most delightful to the ear, l=
ike nectar poured into it. The sonority
natural to Vedic chanting is enhanc=
ed in ghana. Similarly, in the other
methods of chanting like karma, jata, =
sikha, mala, and so on the intonation
is nothing less than stately, indeed =
divine.

The chief purpose of such methods, as already mentioned, is to ens=
ure that
not even a syllable of a mantra is altered to the slightest extent=
. The
words are braided together, so to speak, and recited back and forth.
=

In =93vakyapatha=94 and =93samhitapatha=94 the mantras are chanted in the =
original
(natural) order, with no special pattern adopted. In the vakyapath=
a some
words of the mantras are joined together in what is called =93sandhi=
=94. There
is sandhi in Tamil also; but in English the words are not joined=
 together.
You have many examples of sandhi in the Tevaram, Tiruvachakam, T=
irukkural,
Divyaprabandham and other Tamil works. Because of the sandhi the=
 individual
words are less recognisable in Sanskrit than even in Tamil.

In=
 padapatha each word in a mantra is clearly separated from the next. It
com=
es next to samhitapatha and after it is kramapatha. In this the first
word =
of a mantra is joined to the second, the second to the third, the
third to =
the fourth, and so on, until we come to the final word.

In old inscription=
s in the South we find the names of some important people
of the place conc=
erned mentioned with the appellation =93kramavittan=94 added
to the names. =
=93Kramavittan=94 is the Tamil form of =93kramavid=94 in the same way
as =
=93Vedavittan=94 is of =93Vedavid=94. We learn from the inscriptions that s=
uch
Vedic scholars were to be met throughout South India in past.

*(Note t=
hat South India has a great contribution in preserving the Vedic
traditions=
 during a critical long era of history when North India was
occupied in str=
uggling for survival from brutal attacks of barbaric
invaders and their pro=
genies from West Asia. We find the tradition of Vedic
gurukuls uninterrupte=
d even till today.)*

In jata patha, the first word of the mantra is chante=
d with the second,
then the order is reversed-the second is chanted with th=
e first. Then,
again, the first word is chanted with the second, then the s=
econd with the
third, and so on. In this way the entire mantra is chanted, =
going back and
forth.

In shikhapatha the pattern consists of three words o=
f a mantra, instead of
the two of jata.

Ghanapatha is more difficult than =
these. There are four types in this
method. Here also the words of a mantra=
 are chanted back and forth and
there is a system of permutation and combin=
ation in the chanting. To
explain all of it would be like conducting a clas=
s of arithmetic.

We take all kinds of precautions in the laboratory, don=
=92t we, to protect a
life-saving drug? The sound of the Vedas guards the w=
orld against all ills.
Our forefathers devised these methods of chanting to=
 protect the sound of
our scripture against change and distortion.

Samhita=
patha and padapatha are called =93prakrtipatha=94 (natural way of
chanting)=
 since the words are recited only once and in their natural order.
The othe=
r methods belong to the =93vikrtipatha=94 (artificial way of chanting)
cate=
gory. (In krama, though the words do not go in the strict natural order
of =
one-two-three, there is no reversal of the words-the first after the
second=
, the second after the third, and so on. So we cannot describe it
fully as =
vikrtipatha). Leaving out krama, there are eight vikrti patterns
and they a=
re recounted in verse to be easily remembered.

*Jata mala sikha rekha dhva=
ja dando ratho ghanah*

*Ityastau-vikrtayah proktah kramapurva maharsibhih*=


* *All these different methods of chanting are meant to ensure the tonal
=
and verbal purity of the Vedas for all time. In pada the words in their
nat=
ural order, in krama two words together, in jata the words going back
and f=
orth. The words tally in all these methods of chanting and there is
the ass=
urance that the original form will not be altered.

The benefits to be deri=
ved from the different ways of chanting are given in
this verse.

*Samhitap=
athamatrena yatphalam procyate budhaih*

*Padu tu dvigunam vidyat krame tu =
ca caturgunam*

*Varnakrame satagunam jatayantu sahasrakam*

Considering th=
at our ancestors took so much care to make sure that the
sound of the Vedas=
 did not undergo the slightest change, it is futile for
modern researchers =
to try to establish the date of our scriptures by
finding out how the sound=
s of its words have changed.

What more, today different schools of Vedas e=
xist in south who memorize
vedas in different means, as explained above. An=
d if you compare the
mantras memorized by different schools, you will find =
variation of not a
single syllable. Remember we are talking lacs of syllabl=
es!! And still no
variations. Thats why even Max Muller, a bitter critic of=
 Vedic philosophy,
could also not help but state that such a foolproof meth=
od of preservation
is among the greatest wonders and miracles of the world!=

An example of Ghana Patha

(Reference Source: http://www.krishnamurthys.co=
m/profvk/index.html )

This example gives a faint glimpse of how the vedas =
in spite of its massive
content, (Rg veda and Yajur veda have 153,826 words=
 and 109,287 words
respectively) have been preserved from generation to gen=
eration though it
was all done only by oral transmission.

We give below a =
sentence from the Yajur veda, obviously without the svaras,
in its original=
 samhita pATha form, also its pada text and then the order
of the words in =
the ghana recital. A pundit who has learnt the Ghana
recital of one complet=
e veda (he takes thirteen years of whole time work to
reach that stage) is =
called a ghana-pAThi.

First we give the rule for the ghana mechanics of re=
citation:

If the original order of words in a sentence is:

1/2/3/4/5

The=
 ghana recital goes as follows:

12/21/123/321/123/

23/32/234/432/234/

34=
/43/345/543/345/

45/54/45/

5 iti 5.
Example:

*samhita sentence:*

eshAm =
purushANAm-eshAm paSUnAM mA bher-mA ro-mo eshAM kincanAmamat //

*Meaning:*=


Oh God! Do not frighten these our men and animals, may none of these peri=
sh
or lack health.

*pada text:*

eshAM/purushANAM/eshAM/paSUnAM/mA/bheH/mA=
/arah/mo-iti-mo/eshAM/

kim/chana/Amamat/Amamad-ity-Amamat/

*Note: The nin=
th break here and the last break are the results of a
technicality which yo=
u may ignore, unless you want to specialise in this
art.*

Now for the ghan=
a recital(without the svaras; with the svaras it would be a
delight to hear=
). The recital is a non-stop recital, except for a
half-pause at the place =
shown by / . There is no break anywhere else. The
hyphens shown are for req=
uirements of those who can decipher the grammar ;
they will not be reflecte=
d in the recital.

eshAM-purushANAM-purushANAm-eshAm-eshAM purushANAm-eshAm=
-eshAm

purushANAm-eshAm-eshAm purushANAm-eshAM /

purushANAm-eshAm-eshAM p=
urushANAM purushANAm-eshAM paSUnAM

paSunAm-eshAm purushANAm purushANAm-esh=
AM paSUnAM /

eshAM paSUnAM paSUnAm-eshAm-eshAM paSUnAm-mA mA paSUnAm-eshAm=
-eshAM
paSUnAm-mA /

paSUnAm-mA mA paSUnAM paSUnAm-mA bher-bher-mA paSUnAM =
paSUnAm-mA bheH /

mA bher-bher-mAmA bher-mAmA bher-mAmA bher-mA /

bher-mA=
mA bher-bher-mAro aro mA bher-bhermA araH /

mA ro aro mAmA ro momo aro mA =
mA ro mo /

aro mo mo aro aro mo eshAm-eshAm mo aro aro mo eshAM /

mo eshA=
m-eshAm mo mo eshAm kim kim-eshAm-mo mo eshAm kim / mo iti mo/

eshAm kimki=
m-eshAmeshAM kim-cana cana kim-esham-eshaM kim-cana /

kim cana cana kim ki=
m canAmamad-Amamat cana kim kim canAmamat /

canAmamad-Amamac-cana canAmama=
t /

Amamad-ityAmamat /

*The significant point to note here is that in San=
skrit the order of words
does not matter. *

If you do it with an English s=
entence like:

* Rama vanquished Ravana*

It will go like this:

Rama vanqu=
ished vanquished Rama Rama vanquished Ravana =91Ravana vanquished
Rama=92 R=
ama vanquished Ravana =85 and so on.

You can see the absurdity now. In San=
skrit this absurdity would not arise.
So a ghana recitation is supposed to =
be equivalent to a recitation of the
veda 13 times and to that extent is mu=
ltifold fruitful! The 13 is because
except for two beginning and two ending=
 words in a sentence the others are
repeated 13 times. (You can check it wi=
th the word paSUnAM above).

To summarize:

All the Veda Mantras have been preserve=
d (till today) (at least three
millenia according to western calculations) =
without ever putting them into
writing. This must be considered a great lin=
gusitic achievement of which
India can be legitimately proud. The literatur=
e, which consists of diverse
poetical and prose compositions were simply le=
arnt by rote, the training
being given by the teacher saying each word or c=
ombinations of words once
with the proper incantations *(called svaras)* an=
d the students saying it
twice. They then learnt to recite it in continuous=
 form along with the
incantations. The continuous recitation of a vedic tex=
t is called *samhita
pAtha*. The accuracy of the text is preserved by resor=
ting to an artifice
of nine different techniques or modes of recital.

The =
first is the *pada pATha*, which simply recites each word of the text
separ=
ately; pada means word; pAtha means reading.The euphonic changes that
occur=
s from the samhita pATha to the pada pATha is itself very technical
(Sanskr=
it grammar would be crucial here) but makes sense.

In addition, there are =
eight other techniques of recitation, the sole
purpose of each is to preser=
ve the original samhita text without the loss
or addtion of a single syllab=
le or svara. The svaras are a significant part
of the recital of the vedas,=
 whatever be the mode. The eight modes are
called:

krama, jaTa, ghana, mAl=
A, ratha, ShikhA, daNDa and rekhA.

In each mode the order of recital of th=
e words is specified as a particular
permutation of their original sequence=
.

All these elaborate and sophisticated approaches have ensured that the
f=
irst texts of humanity =96 The Veda Samhitas =96 are available to us today =
in
exactly the same pure original form.

listen to ghanapathins chant the ghana, w=
e notice that they intone a few
 words of a mantra in different ways, back =
and forth.</p>
<p>It is most=A0delightful to the ear, like nectar poured in=
to it. The 
sonority natural to Vedic chanting is enhanced in ghana. Simila=
rly, in 
the other methods of chanting like karma, jata, sikha, mala, and s=
o on 
the intonation is nothing less than stately, indeed divine.</p>
<p>Th=
e chief=A0purpose of such methods, as already mentioned, is to ensure
 that=
 not even a syllable of a mantra is altered to the slightest 
extent. The w=
ords are braided together, so to speak, and recited back 
and forth.</p>
<p=
>In =93vakyapatha=94 and =93samhitapatha=94 the mantras are chanted in the =

original (natural) order, with no special pattern adopted. In the 
vakyapa=
tha some words of the mantras are joined together in what is 
called =93san=
dhi=94. There is sandhi in Tamil also; but in English the words
 are not jo=
ined together. You have many examples of sandhi in the 
Tevaram, Tiruvachak=
am, Tirukkural, Divyaprabandham and other Tamil 
works. Because of the sand=
hi the individual words are less recognisable 
in Sanskrit than even in Tam=
il.</p>
<p>In padapatha each word in a mantra is clearly separated from the=
 
next. It comes next to=A0samhitapatha and after it is kramapatha. In this=
 
the first word of a mantra is joined to the second, the second to the 
th=
ird, the third to the fourth, and so on, until we come to the final 
word.<=
/p>
<p>In old inscriptions in the South we find the names of some important=
 
people of the place concerned mentioned with the appellation 
=93kramavit=
tan=94 added to the names. =93Kramavittan=94 is the Tamil form of 
=93krama=
vid=94 in the same way as =93Vedavittan=94 is of =93Vedavid=94. We learn 
f=
rom the inscriptions that such Vedic scholars were to be met throughout
 So=
uth India in past.</p>
<p><em>(Note that South India has a great contributi=
on in preserving the
 Vedic traditions during a critical long era of histor=
y when North India
 was occupied in struggling for survival from brutal att=
acks of barbaric
 invaders and their progenies from West Asia. We find the =
tradition of 
Vedic gurukuls uninterrupted even till today.)</em></p>
<p>In=
 jata patha, the first word of the mantra is chanted with the 
second, then=
 the order is reversed-the second is chanted with the first.
 Then, again, =
the first word is chanted with the second, then the second
 with the third,=
 and so on. In this way the entire mantra is=A0chanted, 
going back and for=
th.</p>
<p>In shikhapatha the pattern consists of three words of a mantra, =
instead of the two of jata.</p>
<p>Ghanapatha is more difficult than these.=
 There are four types in this
 method. Here also the words of a mantra are =
chanted back and forth and 
there is a system of permutation and combinatio=
n in the chanting. To 
explain all of it would be like conducting a class o=
f arithmetic.</p>
<p>We take all kinds of precautions in the laboratory, do=
n=92t we, to 
protect a life-saving drug? The sound of the Vedas guards the=
 world 
against all ills. Our forefathers devised these methods of chanting=
 to 
protect the sound of our scripture against change and distortion.</p>
=
<p>Samhitapatha and padapatha are called =93prakrtipatha=94 (natural way of=
 
chanting) since the words are recited only once and in their natural 
ord=
er. The other methods belong to the =93vikrtipatha=94 (artificial way of 
c=
hanting) category. (In krama, though the words do not go in the strict 
nat=
ural order of one-two-three, there is no reversal of the words-the 
first a=
fter the second, the second after the third, and so on. So we 
cannot descr=
ibe it fully as vikrtipatha). Leaving out krama, there are 
eight vikrti pa=
tterns and they are recounted in verse to be easily 
remembered.</p>
<p><em=
>Jata mala sikha rekha dhvaja dando ratho ghanah</em></p>
<p><em>Ityastau-v=
ikrtayah proktah kramapurva maharsibhih</em></p>
<p><em> </em>All these dif=
ferent methods of chanting are meant to ensure
 the tonal and verbal purity=
 of the Vedas for all time. In pada the 
words in their natural order, in k=
rama two words together, in jata the 
words going back and forth. The words=
 tally in all these methods of 
chanting and there is the assurance that th=
e original form will not be 
altered.</p>
<p>The benefits to be derived fro=
m the different ways of chanting are given in this verse.</p>
<p><em>Samhit=
apathamatrena yatphalam procyate budhaih</em></p>
<p><em>Padu tu dvigunam v=

<p><em>Varnakrame satagunam jatayantu=

<p>Considering that our ancestors took so much care to=
 make sure that 
the sound of the Vedas did not undergo the slightest chang=
e, it is 
futile for modern researchers to try to establish the date of our=
 
scriptures by finding out how the sounds of its words have changed.</p>
<=
p>What more, today different schools of Vedas exist in south who 
memorize =
vedas in different means, as explained above. And if you 
compare the mantr=
as memorized by different schools, you will find 
variation of not a single=
 syllable. Remember we are talking lacs of 
syllables!! And still no variat=
ions. Thats why even Max Muller, a=A0bitter
 critic of Vedic philosophy, co=
uld also not help but state that such a 
foolproof method of preservation i=
s among the greatest wonders and 
miracles of the world!</p>
<h1>An example=
 of Ghana Patha</h1>
<p>(Reference Source: <a href=3D"http://www.krishnamur=

</a> )</p>
<p>This example gives a faint glimpse of how the vedas in spite =
of its 
massive content, (Rg veda and Yajur veda have 153,826 words and 109=
,287 
words respectively) have been preserved from generation to generation=
 
though it was all done only by oral transmission.</p>
<p>We give below a =
sentence from the Yajur veda, obviously without the 
svaras, in its origina=
l samhita pATha form, also its pada text and then 
the order of the words i=
n the ghana recital. A pundit who has learnt the
 Ghana recital of one comp=
lete veda (he takes thirteen years of whole 
time work to reach that stage)=
 is called a ghana-pAThi.</p>
<p>First we give the rule for the ghana mecha=
nics of recitation:</p>
<p>If the original order of words in a sentence is:=
</p>
<p>1/2/3/4/5</p>
<p>The ghana recital goes as follows:</p>
<p>12/21/12=
3/321/123/</p>
<p>23/32/234/432/234/</p>
<p>34/43/345/543/345/</p>
<p>45/54=
/45/</p>
<p>5 iti 5.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p><strong>samhita sentence:</st=
rong></p>
<p>eshAm purushANAm-eshAm paSUnAM mA bher-mA ro-mo eshAM kincanAm=

<p><strong>Meaning:</strong></p>
<p>Oh God! Do not frighten the=

<p>Now for the ghana recital(without the svaras; with the svaras it

<em>The significant point to note here is that in Sanskrit the order of wor=
ds does not matter. </em></p>
<p><span style=3D"text-decoration:underline">=
If you do it with an English sentence like:</span></p>
<p><strong><em> Rama=
 vanquished Ravana</em></strong></p>
<p>It will go like this:</p>
<p>Rama v=
anquished vanquished Rama Rama vanquished Ravana =91Ravana vanquished Rama=
=92 Rama vanquished Ravana =85 and so on.</p>
<p>You can see the absurdity =
now. In Sanskrit this absurdity would not 
arise. So a ghana recitation is =
supposed to be equivalent to a 
recitation of the veda 13 times and to that=
 extent is multifold 
fruitful! The 13 is because except for two beginning =
and two 
ending=A0words in a sentence the others are repeated 13 times. (Yo=
u can

To summarize:</h1>
<p>All the Veda Mantras have been preserved (till today)=
 (at least three
 millenia according to western calculations) without ever =
putting them 
into writing. This must be considered a great lingusitic achi=
evement of 
which India can be legitimately proud. The literature, which co=
nsists of
 diverse poetical and prose compositions were simply learnt by ro=
te, 
the=A0training being given by the teacher saying each word or combinat=
ions
 of words once with the proper incantations <strong>(called svaras)</s=
trong>
 and the students saying it twice. They then learnt to recite it in =

continuous form along with the incantations. The continuous recitation 
of=
 a vedic text is called <strong>samhita pAtha</strong>. The accuracy of the=
 text is preserved by resorting to an artifice of nine different techniques=
 or modes of recital.</p>
<p>The first is the <strong>pada pATha</strong>, =
which simply recites 
each word of the text separately; pada means word; pA=
tha means 
reading.The euphonic changes that occurs from the samhita pATha =
to the 
pada pATha is itself very technical (Sanskrit grammar would be cruc=
ial 
here) but makes sense.</p>
<p>In addition, there are eight other techn=
iques of recitation,=A0the sole
 purpose of each is to preserve the origina=
l samhita text without the 
loss or addtion of a single syllable or svara. =
The svaras are a 
significant part of the recital of the vedas, whatever be=
 the mode. The 
eight modes are called:</p>
<p>krama, jaTa, ghana, mAlA, ra=
tha, ShikhA, daNDa and rekhA.</p>
<p>In each mode the order of recital of t=
he words is specified as a particular permutation of their original sequenc=
e.</p>
<p>All these elaborate and sophisticated approaches have ensured tha=
t 
the first texts of humanity =96 The Veda Samhitas =96 are available to u=
s 
today in exactly the same pure original form.</p>
