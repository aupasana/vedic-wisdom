Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
I will be very blunt. If someone is worried about the t=
roubles given by Rahu and wants relief, one is most likely not ready for th=
e worship of any Mahavidya, let alone Mother Chhinnamasta (one who is holdi=
ng her own cut off head that is drinking a stream of blood coming from her =
own cut throat along with her two associates who drink 2 other streams from=
 her throat!).
=C2=A0
I have said it before, but it's worth saying again. M=
ahavidya means supreme wisdom. Mahavidyas are highly specific aspects of di=
vine that give a sublime understanding of some aspect of Self, to take one =
closer to liberation. Going to them for relief from mundane problems is lik=
e going to Dalai Lama to complain about leaves coming into your lawn from a=
 neighbor's house. After all, he may say "I am sorry for you" but not do an=
ything about it. Go back to him when you are more interested in Dharma & Se=
lf!

=C2=A0
For troubles given by Rahu, there are simpler solutions. There =
are other *general purpose* forms of divine that are not any inferior to Ma=
havidyas but still applicable to simple mundane problems.
=C2=A0
If you lik=
e Mother, worship Ma Durga with her 108 name prayer or Durga Sooktam or sim=
ple mantra "om dum durgAyai namaH". If you like Vishnu, worship Balaji with=
 any prayer or simple 8-akshari (om namo venkateshAya) or 12-akshari (om na=
mo bhagavate venkateshAya). If you like Shiva, worship Nageshwara with any =
prayer or simple "om namashshivAya namo nAgeshvarAya".

=C2=A0

All these a=
re far more appropriate than worshipping Chhinnamasta.Pray to them to relie=
ve you of your Rahu troubles so that you can progress materially and spirit=
ually 
and do your dharma well. Whichever mantra or prayer you do, the key =
is 
to spend a good amount of time on it (e.g. an hour everyday). Just as 
=
one cannot move a one ton rock with a stick, remedy has to be 
commensurate=
 with the heaviness of karmas it is trying to manipulate.
=C2=A0
Best regar=
ds,
Narasimha
