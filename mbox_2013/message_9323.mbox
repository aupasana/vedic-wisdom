Namaste Sir,
=A0
When rishis were doing tapas, apsaras were sent to test th=
em and disturb their focus. Whether it's Pururava or Vishwamitra, they did =
not *seek* the company of Apsaras. They just succumbed to the temptation wh=
en Urvashi and Menaka came to them unsought.
=A0
Your case is different. Fr=
om what I understand, you are *seeking* the "companionship" of an Apsara. I=
 am not sure if the mantra and sadhana you are looking at is suitable for t=
hat. I am not even sure if you can find any mantra for such a purpose.

=A0=
Just as you can befriend a beautiful woman on earth seeing her as a mother =
or sister and do great things to please her with absolutely no selfish sens=
uous interest, you can try to befriend and please any celestial beauties al=
so with no selfish sensual interests. In fact, the mantra you mentioned sou=
nds to be of that type.

=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =
*
=A0
In any case, if one has a such a strong desire to have the "companion=
ship" of a celestial nymph, that may automatically happen when (IF) one for=
gets that desire completely and starts to make tremendous spiritual progres=
s (in this life or another one).
=A0
If an Apsara comes to one playing not =
a Mother, but a companion, who can resist? Even Vishwamitra couldn't!

=A0P=
lease remember one basic rule: EVERY obstacle you find in your path now and=
 resent having to deal with, was something you either threw in someone else=
's path or something you deeply wished for yourself but could not get. If y=
ou can, get a grip on your uncontrolled desires and stop throwing things ar=
ound in others' paths. Both will cause problems when you least expect it or=
 want it!

=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
BTW, the=
re are many offerings made to several Gandharvas and Apsaras with Veda mant=
ras in "Jayadi homam" that is included at the beginning of uttarangam in tr=
aditional long homas. Of course, those mantras do not mention Rambha, Urava=
shi, Menaka, Tilottama etc, who are more popular in folklore. The list of G=
andharvas and associated Apsaras is instructive. For example, Agni (fire) i=
s taken as a Gandharva and Oshadhis (curative properties or herbs) as his A=
psaras; Surya (Sun) is taken as a Gandharva and Marichis (particles/specks =
of light/lustre) as his Apsaras; Chandra (Moon - mind) is taken as a Gandha=
rva and Nakshatras (stars - keepers of karmas) as his Apsaras.
=A0
Interest=
ing one is that offerings are made to kAma (desire), a Gandharva, and to Aa=
dhis, his Apsaras!! While vyAdhi (vi+Adhi) means a physical disease, Adhi i=
s a mental disease/agony/disrurbance! Ayurveda talks about how vyAdhi arise=
s from Adhi. When the handsome Gandharva of desire enters your mind, he com=
es accompanied by the beautiful nymphs of mental agitation and agony..
=A0
=
Now, that's some imagery for one's "pursuit" of Apsaras! ;-)

=A0Best regar=
ds,

Narasimha
