A Vedic=
 Critique of Marxism
By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya


"If you can cut the=
 people off from their history, then they can be easily persuaded." - Karl =
Marx (1818-1883)

Marxism is arguably the most monstrously destructive and =
morally reprehensible worldview the world has ever known. The perpetual vio=
lence that has been instigated by Marxist movements, totalitarian Communist=
 dictatorships, bloody guerrilla wars, and terrorist bloodshed has been res=
ponsible for more deaths and suffering during the twentieth century than an=
y other rival ideology of that era. Marxism has led to the destruction of c=
ultures, the dehumanization and misery of large segments of the global popu=
lation, and the degeneration of the human spirit. Marxism is an atheistic a=
nd materialistic philosophy that views human beings as purely mechanistic, =
characterless and utilitarian automatons. For Marxists, human persons are t=
o be reduced, both philosophically and in practice, to nothing more than so=
ulless and bland laborers, whose existence only has meaning in direct propo=
rtion to their degree of utility by, and enslavement to, the state.  

Karl=
 Marx (1818-1883) was a German citizen of Jewish descent who in his youth h=
ad been interested in the views of the German idealist philosopher and theo=
logian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831). Though Hegel's philosophi=
cal system was theistic, and most of his followers at that time were themse=
lves primarily religious individuals, Marx's introduction to Hegel's though=
t was via the Young Hegelians, a group dedicated to misusing Hegel's philos=
ophical methods to undermine and eradicate religious thought itself, rather=
 than uphold it. The two main leaders of the Young Hegelians were Ludwig Fe=
uerbach (1804-1872) and Bruno Bauer (1809-1882).

Karl Marx had initially (=
pre-1844) subscribed to the Feuerbachian program of the critique of religio=
n. While he continued to employ the notion of a philosophical anthropology =
- the attempt to discern the human meaning behind every experience - he wen=
t further than Ludwig Feuerbach with his attempt to perform a critique of p=
olitical economy. In the following section, we will briefly examine what le=
d Marx to attempt such a critique, and talk about the ways in which politic=
al economy is thoroughly resistant to such a Marxist critique.  

Fueurbach=
 and the Young Hegelians felt that the very apex of both the philosophical =
and the theological enterprises had been achieved by Hegelianism and German=
 Lutheranism, respectively. Thus, in their monumentally insular view, the e=
nd of the philosophic enterprise had suddenly commenced in their lifetime.[=
1]  Now, the only project left was the creation of a philosophical anthropo=
logy - an attempt to show that all philosophical ideas were dependent upon =
what is essentially human in the purely biologically behavioral sense. Once=
 a general account of humanity would be attained, so their belief went, the=
n such an account could be applied to all things. The primary tool of this =
project was the use of the process of criticism, which would purportedly re=
veal the conditions for the very possibility of any object under observatio=
n.  

The Young Hegelians, including Feuerbach and Marx, had applied this p=
rocess of critique to the nature of the theology of the so-called Right Heg=
elians, who were primarily Lutheran theologians loyal to Hegel's theistic p=
hilosophical underpinnings. Feuerbach, specifically, felt that religion was=
 merely an unreal projection of essential, alienated humanity. Furthermore,=
 for Feuerbach, God was no more than the construction of human beings, and =
actually represented the conceptual personification of what were in actuali=
ty very human traits. By critiquing God and religion, Feuerbach thought, a =
greater knowledge of human beings could be attained. Marx would later ferve=
ntly agree with this general premise.  

While Feuerbach felt that there wa=
s at least a trans-historical human essence, however, Marx felt that such a=
n idea was too much of a concession to the "metaphysical", and that man's e=
ssence was only ever revealed under real world, materialist conditions. Hum=
an beings, for Marx, are in essence, primordially, producers and makers. Wo=
rk, for Marx, was both the raison d'=EAtre and essential attributive nature=
 of the human person. Therefore, on Marx's account, self-actualization cons=
isted in nothing more than having the freedom to perform meaningful work. P=
roduction, for Marx, was labor that is transformative towards creating a ce=
rtain outcome, a praxis. Political economy was a body of theories formulate=
d by the classical economists (such as Adam Smith) that sees human beings a=
s essentially productive animals. Therefore, political economy - the realm =
of production and exchange - now became the central object of any Marxist c=
ritique. 

The French Revolution supposedly succeeded in creating political=
 emancipation, so Marx insisted, but state equality displaced inequality in=
to the social sphere. In the social sphere, human beings were subject to an=
 overwhelming sense of alienation. The proletariat (the working class) was =
separated from what they essentially are - biologically-determined producer=
s unleashed to create, as an expression of their own essence. Political eco=
nomy was thus seen as nothing more than the projection of our collective hu=
man praxis.  Instead of political economy serving human purposes, however, =
Marx felt that humanity was presently serving the needs of political econom=
y. But the present political economy is nothing more than our own creation.=
 Now a human revolution was needed. In order to begin this purportedly eman=
cipatory process, Marx felt that the economic system of his time needed to =
be translated into a philosophical anthropology.

Marx's attempt to transla=
te the critical program to political economy proved immediately problematic=
 for three reasons. 1) While God is immaterial, economies are very material=
; 2) It was impossible at Marx's juncture in history to imagine a world wit=
hout alienated labor; 3) Marx used Adam Smith as his primary economic theor=
ist, though many of Smith's ideas no longer applied. 

Thus, while Marx mad=
e the attempt to translate Fueurbach's failed critique of religion into a c=
ritique of political economy, such an application was itself a complete fai=
lure, to say the least.  


The Failures of Marxism

"We are ruthless and a=
sk no quarter from you. When our turn comes we shall not disguise our terro=
rism."[2] - Karl Marx

The failures of Marxism are legion and have been wel=
l documented for many decades by a wide variety of scholars, researchers, t=
hinkers, economists and political scientists. Marxism eliminates all incent=
ive for people to engage in any form of labor, whether intellectual, artist=
ic or physical. By eliminating wages directly reflective of the value of in=
dividual instances of labor, people living under Marxist regimes are forced=
 to work for a rationed amount of food and basic resources. Without a fair =
wage to work for, people naturally lose the motivation to work at all, thus=
 leading to economic stagnation and a sense of hopelessness. We have seen s=
uch instances of economic failure in every Communist nation in history, and=
 we are now beginning to see such economic breakdown occur in Europe and Am=
erica as a direct result of the incremental introduction of crypto-Marxist =
economic policies.

A nation under the bondage of Marxism is destined to fa=
ilure because such a state provides its people with no reason to strive for=
 anything higher than being a personless atom in the social mass. With no d=
istinctions, diversity, hierarchy, or classes to order the varying social s=
trata of society in a sane and reasonable manner, a doctor will be paid the=
 same wage as garbage collector, and a factory laborer has no hopes of ever=
 earning a better life even if he acquired a Ph.D. All people are paid equa=
lly for work that requires unequal levels of skill, talent, education and p=
ersonal natural propensity, so the person who aspires to be a doctor has no=
 motivation to go to school for so many years of hard work only to be paid =
the same amount as someone who has not gone to school at all.

Marxism is p=
redicated upon the idea of radical egalitarianism. Consequently, Marxists s=
trive to utterly eliminate any sense of ethnic and national diversity, prid=
e or celebration. The policy of eliminating a people's natural and inherent=
 sense of distinct cultural identity is designed to deprive people of any i=
dentity-sourced empowerment to dissent against the totalitarian, atheistic =
government. It is precisely for this reason that we must hold on to our eth=
nic and cultural identity at all costs, expressing a healthy pride in who w=
e are, and in the ethnic heritage that made us who we are. Marxists, both t=
hose who have already gained power and those who seek to force their way to=
 power in non-Marxist societies, promote and force ethnic amalgamation at t=
he direct expense of ethnic diversity, often in the very name of ethnic div=
ersity. We must never allow any government to eliminate the rich and beauti=
ful diversity of the many cultures, languages, ethnicities, races and uniqu=
e peoples that make our world the fascinating and meaningful place it is.

=
Marxism enforces its own beliefs and forcefully prevents all free speech th=
at departs from their own belief system. Marxism is based upon fanaticism, =
hatred, doctrinaire closed-mindedness, dogmatic slogans, and blind faith in=
 unsound historical, social and economic theories. Those found dissenting a=
gainst the Marxist system are taken from their families and put into re-edu=
cation centers or Gulags for merciless and systematic brainwashing. Those w=
ho continue to dissent are often summarily executed, with the family expect=
ed to pay for the bullets. The nightmarish Marxist model of the state repre=
sents the very opposite model that is presented by Dharma.

Marxist philosophy, and the Communist movement in general, is without dou=
bt the most destructive ideology humanity has ever been subjected to. Marxi=
sm represents the exact antithesis of Natural Law, of religion, of positive=
 culture, of any form of national ideal, and of healthy tradition. Marxism =
is the polar opposite of life itself. It is the embodiment of the final, qu=
intessential stage of the 4000-year-old failed Abrahamic experiment.

Commu=
nism has been responsible for the death, murder, torture and pain of more h=
uman beings than any ideology in world history (with, arguably, the possibl=
e exception of Islam). In China, the former USSR, and the former Communist =
nations of Eastern Europe, it has led to environmental degradation that is =
unprecedented. Marxism is a culture-destroyer. Far from being "progressive"=
 and leading societies toward greater advancement, Marxism has led the nati=
ons under its rule back to the dark ages. In each and every significant way=
, Marxism is the very exact opposite of everything that Dharma and Natural =
Law has ever stood for. This explains why for the last 150 years of history=
, communists have been one of the very greatest enemies of Vedic civilizati=
on, and have tried to destroy us every chance they get. Marxism is our natu=
ral enemy. Every follower of Dharma must oppose Marxist materialism with ev=
ery breath we have.
