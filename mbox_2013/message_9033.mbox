I mark the text from the pdf file into a file in the order I find convenien=
t. E.g. I do not need detailed instructions for doing pranayamam. And if I =
need something from the Appendix, I cut and paste that part wher I need it.=


I do not print out the first 10 or so pages which contact topics such as =
"what is homam?', FAQ, misconceptions. I found these very useful the first =
time but not need that whle doing the homam.

I will try to post my latest =
the resulting document to you two. My manuals have the instructions in Engl=
ish and the mantras in Telugu.

Regards
Ranga
