=C2=
=A0 
Sir=C2=A0

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Thanks for your response and the=
 beautiful explanation you have given of all the four paths of self realiza=
tion. Let me try to put all this into a perspective here.=C2=A0

Now my und=
erstanding is that all these four different path lead to the same point or =
the end result and that is self realization. No matter what path or approac=
h you take the end result or the truth has to be the same. It cannot be two=
 different thing for two different people and in that case it is not the Tr=
uth. The path one adopts may be of hindu persuasion or some other religious=
 persuasion the end result has to be the same. Not only the end result one =
has to come to a point where one has an insight or a perception that finish=
es the ego or self directed activity.=C2=A0

Karma is a natural result of t=
he freedom that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning without =
freedom to act. I do mistakes and create imbalance only when I have freedom=
 to act and as such I have pay it back and restore balance in Nature. To ha=
ve the freedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect sens=
e to me.=C2=A0

Now due to karmic overload it may become very hard for larg=
e numbers of people to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if Nature allow=
s one to be free of this attachment without a payback. Now there is a train=
 of thought which says that one can look into the whole nature of this atta=
chment at one shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one thing after=
 another look at this whole thing to the root , have a perception and get o=
ut of it. In a sense our ancestors were intelligent that they devised some =
way to clear this Karma but it seems like for large numbers of people these=
 will become crutches rather than help to get out of the karmic cycle and l=
ead an existence where one is free to act. If my previous karma is influenc=
ing my action then I am not free.=C2=A0

Is it possible for someone to look=
 into this whole process of attachment and have an insight and be free of i=
t right now....

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir,
=C2=A0
> Dont you think all =
these yogas are NOT an end in itself but to prepare the mind for awakening?=
?
=C2=A0
Correct. These paths get one started in the walk towards the same =
end point - Self-realization.

=C2=A0
> To be free is to be awakened.
=C2=
=A0
Not exactly. Awakening is just a step towards freedom. Freedom comes in=
 the end after walking a path for enough time after awakening.
=C2=A0
An un=
awakened sadhaka practicing jnana yoga reads books and talks eloquently abo=
ut how everything is god, but looks at different people, objects and experi=
ences with a different attitude. He becomes happy (if not externally, atlea=
st internally) when people praise him and becomes upset when people critici=
ze him, and so on. An awakened sadhaka practicing jnana yoga starts to hone=
stly contemplate one's actions, words, thoughts (and even instincts finally=
) and slowly weeds out conditioning that makes one look at different transi=
ent things differently. As his equanimity increases, still there will be ep=
isodes of getting carried away. As he employs contemplation and self-correc=
tion more and more, such episodes will become less and less frequent and on=
e will become liberated in the end.
=C2=A0
An unawakened sadhaka practicing=
 karma yoga passionately engages in dharmik actions for the benefit of othe=
rs. He gets elated and feels proud when good results come and becomes upset=
 when bad results come. An awakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga starts to=
 have detachment to results. When something happens which makes him elated,=
 proud, ashamed or upset, he will not think much about it, take it as god's=
 prasad and think about what is the right action for him right now. As his =
detachment increases, still there will be episodes of getting carried away.=
 As one becomes more and more detached (to results of actions), such episod=
es will become less and less frequent and one will become liberated in the =
end.
=C2=A0
An unawakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga goes through yama, n=
iyama, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana etc. His psychic life force may even ari=
se and ascend. He may have various experiences and may feel proud or become=
 attached to them. An awakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga will not not lo=
se self-control in the face of anything and will keep the focus on samadhi.=
 He will not be distracted by anything that comes on the way and keep perfe=
cting concentration and self-control so that samadhi (deep concentration on=
 the unconditioned Self) comes. In the beginning, one may be in samadhi sta=
te now and then. As practice is perfected, one can be in it all the time an=
d become liberated.
=C2=A0
An unawkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga is d=
evoted to god and worships him/her as much as one can, but will project his=
 ego, conditioning and desires onto his worship and hence onto the god he w=
orships. For example, he may think "I worship the highest god while that pe=
rson worships a lower god. I am better" or "I am worshipping god everyday. =
I will get so and so result" or "I worship god more than that person. I am =
better". An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga has little expectation, =
pride etc. Worship becomes not about him but about god! He worships god and=
 marvels at the power that holds this cosmos together - the power that runs=
 things infinitismally smaller than a boson and infinitely larger than a ga=
laxy. He will look at himself as a fully insignificant particle in front a =
supreme power. His desires, likes, dislikes, conditioning and agendas start=
 to seem too insignificant in front of contemplating about that supreme pow=
er. Even as that
 devotional spirit increases, there will be episodes when =
one becomes self-centered in one's worship. But with practice, one loses on=
eself completely and surrenders completely to the supreme power and become =
liberated in the end.
=C2=A0
In each path, one may walk the path without ma=
king any significant progress for a long time. As one starts to imbibe the =
inherent qualities of the path, some internal transformation will kick in. =
Yet, the force of prior conditioning, coming from many lives, is too strong=
 to overcome. One keeps walking..

>=C2=A0
>Here are my 2 cents.
>=C2=A0
>Jnan=
a yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on =
work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery.=
 Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick =
whatever is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom=
, detached action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutual=
ly exclusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, others will=
 automatically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in "Yoga" =
or oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.
>=C2=A0
>Forget =
about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that,=
 I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrish=
na advised
 against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic l=
ife force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean na=
dis. In this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great am=
ounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my v=
iew, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in "Gospel of Ramakrishna" (one=
 of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishy=
as from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encour=
age even him to practice it.
>=C2=A0
>Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is=
 a distinct danger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. Pe=
ople of this age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to =
delude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it's ok - it does=
n't matter. It's all a delusion anyway" without fully overcoming all innate=
 conditioning that reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind
=
 of like declaring wisely in a movie that "it's just a movie and not realit=
y", but flinching in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. With=
out absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problema=
tic too. A long path of constant contemplation and self-correction can be r=
educed to a quick delusional jump to the end.

 2 cents.<br> <br>Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom=
. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on sel=
f-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrende=
r to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop th=
at quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender to=
 the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities develops=
 nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a realized =
person (i.e. one in "Yoga" or oneness) will have all these qualities fully =
blossomed.<br> <br>Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatr=
amsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for =
99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised
 against it. Controlling body and=
 mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requires stri=
ct yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and =
food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be d=
angerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught =

ana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the d=
elusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/=
smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that "all is Brahman. I am Brahma=

without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in=
 consciousness every instant. Kind
 of like declaring wisely in a movie tha=

crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earn=
estness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant contemp=
lation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the=

 yoga are the most suitable and safest.<br> <br>Best regards,<br>Naras=
