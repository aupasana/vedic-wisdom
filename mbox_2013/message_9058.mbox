Heaing voices in the head or seeing things may or may not be an offshoot of=
 a kundalini awakening. There are plenty of simultaneous things that can ha=
ppen. Kundalini is only one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kundalini awaken=
ing may not even make you see or hear anything, it may make a person sudden=
ly experience some other nice things too. The mind is of a very subtle natu=
re. The astral world is a plethora of endless subtle entities of all kinds.=
 If by some chance the link to this world opens up, willingly or unwillingl=
y, it can cause quite a bit of problems for both mature as well as immature=
 people. In the sense, those who are not aware of these can get affected by=
 them easily, even those who do sadhana can also get affected by a plethora=
 of false experiences and misplaced priorities. As such a diagnosis like th=
is simply cannot be done over net, and rarely by people of this forum (unle=
ss I am grossly mistaken).

Doing a homa with the desire that someone gets =
cured maybe good. However, it can also have unintended consequences. Some p=
art of the person's karma will come to you today or tomorrow. You must have=
 enuf spiritual backup to know how to deal with it. It is never advisable t=
o enter into the cricket field merely with a bat in hand, one must also wea=
r all necessary protections.=C2=A0 The first rule is curing such kind of ps=
ycho-spiritual maladies is to find out what causes the effect, and if the p=
erson is trying to remedy interferes with the karmic process, how much of t=
he effect will come to the person and how easily s/he can handle it. All th=
is is complex and not easy at all. It is like a specialization.

=C2=A0 
That was an interesting read. But how is a doctor to tell apar=
t kundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include si=
milar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others canno=
t experience- in other words, what doctors call "hallucinations". Are these=
 hallucinations or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnost=
ic test. 

However most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-=
seeking 'fake' patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... th=
eir stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine "I hea=
r voices in my head" schizophrenic or kundalini patient. 

About vata, most=
 of our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usu=
ally unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derang=
ement. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The =
use of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I'm sure this d=
oes no good for vata.

The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do s=
ome on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any =
patient. 

Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalin=
i patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as "psychosis" and will ad=
vise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not h=
arm them, though I doubt it will help.

Advice and thoughts from all member=
s would be much appreciated.

>>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my re=
cent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at presen=
t, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has=
 had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has i=
nvolved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is no=
t of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms star=
ted and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anyt=
hing physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this=
 is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe th=
emselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini aw=
akening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainst=
ream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by we=
stern medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged
>  kundalini, we =
struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My e=
xperience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be =
forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suf=
fering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, a=
nd it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there c=
ould be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, w=
ho manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and e=
ither cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that t=
he good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we=
 may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be carefu=
l in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps t=
his is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say "let=
 me be your instrument" and leave the kundalini

ices in the head or seeing things may or may not be an offshoot of a kundal=

      <div>That was a=
n interesting read. But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises from =
non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experiences, such=
 as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience- in other =
words, what doctors call "hallucinations". Are these hallucinations or the =
result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. <br>
<br>
Howe=
ver most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking 'fake' =
patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories ten=
d to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine "I hear voices in my =
head" schizophrenic or kundalini patient. <br>
<br>
About vata, most of our=
 patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually un=
able to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. =
We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use of =
Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I'm sure this does no =
good for vata.<br>
<br>
The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do =
some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any=
 patient. <br>
<br>
Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the=
 kundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as "psychosis" an=
d will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this w=

t;>In Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - B=
huta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that =
compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates int=
o more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger=
, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happen=
s, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotio=
n of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the jou=
rney. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it r=
eally does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things =
and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them ar=
e useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its o=
wn ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and m=
iss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi
 becomes even more<br>
&=
gt;  vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experienc=
e of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycholo=
gy are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is=
 puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible =
sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various su=
btle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "rup=
tured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, t=
rauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind a=
nd they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very com=
plex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down ev=
ery option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few =
can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they =
can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess

;>>>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome bas=
ed on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry jo=
b at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to th=
ink she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood.=
 This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body=
. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her sy=
mptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able t=
o find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might b=
e that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill =
describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous k=
undalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this topi=
c in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-under=
stood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for
 deranged<br>
&=
gt;  kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken =
the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kunda=
lini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at ti=
mes because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it =
will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered wh=
at solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to t=
he Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering o=
f this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. M=
ay I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for other=
s like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. A=
nd let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation o=
urselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps=
 safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the
 kundalini<br>
