Dear Narasimha Ji and other members.
	For a long time I was having a though=
t about creating a place for people to do homam outside their apartments.  =
After doing homam in apartment as well as in Homa kunda outside (we built o=
ne at my native village), I felt big limitation when we do homam in an apar=
tment. One, there are limited items one can offer in fire due to its size. =
Two, long duration homam invariably generates soot which eventually goes al=
l over the place. General disturbance if you want to do extended sadhana wi=
th Homam. People staying abroad will have more issues due to fire safety sy=
stem also. Since I don't have any means of creating such a facility at my c=
urrent place in Bangalore, I thought I'll share this with other folks. If s=
omeone feels it is worth pursuing and has ability (anywhere in world), they=
 are welcome to do so.
My idea was to create a site, may be 50x50 or 100x10=
0 sq ft, with 11 or 21 or 51 Homa Kunda (whatever practically possible). An=
yone interested to do homam can come to this place anytime 24x7x365 days, d=
o extended hours of homam or do 1-3-5-7 days sadhana. Bring your own stuff;=
 spend as much as time day/night, evenings/mornings, whatever suits you. Th=
e owner of the place may provide some basic needs if the site is next to hi=
s house.
 Off course all this should not involve any money and should be do=
ne with the sankalpa of one's spiritual progress or restoring Dharma in wor=
ld (as Narasimha had told many times). Also, in my opinion the place should=
 not be in temple premises as invariably people come with materials wishes =
and pray. Well this is just a thought/wish; feel free to give your opinion.=
 This concept could be helpful for people staying abroad too.
With regards,=

Digamber
