Dear Lakshman,


> One of the step is to show mudras after the sthapana of Kalasha.
> Are these gestures important or only chanting of mantras will be enough


When learning a procedure, many traditionalists memorize the sanskrit
instructions along with the mantras (i.e. "now place the kalasha", "fill it
with water" etc). They recite these when performing the puja as a memory
aid. Many times, these instructions are mistaken for mantras.

In the procedures that I have seen, there is usually no mantra that
accompanies these kalasha sthapana mudras. What many people recite are
instructions like "tArkshya-mudrAm pradarshya", "dhenu-mudryA amRtI-kRtya"
etc. These literally translate to "After showing the tarkshya mudra,
nectarize [the waters] with the dhenu-mudra". etc

If there is a real mantra, you can certainly recite it without the mudra.
For example, Narasimha has given a bija-mantra in his manuals for
kalasha-shuddhi.

Do what you know, and skip what you don't until you get a chance to learn
it. It is better to do a few things well, with feeling, than to do many
things mechanically. More is not always better.

Ramakrishna Math Chennai sells a book called "mudra vidhanam". It has a
picture, along with a sanskrit verse that explains the mudra, and a tamil
translation.

sasneham,

   ajit
