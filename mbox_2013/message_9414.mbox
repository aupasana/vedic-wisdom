Yes Sir
Chanting loudly is first method
Chanting without sound but only lip movement is second method
Chanting without sound and lip movement but by mind is third method
Second is better than first and third is the best of all.
This is not my words but by Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.

Dear Friends,

Do reciting Kavacham, Shloka, Mantras etc, loudly produces better result
compared to if it is done silently in mind ?
