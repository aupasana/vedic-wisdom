Dear Bhupendra,
Your question that why worship Ganpati,Laxmi and not any ot=
her deity as
they are all Gods, my explanation to you is that:
When nirguna=
 Brahman along with 'MAYA' or Shakti which is nothing but the
three Gunas i=
s spoken as 'Isvara' and what is nameless is given names such
as Siva, Visn=
u, Rama, Devi etc.
They are all One God under different names and forms.Thi=
s identity of
Godhead behind the multiplicity of forms stems from the Advai=
tic concept of
diversity in Saguna Brahman due to difference in the guna co=
mplex. That
constitutes Its mayaik constituent.
So we worship Ganpati as a =
remover of obstacles as He has that constituent
to be a Vighnaharta.
As to =
your another question as to how long one should do worship, the idea
should=
 be that we should do with utmost Sharddha and Devotion even if it is
for a=
 short duration and leave the results to God as he is the Karma fal
giver.
=
Hope this trying time for you shall pass soon.
best
manoj
