Well Rajarshi,

Your email triggered some random thoughts in me.

I have tr=
ied to medidate on the Gayatri mantra during my prayer. It usually
takes me=
 15 minutes to complete 28 times recital silently and without lip
movement.=
 By this timing, I really wonder how much 20-30 japas x 108 times
per japa =
recital must have taken! For the last 3-4 years, whenever I wake
up first t=
hing in the morning, I see a shining orb of light "just" above my
head and =
the opthamologist says everything is just fine. I wonder whether
this has a=
nything to do with the Gayatri mantra

On the topic of medidation, I close =
with an anecdote about Sri Seshadri
Swamigal. Once at Ujjain, I saw a dog i=
n samadhi (or so I think!) and it
was perfectly still for close to 25 minut=
es! not even a murmur of movement.

=93One should not discuss the subject o=
f meditation; one immerse oneself in
it.=94
 One day Avathar Sri Seshadri S=
wamigal came to Echammal=92s house and asked
her, =93What pooja you are doi=
ng?=94 She replied, =93I keep Ramana Bhagawan=92s
picture and yours and wor=
ship.=94

Swami asked her, =93How many days will you be doing Pooja? You sh=
ould sit in
meditation.=94 She wanted to know how to meditate? Swami demons=
trated it to
her in the Samadhi from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. without any movement=
, like a
lifeless doll. Echammal and other ladies of the house having compl=
eted
their household tasks sat by His side and observed Swami.

At 4 o=92cl=
ock Swami opened His eyes and said, =93Did you see, Echammal? This
is how y=
ou have to do meditation.=94

best regards
Hari
