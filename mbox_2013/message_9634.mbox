Namaste.

I understand that you have quite a bit of problem because you hav=
e a long list of words :-)

Since I don't know Sanskrit, I cannot solve eac=
h of the words but I can definitely tell you my way of doing things. May be=
 it can help. It is not necessarily the correct method but it might be bett=
er for someone who has no way / no help :-)

Since my mother tongue Bengali=
 is very close to Sanskrit, sometimes I have an idea of the word meanings a=
nd thus I am able to break words down.

As an example, in the beginning Vig=
hneshwara prarthna, (initial prayer to Lord Ganesha to remove obstacles), t=
here is a word PRASANNAVADANAM. Since I know PRASANNA means "pleased", so I=
 know it is a separate word so I can break it like PRASANNA-VADANAM.

When =
I break a word, in my own writing I put hyphen(s) between the two/three/fou=
r parts so when memorizing, and even after memorizing is done, I always kno=
w that these parts together form a bigger word so I have to utter them fast=
.

Similarly, I break SARVAKARYESHU into SARVA-KARYESHU... SARVA (All) + KA=
RYESHU (Work/Action/something related like this).

KOTISURYASAMAPRABHA =3D =
KOTI-SURYA-SAMA-PRABHA

Second way, when you don't know the meaning, or don=
't have a clue, simply try to break them down in a way that helps you remem=
ber the whole word better and easily.

As an example, in the very first pra=
yer (Anugya - seeking permission), there is a big word HAVYAIRNAMASOPASADYA=
... 
I break it into HAVYARNAMA-SOPASADYA... (You mentioned it too)

It mig=
ht be wrong in the meaning IN THE WAY YOU WRITE, however when you memorize =
it and by always putting hyphen in between you know they form a single word=
, after memorizing you say it together very fast so there should not be any=
 problem from the point of meaning WHEN YOU SAY IT.

One thing top of all I=
 want to assure you : Once you break the words and memorize the mantra, you=
 will find the whole big word to be very easy and you will have absolutely =
no problem anymore to remember and utter the whole big word very easily. So=
 don't fear, just memorize it by breaking in a way convenient to you! :-)

=
Thanks
Tanvir

 You can download the "English copy" manuals, which means that in those man=
uals the mantras written are written in English. Then you can copy and past=
