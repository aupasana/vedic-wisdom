Namaste,

I understand that Homa can be performed by a pandit for another person 
whose name and perhaps the birth Nakshatra is pronounced by the pandit. 
Does he mention it just at the start of the Homa? or perhaps at the end, 
or in the middle of performance?

What is the the effect of this performance if the pandit is doing it for 
many people and instead of pronouncing their names he writes down their 
names and birth Nakshatras on a paper and at the end of the Homa he 
offers that list to the fire?
Is there any reference to this kind of performance in the scriptures?

Thanks and regards,

Marek
