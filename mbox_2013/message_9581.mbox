Namaste everyone.

I was reading Narasimha Ji's Shani Homam Manual, there i=
n the Vedic Shani mantra taken from Atharva Veda, there is a word like "SHA=
MYORABHISRAVANTU" with a dot appearing over the "M" of SHAMYO.. while liste=
ning to an audio from another source, I heard it is recited as SHAIYO and n=
ot SHAMYO... so I have been wondering whether the dot on the M changes the =
pronunciation to SHAIYO or should I still pronounce SHAMYO...

I tried to c=
heck some transliteration site but couldn't find any solution.

Additionall=
y, if any of you could direct me to a comprehensive transliteration website=
, it will be very helpful.

Thanks
Tanvir
