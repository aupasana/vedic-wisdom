 friends,
>=C2=A0
>Someone with psychiatric problems may expereience what s=
ounds like a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not be one.
>=C2=A0
>It must=
 be conceded though that Kundalini spontaneously rising through various nad=
is without one having gone through proper preparation in this life (i.e. fi=
ne-tuning of one's attitude and development of detachment) CAN create havoc=
!
>=C2=A0
>One may wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in a layman =
with no sadhana, while many serious sadhakas may not experience it.
>=C2=A0=

>Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL STEP in=
 overcoming one's current limited identity.
>=C2=A0
>Let me give an analogy=
. One wanting to move from one's small dilapidated house (this body-mind co=
mplex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace over=
 time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionall=
y goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out of=
 body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it=
 comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it=
. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without any=
 out of body experiences. These are not my word's, but Maharshi Vasishtha's=
 words to Lord Rama.
>=C2=A0
>Secondly, one does not get something without =
wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply de=
sired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. A=
s a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironi=
cally may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.
>=C2=A0
>As you do=
 sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Nature has a delay me=
chanism in granting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can=
 give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous actions). So Nature som=
etimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want som=
ething else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one's whole life an=
d be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that =
wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be v=
ery healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another case, one may =
deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn as a tiger or a do=
g and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that experience. Basically=
, people keep going in circles through various lives, always "seeking" some=
thing they are "missing".
>=C2=A0
>Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one=
 deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and o=
ne's previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be =
born in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there =
is enough karmik force behind it).

>=C2=A0

>Kundalini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, =
is far better than Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable condi=
tioning is still left in one's system.
>=C2=A0
>When one transcends one pro=
blematic notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that la=
y buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one.=
 If one overcomes the notion "I am the body", there may be another notion i=
n one's body-mind complex that one's awareness clings on to (e.g. a great d=
octor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme e=
xample, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescu=
es the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescu=
e the world now. When one's self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings =
to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of p=
rogress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.
>=C2=A0

ed Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one's=
 weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spi=

>The best approach I reco=
mmend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, =
overcome your weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I wa=
nt to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/=
people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a=
 negative attachment.=C2=A0
>Don't worry about whether your Kundalini rises=
 or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (sha=
dripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or not. If your ability to resist the=
m is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast as=
leep, you are still making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kun=
dalini (your self-awareness) will automatically ascend to the top and meet =
Her Lord (true Self).

>One word on surrender=
ing to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do n=
ot have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may be offended=
 by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.
>=C2=A0
>"I want X, I will p=
ray to you and please give it to me", "I am scared of Kundalini rise, I wil=
l pray to you and please protect me" - all this is just a business deal. Th=
ere is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no pla=
ce for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing =
oneself in one's fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is a=
ccepting anything Lord throws one's way (whether it is pleasurable or highl=
y painful) as Lord's prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is =
thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and du=
ring) Death.
>=C2=A0
>If one without true surrender and with many desires a=
nd wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, de=
spite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to "prot=
ect" one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you g=
o back to my "chipmunk glued to mouse trap" example above, I was trying to =
protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one's conditioning makes one *run=
 away* from God's protection! God's protection may seem to a conditioned mi=
nd like grave danger that one should run away from!

>=C2=A0
>Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispass=
ion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be taken awa=
y anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be prepare=
d to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental condi=
tioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one's Kundali=
ni rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one's nadi=
s will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting=
 True Self.

>>>I=
n Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going. 1 - Bhuta Su=
ddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose=
 the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more =
detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust,=
 greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one =
has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a =
far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3=
 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really d=
oes - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and ent=
ities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are usele=
ss, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends=
. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-uti=
lizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more
 vital. 4 - W=
hile someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Sh=
akti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of=
 this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insu=
fficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that th=
e aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences a=
nd helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "ruptured" due to var=
ious reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That c=
an allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chan=
ces of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various =
possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreo=
ver, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the righ=
t knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are of=
ten doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.
 Sometimes it will h=
ave results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting poin=
t is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens=
 sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi

>>>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini s=
yndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a ps=
ychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who =
seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since=
 childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy =
in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini u=
ntil her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not =
been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so=
 it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call me=
ntally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted sp=
ontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research int=
o this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not=
 well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for dera=
nged
 kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken=
 the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kund=
alini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at t=
imes because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it=
 will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered w=
hat solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to =
the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering =
of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. =
May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for othe=
rs like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. =
And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation =
ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhap=
s safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the kundalini
 rising=
 bit to God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna

 not experience it.<BR> <BR>Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievem=

BR> <BR>Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one's small d=
ilapidated house (this body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) =
may first construct the palace over time and
 move into it when it is COMPL=
ETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still un=
der construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise=
), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach =
is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards c=
omplete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These are not=
 my word's, but Maharshi Vasishtha's words to Lord Rama.<BR> <BR>Secon=
dly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient e=
ffort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previou=
s life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it n=
ow. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when i=
t comes in this life.<BR> <BR>As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too =
many specific desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desire=
s (because of constraints on what
 Nature can give you right now, arising f=
rom YOUR OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want=
 LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one =
may pray for great wealth one's whole life and be born as a rich but very s=
ick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for=
 health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any =

_1362067846619_89>In Tantra, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things =
going. 1 - Bhuta Suddhi. Constant efforts of purification of the various el=
ements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this tr=
anslates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, cont=
rol of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awak=
ening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater fo=
rce. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes car=
e of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF a=
nd when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various o=
ther things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while som=
e of them are useless, and given half a chance can make
 use of the individ=
ual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and=
 nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes eve=
n more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experie=
nce of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycho=
logy are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west today =
is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possibl=
e sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various =
subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get "r=
uptured" due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles,=
 trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind=
 and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very c=
omplex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down =
every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis
 is correctly done, very f=
ew can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim th=
ey can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work. =
Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved=
, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks=
 used to say - <SPAN class=3Dyiv1491792485st>Mens sana in corpore sano.</SP=

<DIV>Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of =
kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am=
 doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of s=
omeone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kund=
alini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges=
 of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of =
kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. W=
e have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests =
normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people=
 we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or =
unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and r=
esearch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patie=
nts are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatmen=
ts for deranged
 kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to for=
cibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feelin=
g that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill h=
erself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. S=
he feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I=
 wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was =
to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the=
 suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to =
bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, a=
nd for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is=
 pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this=
 situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. I=
t is perhaps safest to say "let me be your instrument" and leave the kundal=
ini
 rising bit to God's will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna </DIV></DIV></=
