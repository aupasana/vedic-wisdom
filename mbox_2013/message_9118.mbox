Namaste - The present place I stay do not have cows nearby ! The previous l=
ocation I was at had a family that owned a cow and I could feed the bali (b=
anana pieces) daily. I am offering raisins as bali and even pigeons are not=
 touching it. There are no sparrows (thanks to multiple base stations on ap=
artments), else they would eat raisins. What are the other best alternative=
s for bali offering ? Can I offer sugar crystals and drop them near some pl=
ants on the ground for ants to eat ? For time being I am saving the raisins=
 and on a weekend I will find a cow on the road to feed them all along with=
 non-bali bananas :-)

Also, I keep kalash as part of the ritual and use it=
 just to sprinkle water initially on all the homa samagri (havan items), bu=
t later the water goes to plants. Can I do away with kalash completely and =
use my achamana cup water for the homa samagri suddhi ? The reason I ask is=
, pouring the water to plants, etc saves atleast 5 minutes and on working d=
ays, even that is good save.

Lastly, can I cover the homa kundam (havan ku=
nd) with a lid after I finish ? I do homam in balcony that is open and I do=
not want any dust, pigeon feathers, etc to fall into it. 

Thank you.
