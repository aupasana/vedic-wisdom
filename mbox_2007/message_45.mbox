Join our new Yoga Spirituality Yahoo! Group.  

For lively discussion, dee=
per insight, and valuable knowledge about 
the ancient spiritual path of Yo=
ga.  

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/yoga-spirituality/



Namaste.  Our ne=
w Yoga Spirituality discussion group is dedicated to 
exploring the philoso=
phy, spiritual path, and practice of Yoga and 
Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism). =


While the practice of Yoga has exploded in popularity in the U.S. in 
rec=
ent years, most practitioners still limit their Yoga experience to 
merely =
the physical benefits that Yoga offers. Yoga, however, is so 
much more tha=
n just the "aerobics of India". 

In addition to the profound physical and =
health benefits that Yoga 
gives us, Yoga is also a highly effective spirit=
ual path that can 
provide deep meaning to our lives, inner peace and calm,=
 lasting joy 
and happiness, God-realization, and truly satisfying answers =
to 
life's most important questions. 

Yoga is an ancient spiritual and phi=
losophical tradition. The goal of 
Yoga is self-realization and God-conscio=
usness=85and that is what this 
brand new Yahoo! Group is here to discuss a=
nd explore. 

If you're a serious spiritual seeker who wants to fully explo=
re the 
spiritual dimensions of Yoga, you're welcome to join!
