Om shivaya namah

Dear Narashima Ji,

Earlier I wrote a mail to you on Rudrabishekam. But didn't get any reply.

Couple of weeks before I down loaded Ganapati homam manual and mp3 version from your web site. I found it very useful. Thanks for the same. Is it possible for you to put one such manual for Rudrabishekam also.

Iam doing Rudrabishekam daily for quite some years and want to check with you if iam doing it in right way or not. What I do is recite rudram and chamakam, and do abishekam to shiv linga. End up with mantra pushpam

Please advise.

Thanks. Rgds
Anand
