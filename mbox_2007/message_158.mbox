I'm trying to understand the starting position, and thus have a couple
of questions

(a) If we say that pronounciation of vedas is largely corrupted, does
it also follow that portions
of the vedas themselves are largely corrupted? There are patha-bedhas
even in veda. Or, for now
are you only saying that the pratishakya-s are all corrupted.

(b) on what basis is correct pronounciation being re-inferred. I guess
the pratishakya is out, and
we are back to the panini-shiksha-sutras & such. But even here, how
does one interpret the
simplest sutras like "uccairudAttaH".

(c) current rig-veda pronounciation is generally "better" from
sanskrit viewpoint compared to other
shakhas. But, in the most prized shrouta karmas, it is the
sama-gana-vikriti that is given much
importance, even though most of its mantras are nothing but rig-veda
mantras. What is your view
when it comes to pronounciation of sama-veda? Because from a sanskrit
point of view, it is rather
"interesting".

(d) chandas-shastra in veda does not seem to be so simple. There are
plenty of instances of mantras
which are said to be in one meter . . . which don't seem to be in that
meter at all. Some learned scholars
are of the opinion that there are several differrent chandas all of
which go by one name, particularly in veda.
Secondly, some opine that the definition of laghu & guru are actually
different, and letters being alpa-prAna /
mahA-prAna etc also factor into the counting of letters.

What is your view of traditional chandas-shAstra. The reason I ask is
before we claim that traditional pronounciation
is flawed in some cases (using chandas as the reason), one has to be
very confident in their understanding of
chandas shastra.

And efforts towards this goal are laudable.
