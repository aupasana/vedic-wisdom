Press Release
July 12, 2007

Religious Bigots Attack Hindu Priest in U.S.=
 Senate

History was made on Thursday, July 12th when a Hindu priest delive=
red
the opening prayer at the U.S. Senate for the first time ever. Mr.
Raja=
n Zed, a journalist and Hindu priest, delivered a minute and a
half prayer =
in which he offered God thanks and prayed for peace.

However, before Mr. Z=
ed could offer his short prayer to God, three
Christian activists disrupted=
 the ceremony with angry shouts and
denunciations of Hinduism to the shock =
of on-lookers. "This is an
abomination!" the Washington Post reports one of=
 the disruptors as
screaming. "We are Christians and patriots!" yelled anot=
her before
being led away by police.

Shockingly, far from being an isolate=
d and spontaneous incident of
hatred, it is reported that a large number of=
 well-organized
fundamentalist Christian groups throughout the nation had b=
een
clamoring against allowing a Hindu priest to lead a prayer in our
natio=
n's capital. The American Family Association has been on the
forefront of u=
rging Christians to take direct action against
religious tolerance and aske=
d their followers to contact the Senate
to ban a Hindu from leading prayer.=


For further information on this dark and disturbing incident, please

America has been celebrated throughout the world as a society that
cher=
ishes religious tolerance, freedom of faith, and respect for
different cult=
ures. Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) is the most ancient
continuously practiced=
 spiritual tradition on earth. Hinduism is a
dignified and highly respected=
 religion that has always fostered
peace, respect of cultural diversity, an=
d freedom of thought.

As an American Hindu leader, and the President of th=
e International
Sanatana Dharma Society, I would urge all freedom loving Am=
ericans to
openly reject such disturbing instances of hatred, bigotry, and
=
prejudice as we sadly witnessed at this event.

I also urge all Hindus to b=
ecome actively involved in vocally
denouncing this incident of bigotry, and=
 insisting that mainstream
American society extend the same respect and tol=
erance toward
Hinduism as it commonly gives to the Abrahamic minority relig=
ions in
our great nation. Together, let us create a nation of mutual
respec=
t, and tolerance of diverse cultures and religions.

Om Shanti (May Peace P=
revail),
