The Difference Between Devotion and Emotion

Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.
(Sri =
Dharma Pravartaka Acharya)



"Of all Yogis, he who always abides in Me wit=
h great faith, 
worshiping Me in transcendental devotional service, is most=
 
intimately united with Me in Yoga and is the highest Yogi of all."

Bhaga=
van Sri Krishna, Bhagavad Gita, 6:47


The central message of the Bhagavad =
Gita, the most important 
scripture in all of Sanatana Dharma, is that bhak=
ti, or devotion to 
the Absolute, constitutes the most effective and highly=
 recommended 
path in all of the Yoga tradition.  It is truly unfortunate, =
however, 
that despite the almost universally held importance of bhakti in =
the 
history of Yoga, there seems to have always been a good deal of 
misun=
derstanding on the part of many about what the terms "bhakti" 
and "Bhakti =
Yoga" actually mean.  I've read even many supposedly 
knowledgeable authors=
 write that bhakti is the Yoga of "emotion", or 
that it somehow precludes =
any involvement with jnana (knowledge, or 
intellectualism), philosophy, or=
 serious Yogic sadhana (practice).  
Nothing could be further from the trut=
h.

The word "bhakti" is derived from the Sanskrit verb root `bhaj', 
meani=
ng "to share in, resort to, experience, partake of, cultivate, 
worship, go=
 to", etc. The object of this "experiencing" or "partaking 
in" is, of cour=
se, God.  In this definition, we can begin to 
recognize in seed form what =
the foundational basis of Bhakti Yoga 
consists of.  

Bhakti is a trans-em=
otional state of consciousness that we are meant 
to cultivate and uncover =
as the natural essence of our soul, and 
Bhakti Yoga is a complex and rigor=
ous system of Yoga designed to 
bring its adherent to a progressively deepe=
r state of meditative 
absorption (samadhi) in the Divine.  Thus, the term =
"bhakti" denotes 
both a state of trans-empirical perceptual awareness and =

phenomenological experience, as well as a philosophical system and 
praxis=
 designed to bring about such a higher state of awareness of 
the Divine.  =


Bhakti is meditation in its fullest and deepest manifestation.   
Bhakti =
actually denotes devotional meditative absorption. Unlike any 
other system=
 of Yoga, bhakti stands apart from all other systems in 
that it actually c=
onstitutes both a means (upaya) toward the goal of 
God-realization (and th=
us it is a Yoga), as well as the end (artha) 
of Yoga itself in the form of=
 a spiritual state of pure egolessness 
and God-consciousness.  Bhakti is n=
ot only the most effective and 
most highly recommended means of enlightenm=
ent, but bhakti IS 
enlightenment.

"Devotion" in this correctly understood=
 bhakti sense is radically 
different from "emotion". Bhakti is a state of =
consciousness that is 
transcendent in essence and which reflects the inner=
most, latent 
nature of the atman (true self) as being functionally conting=
ent and 
ontologically sustained by the Absolute. Bhakti, or devotion in th=
is 
more phenomenological sense, represents the true functional nature of 
=
our soul. There is nothing material, or emotional, or sentimental 
about bh=
akti at all.

Emotion, on the other hand, is held universally by all the sc=
hools of 
Yoga and Dharmic spirituality, to be a purely material-originated=
 
phenomenon that arises from manas (mind), chitta (psyche), desire 
(kama)=
 and anger (krodha). Thus, materially-inspired emotions are 
unreal, tempor=
ary and negative in the truest, spiritual sense. 
Emotions that stem from m=
aterialistic likes and dislikes are akin to 
phantasms that =96 while certa=
inly experienced in a very real way when 
we have them =96 are nonetheless =
not of lasting importance.  This is 
especially true of negative emotions t=
hat arise from our illusion of 
being separate from God. 

Material emotion=
s, for the yogi, are to be transcended. Devotion, for 
the yogi, is to be c=
ultivated.

This being said, Sanatana Dharma does not teach that emotions a=
re 
inherently an evil or unwanted instrument.  Emotions in and of 
themsel=
ves are actually a neutral tool.  They are a tool that can be 
used for eit=
her good or for self-bondage.  The emotive mechanism is 
just as much a neu=
tral tool as is our mind, body, intellect, etc.  
Just as is true of our mi=
nd, body, and intellect, it isn't that any 
of these tools are inherently e=
ither good or bad. Rather, they're 
good if they are under our control, and=
 bad if they're not under our 
control.

When a person has an uncontrolled =
mind, they're considered to be 
mentally disturbed. When a person has an un=
controllable body, then 
they're experiencing some sort of physical illness=
. In the same way, 
when a person has emotions that are uncontrolled, they =
tend to be 
emotionally unstable and thus unpeaceful. And peace is the dire=
ct 
manifest symptom of spiritual transcendence.

To have normal, reactive =
emotions toward things that happen in our 
lives is natural. Emotions arise=
 as a result of external things that 
affect us, which we then perceive as =
either good or bad. Just like if 
someone hits us, we feel physical pain, i=
n the same way if someone 
hurts us emotionally, we then feel emotional pai=
n. Emotions are a 
natural effect to external stimuli =96 or at least to ou=
r perceptions 
of such stimuli.

But if we were to cry for the next week be=
cause we gently stubbed our 
toe, then we would be overreacting to a very m=
iniscule amount of 
physical pain, and we wouldn't really be in control of =
our physical 
reactions.  In the same way, if we overreact and give in to a=
 sea of 
uncontrollable emotion with every incident that happens to us, big=
 
and small, then we are not serving ourselves, but rather being slaves 
of=
 our uncontrolled emotions.

So the idea that is espoused in Yoga spiritual=
ity is not to 
artificially repress, ignore, or stifle our emotions, mind, =

intellect, ego, body, etc., but to see them in their proper place in 
rela=
tion to spirit, our true self, and to then control and thus 
transcend thei=
r power over us.  It is a simple matter of having 
control over our emotion=
s, rather than allowing our emotions to have 
control over us.  

A prevale=
nt misconception that many have is that God-realized, or 
enlightened, peop=
le are necessarily emotionless people because they 
have learned to transce=
nd emotion.  Nothing could be further from the 
truth.  God-realized people=
 are certainly not emotionless. On the 
contrary! They can be the most fun =
people to be with. God-realized 
sages can laugh, can cry, and can even exh=
ibit anger when 
appropriate.  God-realized people can be emotional; but su=
ch emotions 
tend to be positive emotions that are used in God's service, a=
s well 
as spiritual bhava, or transcendent states of consciousness that th=
e 
unwise might mistakenly confuse with material emotions. God-realized 
pe=
rsons: 1) try not to be ruled by their emotions; 2) tend to focus 
on more =
positive emotions (love, compassion, pity, joy, etc.); 3) and 
ultimately t=
he emotive states that they experience most deeply are 
the transcendental =
mellows of love between themselves and God, and 
not the lower, reactive em=
otions that arise from sense perception.

In the highest state of Self-real=
ization and God-realization, our 
material emotions are keenly surpassed an=
d are subsequently replaced 
by devotional ecstasy and states of rapturous =
spiritual elations the 
likes of which nothing in our present perceptual st=
ate can 
comprehend.  To experience such bliss, we must practice Bhakti Yog=
a, 
the Yoga of devotion.  The greatest textbook on Bhakti Yoga is the 
Bha=
gavad Gita.  Beginning with devoted study of the Bhagavad Gita, 
coupled wi=
th daily meditation upon the Absolute under the expert 
guidance of an auth=
entic spiritual teacher (guru), we can know the 
bliss of love of God.
