"The Hindu world has been infected by Impossibility-Thinking for too
lo=
ng. We have allowed ourselves to be convinced that we are
powerless. The ti=
me of such thinking is over! The era of the passive
Hindu is over! We need =
to know that, with Bhagavan's blessings and
grace, anything and everything =
is possible in His service. We need to
adopt Possibility-Thinking, and know=
 that there is no barrier, no
obstacle, no enemy, and no challenge that we =
cannot overcome. With
such thinking, we can change the course of world hist=
ory...and we
will!"

Namaste,

The Vedic Friends Association congratulate=
s Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.
(Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya) for being appoin=
ted to his new
position of Resident Acharya at the Hindu Temple of Nebraska=
. This is
an important step and shows that Indian Hindus in America are
beg=
inning to recognize the sincerity, knowledge, capability, and
dedication of=
 Western Hindus, and that they are, indeed, a part of
the global Hindu comm=
unity.

We hope that this can set an example for other Indian Hindus and
te=
mples alike.

All the best,
Hari Om,

Stephen Knapp, President of the Vedic=
 Friends Association.
