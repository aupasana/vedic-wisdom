Who is Your Very Best Friend?

By Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.
(Sri Dharma Prav=
artaka Acharya)


Do you have friends?  Of course you do!  Who doesn't have=
 friends?  
To even pose such a question would seem silly to many of us.  A=
s 
human beings, most of us are social by nature, and we need to express 
o=
ur need for relationship in the form of our many friends and loved 
ones.  =
Most of us even have one or two people who we would call our 
very best fri=
ends =96 people whom we trust completely, and who we know 
are always there=
 for us in times of trouble.  

While almost all of us can say that we have=
 truly good friends, 
however, the truth of the matter is that most of us h=
ave no real 
knowledge about who our truly best of friend really is.  The v=
ery 
best friend that we have is the same one whom we tend to ignore the 
e=
asiest.  Indeed, most of us spend much of our lives running away 
from our =
very best friend as fast as our little feet can take us.  
That very best f=
riend in your life is Bhagavan: God.  It is God who 
is not only your very =
best of friends, but who is responsible for the 
friends that you do have n=
ow.  

Accepting the reality that God has given us the gift of friendship i=
n 
our lives, I want to pose an interesting question to you.

Think of the =
very closest friend that you have in this world.  This 
person cares about =
you and would do anything for you, right?  Of 
course he would.  Well, this=
 is my question:  Do you have any friend 
or loved one in the world, includ=
ing even your very best friend, who 
you can say will never abandon you?  D=
o you have a friend who, in 
fact, will look after you and follow you as yo=
u traverse lifetime 
after lifetime, sometimes being in male bodies and som=
etimes in 
female bodies, sometimes in the body of a slug or sometimes in t=
he 
body of a king; who will be there as a silent witness seeing you in 
yo=
ur best of times, but also seeing you when you're at your very 
worst?  If =
you answer this question honestly, you know that there is 
absolutely no on=
e =96 however much they may truly love you =96 who would 
be willing to do =
this for you.  No one.  

Yet you do have such a friend.  God as Antaryamin=
 (the Inner Witness) 
patiently and lovingly accompanies us as we journey f=
rom one life to 
another.  Bhagavan (God) doesn't ever judge us or abandon =
us.  Rather 
God chooses to reside ever-present within our hearts as the si=
lent 
witness of our actions, emotions, and thoughts, observing us in our 
=
good times, and at our very cruelest and most selfish times.  Yet, 
even mo=
re so than the most loving parent we could ever imagine, God 
never gives u=
p on us.  Instead, He waits patiently and lovingly, our 
True Friend, yearn=
ing for us to come to the realization that we are 
never alone.  He waits f=
or us to quiet our mind, to still our 
uncontrolled desire for selfish purs=
uits, and to turn to Him and His 
loving embrace.  

To know this Eternal F=
riend, we must cultivate love and devotion 
(bhakti), for this is all that =
God asks of us:  that we make Him the 
priority in our lives, and that we t=
ry to love our very Best Friend 
as He loves us.  This friend has written u=
s a letter of love called 
the Bhagavad Gita.  Read Bhagavan's letter to yo=
u, love Him, and live 
His Dharma daily.  Thus you will know more joy, more=
 peace, more 
fulfillment, and more bliss than any human friend can ever gi=
ve you.  
You will directly experience the love of Bhagavan.
