||Hare Ram Krishna||

Dear Manish and Narsimha ji,

Namaskar,

With  guida=
nce from both of you ,I performed the Ganapati Homam
successfully today on =
Krishna Chaturthi. I chose this as per Manish ji's
advise and did not see a=
ny muhuratha. My humble thanks to Manish ji for
encouraging me to do this.
=

It was a good feeling and I know how I can improve on this.

I would sugge=
st for people in a similar position( living in multi
storeyed apartments):
=

1.Minimise use of camphor, its smoke set of my smoke alarm once. So keep
a=
 closeby window or door to exterior open.

2. Use smaller piece of coconut =
initially until one is confident of
controlling the agni, I used only one h=
alf but felt a smaller piece
would have worked well too.

3. Problem is in =
getting the ' auspicous grass ' . I coudnt get it hence
used ' curry leaves=
 ' but they produce smoke so used only very small
bits.

Any ideas on this =
Manish ji/Narsimha ji?

4. Keep plenty of akshatas, as I nearly ran out of =
them.

5.Ghee lamp..has to be earthen, I didnt have that but will get one f=
rom
India, so one can use a wax lamp.

6. Incense stick will keep getting b=
urned out so keep lighting them.
Keep at least 3 ready.

7. Co-ordiantion o=
f Homam audio and document can be challenging. Keep
lap top on power or bat=
tery may run out. Keep it at eye  distance, best
to print off pages.

The a=
udio is excellent and waits for you.

I would keep the mantras ready to rea=
d or memorise them, when I do this
again as the speed of audio for unfamili=
ar mantras can be daunting.

Fire can go off, so keep ghee drops pouring, a=
dding camphor gives smoke,
use it only when fire has burned out. Coconut bu=
rns well when the pieces
are smaller.

Best to rehearse with the document, =
before beginning for first time. For
food, fruits are practical, the rice I=
 made in MW became very dry..prob
needs more practice :)

Thanks gain for e=
xcellent audio and documentation by Manish/Narsimha
ji..this is definietly =
do able again and again.

Best wishes

Sharat Misra
