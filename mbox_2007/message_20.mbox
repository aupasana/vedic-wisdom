Thank you Narasimha

Your 'rambling' was indeed very interesting and enligh=
tening, esp abt 
the stree sharira. So, I take it, that there is nothing in=
 the vedic 
text itself debarring women. 

Can you recommend a good, unbias=
ed translation of the entire vedic 
text in English or Hindi?

Regards

Roh=
