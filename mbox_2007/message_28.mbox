Change Your Vision
There was a millionaire who was bothered by severe eye=
 pain. He 
consulted so many physicians  and  was  getting  his  treatment =

done. He did not stop consulting galaxy of medical experts; he 
consumed h=
eavy loads of drugs and underwent hundreds of 
injections.   
             =
                                                        
                  =
 
But the ache persisted with great vigour than before. At last a monk 
who=
 has supposed to  be  an  expert  in treating  such patients was 
called fo=
r by the millionaire. The monk  understood  his  problem  
and said that fo=
r sometime he should concentrate only on green 
colours  and  not  to fall =
his eyes on any other colours. The 
millionaire got together a group  of  p=
ainters  and purchased 
barrels of green color and directed that every obje=
ct his eye was 
likely   to   fall   to   be   painted   in   green   colou=
r   
just   as  the  monk  had 
directed.                                  =
                          
                    
                           =
                                          
                   
When   the  =
 monk  came  to  visit  him  after  few  days,  the  
millionaire's  servan=
ts ran with buckets of green paints and poured 
on him since he was in red =
dress, lest their master not see any 
other colour and his eye ache would c=
ome 
back.                         
                                       =
                              
                   
Hearing  this  monk  lau=
ghed said "If only you had purchased a pair 
of green spectacles,  worth  j=
ust  a  few  rupees, you could have 
saved these walls and trees and pots a=
nd all other  articles and 
also could have saved a large share of his fort=
une. You cannot paint 
the  world green." Let us change our vision and the =
world will 
appear accordingly. It is  foolish to shape the world, let us s=
hape 
ourselves first.   

Lets change our vision..!!   
  
Best Wishes
