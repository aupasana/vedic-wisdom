Dear Narasimhaji,
Pranam & thanks for the detailed illuminating post.
I was=
 given to understand that 'initiation' by 'Guru' helps in 
process of learn=
ing vedic knowledge, so much so that even if Guru 
does not explain all the=
 meanings of the mantras/richas, initiation 
by the Guru by itself accelera=
tes the process of learning, akin to as 
mentioned by you in "keep chanting=
 it".

Only someone who has gone through such experience can comment 
regar=
ding the validity of this understanding.

May Lord Shrikrishna bless us wit=
h this Jnan.

regards,
Om Shri Krishnarpanamastu
Himanshu Mohan
