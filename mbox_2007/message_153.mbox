Cloning and Jeevatma

I want to put one thing that is unanswered to me and=
 it haunts my mind 
many a time. During the process of cloning scientists t=
ake out a cell 
from mother but it does not have a jeevatma or "Ansha of Pa=
rmatma". Now 
the question is " How does jeevatma enter into the cloned bod=
y?". Are 
the scientists able to deceive lord Brahma too? It may be typical=
 
question but it has deep sense too.

One more question that haunts me aga=
in and again,"Were our Rishis has 
more powers and expertise in the field o=
f cloing." Maharishi Balmiki 
were able to make "Kush" from a a bush like p=
lant "Kush". So he 
possesed more expertise in cloning(we may name it cloni=
ng).
