Dear Sharat ji,
 
I am glad Manish talked to you and encouraged you. He doe=
s not read this list, but I forwarded your mail to him as he lives in UK li=
ke you. He the one mentioned in the document as having received some instru=
ctions about spreading homam from some elevated beings and later from the M=
other. He is my spiritual master.
 
(1) Yes, big camphor piece is a bad ide=
a. You just need a very very small piece that burns for perhaps 15-20 secon=
ds. That is enough to ignite the dry coconut pieces. Place the pieces such =
that the corners of the pieces are just above the fire. They will catch fir=
e quickly.
 
(2) One half coconut is also not needed. I start with two 1.5"=
x1.5" pieces and go on for 30-40 minutes easily, before introducing more pi=
eces.
 
(3) Darbha (dry auspicious grass) is not a consumer commodity. The =
best thing is to ask a local priest or enquire at a local temple. When you =
go to India, get a big bunch!
 
(5) If you don't have an earthen lamp, you =
can also use a silver or copper or brass or bronze lamp stand that can be b=
ought at an Indian store. Any size is ok. Pour melted ghee or sesame oil in=
 it, put a cotton wick (available at Indian stores) and light it. If this i=
s not possible, use a wax lamp or just a candle.
 
(7) Very soon I will rel=
ease a newer version of audio that is more in sync with the latest document=
 and also is more sensitive to the needs of those who perform homam using i=
t. It will be even easier then.
 
I am glad your homam went well and was a =
good experience. After a few attempts, you will get a hang of it and things=
 will flow smoothly. After a while, you will realize the true impact of hom=
am.
 
Do it again when you are comfortable. All the very best for your futu=
re homas.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha

  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam


  ||Hare Ram Krishna||

  Dear Manish and=
 Narsimha ji,

  Namaskar,

  With  guidance from both of you ,I performed =
the Ganapati Homam successfully today on Krishna Chaturthi. I chose this as=
 per Manish ji's advise and did not see any muhuratha. My humble thanks to =
Manish ji for encouraging me to do this.

  It was a good feeling and I kno=
w how I can improve on this.

  I would suggest for people in a similar pos=
ition( living in multi storeyed apartments):

  1.Minimise use of camphor, =
its smoke set of my smoke alarm once. So keep a closeby window or door to e=
xterior open.

  2. Use smaller piece of coconut initially until one is con=
fident of controlling the agni, I used only one half but felt a smaller pie=
ce would have worked well too.

  3. Problem is in getting the ' auspicous =
grass ' . I coudnt get it hence used ' curry leaves ' but they produce smok=
e so used only very small bits.

  Any ideas on this Manish ji/Narsimha ji?=


  4. Keep plenty of akshatas, as I nearly ran out of them.

  5.Ghee lamp=
..has to be earthen, I didnt have that but will get one from India, so one =
can use a wax lamp.

  6. Incense stick will keep getting burned out so kee=
p lighting them. Keep at least 3 ready.

  7. Co-ordiantion of Homam audio =
and document can be challenging. Keep lap top on power or battery may run o=
ut. Keep it at eye  distance, best to print off pages.

  The audio is exce=
llent and waits for you.

  I would keep the mantras ready to read or memor=
ise them, when I do this again as the speed of audio for unfailiar mantras =
can be daunting.

  Fire can go off, so keep ghee drops pouring, adding cam=
phor gives smoke, use it only when fire has burned out. Coconut burns well =
when the pieces are smaller.

  Best to rehearse with the document, before =
beginning for first time. For food, fruits are practical, the rice I made i=
n MW became very dry..prob needs more practice :)

  Thanks gain for excell=
ent audio and documentation by Manish/Narsimha ji..this is definietly do ab=
le again and again.

  Best wishes

  Sharat Misra
