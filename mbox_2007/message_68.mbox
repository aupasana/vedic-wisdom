Namaskar,
  
 Quite seriously, please do not address me as a  guru. Guru is a very heavy word. It means the remover of the darkness of  ignorance. I am NOT a guru.
  
 If She wants to answer something, She can pick  someone and answer through them. The person in question is just a  nimitta.
  
 Actually, Vasishtha teaches that even a guru is a  nimitta! Then what about someone like me? Everything here is just a  coincidence. She is the master planner. If She wants something to be given to  someone, she will select somebody else as a nimitta for it and make the second  person give that thing to the first person. She is the energy that moves the  entire universe. She is the ichcha sakti (desire), kriya sakti (action) and  jnaana sakti (knowledge) of each being in this creation. It is amazing how She  plans the whole thing.
  
 She is like a master film director who is making a  secretive magnum opus. Imagine a director who has a really complicated script  and shoots one scene with one set of actors and another scene with another set  of actors etc. Each actor only knows the scenes (s)he is in. No actor can figure  out the complete story from the few scenes that (s)he knows. The Mother is like  that. She has a beautiful screenplay and we are all actors playing out roles. We  only know a little bit of the story.
  
 Some people become too attached to the play and  start wondering what the complete story is. They waste their time and energy  wondering what the complete story is or what the next scene is. This does not  improve their performance in their own scenes even one bit. On the contrary,  this guesswork sometimes biases them and they end up messing up their own scenes  due to the mistakened biases.
  
 Now take an actor who leaves it completely to the  director, resigns to the mastery of the director and just does what (s)he is  told to do. Such an actor gives a perfect performance and does not waste any  time or energy in unnecessary activities. Similarly, one who realizes Her  mastery and realizes that She is the doer of everything and considers oneself a  pawn in the hand of a master chess player does not over-analyze everything and  leads a blissful and fruitful life and serves Her agenda perfectly.
  
 This is not a direct comment on what you said, but  an extension of the previous streams of thought...
  
  Thank you for your blessings.
  
Best  regards,
Narasimha

     Dear Kishore,
      
     There are so many practices that are geared      towards creating discipline, reducing ego, overcoming the inner      enemies and purifying oneself.
      
     Any practice will do. However, depending on who      one was earlier and what one did earlier, one may experience different      levels of affinity towards different practices and also get results at      different speeds with different practices.
      
     Normal people can only give you good advice      from THEIR perspective. They cannot give you advice from YOUR perspective.      Only a sadguru, who knows more about the real you than you yourself do, can      give you advice from your perspective. Unfortunately, I am  not      one.
      
     If you want my suggestion nevertheless, here      are some basic suggestions.
      
     (1) In "Yoga Vaasishtham", Maharshi      Vasishtha prescribes company of saints as the first step in acquiring      self-knowledge. Spend some time every week with spiritually      inclined people discussing spiritual matters.
      
     (2) Identify one personal weakness (e.g. anger,      jealosy). Make a sincere effort to overcome it. Whenever the weakness      strikes you (e.g. you become angry), consciously restrain yourself and      divert your mind to something else (e.g. repeating a mantra).
      
     (3) Take a mantra (e.g. Gayatri mantra). Spend      atleast 30 minutes everyday repeating that mantra. Sit comfortably with a      reasonably straight back and closed eyes and repeat the mantra. If your mind      wanders off the mantra and its deity and you get distracted by all kinds of      thoughts, do not worry. Accept it as the nature of mind and make a conscious      effort to pull the mind back into the mantra and its deity.
      
     (4) Before that japa, do a simple pranayama for      5 minutes. Breath in through the right nostril for n seconds, breath out      through the left nostril for n seconds, breath in through the same left      nostril for another n seconds and then breath out through the right nostril      for n seconds. Keep the time duration - n seconds - approximately the same      in all steps. If you want, you can use a small mantra as the measure of time      and say it mentally in each step. Keep repeating this sequence for 5      minutes.
      
     (5) Cultivate the thinking that you do not own      anything. Think that you are just a *temporary caretaker* of things that      seem like your possessions (e.g. you relations, your house, your car and      even your own body, name, fame etc). Tell yourself that all these are god's      property and that you are servant and a temporary caretaker. Just as a      servant working at a rich man's house takes excellent care of things      entrusted to him without developing the "it is mine" attachment to the      things, tell yourself that you too have to take excellent care of all the      things entrusted to you (e.g. your relations, your house, your car, your      body, name, fame etc) while cultivating the "it is god's and not mine"      sense.
      
     This is a very important step and just      keep on trying if you keep failing.
      
     (6) Read a little of some scripture or      teachings of a holy man everyday. Examples are BhagavadGita, Jnaneshwari      etc. I particularly recommend "Gospel of Ramakrishna". Ramakrishna      Parahamahamsa was a great master who taught the highest knowledge in      simplest terms to all kinds of people. Read his teachings with an open mind,      understand them and try to follow them.
      
     *             *        *
      
     If some previous karmas are blocking one's      spiritual progress, one has to either burn those karmas through sadhana or      experience the result of the karmas. Then only the blockage will go away.      There is no other way.
      
     Each minute spent in spiritual sadhana -      including japam, homam etc - contributes to that. No effort is wasted. One      should never get disheartened.
      
     Best      regards,
Narasimha

Dear PVR,

There is a profound        gravitation towards the knowledge flowing here. From the sidelines, I        aspire to learn the basics to better understand your messages. In your        previous mails you suggested Ganapathi Homam as a daily ritual. Your        messages convey a concept that there are umpteen paths to vedic wisdom.        For starters can you please give a list of readings and daily practices.        It could be due to lack of initiation or laziness if we cannot do Homam        what do you think we should start with. 

Namaste,
-Kishore.

From the sidelines, I        aspire to learn the basics to better understand your messages. In your        previous mails you suggested Ganapathi Homam as a daily ritual. Your        messages convey a concept that there are umpteen paths to vedic wisdom.        For starters can you please give a list of readings and daily practices.        It could be due to lack of initiation or laziness if we cannot do Homam        what do you think we should start with. <br><br>Namaste,<br>-Kishore.        <span style="color: white;" width="1"></span><span style="color: white;"></span>    <div>   </div><hr>    <div></div>No virus found in this incoming message.<br>Checked by AVG Free    Edition. <br>Version: 7.5.472 / Virus
