Actually, Vasishtha teaches that even a guru is a nimitta! Then

She is the master=

(4) Before that japa, do a simple pranayama for 5 minutes. 
Breath in throu=

 and then breath out through the right 
nostril for n seconds. Keep the tim=

 you can use a small 
mantra as the measure of time and say it mentally in =
each step. Keep 
repeating this sequence for 5 minutes.

your possessions (e.g. you r=

your own body, name, fame etc). Te=

god's property and that you are servant and=

excellent care of all the things entrusted to you (e.g. your
