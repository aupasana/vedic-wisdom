Dear Narasimha

Thank you for accepting me on your new group.

I try to mak=
e sure that I have access to your writings and 
recordings, as I find them =
very interesting.

I did want to pick your brain on something.

I think you=
 hold the view that the unmanifest Supreme Brahman is the 
origin of all ot=
her forms.

I am from the ISKCON understanding. I am just wondering if you =
knew 
the following:

ISKCONs belief is that the Supreme Brahman certainly =
exists but it is 
the effulgence from Lord Krsna. Just like the sunshine co=
mes from the 
sun globe. 

It is argued that the origin must be full of for=
m. As we can perceive 
things that originate from the origin as having form=
. Therefore the 
origin cannot be any less than what originates from it. 

=
Something can be spiritual and still have form. But spiritual form is 
not =
perceivable to our material eyes.

I wonder what you think of this.

It may=
 be useful for you to read more deeply into the ISKCON 
philosphy. I can pr=
ovide links to the Caitanya Caritamrta, Srimad 
Bhagvatam, Bhagvad Gita if =
you are interested.

Yours benevolently

Kasim
