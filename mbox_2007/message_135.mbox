Sanatana Dharma: Embracing an Infinity of Possibilities

Dr. Frank Morales,=
 Ph.D.
(Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya)


Sanatana Dharma is a religion that=
 has faced over 1000 years of 
brutal battering and horrendous persecution =
at the hands of adherents 
of the Abrahamic religions - specifically Islam =
and Christianity.  
First, the Islamic conquerors attempted to quite litera=
lly physically 
annihilate Dharma =96 killing as many as 100 million Hindus=
, burning 
our libraries and sacred institutions of learning to the ground,=
 
denying us our right to worship, making us third-class citizens in 
our o=
wn nation, and destroying almost every single Hindu temple in 
North India.=
  Then the British came.  When the British Raj was 
established, the Christ=
ians did not attempt to physically annihilate 
Hinduism as the Muslims had =
earlier.  Rather, they attempted a more 
genteel and sophisticated intellec=
tual/cultural/spiritual 
annihilation of what remained of Vedic culture.  W=
e are dealing with 
the negative effects of this less violent form of genoc=
ide to this 
very day.  

Today, as a direct result of this millennium-long=
 persecution, we 
have a Sanatana Dharma that finds itself only now beginni=
ng to arise 
from the smoldering ashes of this 1000 Year Holocaust.  Hindui=
sm is 
only now beginning to reconstruct itself as an authentic, shastra-
b=
ased Sanatana Dharma, to rid itself of all non-Dharmic influences 
over its=
 philosophy and culture, and to begin finally reasserting 
itself again ont=
o the world-stage.  The horrific psychic remnants of 
the anti-Hindu Holoca=
ust have survived, however, and have manifested 
themselves in today's Hind=
us in deeply self-destructive psychological 
terms.  

Hindus have been rel=
entlessly forced to hear from our deceitful 
persecutors for so very long t=
he false propaganda that Hinduism is an 
inferior and unworthy religion, an=
d that Hinduism only leads to 
superstition and poverty.  As a direct resul=
t of generations of such 
brainwashing, today even the most vocal Hindu act=
ivists often find 
themselves suffering from agonizing bouts of self-doubt,=
 passivity, 
impotence, and feelings of utter powerlessness in the face of =
the 
many challenges that Sanatana Dharma is currently facing.  Most 
Hindu=
s today find themselves unable to defend Hinduism from our 
persecutors in =
anything but the most passive, cursory, fearful, and 
weakest of ways.  Too=
 much of the Hindu world has been 
psychologically impacted, and strategica=
lly paralyzed, by what I call 
Impossibility-Thinking =96 the idea that we =
can accomplish no large 
task in the name of Sanatana Dharma, and that our =
religion is somehow 
destined to extinction regardless of what we may attem=
pt to save it.  
This problem is especially seen when it comes to the major=
ity of 
Hindus venturing to acknowledge and embrace the vast potential that=
 
Sanatana Dharma has to offer us personally, and that our religion has 
to=
 offer the world at-large.  

The Hindu world has been infected by Impossib=
ility-Thinking for too 
long. We have allowed ourselves to be convinced tha=
t we are 
powerless, that we are incapable of achieving greatness in Dharma=
. 
The time of such hopelessly negative thinking is over! The era of the 
p=
assive Hindu is over! We need to know that, with Bhagavan's 
blessings and =
grace, anything and everything is possible in His 
service. We need to adop=
t Possibility-Thinking, and know that there 
is no barrier, no obstacle, no=
 enemy, and no challenge that we cannot 
overcome. With such thinking, we w=
ill see Sanatana Dharma change the 
course of world history.  We will see t=
he beginning of the new 
Dharmic Era that will affect every corner of the g=
lobe.  

Sanatana Dharma is the most personally expansive and psychological=
ly 
empowering religion on earth.  It is a path that teaches its 
followers=
 to be fearless, dedicated, focused, strong, assertive, self-
controlled, v=
irtuous, self-reliant, and to strive for excellence in 
all endeavors.  Thi=
s, however, is only the case when Dharma is 
actually followed and practice=
d.  

It is only by embracing the daily practice of Dharma that we can 
beg=
in to access the full potential that we all have lying within.  
Through st=
eadfast practice of the remarkable techniques of Yoga, 
meditation, puja, a=
nd bhakti, all of which are at the very heart of 
Hinduism, God has provide=
d us with powerfully effective tools by 
which we can perfect ourselves and=
 manifest unparalleled excellence 
in our lives.  By practicing a strict re=
gimen of Hindu sadhana, we 
can achieve our utmost potential physically, em=
otionally, mentally, 
intellectually, and spiritually.  It is by practicing=
, and witnessing 
the direct results, of these Dharmic disciplines that we =
can develop 
the self-confidence, healthy assertiveness, fearlessness, inne=
r 
peace, and self-control that are the hallmark of any healthy and well-
b=
alanced person.  It is no longer enough merely to call ourselves 
Hindus, t=
o be merely Nominal-Hindus any more; it is incumbent upon us 
all to practi=
ce Hinduism if we are to experience firsthand what it 
means to live a life=
 that is empowered by the grace of God, and to 
know that in Dharma all thi=
ngs are possible.  

Sanatana Dharma is a religion of the possible.  It is =
a tradition 
that teaches us that anything and everything we can dream is 
=
attainable.  In Sanatana Dharma, we are radically free to perform any 
posi=
tive task, to reach out boldly toward any constructive goal, to 
achieve an=
y dream that our imaginations can reveal.  Dharma frees us 
from the bonds =
of ignorance and fear that bind us, and gives mighty 
wings to realize our =
inner yearning for peace, joy, and unlimited 
freedom.  

Ours has historic=
ally been a religion that has fostered Possibility-
Thinking.  Sanatana Dha=
rma is a religion that reflects the very 
essence of the diverse and infini=
te possibilities that the universe 
has to offer us.  The infinitely expans=
ive range of thinking, 
feeling, and experiential possibilities that the Dh=
armic world-view 
offers is without limit. The Possibility-Thinking that Dh=
arma 
encourages is one reason why we find so many amazing stories, 
wondro=
us deeds, and heroic feats in our scriptures that would 
otherwise defy our=
 common-day imagination.  Only in Sanatana Dharma 
do we find such stories =
as Lord Shiva having the ability to 
fearlessly drink deadly poison from an=
 ocean of milk and yet not die; 
or stories of the divine Sage Narada freel=
y traversing the length and 
breadth of the universe at will in his unendin=
g mission to share 
God's love with all sentient beings; or the story of Ha=
numan bravely 
leaping to Lanka in a single monumental bound to seek out th=
e beloved 
of Lord Rama.  The one thing that these and so many thousands of=
 
similar sacred stories tell us in the boldest of voices is that there 
is=
 no challenge in this world that cannot be overcome in the service 
of the =
Divine.  There is no possibility that is beyond us.  

The scriptures (shas=
tras) and history of Sanatana Dharma are replete 
with the examples of many=
 thousands of brave men and women who 
understood the principle of embracin=
g the oceanic potential of 
Possibility-Thinking.  Numerous sages, rishis, =
yogis, kings and 
queens, and leaders of the Hindu people throughout our hi=
story have 
shown us what can be accomplished when we know that all things =
are 
possible, and that we can achieve anything in Bhagavan's service.  
Ch=
anakya had the determination to drive the Greeks out of Hindu 
India.  Shan=
kara used the power of resolute focus to revive Hinduism 
when it was threa=
tened with extinction.  Ramanuja possessed the 
determined will to revive p=
ure bhakti throughout the length and 
breadth of Bharat.  Shivaji Maharaja =
had the fearless fortitude 
necessary to route the mighty and seemingly inv=
incible Moghul empire, 
and to reestablish the Dharma Nation as a viable mi=
litary-political 
entity.  Vivekananda showed us that Sanatana Dharma is no=
t merely the 
possession of India, but can be realized as the future pre-em=
inent 
world-view of the entire globe.  Prabhupada showed us that Americans=
 
and Europeans and East Asians and Russians and the peoples of the 
entire=
 world can =96 and will - enthusiastically embrace pure and 
authentic Sana=
tana Dharma in their millions.  

Dharma, when practiced, provides us with =
Moksha =96 radical existential 
freedom, and liberation from all the worldl=
y impediments that bind 
us.  Such is the nature of the radical freedom of =
Moksha that we find 
ourselves without the limiting bounds that so affect t=
hose who have 
not tasted the nectar of Brahma-vidya (God-realization).  As=
 servants 
of Dharma and devotees of God, we naturally find that our lives =
can 
be lived without limits.  When we experience the spiritual revolution =

in our lives that the Dharma lifestyle can grant us, our 
possibilities ar=
e then endless.  

By God's grace, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.  =
