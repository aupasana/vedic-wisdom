Be a Conscious Hindu!

By Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.
(Sri Dharma Pravartaka A=
charya

The number of Hindus currently living in our world is truly 
impres=
sive.  According to reliable sources, there are as many as a 
staggering on=
e-billion Hindus in the world today.  There are as many 
as three-million H=
indus living in the U.S. alone.  Indeed, if you 
found yourself drawn to re=
ading this column, you are yourself most 
likely one of this teeming number=
 of self-identified Hindus.  While 
the numbers of Hindus in the world may =
be impressive, however (and 
the numbers are indeed to be seen as a source =
of pride), numbers 
alone don't always point to the actual strength of a re=
ligion.  

The number of adherents of a religion do not, after all, always =

correspond to the quality of the individuals practicing the 
religion.  An=
d it is really the inner strength of the individual 
religious persons that=
 is the source of the outer strength of any 
religion.  This is the case fo=
r Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) as much as 
any other religion.  

Religion is=
 ultimately not just a numbers game.  Rather it is a 
matter of personal co=
nviction, depth of realization, and inner 
spiritual experience.  Religion =
is ultimately a radically personal 
experience, and not just a group dynami=
c or a demographic statistic.  
This truth being the case, I have made a di=
stinction between two 
types of "Hindus" in the world today.  There are wha=
t I call "Nominal 
Hindus" and "Conscious Hindus".  The real question for y=
ou is:  Which 
of these two types of Hindus are you?

A Nominal Hindu is a =
Hindu in name only.  That is, they have no 
difficulty necessarily saying t=
hat they're Hindu.  That comes easy 
enough.  But this mostly cultural iden=
tity is often as far as the 
typical Nominal Hindu is willing to go into ex=
ploring the depths of 
their spirituality.  The real question, of course, i=
s not just are 
you willing to call yourself Hindu=85but are you consciousl=
y and 
sincerely practicing Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism)?  

Like the Nominal=
 Hindu, the Conscious Hindu also has no difficulty 
proclaiming "mein hindu=
 hun."  "I am a Hindu."  But unlike the 
Nominal Hindu, the Conscious Hindu=
 actually knows what this claim 
means=85and he knows so as a result of his=
 own personal experience.  
The Conscious Hindu not only identifies with Sa=
natana Dharma, the 
most ancient and profound spiritual system the world ha=
s ever known, 
but he also has immense pride in this heritage, and isn't af=
raid to 
show it!

More, the Conscious Hindu knows that it is his duty to n=
ot only revel 
in the greatness of Dharmic culture, but that to be a true H=
indu he 
must also do everything in his power to live the life of a Hindu. =
 A 
Conscious Hindu joyfully embraces the Hindu lifestyle.  

As a Consciou=
s Hindu, you must be knowledgeable about the philosophy 
and teachings of S=
anatana Dharma, reading the Bhagavad Gita daily and 
familiarizing yourself=
 with the meaning of Dharma.  More, you must 
know that it isn't enough to =
merely read about Sanatana Dharma, but 
that you must also practice its pri=
nciples (puja, meditation, arati, 
Yoga, etc.) and ethics (non-stealing, no=
t lying, being noble, etc.).  
Finally, it also is not even enough merely t=
o practice Dharma by 
rote, but you must practice with the ultimate end-goa=
l in mind:  The 
goal of Sanatana Dharma =96 Hinduism =96 is to know, and l=
ove, and serve 
Bhagavan =96 God.  The ultimate purpose of both Hinduism, a=
nd life 
itself, is having deep and abiding Bhakti =96 devotion toward God.=
  

It is ultimately only by living your life as a Conscious Hindu - 
recla=
iming your spiritual heritage in Sanatana Dharma and joyously 
practicing t=
his path =96 that you will know the true happiness, peace, 
fulfillment and=
 joy that your spiritual tradition has to offer you.  
Become a Conscious H=
indu, live the Hindu lifestyle, and begin to 
experience the true joy of th=
e presence of God in your life.
