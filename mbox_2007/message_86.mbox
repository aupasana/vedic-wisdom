>> Dear Respected Group Members,
>>
>> I was going though Kirana Agama and in one of the chapters, the

>> techique that I have been trying to practice for some time after
>> suffering from indigestion for some years now. The second resason
>> was that I wanted to attain a level of concentration in my mantra
>> jap. There has been occassions (very seldom though) when I attain a
>> level of concentration higher than what I would attain noramlly and
>> I very much like this feeling.
>>
>> I would like to put some discipline in my appraoch to practice pf
>> pranayam, reading books which illustrates different methods makes me

>> shiv bhakt in this group who has attained a level of proficiency or

>>
>> I am aware of a lot of material on the internet in this matter but
