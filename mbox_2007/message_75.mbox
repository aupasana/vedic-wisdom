Dear Friends,
   
  Pl. go through this priceless article. one of my friends has forwarded it to me. he told me that this article was written by a yogi himself in a local indian language and later translated by his disciples in english.
   
  whatever may be the case. explanation is very refreshing and one can truly APPRECIATE various 'Pranayaam' (Breathing Techniques) after undertstanding this writeup.
   
  To Naranimha Garu--> Pl. save it in the File section as i am not able to do that due to insufficient admin permission (I am at a ermote place).
   
   
  yours,
   
  Utpal Pathak
