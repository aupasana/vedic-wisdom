Om Gurave Namah
Om Gung Ganpataye Namah
Om Hare Rama Krishna
Om Shleem Dhl=
eem Jyotirbrahmaaya Namah

Power of Mantra

Now many people in this group a=
re taking interest in learning Vedic
Astrology and in a very proper manner =
too. So it is right time to reveal
the secret of learning Vedic Astrology. =
Astrology is divine science so
you need blessings of your Guru, Lord Ganesh=
 and other gods. I am
suggesting you to recite the following mantras to rec=
ite one mala daily.

Om Gurave Namah

Om Gang Ganpataye Namah

There are so=
me more mantras but you will not have so much time for it so
I am suggestin=
g you only two.

Those who do not have any Mala (like Tulsi etc.), they may=
 use "Kar
Mala". "Kar" means hand so you will use your hand to count the nu=
mber
Mantras.

You should use your right hand to count mantras. You should =
use your
thumb for counting like in the picture given below,



Note :- You=
 should avoid putting thumb on lines and tip of fingers.

When you complete=
 one cycle of ten, use your left hand and its thumb in
the same manner to c=
ount one cycle. when you have completed the 10 cycle
or 10 x 10 =3D 100 tim=
es (menas you have recited the Mantras 100 times
till now) you would have c=
ompleted the 10 points on left hand too.

Now remove thumb from left hand a=
nd count the balance 8 Mantras in the
following manner.



Now you one Mala=
 of 108 Mantras is complete. So you do not need any type
of mala to recite =
the mantras. Kar Mala is very very powerful too.

Important :- After some m=
onths you will see the difference in your
vision. There will be unbelievabl=
e changes in you learning capacity -
UNBELIEVABLE UNBELIEVABLE UNBELIEVABLE=
 CAPACITY TO LEARN VEDIC
ASTROLOGY. IT IS MY PROMISE.

with regards

sushil=
 dikshit
