Freinds,

I quote here the Extract from swami Chinmayananda's book - 'Talk=
s on
Sankara's Vivekchodamani'

Intrested ones will get a clear idea of the=
 peerless Shankaracharya's
teachings just by going thro' following extract.=
 I personally found the
following example given by Swami Chinmayananda, a v=
ery apt one and
perfectly convincing.

------------------------------------=
------------------------------------\
-------------------------------------=
----
Then what is Avidya?

All that we can say about it is that it is a 'gr=
eat wonder!' It can only
be said to be indescribable (Anirvachaneeya). Ther=
e is wonder when the
intellect is not able to comprehend a thing. anything =
that i see and my
intellect can not explain, i say is a 'wonder'. The more =
i think about
this avidya, the more my intellect fails, because this aviday=
 is the
very cause for the intellect. The intellect cannot comprehend its o=
wn
cause because it is the child born out of Maya and a child cannot go
bac=
k to look for the womb. This Maya when it menifests, becomes the
intellect.=
 Therefore, the intellect cannot comprehend the unmanifest
which is its own=
 cause. The effect cannot, by itself, comprehend its own
cause. Maya is als=
o called a "Delusion", and a delusion can never be
explained. There cannot =
be a biography of the ghost i saw on the post,
nor can i grow rich by extra=
cting 'silver' from the mother-of-pearl.
This Maya-Shakti, we can only say,=
 is an indescribable, mighty,
inscrutable power of the Lord. Strange, for b=
y his own inscrutable power
a person deludes himself and says, "Tell me, te=
ll me what is this power?
Where is it?"

    A brahmin boy, one day, went t=
o meet his friends in a students'
hostel. That being the festival day of Ho=
li, the boy's friends were
preparing 'Thandai'- a cool drink in which a bit=
 of opium is also added.
In order to tease him they gave him a strong dose =
of the opium drink.
The boy not being used to it, gupled it down somehow, u=
nable to refuse
his friends' offer. As the opium started having effect on h=
im, he
thought of going home. He felt that he could not go alone, so he sta=
rted
shouting, "Take me home! Take me home!" Now he was under the full
infl=
uence of the intoxicant, and he shouted even more loudly, "Take me
home! Ta=
ke me home!"

   Then one of his friends took pity on him. He led him home =
and made him
lie down on his bed. Not realising where he was, the boy conti=
nued
shouting, "Take me home!" Hearing his meaningless shouts, his parents
=
rushed to is bedside. They tried to tell him that he was already at
home. B=
ut the boy would not stop his blabbering. Suspecting some
mischief, the fat=
her questioned his friend and found out that he was
under the intoxicating =
influence of opium. He then fetched some
buter-milk which is an antidote an=
d made him drink it. When he had drunk
the butter-milk, the boy, in time, s=
tarted coming to his senses. But he
continued shouting, "Take me home!" Aft=
er some time, he became fully
conscious that he was reclining in his own be=
d, shouting, "Take me
home!" In a flesh he realised how folish he was, that=
 there was no need
for him to shout, for he was already home. so he stopped=
 shouting and
thereafter, slept peacefully.

Similarly, we, at the moment, =
under the influence of the opium of
avidya-'non-apprehension' of reality, c=
onsider ourselves to be the
body-mind-intellect and are supremely confused =
by the objects perceived,
emotions felt and thoughts entertained. We cry ou=
t, "O Lord! O Teacher!
Take me home. Give me peace. Make me happy!" Take yo=
u where? Give you
what? In Reality you are the self, but due to avidya, you=
 live and
behave as though you are an ego.

Take me to myself. Give me my o=
wn self. You are already in Om, which is
your home. Your home is really Om.=
 Never were you out of Om, your home.
Hurry home! Hari Om!

You ask, "Then =
why am i sufering?" All on account of this opium, the
*Avidya*, which is wi=
thin you. The Guru, the Teacher, will give you the
butter-milk of the 'stud=
y of the Shastras', 'Spiritual discipline', etc.
All these for what? To tak=
e you home which is Om, where you already are.

Lack of correct thinking pr=
oduces misconceptions. Think rightly. All
misery will end. The text that te=
aches us to think correctly and
discriminate properly is the Vivekchoodaman=
i, the
Crest-Jewel-of-Descrimination.
