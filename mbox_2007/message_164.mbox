  Subjec=
t: [vedic-wisdom] Pronunciation error and/or corruption? Question about Gan=
esha Mantra


  This email below and Narasimhaji's previous email re:Pronun=
ciation
  errors brought up a question that I have had for quite some time =
now:

  Sushil-ji wrote the Ganesha mantra below as
  "Om Gung Ganpataye Na=
mah"

  In other places, I have seen "Om Gan Ganapathaye Namah", as well as=
 
  "Om Gam Ganapathaye Namah".

  Will the learned folks kindly provide th=
eir guidance on what the right
  version is, and hopefully provide pronunci=
ation tips as well?

  Many Thanks in advance!
