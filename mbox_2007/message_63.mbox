Namaste Sir,
 
There is another angle. A priest may have gotten used to the=
 fast style because of others and not due to lack of devotion. Fast reading=
 of mantras does not prove a lack of devotion (though it sometimes indicate=
s that). A priest may pronounce mantras incorrectly or very fast, but may h=
ave the highest level of devotion in his heart. If such a priest calls gods=
, they WILL come. Gods do not do nitpicking about your pronunciation or pro=
cedure or speed, when your devotion and effort makes them happy. Shiva was =
pleased with the meat offering Kannappa who did not know how to worship!
 
=
When scriptures refer to Sabda Brahman, the "sabda" (vibration) referred to=
 there is not just the physical audible sound. When we say a mantra, the th=
oughts, the images and the movement of praana in the mind also accompany th=
e sound as subtler levels of sabda. Out of the 4 levels of sabda (vaikhari,=
 madhyama, pasyanti and para), the audible sound that results in vibration =
of the gross matter around us is only the grossest level (vaikhari). The ot=
her levels cause vibration in the subtle matter around us. An advanced yogi=
 may be able to hear (not with ears) those vibrations too. Those vibrations=
 are a more important part of the sabda.
 
Even a person who reads a mantra=
 perfectly may produce wrong sabda if his thoughts are wandering. One who p=
ronounces incorrectly but has his mind firmly focussed on the Lord produces=
 an almost perfect sabda and reaches Him.
 
*        *        *
 
Though I =
urge people to make an effort - as stated in the previous mail - to pronoun=
ce mantras slower and better, I urge them NOT to judge others around them. =
It is dangerous. Judge yourself and not others.
 
If you can do a pooja you=
rself, it is always a good idea to do that.
 
But, when you call a priest t=
o your house to perform a pooja, don't judge him and just think of him as S=
hiva. Think that Shiva Himself came to your house and doing that pooja. Bel=
ieve that in all sincerity and surrender. Then, you will get the perfect fr=
uits of the pooja, no matter how the priest reads the mantras, no matter ho=
w much he hurries and no matter how much his devotion is! All that is HIS k=
arma. If you truly accept him as Shiva and take his deeds as Shiva's deeds,=
 your karma is pure.
 
*        *        *
 
>   Unfortunately, we are not =
living in the best of times and
> possibility times are going to get even w=
orse.
 
There is a silver lining to every cloud.
 
Compared to Krita/Sathya=
 yuga, the overall dharma in this Kali yuga is 1/4th. However, the dharma f=
ollowed by an average person today is probably 1/100th or 1/1000th of the d=
harma followed by an average person in Krita yuga. How is it then that the =
average dharma is 1/4th?
 
Obviously, there are some souls somewhere, who a=
re engaged in great tapascharya and pulling up the average dharma for the b=
enefit of the world. Thus, even though we "are not living in the best of ti=
mes", there are places and people where "the best of times" is maintained. =
If it gets "even worse", the sections that are maintaining dharma will get =
even better. SHE ensures that. One can volunteer for that work and seek Her=
 blessings.
 
Each fall is a new opportunity to rise. Each falling soul is =
a new opportunity for you to serve.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
