Omaha, NE, USA


Historical Precedent

The=
 Hindu Temple of Nebraska, LTD, is proud to announce the 
appointment of Dr=
. Frank Morales, Ph.D. (Sri Dharma Pravartaka 
Acharya) as the Resident Sch=
olar and Acharya of our temple.  

Throughout the long history of the Hindu=
 religious tradition, Hindu 
temples have customarily had an officiating Ac=
harya =96 or resident 
teacher =96 who was responsible for the education an=
d spiritual 
guidance of the community, and for conducting spiritual teachi=
ng, 
classes, and instruction.  It is in the spirit of this ancient Hindu 
=
tradition that the Hindu Temple of Nebraska has created this office.  

Eve=
n though Hindu temples have existed in America for many decades 
now, this =
appointment represents the first time in American history 
that any of the =
over 1000 existing Indian Hindu temples has 
officially appointed an Achary=
a to over see their educational 
activities.  While this is an ancient offi=
ce in India, it is a first 
time occurrence in the West.  Moreover, it is a=
lso a groundbreaking 
development that this first ever Acharya is not of In=
dian origin, but 
is a practicing American Hindu of Italian and Spanish eth=
nicity.
