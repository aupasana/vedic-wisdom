Namaste friends,

When I found a really nice muhurta a few months back, I s=
tarted a yahoogroup called "vedic-wisdom" to discuss the hidden meanings in=
 Vedas, Upanishats, Puranas etc. I plan to occasionally post my random thou=
ghts on the list, mostly on spiritual/philosophical matters.

Please excuse=
 me for posting this on astrology lists. In future, I will move all my non-=
astrological spiritual mails to this yahoogroup and stop posting on the ast=
rology related lists. If you are interested, please subscribe to vedic-wisd=
om yahoogroup. You can see the archives without subscribing at:

http://gro=
ups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/messages

Please note that it is not inten=
ded to be a high volume list and instead meant to be an archive of my writi=
ngs on spiritual matters and deeper meanings of scriptures. I will not writ=
e everyday, but only occasionally.

*        *        *

The following Vedi=
c hymn is used at the beginning of several Vedic homas (fire rituals), when=
 the Fire god is welcome into the fire pit. It is verse 4.58.3 from RigVeda=
 and 12.10 from MahaNarayanopanishad. This text is in ITrans transliteratio=
n.

catvAri shR^iMgAstrayo asya pAdA dve shIrShe saptahastAso asya |
tridhA=
 baddho vR^iShabho roravIti maho devo martyAm Avivesha ||

Literal translat=
ion: "He has 4 horns, 3 legs, 2 heads and 7 hands. This bull is tied 3-ways=
 and roars splendidly. This supreme god possesses all beings."

Obviously, =
this has to be interpreted figuratively and not literally. Here is my inter=
pretation:

This verse extols the role played by Agni, fire god. The Agni b=
urns within us as the bhootaagni in the subtle body. It burns as jatharaagn=
i and others in the gross body. It drives all our actions.

Shringa not onl=
y means a horn, but also a summit or a pinnacle. Agni is the fire witin us =
and is the basis for all our actions. The four purusharthas (purposes of th=
e existence of a being - dharma, artha, kaama and moksha) that we fulfill t=
hrough our actions are the four peaks of the Agni that provokes us to act. =
The crowns from the actions of Agni within us are these four purusharthas.
=

Legs are the basis on which one stands. They provide the foundation and ba=
sis. The three gunas - sattva, rajas and tamas - are the basis for the Agni=
 within us. It stands on the basis of our gunas and provokes us to act. If =
the three gunas did not exist, the Agni within us could still exist as chid=
agni (the existential fire), but it wouldn't move (chetana). The three guna=
s are fundamental to the movement (chetana) of chidagni, which enables all =
our actions. That is why this Agni within us that provokes us to act has 3 =
legs.

Seersha not only means head, but also means the front portion or wha=
t is seen. It basically refers to the identity, how one comes across. The t=
wo fronts of this Agni that provokes all actions within us are Purusha and =
Prakriti - the male and female energies. Surya and Chandra nadis (Pingala a=
nd Ida) within the subtle body represent these two fronts of the Agni that =
makes us act. They represent actions in the gross body through the sympathe=
tic nervous system and parasympathic nervous system, respectively. One is t=
he face of objective thinking and actions of an active nature, while the ot=
her is the face of subjective thinking and actions of a passive nature. The=
 Agni that burns within us and makes us act results in various actions that=
 wear one of these two as the front/face.

Hands are the karmendriyas. It i=
s with hands that we act in the world. They are the acting agents. The fire=
 that burns within us acts through the physical body and its tissues. The d=
haatvagnis (fires burning in the seven dhatus or tissues of the vital body)=
 are the seven hands of the master fire burning within us and making us act=
. Through them, the fire carries out all its actions.

This fire of action =
is tied with 3 ropes. The tridoshas of beings - kapha, pitta and vaata - ar=
e the 3 ropes with which it is tied and its actions are restrained and also=
 kept in balance by these 3 ropes!

This fire within us roars like a bull a=
nd is responsible for all our thoughts and actions. It is this fire that is=
 responsible for the actions of every being in this creation - from Brahma =
to Vishnu to Shiva to you and I. This fire possesses all beings and make th=
em act in this world.

Thus, this hymn eloquently describes the subtle natu=
re of the bhootaagni that burns within us and that is responsible for all o=
ur actions. Though we invoke an external fire when performing homam, it is =
supposed to represent (and strengthen in the course of time) the internal f=
ire. No wonder a hymn giving this detailed and symbolic description of the =
internal fire is chanted when establishing the fire in the homa kundam!

Ma=
y the light of Brahman shine within,
Narasimha
