Namaste everyone!

Thankyou Moderator for accepting me as a member. i look =
forward to 
discussions on this forum.

recently i started reading the upan=
ishads (unfortunately, only a 
translation).

The opening lines of the Brih=
ad Aranyaka talks of Ashwa Medha. The 
imagery is very powerful.

"Om! Veri=
ly, the dawn is the head of the sacrificial horse; the sun, 
his eye; the w=
ind his breath; universal fire, his open mouth. The year 
is the body; the =
sky, his back; the atmosphere his belly; the earth, 
the underpart of his b=
elly; the quarters his flanks; the intermediate 
quarters, his ribs; the se=
asons his limbs; the months and half months 
his joints; the days and night=
 his fee; the stars his bones; the clouds 
his flesh. Sand is the food inhi=
s stomach; rivers are his entrails. His 
liver and lungs are the mountains;=
 plants and trees his hair. The 
orient is his fore part; the occident his =
hind part. When he yawns then 
it lightens. Whe he shakes himself it thunde=
rs. When he urinates then 
it rains. Voice indeed is his voice"

If one let=
s the imagination go wild then the concept of birth (dawn) / 
rising ascend=
ant, (and therefore also death of the sacrificial horse?); 
the atman; the =
elements; the space; the time; the energies; the 
physical; the five senses=
; everything appears to be there. in the very 
first shloka.

The theme of =
sacrifice / sacrificial oblations, etc. occur again and 
agian throughout t=
he text of this Upanishad.

My questions are:

why, is it essential to use =
imagination to understand what is written? 
Does that mean that each person=
 has to experience the meaning on his or 
her own depending on his or her a=
wareness? Then the question is how 
real is imagination? Can we depend on i=
t to understand things? 
correctly? The shlokas appear to be so  multi-laye=
red /multi-
dimensional that there is no "logical" way to understand them (=
assuming 
of course, that imagination does not relate to logic)!

But most =
important of all: WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF SACRIFICE IN 
EXISTENCE??? WHY =
THE SYMBOL OF ASHWA MEDHA?

Does it have something to do with movement from=
 gross to the subtle? 
Self purification?

Would love to hear the views of =
others.
