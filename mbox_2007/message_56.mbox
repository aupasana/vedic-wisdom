The Teachings of the Bhagavad Gita

Marks of a Self-Realized Person

Lord K=
rishna said: When one is completely free from all desires of 
the mind and =
is satisfied with the Supreme Being by the joy of 
Supreme Being, then one =
is called an enlightened person, O Arjuna. 
(2.55)

A person whose mind is =
unperturbed by sorrow, who does not crave 
pleasures, and who is completely=
 free from attachment, fear, and 
anger, is called an enlightened sage of s=
teady intellect. (2.56)

The mind and intellect of a person become steady w=
ho is not attached 
to anything, who is neither elated by getting desired r=
esults, nor 
perturbed by undesired results. (2.57)

When one can completel=
y withdraw the senses from the sense objects as 
a tortoise withdraws its l=
imbs into the shell for protection from 
calamity, then the intellect of su=
ch a person is considered steady. 
(2.58)

The desire for sensual pleasures=
 fades away if one abstains from 
sense enjoyment, but the craving for sens=
e enjoyment remains in a 
very subtle form. This subtle craving also comple=
tely disappears from 
the one who knows the Supreme Being. (2.59)

Overcoming Depr=
ession with Meditation

by Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.
(Sri Dharma Pravartaka =
Acharya)


Modern America is a land of many interesting, and often painfull=
y 
ironic, contradictions.  On the one hand, we supposedly enjoy more 
pros=
perity, longevity, comforts, and conveniences in the United 
States than an=
y other civilization has even dreamed of in previous 
history.  Supposedly.=


On the other hand, however, America is currently going through one of 
th=
e biggest mental health crises that any nation in history has ever 
experie=
nced.  Various forms of depression, anxiety disorders and 
neuroses are aff=
ecting millions of Americans.  Depressive disorders 
affect approximately 1=
8.8 million American adults, or about 9.5% of 
the U.S. population age 18 a=
nd older in any given year. For those 
cases of depression that are reporte=
d, many more remain unreported, 
and thus unknown.  This current mental hea=
lth crisis includes such 
ailments as major depressive disorder, dysthymic =
disorder, and 
bipolar disorder.  

What is especially disturbing is that d=
epression is increasingly a 
common occurrence among the nation's young, a =
demographic that should 
be enjoying the fun and carefree life usually asso=
ciated with 
childhood.  Pre-schoolers are the fastest-growing market for 
=
antidepressants. At least four percent of preschoolers -- over a 
million! =
-- are considered clinically depressed.  CNN recently 
reported on a study =
that revealed that as many as 3 million teenagers 
contemplated suicide in =
2006.  The rate of increase of depression 
among children is an astounding =
23%.

30% of women are depressed. Men's figures were previously thought to =

be half that of women, but new estimates show that the actual figures 
are=
 higher than at first suspected. 

Depression will be the second largest ki=
ller after heart disease by 
2020 -- and medical studies have shown that de=
pression is a 
contributory factor to fatal coronary disease. 

Depression =
results in more absenteeism and loss of employment than 
almost any other p=
hysical disorder, and costs employers more than 
US$51 billion per year in =
absenteeism and lost productivity, not 
including high medical and pharmace=
utical bills. 

The treatment modalities often used in the attempt to comba=
t 
depression are diverse and have varied results.  Some of these 
treatmen=
ts include talk therapy and anti-depression medications.  
Currently, sever=
al million Americans are on various anti-depressants, 
including Prozac, Le=
xapro, and Amitriptyline.  Many of these anti-
depression medications have =
had only mixed results.  

Antidepressants work for 35% to 45% of the depre=
ssed population, 
while more recent figures suggest as low as 30%. Standard=
 
antidepressants, SSRIs such as Prozac, Paxil (Aropax) and Zoloft, 
have r=
ecently been revealed to have serious risks, and are linked to 
suicide, vi=
olence, psychosis, abnormal bleeding, and brain tumors. 

Though most docto=
rs advise a combination of therapy and 
antidepressants, cognitive behavior=
al therapy (CBT) has an 80% 
relapse rate in the long term. 

While medicat=
ion and therapy can often take the edge off of the 
experience of depressio=
n, they are far from successful in all 
instances.  The only truly effectiv=
e cure lies in going to the root 
of depression.  That root is ultimately s=
piritual in nature.  

Depression is itself only a direct symptomatic manif=
estation of the 
radical secularization of human society.  Previous to secu=
lar 
modernity, depression was a much less prevalent phenomenon.  And when =

it was experienced, the reasons were more clearly environmental and 
causa=
l than they are now.  In the past, depression was directly 
associated with=
 a specific event or occurrence in the person's life 
that directly caused =
the depression.  Today, however, an increasing 
number of depressed persons=
 are experiencing more generalized 
depression, a type of general existenti=
al angst, the exact cause of 
which it is difficult for them to pinpoint.  =
Some of the leading 
causes of depression today include a sense of meaningl=
essness; 
consuming and generalized fear; spiritual crises, and the high 
d=
egrees of stress and anxiety that has become accepted as normal in 
modern,=
 radically secularized, everyday life.  

For younger people, especially, w=
hen asked why they are experiencing 
deep depression, many youth will point=
 to a complete sense of 
meaninglessness in their lives.  The don't know wh=
y they are here, 
what their purpose in life is, why they are bothering to =
learn and 
work hard, and why our present-day, materialistic society is gea=
red 
in such a way as to provide them with no real answers to their quest 
=
for meaning.  While pop culture, technology, and the youth scene 
serves as=
 a temporary outlet for many teens, more often than not it 
only serves to =
tremendously exacerbate the problem of depression.  

Secular modernity pre=
sents us with a social-philosophical construct 
that is artificial, anti-na=
tural, and ultimately destructive and 
unhealthy in nature.  In our society=
, we have been deprived of the 
age-tested, fundamental vehicles through wh=
ich we can excel 
spiritually, intellectually, and culturally.  Spiritualit=
y and 
Dharma, which form the basis of all meaningful human growth and 
pro=
gress, has been systematically and viciously erased from modern 
secular so=
cieties to such a radical extent that hundreds of millions 
of persons worl=
dwide are vividly feeling the ill effects of a life 
devoid of meaning, val=
ue, nobility, goodness, heroism, and the quest 
for Truth.  

The search fo=
r truth has been replaced in the lives of billions with 
the search for ent=
ertainment.  

Rather than encouraging such spiritual values as courage, no=
bility, 
and heroism, the modern world today encourages the coldly 
unsatis=
fying propaganda of radical egalitarianism.  Rather than 
encouraging the n=
urturing of the inner life of the spirit, and the 
natural joy, peace and f=
ulfillment that results from a healthy 
spiritually-centered life, today it=
 is only selfish economic 
advancement and the value of purchasing power th=
at is advocated.  
Rather than a lifestyle of mental, physical and spiritua=
l health, 
today lifestyles of selfish hedonism, consumerism, greed, fame, =
and 
lust are upheld as the ideal course of behavior, and the values 
towar=
d which all should aspire.  

Dharma, the principle of living one's life in=
 accordance with Natural 
Law and God's will in a manner that is healthy, f=
ulfilling, 
nurturing, and truly progressive, has now been replaced with an=
 
artificial and life-denying lifestyle that only produces a profound 
sens=
e of meaninglessness and anxiety.  

The ultimate cure for society's presen=
t crisis of depression and 
meaninglessness is to re-embrace a life of mean=
ing, a life of 
Dharma.  Dharma, by its very definition, denotes the sustai=
ning 
foundation of all reality.  Dharma is the concept that all that we 
e=
xperience in this world is based upon a higher, spiritual reality 
that pro=
vides the ordering principles necessary for the proper 
function of the wor=
ld.  To understand Dharma is to understand the 
world, and the natural laws=
 behind all things that make life a 
meaningful and beautiful expression of=
 the Divine in spacial-temporal 
reality.  To know Dharma is to know life's=
 ultimate meaning.  And the 
way to fully know Dharma is through the proces=
s of meditation.  

For millennia, a spiritually based practice of meditati=
on has been 
shown to be very effective in combating such problems as stres=
s, 
anxiety, fear, and feelings of meaninglessness.  Because meditation 
ad=
dresses the root causes of depression and anxiety, the time honored 
techni=
ques of meditation can be a much more effective cure for 
depression than e=
ither talk-therapy or medication.  

Meditation is a natural, easy and prov=
en method that has been shown 
in hundreds of clinical studies to bring abo=
ut deep states of peace, 
calm and mental clarity.  In addition, a specific=
ally spiritual 
regimen of daily meditation can help to foster a deep sense=
 of 
meaning and spiritual comfort.  

Meditation has been shown to work on=
 two distinct levels: a) the 
cognitive level, and b) the spiritual level. =
 On the cognitive level, 
meditation helps to bring about a deep equipoise =
and a calming relief 
to one's overactive mind.  Today, especially, the min=
d is constantly 
bombarded with an unending stream of diverse information -=
 some 
valuable, most useless.  As a direct result of such information 
bom=
bardment, the mind is in an almost constant state of agitation and 
confusi=
on.  Meditation serves to calm the mind, allowing our 
attention to shift f=
rom the storm of external stimuli to the deep 
inner peace that is the natu=
ral state of the soul.  As a consequence 
of having a calm mind, we then fi=
nd that we can think and make 
important decisions with much more clarity, =
insight, and power.  We 
are now able to process information in a way that =
serves us, rather 
than merely being the victims of myriad sensory impressi=
ons and 
information overload.

On the more spiritual level, meditation has=
 the ability to provide us 
with deep levels of self-realization and God-re=
alization that, up 
till now, may have seemed to be impossible attainments =
to many of 
us.  By meditating with the expressed goal of making spiritual =

progress, and knowing God and self, we then traverse beyond the 
merely co=
gnitive and mental, and begin to penetrate the inner realms 
of eternal spi=
rit.  When we have self-realization, we now experience 
the transcendent pe=
ace and calm that is the natural result of living 
in spirit.  When we have=
 God-realization, we are now in communion 
with the very source of our bein=
g, the eternal, loving Absolute who 
is our very best of friends, and great=
est of well-wishers.  In such a 
transcendent state of spiritual attainment=
, no anxiety, stress, 
depression, or fear can ever burden our minds or hea=
rts again.  For 
we have now, through the process of spiritual meditation, =
realized 
the infinite well of spiritual peace that lies naturally within. =
 

The root cause of most depression today, then, is the pervasive sense 
o=
f meaninglessness that naturally accompanies life in a radically 
seculariz=
ed, materialistic society.  The cure to such existential 
meaninglessness i=
s to partake profoundly in the spiritual nature of 
our true selves and the=
 spiritual foundations underlying our everyday 
concerns.  The artificial c=
onstruct of materialism needs to be 
replaced with Dharma, and the natural =
lifestyle and spiritual way of 
being that Dharma teaches us to embrace.  T=
he most effective way of 
accessing the spiritual reality that is our true =
self, and thus to 
over-come the unnatural state of depression, is God-cent=
ered 
meditation as taught in the ancient tradition of Sanatana Dharma.
