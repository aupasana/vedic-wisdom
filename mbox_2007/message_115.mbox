Dear Sharat ji,

I believe deepa homam can be performed with a deepam, with drops of oil 
offered into the deepam with mantras. However, compared to fire in regular 
homam, fire in a deepa homam is restricted and unfree. Thus, a regular homam 
is far more effective than a deepa homam.

But, if you have no better choice, it can certainly be considered.

Some people living in apartments in USA have performed Mahaganapathi homam, 
but I am not that familiar with UK.

If you use dry coconut pieces only (i.e. no wood) and put the right amount 
of ghee, it actually generates hardly any smoke. However, that takes a 
little bit of practice. Doing the homam near a window and keeping the window 
open can also help.

There is a smoke detector right next to the door (which is always kept open) 
of the room in which I do my daily homam at my house. It goes off very 
rarely.

If Ganapathi wants you to worship Him in fire, He will show you the way.

Best regards,
Narasimha
