Dear Rohini Ji,
Namaste.
I humbly share my=
 understanding here, though not as detailed as 
expected by you.

For learn=
ing of Vedas, one has to be 'initiated' or in common 
parlance has to be gi=
ven 'Mantra'. It is this Mantra, which when 
recired regularly with devotio=
n which opens up thedors of all 
spiritual and Vedic knowledge for the pers=
on.

As regards the disallowance of Veda learning to the ladies, there is 
=
ample proof available that this is a later development, maybe during 
the p=
resent post-Mughal era.

Apala, Ashwaghosha and so many others are the ladi=
es held in high 
esteem due to their Vedic knowledge. Leelvati, daughter-in=
-law of 
great Varahamihira is also a renowned name for her astrological 
a=
ccumen, again in a vedanga. This however relates to Kaliyuga itself, 
there=
fore we can not ascribe the disallowance women of Veda-learning 
to the Kal=
iyuga.

In the Hindu (Sanatana) Culture, earlier Yajnopavita/Upanayan 
sams=
kara (Sacred thread ceremony) was held for the women also, after 
which the=
y were considered eligible for the Veda learning. Now-a-days 
this sacred t=
hread ceremony is held for the males only, and probably 
this is somehow re=
lated to the tradition.

During this Yajnopavita samskara, one is also give=
n a Guru-mantra, 
which is the key to all knowledge as it opens the doors o=
f the 
learning process for the Batuka, the person who is being given the 
=
thread and Mantra.

Even now, any traditional knowledge, be it astrology (a=
 vedanga), 
Vedas, or even for the music learning from any classical GHARAN=
As, 
the disciple is initiated through a ceremony, given mantra; or 
a "GAN=
DA" or talisman is tied by the guru on the arm of the Shishya 
(disciple) b=
efore the teachings begin. This "GANDA" or talisman again 
contains a mantr=
a written on some piece of paper or birch-bark (Bhoja-
patra).
So it boils =
down to the "Mantra" that establishes a rapport between 
the Guru and the S=
hishya. Well, learning of Vedas is therefore not 
allowed without subscribi=
ng to a Guru, being a spiritual knowledge.

There are various criteria to d=
ebar one from learning Vedas, 
enumerated in Manu-smriti and other scriptur=
es; and this 
inelligibility of women is a long-drawn extension from such c=
riteria.

regards,
