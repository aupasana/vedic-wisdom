Namaste Kasim,

Maharshi Vasishtha held that v=
iew and taught it to Lord Rama. Vasishtha's teachings to Rama were later re=
peated by Maharshi Valmiki to Maharshi Bharadwaja. They are captured in a c=
lassic called "Yoga Vaasishtham". For any sincere seeker of the Highest Tru=
th who is attracted to Adwaita, "Yoga Vaasishtham" is a must-read book.
 
>=
 Something can be spiritual and still have form. But spiritual form is

ot perceivable to our material eyes.
> I wonder what you think of this.
 
W=
hether you are talking about a form made of gross matter (e.g. a human bein=
g) or a form made only of subtle ethereal matter (e.g. a god), it has some =
"attributes" (gunas). Attributes are attributes, whether gross or subtle. T=
hey are limiting.
 
A form with attributes can be perceived by the mind (th=
rough the senses of the gross body in the former case and through the subtl=
e perception in the latter) while mind is still mind. It is only the formle=
ss reality that cannot be perceived by the mind while it is a mind. Only wh=
en mind ceases does the duality of the world cease and the reality that is =
not limited by any attributes is revealed.
 
So, my definition of a form is=
 not what is "perceivable to our material eyes". It is what can be perceive=
d by the mind through senses or subtle perception, in its various levels of=
 existence. My definition of formless reality is that which is revealed whe=
n mind ceases to exist.

Hindu philosoph=
y as outlined by Upanishads is a very vast and complex one. When Kali Yuga =
started, it seems to me like some great souls were born on this earth to si=
mplify and slightly re-adjust the teachings of Upanishads to make them more=
 palatable and understandable to the masses. A simplified and systematic re=
ligion that people can appreciate is perhaps better in Kali Yuga than a com=
plicated philosophy that seems self-contradictory and alienates people.
 
T=
hus, I respect the works of several great souls and consider each work to b=
e an important one, but I am clear about my own path.
 
As far as Bhagavad =
Gita is concerned, it is the highest teaching of the Absolute Reality. The =
commentary on Bhagavad Gita by Jnaneshwar (a great saint from Maharashtra) =
is the one that I like the most. It is unabashedly Adwaitic (non-dualistic)=
. I cannot reconcile most other commentaries with the teachings of Upanisha=
ds and the teachings of Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama. However, Jnaneshwa=
r's interpretation fits perfectly with the rest.
 
A literal English transl=
ation of the Marathi commentary (containing the original Sanskrit verses al=
so) is available at
 
http://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Sw=
ami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648/sr=3D8-1/qid=3D1171905959/ref=3Dsr_1_1/105-846=
6969-7236409?ie=3DUTF8&s=3Dbooks
 
*        *        *
 
I humbly suggest t=
hat you should follow the path that you feel comfortable with. We need not =
convince each other. Whether you follow Dwaita or Adwaita, the first steps =
are the same.If you follow the teachings of your gurus sincerely, you will =
get there. The final goal is almost the same. For one who lives in USA, Del=
hi and Agra are almost the same distance. First get to India and then you c=
an figure out whether to go to Delhi or Agra. The journey to India it a lon=
g one. Similarly, whether you want the highest dwaitic experience or the ad=
waitic (non-)experience, the distance between them is quite small compared =
to the distance a normal person has to either!
 
May the light of Brahman s=
hine within,
Narasimha

  Dear Narasimha

  Th=
ank you for accepting me on your new group.

  I try to make sure that I ha=
ve access to your writings and 
  recordings, as I find them very interesti=
ng.

  I did want to pick your brain on something.

  I think you hold the =
view that the unmanifest Supreme Brahman is the 
  origin of all other form=
s.

  I am from the ISKCON understanding. I am just wondering if you knew 
=
  the following:

  ISKCONs belief is that the Supreme Brahman certainly ex=
ists but it is 
  the effulgence from Lord Krsna. Just like the sunshine co=
mes from the 
  sun globe. 

  It is argued that the origin must be full of=
 form. As we can perceive 
  things that originate from the origin as havin=
g form. Therefore the 
  origin cannot be any less than what originates fro=
m it. 

  Something can be spiritual and still have form. But spiritual for=
m is 
  not perceivable to our material eyes.

  I wonder what you think of=
 this.

  It may be useful for you to read more deeply into the ISKCON 
  p=
hilosphy. I can provide links to the Caitanya Caritamrta, Srimad 
  Bhagvat=
am, Bhagvad Gita if you are interested.

  Yours benevolently

  Kasim
