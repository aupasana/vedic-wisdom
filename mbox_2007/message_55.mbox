Embracing the Meaning of Our Human Existence

By Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.  =

(Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya)


Who among us has never, at some contempl=
ative point in our lives or 
another, asked ourselves the truly big questio=
ns, questions about the 
ultimate meaning of this world, and of our lives i=
n it?  Questioning 
the reason for our human existence is a very natural pu=
rsuit on the 
part of any human being.  Indeed, unlike any other species of=
 life, 
human beings alone have been gifted by God with the unique cognitiv=
e 
ability to engage in self-reflection upon our very own existence as 
hum=
an beings.  To be human means to question what it means to be 
human.  

It=
 is especially when such existential questions arise in our minds 
that we =
find ourselves understandably turning to the precise fields 
of knowledge t=
hat deal most directly with such questions: the sister 
fields of religion =
and philosophy.  In the following, I will answer 
this universal query from=
 the perspective of the most ancient religio-
philosophical system on earth=
, Sanatana Dharma.

The nature of existence has been dealt with by many phi=
losophers, 
both Western and Asian, from the beginning of time.  Whether we=
 are 
speaking of Thomas Aquinas and his metaphysical distinction of 
exist=
ence and essence, Soren Kierkegaard and his attempts to come to 
grips with=
 the problem of existence from a Protestant perspective, 
the Existentialis=
ts of the 20th Century, or the Samkhya and Vedanta 
schools of Sanatana Dha=
rma, the nature of our existence has been on 
the minds of some of history'=
s greatest thinkers.  

The most basic of all philosophical questions that =
can be asked is: 
Why do human beings exist?  When I open my eyes in the mo=
rning, why 
is it that there is something rather than nothing?  In order to=
 
sufficiently analyze this question, the question itself really needs 
to =
be divided into two closely related questions:  a) why do we exist 
at all,=
 b) why do we exist as human beings.  I'll try to answer both 
from the per=
spective of Yoga spirituality and Sanatana Dharma.

According to the ancien=
t wisdom of Dharma, we exist to begin with 
because it's our very innate na=
ture to exist.  The sacred scriptures 
of both Yoga and Sanatana Dharma tea=
ch us that our true, innermost 
nature is that we are atman, or eternal uni=
ts of consciousness.  We 
have the Absolute (Brahman, or God) as both our c=
ausative and 
substantial source, and as the ontological sustainer of our 
=
existential being.  Having God as our underlying source, it 
necessarily fo=
llows that we naturally share in many of God's 
essential attributive quali=
ties.  Because we participate in God's 
innate attributes - and if not to a=
 quantitatively equivalent degree, 
then certainly to a qualitative one - w=
e too share in many of God's 
qualities.  One of those attributes that both=
 God and we have in 
common is necessary existence.  In other words, both G=
od and we 
ourselves (atmans, or souls) are eternal by our inherent nature.=
  God 
and individual atmans cannot but exist.  To go out of existence is 
=
simply not within the realm of our capability.  

Never was there a time wh=
en we came into being, and never will there 
be a time when we cease to exi=
st.  So, in a way, we exist because we 
cannot but exist, being purely spir=
itual beings in essence.  Such is 
our nature, for it is the nature of God,=
 the ultimate source of our 
being.  

A deeper question than the principle=
 of necessary existence, however, 
is: why is it the case that we were even=
 gifted with necessary 
existence to begin with?  Sanatana Dharma answers t=
his in the 
following manner.  Brahman (God) is One (ekam).  But as a natur=
al 
result of the overflowing abundance of the Infinite, God decides to 
be=
come more than One.  God thus becomes One-with-attributes 
(vishishta-advai=
ta).  Consequently, in addition to Brahman, we also 
have atman (individual=
 selves) and jagat (materiality).  As atman, we 
have our own individual ex=
istence in attributive relationship with 
Brahman (God) in order to know, a=
nd love, and serve Brahman.  

The second part of our question on human exi=
stence =96 "why do we exist 
as human beings?" =96 can then be understood f=
rom understanding the 
first part.  As beings who partake in God's necessar=
y existence and 
attributive nature, we are currently in a state of self-im=
posed 
separation from God due to our self-destructive fascination with ego=
 
and the objects of ego.  It is ego, and the subsequent selfishness 
and s=
elf-centeredness that result from ego, that produce the various 
layers of =
illusory self that we mistakenly identify with our true, 
spiritual identit=
y.  

The "human person" is in actuality a complex symbiosis comprised of 
=
several distinct aggregates, including physical body (deha), mind 
substanc=
e, (manas), intellect (buddhi), ego (ahamkara), the vital 
force (prana), a=
nd ultimately atman as the source of consciousness 
and animating source.  =
While the "human person" is an artificial and 
temporal construct comprised=
 of these many elements, it is the atman 
alone that is the true self, and =
that is eternal, true, beautiful, 
indestructible, and blissful by its own =
inherent nature, having God 
(Brahman) as its source of being.  

We thus f=
ind ourselves in human form (and sometimes other forms!) in 
an endlessly u=
nsuccessful attempt to selfishly enjoy ourselves in the 
illusion that we c=
an have a meaningful existence without the benefit 
of God's love.  We are =
identifying with the temporal instead of the 
eternal, with the shallow ins=
tead of the profound, with the material 
instead of the spiritual, with the=
 illusory instead of the real.  

The meaning of life in human form is to t=
hus reverse this negative 
and self-defeating tendency to serve our ego, an=
d to instead once 
again serve God.  We are here, as human beings, to trans=
cend our 
merely human nature, to re-embrace our true identity as eternal 
=
spiritual beings, and to partake of the Divine nature that is our 
birthrig=
ht, that is our natural state of being, and that is our true 
home.  We are=
 here to know, and to love, and to serve the Divine.  

In Sanatana Dharma,=
 God is presented as the source of all goodness, 
acceptance, compassion, a=
nd non-judgmental love.  God is embraced and 
loved without restrictions, w=
ithout fear, without force, and without 
loss.  This is a very different co=
nception of the Absolute when 
compared to the notion we find in the Wester=
n, Abrahamic religious 
constructs of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  Unl=
ike in the 
Abrahamic religions, in Sanatana Dharma we find a concept of Go=
d as 
not only being a thoroughly transcendent source of reality, but also =

as a lovingly imminent and intimate friend who provides us all with a 
mea=
ns for achieving immediate knowledge, and a direct and ecstatic 
experience=
 of Him.  

The path of Sanatana Dharma offers us such profoundly philosoph=
ical 
works as the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and Vedas for the unfailing 
=
guidance and knowledge necessary to comprehend life's meaning.  It 
also of=
fers us a systematic path of spiritual practice that leads 
directly to a p=
ersonal experience of the Divine.  This path includes 
the ancient and high=
ly effective processes of Yoga, meditation, puja, 
and devotion to God.  

=
To truly know the answer to the meaning of human life, however, it is 
not =
enough ultimately to merely engage in an intellectual 
understanding of Tru=
th.  Rather, we need to personally experience the 
sweet taste of Truth as =
the immediate presence of God in our hearts 
and in our lives.  To experien=
ce the profound bliss of God's presence 
in your life, and to truly know wh=
y we have the joy of existence, 
please explore the profound depths of spir=
itual realization that 
Sanatana Dharma has to offer you.  To be human is t=
o ask.
