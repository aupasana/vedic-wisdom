The Teachings of the Bhagavad Gita

THE INDESTRUCTIBLE SPIRIT TRANSCENDS M=
IND AND SPEECH 

Some look upon this Spirit as a wonder, another describes =
it as 
wonderful, and others hear of it as a wonder. Even after hearing 
ab=
out it very few people know what the Spirit is. (See also KaU 2.07) 
(2.29)=


O Arjuna, the Spirit that dwells in the body of all beings is 
eternally =
indestructible. Therefore, you should not mourn for 
anybody. (2.30)

LORD =
KRISHNA REMINDS ARJUNA OF HIS DUTY AS A WARRIOR

Considering also your duty=
 as a warrior you should not waver like 
this. Because there is nothing mor=
e auspicious for a warrior than a 
righteous war. (2.31)

Only the fortunat=
e warriors, O Arjuna, get such an opportunity for an 
unsought war that is =
like an open door to heaven. (2.32)

If you will not fight this righteous w=
ar, then you will fail in your 
duty, lose your reputation, and incur sin. =
(2.33)

People will talk about your disgrace forever. To the honored, 
dish=
onor is worse than death. (2.34)

The great warriors will think that you ha=
ve retreated from the battle 
out of fear. Those who have greatly esteemed =
you will lose respect 
for you. (2.35)

Your enemies will speak many unment=
ionable words and scorn your 
ability. What could be more painful to you th=
an this? (2.36)

You will go to heaven if killed on the line of duty, or yo=
u will 
enjoy the kingdom on the earth if victorious. Therefore, get up wit=
h 
a determination to fight, O Arjuna. (2.37)

Treating pleasure and pain, =
gain and loss, and victory and defeat 
alike, engage yourself in your duty.=
 By doing your duty this way you 
will not incur sin. (2.38)

Strive for Excellence!

"=
Strive always for excellence in all things.  Admire the greatest 
exemplars=
.  Dream the greatest dreams.  Seek the loftiest goals.  
Cultivate the mos=
t valuable virtues in yourself.  Never settle for 
your lesser self.  In al=
l striving, however, always seek to do Good.  
Never seek the path of self-=
aggrandizement."

Is T=
here Evidence for Reincarnation? 

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Fr=
ank Morales)

 
I've often been asked about what evidence there is for the =
process of 
reincarnation.  To answer this question properly, it depends on=
 what 
someone means by the term "evidence".  Since reincarnation is a 
met=
aphysical reality (meta =3D "beyond"; physical =3D "material"), and 
not a =
material one, it doesn't stand to reason that there can really 
be scientif=
ic "evidence" per se.  A non-material, metaphysical 
reality simply cannot =
be grasped by merely material physical means.  

That doesn't mean, though,=
 that reincarnation can't be proven.  After 
all, we can know that many oth=
er non-material things exist that 
cannot be proven scientifically or empir=
ically.  For example, we all 
know that we have minds=85yet no one can real=
ly see a mind.  We can't 
examine a mind in a microscope, nor can we put a =
mind in a test-
tube.  The proof for your mind's existence is that we can i=
nfer that 
you have a mind because you act intelligently: you display the 
=
attributes and actions of one who has a mind.  In the same way, 
reincarnat=
ion cannot be proven through scientific experimentation=85but 
it can be pr=
oven through inference and logic.  

One of the most powerful arguments for=
 upholding the fact of 
reincarnation is that, without the existence of rei=
ncarnation and 
karma (reincarnation and karma are inseparable; you can't h=
ave one 
without the other), the existence of human suffering has no 
expla=
nation and no coherent meaning.  Logically speaking, we can only 
explain t=
he meaning of suffering in the world by inferring the fact 
of reincarnatio=
n and karma.  

If each of us merely pops into existence at the moment of c=
onception, 
and did not have a pre-existence previous to the creation of th=
is 
body, then how do we explain the fact that some people are born with 
t=
errible birth defects (blindness, lacking a limb, etc.), and others 
are no=
t?  How can a merciful and loving God allow some babies to be 
born fine an=
d healthy, and others to be born in a terrible state of 
pain and suffering=
?  Simply claiming that such instances are 
merely "divine mysteries" is ju=
st avoiding the question.  The only 
explanation for suffering that does no=
t make God seem either unjust 
or impotent is the concept of reincarnation/=
karma.  

More, we also see that people are all born with very different 
c=
apacities, talents, attributes, and personalities.  As much as we 
want to =
pretend that all human beings are born as complete tabula 
rasas, or blank =
slates, the truth is that none of us are born with 
equal intrinsic faculti=
es.  Some people are born with more of an 
inherent talent to be creative a=
nd artistic than others.  Some are 
born more cerebral and intelligent than=
 others.  Some are born 7 feet 
tall and can become famous basketball playe=
rs, while some are 5 feet 
tall, and cannot.  Again, the only logical expla=
nation for why a just 
and merciful God would allow people to be born with =
such diverse and 
unequal qualities is reincarnation and karma.  

The conc=
ept of reincarnation and karma is a principle of both 
universal justice an=
d radical freedom of the individual to create 
his/her own destiny.  This c=
oncept teaches us that with every 
thought, action and word containing ethi=
cal-content that we engage 
in, we are freely creating who we are =96 and w=
ho we will be in the 
future.  When we perform actions that are of an ethic=
ally positive 
and good nature, we are directly affecting our own conscious=
ness in 
such a way as to purify and ennoble who we are.  Conversely, when =
we 
perform actions that arise from selfishness, egotism, and negativity, 
=
we are ensuring that our future only holds darkness and sorrow.  

So, the =
concept of reincarnation and karma, ultimately, is a positive 
and hopeful =
concept of radical freedom, in which each and every one 
of us has the abil=
ity, moment to moment, to freely create both 
ourselves and our destinies. =
 With every decision we make today, we 
are creating our own futures, our o=
wn destinies, and our own future 
lives.  Such is the grace and love of God=
 that He gives us the 
complete freedom either to choose to know Him, or to=
 flee from His 
face.  The choice to do one or the other is ours, and ours =
alone.
