Is there a purpose for life?

Narasimha in his initial post wrote "highest =
purpose (
of Vedas) is self-knowledge and that is why Vedas are its swaroop=
am"
If I derive the point that Vedas have a purpose so should living
beings=
. If living beings have a purpose, what is it? 

* To maintain jeeva rasi (=
ecosystem): There should be more
than that. 

* To understand Vedas and att=
ain self-realization: Then
why did the Supreme Cosmic being not create just=
 one human being
and impart all the knowledge in one shot.

As you may reco=
gnized this is a layman's question. 
Please write on this basic question as=
 this would help me 
concentrate better in my prayers. 

Any suggested read=
ings is much appreciated.

PS: The knowledge that is being shared in this t=
hread is useful
especially for someone who cannot interpret the Vedas writt=
en
in Sanskrit.
