Dear members

I would be very grateful if someone could tell me where I cou=
ld find, 
preferably on the net, an English translation and explanation of =
the 
Purusha Sukta? Actually I am looking for an analysis of the 18th verse=
 -
yagyena yagyam.... Does this explain the importance of yagyas - since 
w=
e were all created through the agency of a yagya?

Where else, in our texts=
, can I find references to the philosophy 
behind the process of yagyas?

T=
hank you

Rohini
