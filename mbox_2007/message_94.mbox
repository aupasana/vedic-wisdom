          Namaste Bhupendra ji,

(0) When you breathe in, diaphragm (the muscle between lungs and stomach) 
should move down so that lungs can expand and move down and push stomach. 
Then stomach protrudes outward. This gives more volume to lungs and they can 
take more air. When you breathe out, stomach is contracted inside and 
diaphragm moves up and lungs contract and move up. This is the correct 
breathing.

Due to the bias in modern lifestyle against a stomach that protrudes out, 
this natural breathing is sub-consciously curbed by most people. They don't 
give enough room to their lungs when they breathe in. Their stomach does not 
move.

Some people do it even worse. As the lungs are sucking in air, their lung 
muscles get used to sucking everything around them towards them. Thus, their 
diaphragm is sucked in by the lungs and moves UP when they are breathing in. 
When they are breathing out, all the lung muscles are relaxed and move away 
from lungs. This releases the diaphragm to move DOWN when breathing out. 
This bad breathing style actually reduces the volume of lungs considerably 
(instead of increasing it considerably) when breathing in. This is the 
opposite of the correct breathing. This is quite bad. Unfortunately, many 
people "suffer from" this breathing style these days!

(1) I am aware of 1:4:2. But 1:1:1 is better for overall health. That is 
what Vasishtha and Vivekananda taught. Make pooraka and rechaka the same and 
make kumbhaka as whatever is comfortable.

(3) Well, it is indeed tough to get a good rhythm with mantra in 1:4:2. But 
mantra works quite well with 1:1. In the beginning, you will be focussing on 
mantra. After some days, it is possible to focus on breath too. Actually, 
I'll say the purpose is served irrespective of whether you are focussing on 
mantra or breath or even an image of god. As long as there is some focus for 
the mind, the purpose is served.

(4) When you breathe in forcefully and hold the air, it does feel very nice. 
But everythingthing that feels nice is not necessarily good for you!

(5-6) If you have a knee problem, do sit on a chair. Irrespective of how 
your legs are, make sure that you have your back and head erect and eyes 
closed. That is the key. If you fall asleep, then you will have to find some 
solution that stops you from doing it.

(7) This is not a problem with praanaayaama alone. This is a fundamental 
problem with all sadhana. Each mode of spiritual sadhana (japam, 
praanaayaamam, homam etc) gives results based on our level of purity and 
purity comes as you do more sadhana. It is a chicken-and-egg came. You just 
have to get started and hang in there without worrying about the speed at 
which results are coming. Slowly the momentum builds. After crossing a 
threshold, results start coming very quickly.

You just do the best you can do at a given point of time and leave the rest 
to Her.

If you have time, energy and inclination, you can consider homam. Out of all 
the practices I know, homam is the fastest in burning karmas and purifying 
one's core. That is the power of living fire. If you do a daily homam of 
30-45 min for 6 months, your dhyana and dharana will improve a lot.

* * *

A couple of additional points:

(9) There is something known as the "nasal cycle". The breathing is not 
equal in the two nostrils at all times. The left nostril is more free and 
the right nostril is less free for 2 hours. Then the right nostril is more 
free and the left nostril is less free for another 2 hours. And so on. This 
pattern was taught by Yogis and now science also found it and calls it the 
nasal cycle. The 2 hour period mentioned by me is ideal. In most people, it 
is different. For example, someone may have a more active right nostril for 
2.5 hours and a more active left nostril for 1.5 hours.

Keep one nostril closed and breathe in and breathe out through the other 
nostril. Now swich the try the other nostril. See which one feels more free. 
You can also stand in front of a mirror and breathe in out through both 
nostrils and see in the mirron which nostril is opening more.

If you track your cycle, the time when the active nostril is about to change 
is a good time to do praanaayaama. At the transition time, both nostrils are 
more or less equally open! That is conducive to a more fruitful 
praanaayaama.

In general, the right and left nostrils are associated with the Pingala 
(Surya) and Ida (Chandra) nadis of the subtle body. In modern scientific 
terminology, they are associated with the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
nervous systems. One nervous system is "push" based and the other is "pull" 
based. One excites and the other restrains. As a result, there is balance.

There are certain activities that are best performed when the right nostril 
is more active and certain activities that are best performed when the left 
nostril is more active. It is also possible to force a change in the active 
nostril through action. If you lie down on the floor on your left side, then 
the right nostril will open up in 5-10 minutes. Or, if you chant Savitru 
Gayatri mantra for a while perfectly, the right nostril will open up.

(10) Just as there is a kumbhaka between pooraka and rechaka, it is possible 
to have a shoonyaka (name coined by me) between rechaka and pooraka. It is 
possible to empty the lungs (rechaka) and hold like that for a while 
(shoonyaka) before breathing in again (pooraka). Though Vasishtha does not 
mention the name shoonyaka, he does talk in Yoga Vaasishtham about holding 
breath after rechaka and seeing gods and celestials.

However, this is a really dicey thing and I should have perhaps not even 
mentioned. One needs to be guided by a sadguru and have his blessings.

(11) When you do anulom-vilom, do you breath in through right nostril first 
or left? Both are possible. If you start breathing from the left, it causes 
"Pushti" (nourishment). If you start breathing from right, it causes 
"Yashti" (sacrifice, i.e. burning). The Ida nadi (Moon - left) causes 
pushti, while Pingala nadi (Sun - right) causes yashti. Depending on what 
you want, you can adopt one way.

Instead of anulom-vilom, it is actually possible to always breathe in from 
left and breathe out through right (to gain weight, i.e. pushti) or to 
breathe in from right and breathe out through left (to lose weight, i.e. 
yashti). In this approach, all poorakas are from ONE nostril (left or right) 
and all rechakas are through the other nostril (right or left). This is good 
for the specific purpose of activating one nadi.

Even in anulom-vilom, different teachers teach differently. You decide it 
based on your goal. I have given the basis above.

Best regards,
Narasimha

With kumbhaka, I feel at peace, and without<BR>> it, I feel restless, I begin
 watching the clock for it to be over. I<BR>> tried for a period to do anulom-vilom without kumbhaka, but<BR>> thereafter, I became so dis-inclined towards doing anulom-vilom,<BR>> that I began to realise it was pointless doing it in such a state of<BR>> mind.<BR>><BR>> 3)Pranayam with mantra....for some reason, the rhythm is not there<BR>> when I try that. I noticed that I ended up concentrating more on the<BR>> mantra then on the breathing so I rolled back to simply "dry"<BR>> pranayam as you term it to go back to basics.<BR>><BR>> 4) That is what I do. Instead of clocking my time, I try to time by<BR>> the number of cycles. I also do Bhastrika following anuloom-vilom,<BR>> about 10-12 rounds, I am trying to increase the duration of kumbhaka<BR>> in this, again trying not to stress myself. I am able to do kumbhaka<BR>> in here for a much longer duration that I can in anulom-vilom, I am<BR>> guessing becuase of the forceful
 deep breathing.<BR>><BR>> 5-6)remaining still is a big problem for me becuase of knee pain. So<BR>> someone suggested I try to do pranayam sitting in a chair, but doing<BR>> this, I become sleepy on most days so I have to come down.<BR>><BR>> 7) This is where I have problem. I have read that pranayam burns<BR>> samskaaras and help concentration, yet some caim that concentration<BR>> is necessary for successful pranayam. THIS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND, i<BR>> HAVE A MIND THAT IS SIMPLY INCAPABLE OF SITTING ON ONE THING. And<BR>> there are certain vises (and I do not know if these are vices) that<BR>> I am not able to give up, I am in constant conflict with myself and<BR>> some around me for that reason.<BR>><BR>> 8)This also I am doing but I have to withdraw time and again becuase<BR>> I develop a guilty feeling towards spending money on fulfilling<BR>> personal wishes, comes to a point where I am cutting back on<BR>> personal
 expenses just so that I can make sufficient donations.<BR>><BR>><BR>><BR>> Regards,<BR>> Bhupendra.<BR>><BR>> --- In <A href="mailto:sivacharya%40yahoogroups.com">sivacharya@yahoogro<WBR>ups.com</A>, "Narasimha P.V.R.

When breathing<BR>> air in,<BR>>> the diaphragm should move down and the stomach should protrude out<BR>> freely.<BR>>> When breathing in, the diaphragm should move up and the stomach<BR>> should be<BR>>> drawn in. For some people,
 artificial and constrained breathing<BR>> over many<BR>>> years changes this natural breathing. Place the palms on the<BR>> stomach and<BR>>> then breathe in and out a few times and see if your breathing is<BR>> correct. If<BR>>> it is not, first it must be corrected.<BR>>><BR>>> (1) I suggest anuloma-viloma praanaayaama. Keep the lengths of<BR>> pooraka<BR>>> (breathing in phase), kumbhaka (holding phase) and rechaka<BR>> (breathing out<BR>>> phase) about the same. Though other ratios are suggested by some,<BR>> this is<BR>>> the best.<BR>>><BR>>> (2) In fact, in the beginning, it is better to just omit kumbhaka.<BR>> Just do<BR>>> Pooraka-Rechaka, Pooraka-Rechaka. When you are ready, kumbhaka<BR>> will<BR>>> automatically come by itself! Artificially induced kumbhaka can be<BR>> bad. It<BR>>> should be natural.<BR>>><BR>>> (3) Use a mantra (any) as a
 measure of time. Repeat the mantra<BR>> during each<BR>>> pooraka and rechaka. There is a big difference between a dry<BR>> praanaayaama<BR>>> without a mantra and one with a mantra. Savitru Gayatri is a good<BR>> mantra to<BR>>> use, but, if it is too long, use something smaller.<BR>>><BR>>> (4) Do the pranayama for 5 minutes before dhyana and then do<BR>> dhyana.<BR>>><BR>>> (5) During dhyana, keep your back straight (no slouching). Keep<BR>> head also up<BR>>> and straight. Close the eyes. There is a big difference between<BR>> meditating<BR>>> with open eyes and closed eyes.<BR>>><BR>>> (6) Try not to move during dhyana. If you cannot avoid physical<BR>> movement for<BR>>> extended periods, atleast try small periods. For example, stay<BR>> absolutely<BR>>> still for 10 minutes, then move a little if needed, and then stay<BR>> still<BR>>> again and so
 on.<BR>>><BR>>> (7) The goal of all spiritual sadhana is to efface ego (I-ness)<BR>> and return<BR>>> to the source. Whether one does dhyana or homa or pranayama or any<BR>> other<BR>>> practice, it should somehow or the other efface the I-ness. The<BR>> practices<BR>>> help one overcome ego, while the ego is an obstacle in the<BR>> practices and<BR>>> overcoming the ego makes the practices more effective. Thus, there<BR>> is a<BR>>> chicken-and-<WBR>egg kind of problem here. You have to somehow get<BR>> started and<BR>>> the momentum slowly builds.<BR>>><BR>>> Especially in the beginning, use as many tools as possible to<BR>> reduce ego.<BR>>> Even if pranayama and dhyana are your chosen path, other tools can<BR>> be<BR>>> integrated.<BR>>><BR>>> (8) Cultivate the thinking that everything in this world is a<BR>> property of<BR>>> Shiva and you are just a
 caretaker. Just as a servant takes good<BR>> care of a<BR>>> king's properties without forming an attachment, we should take<BR>> care of<BR>>> things entrusted to us by Shiva. Our relations, our body, our<BR>> name, our<BR>>> fame, our health, our near and dear - all are Shiva's property<BR>> only. We own<BR>>> absolutely NOTHING. We are just His servants and temporary<BR>> caretakers. Just<BR>>> as a servant who takes care of one room in one palace can later be<BR>> moved to<BR>>> another room in another palace, our duty may later change to<BR>> another body,<BR>>> another name, another fame, another set of relations etc. A<BR>> servant takes<BR>>> excellent care of his king's properties, but does not think of<BR>> those things<BR>>> as his and doesn't get attached. We should also be that way.<BR>>><BR>>> One may wonder what this has to do with pranayama and dhyana. But<BR>>
 such<BR>>> detachment and control over mind does help.<BR>>><BR>>> Pranayama literally means "disciplining/<WBR>restraining the pranas".<BR>> Pranas are<BR>>> not just breathing or air. Prana means the life force. It includes<BR>> the mind<BR>>> and movement of thought in it. We control breathing so that our<BR>> thoughts are<BR>>> controlled. But again, if thoughts are not restrained, breathing<BR>> is not<BR>>> fully restrained. This is also a chicken and egg kind of issue.<BR>> Thus, having<BR>>> the correct mental attitude, control over mind and restraint over<BR>> the<BR>>> movement of thoughts helps in a more effective praanaayaama.<BR>>><BR>>> Thus, having the correct attitude and cutting down on unnecessary<BR>>> attachments IS very conducive to an effective praanaayaama and an<BR>> effective<BR>>> dhyaana.<BR>>><BR>>> Now I have to
