"Dr. Frank Mora=
les represents the Sankalpa [the will] of the Hindu
people and the cause of=
 Sanatana Dharma. I urge all Hindus
everywhere to give him your full suppor=
t, assistance, and
encouragement in his crucial work. He needs and deserves=
 our help."

- Dr. David Frawley (Oct. 14, 2007)



The Teachings of the Bh=
agavad Gita

Arjuna asked: If You consider that acquiring transcendental kn=
owledge
is better than working, then why do You want me to engage in this
h=
orrible war, O Krishna? You seem to confuse my mind by apparently
conflicti=
ng words. Tell me, decisively, one thing by which I may
attain the Supreme.=
 (3.01-02)

Lord Krishna said: In this world I have stated a twofold path o=
f
spiritual discipline in the past. The path of Self-knowledge for the
cont=
emplative ones, and the path of unselfish work (Seva, Karma-yoga)
for all o=
thers. (3.03)

One does not attain freedom from the bondage of Karma by mer=
ely
abstaining from work. No one attains perfection by merely giving up
wor=
k, because no one can remain actionless even for a moment.
Everyone is driv=
en to action, helplessly indeed, by the forces of
Nature. (3.04-05)

Anyone=
, who restrains the senses but mentally dwells upon the sense
objects, is c=
alled a pretender. (3.06)

________________________________________________=

The Rishi Phenomenon

"When we look at the examples of th=
e many great Rishis and sages of
the Dharma tradition, we witness an occurr=
ence that I term the "Rishi
Phenomenon". When a truly great sage finally ac=
hieves liberation
from the illusion of separation from God, he or she does =
not merely
stop their activity there, content to merely live a life of isol=
ated
bliss in self-realization. But, rather, they eventually look around
th=
emselves and see that others are not similarly experiencing that
divine sta=
te of liberated bliss. They see that all beings are
suffering due to lack o=
f spiritual insight. What then naturally
arises within the heart of the ris=
hi as a result of his or her own
Brahmic experience is a deep compassion fo=
r all beings, and a
yearning to help them. The rishi then takes on the task=
 of teaching
others the way of Dharma with the hope of elevating all sentie=
nt
beings to a similar experience of the Divine. We too are meant to
manife=
st the Rishi Phenomenon in our own lives and, with compassion
for all suffe=
ring beings, help others to experience their own
spiritual self-unfolding. =
To not want to share spiritual truth with
all beings is to not fully unders=
tand the loving and compassionate
nature of spiritual truth. We are each ca=
lled upon to share the
liberating truth of Dharma with all."

Pravartaka Acharya
