Meditation and the Art of Questioning

Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.
(Sri Dharma=
 Pravartaka Acharya)


The beginning of all spiritual life begins with aski=
ng the big
questions: "Why am I here?" "Who am I?" "What is God's will for =
my
life?" These and other such questions form the very basis of a self-
ref=
lective life. The process of sincere inquiry, and the reciprocal
receiving =
of real and satisfying answers is a course of action that
continues all thr=
oughout one's spiritual journey. This is one thing
that, in fact, makes the=
 path of Yoga and Sanatana Dharma very
different from almost all other spir=
itual traditions: unlike the
Western Abrahamic religions, sincere questioni=
ng is actually actively
encouraged in our spiritual tradition.

Sanatana Dh=
arma is a spiritual world-view that is predicated upon the
idea that we are=
 all free and unique beings. We are respected as
persons who have the abili=
ty to make our own choices in life, and who
deserve to have our choices hon=
ored. As free beings, it is incumbent
upon us to progress spiritually by th=
e strength of our own sincerity,
dedication, and free inquiry. The traditio=
n of Dharma, from this
perspective, can almost be called the religion of qu=
estioning and
free inquiry.

Throughout the Dharmic scriptures (the Vedic l=
iterature), we see
again and again thousands of examples of free and open d=
ialogs that
take place between students and teachers in an attempt to under=
stand
the truth of a particular question or philosophical problem. Whether
=
in the Upanishads, Puranas, Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, or any of the
other=
 scriptures of Sanatana Dharma, we repeatedly read about various
philosophi=
cal discussions that take place between either a guru and
disciple, or a ki=
ng and a guru, or a god and a human, etc., etc.
Indeed, only in Sanatana Dh=
arma is there even a scripture known as
the Prashna Upanishad, or the "Upan=
ishad of Questioning". The most
important of Dharmic scriptures, the Bhagav=
ad Gita, is itself an open
philosophical dialog between a princely warrior =
and God Himself.

In the Bhagavad Gita, we have God Himself engaging in fre=
e and open
dialog with His student Arjuna, in the attempt to bring Arjuna t=
o a
deeper understanding of the truth of his own self-identity, and his
rel=
ationship with God. This vision of God as the Supreme Person who
is compass=
ionate, loving, and secure in His own being enough to have
a down-to-earth =
conversation with His devotee is in stark contrast to
how the Abrahamic (Ju=
deo-Christian-Islamic) god is depicted in the
Biblical and Koranic texts, a=
s an unapproachable being who only
engaging in a one-way dialog with his fo=
llowers. The encouraging of
sincere and open questioning is found throughou=
t our spiritual
tradition like with no other religious tradition on earth.
=

It is understood in Santana Dharma that the process of questioning is
in i=
tself an art. The important thing to understand about the
process of philos=
ophical questioning is that the questioning itself
has to follow the proper=
 methodology if one is to receive real and
truly authentic answers. Questio=
ning is itself an art and a
spiritual discipline. Above all, it is the moti=
vational attitude,
even more so than the cognitive abilities of the questio=
ner, that is
of operative importance. In other words, the important factor =
in
questioning is not how smart the questioner thinks he is, but why the
pe=
rson is asking the questions in the first place. A philosophical
question n=
eeds to be presented in a way that is sincere, humble,
open, and direct. An=
ything less than this attitude will not lead to
real answers. Even a questi=
on as seemingly benign as "What is God?",
for example, can be asked in such=
 a manner as to receive a real
answer, or it can be asked in a manner that =
is arrogant and
demanding. Only the former, asking with humility and openne=
ss, will
lead the questioner to Truth. Asking with arrogance will only lead=

to further ignorance.

The Bhagavad Gita provides us with a very clear des=
cription of the
science of asking:


"Attempt to learn that truth by approa=
ching a spiritual teacher.
Inquire submissively from him and render service=
 to him. The self-
realized sages will initiate you into true knowledge for=
 they have
themselves seen the truth."

(Bhagavad Gita, 4:34)


It is only =
in approaching the search for truth with such an attitude
of openness, humi=
lity, patience, and sincerity that the truth will be
revealed to you.

In t=
he same way that we can approach an embodied guru or sage with
sincere inqu=
iries, we can also engage in such a student/teacher
relationship with God H=
imself as the antaryamin, or the inner witness
within our hearts. While it =
is imperative that we have a living,
embodied guru to whom we can approach =
and receive Divine knowledge,
God is ultimately the source of all Truth, an=
d the eternal Guru.
Thus, through the process of meditation, we can both co=
nfirm the
realizations that we receive from the embodied guru, as well as
e=
ngage in a direct reciprocal relationship with God in which we can
clarify =
inner doubts, receive answers to further queries, and deepen
our understand=
ing of both ourselves and the nature of reality.

There are always two peop=
le involved in spiritual inquiry: the
student (shishya) and the teacher (gu=
ru). Likewise, the general
process of inquiry consists of a two way process=
. It requires not
only the asking of questions on the part of the student, =
but also the
ability to receive and accept answers from the teacher. These =
two
steps are necessary whether the teacher is an embodied guru, or God
Him=
self. When we are inquiring directly from God, these two steps
are found in=
 the form of 1) prayer and 2) meditation.

Through prayer, we are communica=
ting our concerns to God, and through
meditation, we are allowing God to re=
veal Himself to us. Thus, the
communication is a two way street, and not a =
one way monologue. One
of the problems that we often find with the Abrahami=
c religions of
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam is that these religious con=
structs
tend to lay a great emphasis on prayer alone, or speaking to their
=
god and petitioning him, without any understanding of the reciprocal
need o=
f stilling the mind in meditation and allowing their specific
divinity to t=
hen reveal himself to them. Prayer, for the Abrahamic
faiths is a one way f=
orm of communication alone.

Too many of us want to speak to God, ask Him q=
uestions, ask for
favors and gifts, but so few of us are ready to then sit =
in the
silence of meditation and allow God to respond to our queries. Would=

it not at the very least be considered rude if someone were contantly
spea=
king at you, asking your questions, petitioning you for favors,
but never a=
llowing you an opportunity to actually respond? This is
what we are doing t=
o God when we only pray, but never open ourselves
in meditation for His res=
ponse to us. In Sanatana Dharma, it is
understood that "listening" to God i=
n meditation is often of much
greater importance than talking to God, since=
 it is in humbly and
openly listening that we learn and grow. Both, speakin=
g and
listening to God, however, must be present if we are to fully
experie=
nce what it means to commune with the Absolute.

It is in devotional medita=
tion that we are in the most intimate
communion with God. God, being purely=
 spiritual in nature, the only
way to truly communicate with, experience, a=
nd thus truly know God is
in the pure realm of consciousness. In meditation=
, the pure atman
that is our true self is in closest proximity with God. An=
d the
deeper and more advanced the meditator is, in direct proportion is
sh=
e able to experience and understand the eternal Truth free of egoic
mediati=
on. It is when there is no medium left separating the
meditator from the ob=
ject of meditation (God) that we can then
experience pure and eternal knowl=
edge being revealed to us directly
from the mercy of God Himself. At this p=
oint of pure meditative
absorption upon the Absolute, nothing remains unkno=
wn to us. This,
of course, is the ultimate goal (artha) of meditation, and =
takes
years of dedicated practice, sincerity, focused determination, and
gr=
eat devotion to attain.

As for the question of getting immediate answers t=
o ones questions
through meditation, the answers that one gets will be in d=
irect
proportion to one's spiritual advancement and God's grace. The path
o=
f Sanatana Dharma offers us the greatest, most systematic, and most
effecti=
ve vehicle for making spiritual advancement and for
experiencing the infini=
te grace of the Divine.
