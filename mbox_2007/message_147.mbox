Deepavali Benedictions to All

>From 
Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Fra=
nk Morales, Ph.D.)
Resident-Acharya, Hindu Temple of Nebraska

Deepavali (o=
r Diwali) is one of the most important sacred festivals 
in the ancient rel=
igious tradition of Sanatana Dharma.  It is a 
sacred day that is celebrate=
d with great enthusiasm and joy by Hindus 
throughout the world. Deepavali =
is observed to celebrate the return 
of Lord Sri Rama (a divine avatara, or=
 incarnation, of God) to His 
capitol city of Ayodhya after being in exile =
for many years.  In 
order to celebrate the return of their Lord and King, =
the residents 
of Ayodhya lit millions of ghee lamps to light the way for S=
ri Rama's 
return to His kingdom, and to inaugurate the beginning of the re=
ign 
of Ramarajya, or perfect Dharma Government on earth.  Thus, the power =

of light is always associated with this important Hindu festival. The 
day=
 is celebrated with people lighting lamps in temples, homes, and 
public pl=
aces. Sri Lakshmi Puja is also performed in the evening to 
seek the divine=
 blessings of Sri Lakshmi Devi, the Goddess of 
Abundance and consort of Sr=
iman Narayana.

May the blessings of Sri Rama, of Srimati Lakshmi Devi, and=
 of Sriman 
Narayana be bestowed upon you, your family, and upon all sentie=
nt 
beings.  Shubh Deepavali.  

Jaya Sri Rama,

Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acha=
rya
