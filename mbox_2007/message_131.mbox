The Things That Will Be:
What the World Will Experience in the Next 50 Year=
s

By

Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.
(Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya)


Om Hari O=
m


By the year 2058, 


We will witness that Sanatana Dharma has become th=
e preeminent world-
view, religion, and philosophy of the entire earth.

Hi=
ndus themselves will work with unbridled dedication, energy, 
enthusiasm, a=
nd self-sacrifice to make the above a reality.

One-billion Hindus in South=
 Asia will have renewed their personal 
commitment to Sanatana Dharma with =
an enthusiasm and sincere fervor 
the likes of which all of Hindu history h=
as never seen before.  

The world will see Sanatana Dharma as a religion t=
hat fosters 
strength, fearlessness, healthy assertiveness, and excellence =
in all 
its followers.  

The day of the passive Hindu will be over.  

Ten=
-million non-Indians in America will have converted freely and 
joyously to=
 Sanatana Dharma, conducting pujas in their homes, being 
strict vegetarian=
s, following the precepts of Sanatana Dharma, and 
proudly proclaiming to t=
he world that their religion is Sanatana 
Dharma.

Twenty-million non-India=
ns in Europe will have similarly converted 
freely and joyously to Sanatana=
 Dharma.

We will see a White Prime Minister of Britain who is an openly 
p=
racticing and proud Hindu.  

Marxism will remain only as a horrific memory=
 in the minds of 
humanity, and will have ceased to exist in every corner o=
f the world, 
replaced by the life-affirming and spiritually empowering ide=
ology of 
Dharma.  

The paper tiger of Islam will have been diminished to =
only a mere 10% 
of its current perceived power and strength as tens of mil=
lions of 
Muslims renounce their destructive ideology and come to the light=
 of 
spirituality without hate.

Tens of millions of Muslims will have aban=
doned Islam =96 the "Religion 
of Submission" =96 and have joyously convert=
ed to Sanatana Dharma =96 the 
Eternal Natural Way.  

The artificial natio=
nal construct of "Pakistan" will have ceased to 
exist, torn apart by its o=
wn internal political and cultural 
contradictions.  

There will be over 1=
000 Hindu temples across the length and breadth 
of China, with millions of=
 enthusiastic native Chinese filling these 
temples to overflowing.  

We w=
ill witness multiple Dharma Nations emerge onto the world scene 
as powerfu=
l and prosperous nations that will serve as examples to the 
rest of the wo=
rld of what nations look like when governments truly 
reflect the sole inte=
rests of their people.  

India will not be the first of these Dharma Natio=
ns.


This will all have occurred by the year 2058.  


Om Hari Om
