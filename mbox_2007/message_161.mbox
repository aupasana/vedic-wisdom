Om Gurave Namah
Om Shri Mahaganapataye Namah
Om Hare Rama Krishna


Dear M=
embers,

A matra is a divine word or sentence that is chanted in particular=
 way
to achieve Dharma, Artha, Kama or Mokhsa. A mantra can make the
imposs=
ible things possible. A simple sadkak can become a great saint
with the pow=
er of mantra. A mantra can change an unfavourable situation
into a favourab=
le one.

There are three types of mantras.

    * Sabhri Mantra:- These man=
tras empowers the sadhak with siddhi or
mystic powers.
    * Tantrik Mantra=
:- These mantras empowers the sadhak ckamatkarik
powers (amazing demonstrat=
ive powers) at the mystic level.
    * Vedic Mantra :- Vedic mantra which g=
oes towards achieving eternal
peace for the soul.

This mantra once given b=
y a guru can erase fear within oneself
immediately. Mantras have amazing an=
d unbelievable power. Once I read a
book that there was a saint  Mahamalesh=
war if somebody touched his body
he could hear Rama Naam jap automatically.=
 Mahaprabhu Chaitanya chanted
naam kirtun trees began to sway as if in danc=
e to his sacred tune. So
Mantras have amazing and unbelievable powers. Ever=
y Sadhak will convey
you a different experiences and stories. Mantras are s=
o powerful because
it is a pure sound and it invokes every nerve of you bod=
y and creates an
invisible ring outside your body.

Many people do not beli=
eve that these small mantras have so much power.
It is because they are ill=
iterate in this filed and they are in
darkness.

You know when one a small =
mass is converted to energy it creates too
much energy and Atom Bombs are m=
ade on this theory.

235 92 U + 1 0 n ---------->139 56Ba + 94 36 Kr +3 1 0=
n + Large amount
of energy

Nuclear power plant are working on this theory.=
 1 gram of uranium-235 is
subjected to fission creates 8.36 x 107 kilojoule=
s of energy. It is
possible because Uranium is not a simple metal but has t=
oo much hidden
energy.

In the similar way these Mantras are not simple wor=
ds but they are
special words like Uranium, Thorium, Plutonium they have gr=
eat hidden
energy and when triggered by a Sadhak it produces unlimited ener=
gy
within you. You can utilise the energy produced by Mantra Chanting.

The=
re are three mantras written at the top of this article and you may
start a=
nyone of these mantras and recite them daily one mala. You will
have some s=
pecial feeling withing 40 days.

You can feel the energy just go on and tri=
gger one Mantra of your need
or choice. Please chant only Vedic Mantras.


=
regards

sushil dikshit
