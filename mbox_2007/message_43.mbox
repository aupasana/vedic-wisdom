The Teachings of the Bhagavad Gita

IMPORTANCE OF KARMA-YOGA

The science =
of transcendental knowledge has been imparted to you, O 
Arjuna. Now listen=
 to the science of selfless service (Seva), endowed 
with which you will fr=
ee yourself from all Karmic bondage, or sin. 
(2.39)

No effort is ever los=
t in selfless service, and there is no adverse 
effect. Even a little pract=
ice of the discipline of selfless service 
protects one from the great fear=
 of repeated birth and death. (2.40)

A selfless worker has resolute determ=
ination for God-realization, but 
the desires of the one who works to enjoy=
 the fruits of work are 
endless. (2.41)

THE VEDAS DEAL WITH BOTH MATERIAL=
 AND SPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF LIFE 

The misguided ones who delight in the melo=
dious chanting of the Veda -
- without understanding the real purpose of th=
e Vedas -- think, O 
Arjuna, as if there is nothing else in the Vedas excep=
t the rituals 
for the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment. (2.42)=


They are dominated by material desires, and consider the attainment 
of h=
eaven as the highest goal of life. They engage in specific rites 
for the s=
ake of prosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result of 
their action. (2=
.43)

The resolute determination of Self-realization is not formed in the 
=
minds of those who are attached to pleasure and power, and whose 
judgment =
is obscured by ritualistic activities. (2.44)

A portion of the Vedas deals=
 with three modes =AD goodness, passion, and 
ignorance =AD of material Nat=
ure. Become free from pairs of opposites, 
be ever balanced and unconcerned=
 with the thoughts of acquisition and 
preservation. Rise above these three=
 modes, and be Self-conscious, O 
Arjuna. (2.45)

To a Self-realized person=
 the Vedas are as useful as a small 
reservoir of water when the water of a=
 huge lake becomes available. 
(2.46)

Overcoming Negativity

"Negative emotions - s=
uch as fear, sadness, depression, grief, and 
guilt =96 cannot be ignored. =
 But neither should they be given power 
that they don't have.  All negativ=
e emotions can be overcome with 
God's love, just as shadows naturally disa=
ppear in the clear presence 
of light."

The Power of Focus

"Focus and concentration are eve=
rything.  If you can learn to focus 
all of your attentive energy like a la=
ser beam, there will be no 
task, no goal, no dream that you cannot realize=
 in this world."

                                  - Sri Dharma Pravartaka=
 Acharya

Se=
ek the Seeker

"We are all seeking so many things =96 career, love, success=
, fame.  
But who is it that seeks?  If you don't know your own self, how c=
an 
you truly know success in what you seek?  Seek your true self first.  
=
Seek the seeker.  Success will follow automatically."

Always Reach Further

"Progress means =
ever seeking to exceed your present maximal limits.  
Always know that you =
have even more potential within than you 
presently believe.  Always reach =
further."  

                                  - Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acha=

Trust

=
"Trust is the most precious gift another person can give us.  Never 
misuse=
 this gift or take it for granted, or else it may never be 
given to you ag=
ain."
        
                                  - Sri Dharma Pravartaka Ac=

The P=
ower of Your Word

"Your word contains more power and sacredness than you c=
an ever 
imagine.  Once you've given your word to another, it is in keeping=
 
that word that you gain strength; and it is in going against that 
word t=
hat you become weak.  Once your word is given, do not ever go 
back on that=
 word."

Accomplish=
 Anything

"Always lead a healthy existence.  Cultivate health in your body=
, 
mind, emotions and spirit.  With health follows strength.  With 
strengt=
h follows fearlessness.  And with fearlessness, you can 
accomplish anythin=
g."
