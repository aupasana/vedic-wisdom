Namaste friends,

erstood by their desciples, may be same w'd have happened in 
> kanchi.
 
P=
lease allow me to blabber and give my 2 cents of thoughts on this non-astro=
logical topic.
 
There is no doubt that Swami Chandrasekhara Saraswati was =
a fully self-realized and liberated sage. However, I urge respected members=
 to not jump to any conclusions regarding the current pontiff.
 
Two libera=
ted sages do not act the same way. It depends on the actions destined for t=
hem by poorva vasanas and desa-kaala-paatra. One liberated sage may rule a =
big country (like king Janaka). Another liberated sage may roam forests. An=
other liberated sage may be involved in the politics of a country and guide=
 a king as the royal guru (like Samartha Ramadas).
 
You cannot identify a =
liberated sage from what one does or does not. In fact, you cannot identify=
 a liberated sage unless you too have progressed.
 
All people are all like=
 pawns in a chess game. The Mother is the master chess player who is moving=
 all these pawns from one square to another and pitting one against another=
. Most people are akin to pawns that are always worried about where they ar=
e going to go next. When a pawn kills the rook, it gets excited. When it is=
 attacked by the opposite pawn, it gets depressed.
 
A liberated sage is li=
ke a pawn that moves as the player (Mother) decides and does not worry much=
 - a pawn that is neither excited nor depressed. Thus, you cannot really id=
entify a liberated sage by what one does or does not.
 
It is possible that=
 the current pontiff is not deviating from his guru's path because he did n=
ot "understand" his guru, as you say. It is possible that his destiny and p=
ath are simply different. He is living in different times and the Mother's =
plans for him, his mutt and his country may be different now.
 
It is not g=
ood to think negatively about a liberated sage. Please note that the curren=
t pontiff belongs to a lineage starting from Adi Sankara and that he was pi=
cked and guided by Swami Chandrasekhara Saraswati. There may be events that=
 may make you think that there were differences of opinion between the two.=
 But it may all be Her Lila. Please do not jump to any conclusions about th=
e current pontiff and give due respect to him!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
