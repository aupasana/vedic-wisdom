Namaste Sir,
 
Both are ok. But, in my view, the best way to chant is to ch=
ant mentally. When some people chant mentally, there is subtle movement of =
muscles in the throat. If you can chant in the mind with complete silence, =
i.e. with NO movement of any internal [physical] body part, it is the best.=

 
In fact, if you attempt that, you will realize that your focus on the ma=
ntra has to be very high to achieve the above. When you say a mantra loud, =
mind can be thinking of something else while the throat and lips say someth=
ing. In order to say something mentally without any movement, however, your=
 focus has to be much higher. It just forces a higher level of focus.
 
If =
you attempt the above, it is difficult in the beginning to avoid occasional=
 movement of muscles in the throat. If you practice more, you will be able =
to say without any movement. Secondly, if you can also avoid the movement o=
f other physical body parts (not involved with sound production) such as ha=
nds, legs, head etc, it can result in a more productive meditation session.=

 
Krishito naasti durbhiksham. When it comes to spiritual sadhana, there i=
s nothing like effort. One just needs to put more and more effort and keep =
trying without giving up.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
