Dear Narasimha ji

Thank you very much for your quick response with a detai=
l explanation.
I have been doing chandi path at least once during every vis=
it to
India. This was disrupted for last two and half years due to deaths i=
n
family. Because of the cumulative method you explained I hope I could
res=
ume, even during a short visit, the chandi paths with a sata chandi
path, r=
est mother's wish.

With my best regards
Swadhin
