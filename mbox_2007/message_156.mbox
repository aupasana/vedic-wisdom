Respected Narsimha Ji,

Pranam,

Please post the correct form of Complete M=
ahamrityunjaya Mantra. I want 
to know the correct form of it because many =
pandits pronounce it 
differently. I have read "Vedic Ramedies in Astrology=
" by Sanjay Rath 
but I have found there are so many errors in pronunciatio=
n 
like "oo"(Deergha U) has been written as "u". I respect him too much 
be=
cause he is a great scholar of Vedic Astrology but there are 
certainly som=
e errors.

with regards
sushil dikshit
