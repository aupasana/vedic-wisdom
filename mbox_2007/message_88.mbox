I am sure that first one you wrote for Breathing in & the next =
for 
Breath out.it seems to be typo error. 

I practise Sudarshan Kriya for=
 sometime now. My Diaphram goes up & 
stomach inside (chest comes out) when=
 breathing In & reverse for 
Breathing out. I can do the reverse way withou=
t any problem but in 
comparision i have found that the first one mentioned=
 by me gives me 
much better feeling. 

Your statement has again intrigued =
me.

would you reply?

Warm Regards

Utpal
