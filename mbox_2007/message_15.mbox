A warm namaste to everyone!

I have heard it said that women are not allowe=
d to read/know/recite the 
vedas. Can anyone tell me if this is true? If so=
, is there any mantra 
(or evidence)in any of the Vedas which says this?

I=
 ask this not as a disrespectful argument but as a genuine desire to 
know =
what the text actually says, if it does indeed say anything at all 
on the =
subject.

Also I have heard that a Brahmin who does have the right to recit=
e/use 
the mantras has to follow a certain (very strict) way of life. Is th=
is 
too mentioned in any of these 'books' (for want of a better word)?

ards
