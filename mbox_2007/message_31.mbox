Dear Swadhin,

The normal interpretation is to add the counts of all participants. If ten 
people read nine times each, the count is 10x9=90.

When we did Sata Chandi homam, we did it that way. Actually, we did not do 
over ten days. It was 7 days. We cumulatively chanted 90 times in 4 days and 
then chanted 10 times *in the fire* over the final 3 days.

The priest arranged for some other priests to read Chandipath during those 4 
days and clear the count of 90 with a safe margin. But not all of them were 
reading it at the temple. They were reading it at their homes with the 
mental sankalpam to contribute to the homam at the temple.

The homam was due to the sankalpam of my spiritual master Dr Manish Pandit 
from Manchester, UK. He suggested that we should actually get to the count 
of 90 *at* the temple if possible. So some of us chanted several times a day 
and actually covered the count of 90 at the temple itself with a margin. In 
addition, some more people read it at homes, based on the previous plan of 
the priest. So we made the count in different ways.

I was not there all the 7 days. During the first 4 days, I was away for 2 
days, visiting Tirupati, Tirunannamalai, Kanchi etc. But my guru was there 
chanting all the seven days. On 5 out of 7 days, I too was there at the 
temple. However, we left the temple and went to the house of the head priest 
to sleep in the nights. It may have been a good idea to sleep at the temple 
itself. Again, it is a very alive temple with so many kinds of energies...

Yes, we think we are the doers, but we are just pawns. Just read the 
kavacha, argala and keela in the beginning of chandipath on each day for 
protection.

I took a vow at the Sata Chandi homam to read Chandipath for 108 consecutive 
days and completed it in June 2006. A couple of months after that, the head 
priest of that Kalikambal temple visited Boston. He was at our house and we 
did 10 Chandi homas at my house. We did 8 on a Saturday (starting in the 
morning and going on till 2 am!), the 9th on Sunday morning and did an 
elaborate final one on Sunday afternoon. It was six months after the Sata 
Chandi homam in Chennai and it can also be considered a different kind of 
Sata Chandi homam.

Best regards,
Narasimha
