Dear Members,
Here a small story,with a wonderful meaning. It all depends o=
n
you look at it. I have received it from a different source and
sharing it=
 with you all. Kindly read and re-read and remember.


THE PERSPECTIVE

One=
 sees the top of a coin and says it is Heads, the other sees it
from the ot=
her side and says it is Tails - who is correct?

Both are. It is the same c=
oin being seen from two different sides.
You have the power to see from bot=
h sides - so it is your decision
which side you want to be in - the top or =
the bottom, the left or
right.

On one side is God and on the other is the =
world (a reflection of
God).

The coin is like a one sided mirror - in the =
centre. God sees you
but till you are seeing from the other side - you only=
 see the 'I'
and not God. The diagram below somewhat captures what is tryin=
g to
be expressed.

Heads COIN Tails

[[GOD]] [Faith Belief || Knowledge We=
alth] [WORLD] - I

It is just our own created perspective. I came across th=
is message
and felt that it enhances the above topic of discussion. For you=
r
reading and comments.

What makes a person rich?

One day a father of a v=
ery wealthy family took his son on a trip to
the country with the firm purp=
ose of showing his son how poor people
live. They spent a couple of days an=
d nights on the farm of what
would be considered a very poor family.

On th=
eir return from their trip, the father asked his son, "How was
the trip?"

=
"It was great, Dad."

"Did you see how poor people live?" the father asked.=


"Oh yeah," said the son.

"So, tell me, what did you learn from the trip?=
" asked the father.

The son answered: "I saw that we have one dog and they=
 had four. We
have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they=
 have a
creek that has no end. We have imported lanterns in our garden and
=
they have the stars at night. Our patio reaches to the front yard
and they =
have the whole horizon. We have a small piece of land to
live on and they h=
ave fields that go beyond our sight. We have
servants who serve us, but the=
y serve others. We buy our food, but
they grow theirs. We have walls around=
 our property to protect us,
they have friends to protect them."

The boy's=
 father was speechless.

Then his son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me h=
ow poor we are."

Isn't perspective a wonderful thing? Makes you wonder wha=
t would
happen if we all gave thanks for everything we have, instead of
wor=
rying about what we don't have.

Appreciate every single thing you have, an=
d most of all the One who
has given it all to you.

Regards
Shiva
