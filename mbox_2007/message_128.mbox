Sri Krishna Janmashtami Benedictions to All

>From 

Sri Dharma Pravartaka A=
charya 
(Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.)


The appearance day of Bhagavan Sri Kri=
shna, Sri Krishna Janmashtami, 
represents the most important holy day in a=
ll of Sanatana Dharma.  
For it was over 5100 years ago that God Himself, o=
ut of mercy and 
love for all humanity, deigned to come to earth in order t=
o 
reestablish the principles of Dharma, to actively punish those who 
hara=
ssed His devotees, and to gift His devotees with His precious 
darshana.

I=
t is only in Sanatana Dharma that the understanding is given that 
the Infi=
nite Himself has the capability to choose to manifest Himself 
in seemingly=
 finite form, while still being fully the Infinite=85and 
that He does so m=
otivated by pure love for His devotees.  

One-billion Hindus will celebrat=
e this sacred event of Lord Sri 
Krishna's appearance on this day as an opp=
ortunity to worship with 
family and friends, and to take a well-deserved b=
reak from the 
stressful conditions of life.  Let us also, however, take th=
is 
opportunity to renew our relationship with God, and to deepen our 
comm=
itment to the Dharma that is God's gift to us all.

Devotion to Sri Krishna=
 is not meant to be practiced only one day a 
year, but is in actuality our=
 soul's inner-most yearning and need.  
We must aspire to show our devotion=
 to Sri Krishna each day of the 
year, each moment of every day, and with t=
he utter-most depths of our 
being.

Devotion is not merely sentiment.  Dev=
otion is action=85action in pure 
love.  To show our devotion to Sri Krishn=
a, let us use this 
opportunity of His appearance day to resolve now to alw=
ays put Him 
first in our lives, to read and study His sacred words in His =

Bhagavad Gita each and every day, to follow and incorporate His 
teachings=
 in our daily lives, and to be the very best bhaktas that we 
can be.  

Ab=
ove all, let us sincerely pray at the lotus feet of Bhagavan Sri 
Krishna t=
hat He will empower each and every one of us that we may 
serve Him and tha=
t we may help to revive Dharma in this world.  

Let us make every day Sri =
Krishna Janmashtami.  If we do so, Sri 
Krishna will appear in our hearts n=
ot just once a year, but every 
moment of our lives, to bless us and to bes=
tow the gift of His grace 
upon us.  May all sentient beings enjoy a blesse=
d and joyous Sri 
Krishna Janmashtami on this sacred day.
