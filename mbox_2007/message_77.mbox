Bhakti as a Social Force

Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.
(Sri Dharma Pravartaka A=
charya)


The very heart of Sanatana Dharma consists of experiencing a dire=
ct
and intimate realization of God in devotion (bhakti). Without such
an ex=
perience, Sanatana Dharma is rendered devoid of all meaning and
purpose. To=
 love God is to embrace Dharma. And to embrace Dharma
thoroughly and withou=
t reservation is what it means to be a Hindu.

One of the most unfortunate =
and most damaging stereotypes that many
present-day Hindus have about Sanat=
ana Dharma is that a) deep
spirituality and b) practical action in the worl=
d simply do not mix.
In the minds of such people, serious spiritual practic=
e and practical
social action are mutually exclusive paths, of which we can=
 only
choose one. Such a defeatist scenario is in actuality the very
opposi=
te of the realty of Sanatana Dharma. Indeed, holding this
incorrect opinion=
 that one cannot be both spiritual and also engaged
in the world is in itse=
lf just another sad manifestation of the self-
denigrating syndrome that we=
 see so prevalent among nominal Hindus
today.

When we look at both the his=
tory and the teachings of Sanatana Dharma
specifically, and of all religion=
s generally, we see that the reality
is the opposite of these gross, and ve=
ry much modern, Western-
inspired, stereotypes. The myth of the other-world=
ly mystic having
been rendered incapable of engaging the world around him i=
n a
practical and activist manner is an exaggerated stereotype arising
more=
 from the speculative minds of spiritually unaware speculators of
religion =
than from anything corresponding to reality. Rather than
being socially deb=
ilitating, spirituality has always proven itself to
be the most powerful mo=
tivator for highly practical and effective
action in the world.

Bhakti, or=
 single minded devotional meditation upon Bhagavan (God),
is not a hindranc=
e to practical social and political action in the
world. On the contrary, b=
hakti has been, by its very inherent
nature, a powerful and dynamic social =
force in the past. Bhakti is
an unparalleled motivating force that has indu=
ced revolutionary and
progressive change. It will also serve as the driving=
 spiritual
force that will revive and strengthen Dharma well into the 21st
=
Century.

If we examine the very long history of Sanatana Dharma, we see th=
at
it was almost exclusively deeply spiritually-realized people who were
al=
ways the most practical and successful men (and women) of action.
Valmiki, =
for example, was originally a bandit who then later became a
dedicated Rama=
-bhakta and ascetic sage. It was only after this
personal spiritual transfo=
rmation affected him to the core of his
being that he then found himself em=
powered to compose the enormous
literary masterpiece known as the Ramayana =
in its 24,000 Sanskrit
verses. Indeed, the entire corpus of Sanskrit shastr=
as (scriptures)
were written by hundreds of spiritually-inspired saints, wh=
ose very
motivation for writing about philosophy, religion, politics, Yoga,=

mathematics, sciences, medicine, etc., etc. was their own radically
person=
al self-transformative experience of the presence of God within
them. Witho=
ut the committed scholarship of such spiritually-inspired
sages, Hinduism a=
nd India would today have been entirely devoid of an
intellectual and cultu=
ral history! It was the empowerment provided
to these sages by God that equ=
ipped them to realize unparalleled feat
of scholarly and literary accomplis=
hment in this world.

After the ascendance of Buddhism and Jainism in Hindu=
 India, it was
again God-realized men of action who - far from retreating f=
rom the
world and living in their sadhana huts - led dynamic movements that=

saved Sanatana Dharma from imminent extinction. The great sage Sri
Shankar=
a Acharya was known as Dig-vijaya ("Conqueror of All
Directions") because h=
e quite literally conquered the four corners of
India, peacefully reestabli=
shing Vaidika Siddhanta (the Vedic Truth)
as the preeminent philosophical s=
ystem on earth, and the only
legitimate path for knowing Brahman (God). Sha=
nkara was shy in his
assertion that Sanatana Dharma was the most legitimate=
 and direct way
of knowing God, and each and every other system was substan=
dard in
comparison. He is known to have engaged in hundreds of debates with=

the avaidika (non-Hindu) Buddhists, soundly defeating them with the
superi=
ority of Vedic teachings, and converting their followers en
masse to Sanata=
na Dharma. Hardly an otherworldly dreamer was he!

The great Vedantist phil=
osopher Ramanuja Acharya, similarly, was a
radical bhakta (practitioner of =
Bhakti-yoga) who nonetheless wrote
some of the most philosophically profoun=
d masterpieces India has ever
produced, while simultaneously traversing the=
 length of breadth of
Bharata (India) to reestablish the path of bhakti as =
the greatest
expression of Vedanta philosophy. Ramanuja created a revolutio=
n in
people's understanding and appreciation of the ancient bhakti
traditio=
n, reviving bhakti in the four corners of India, and changing
the course of=
 Indian and world history.

Like Shankara centuries before him, the Vaisnav=
a Vedantist Sri Madhva
Acharya traveled widely, actively converting thousan=
ds of Buddhists
and Jains to Sanatana Dharma, and reestablishing Vaidika Dh=
arma in
South India. He also urged the kings of South India to physically
e=
xpel thousands of avaidika Jain leaders from their kingdoms,
converting man=
y important kings to the fold of Sanatana Dharma.

Tulasidas, Surdas, Mirab=
hai, Chaitanya, Sahajananda Svami
(Swaminarayana), and a thousand other God=
-intoxicated revolutionaries
fearlessly revived the people's faith Sanatana=
 Dharma during the
Islamic holocaust in northern India. Without the practic=
al
leadership and hard work of these many bhakti-inspired saints,
Sanatana =
Dharma would most likely have been annihilated by the
Abrahamic purveyors o=
f genocide hundreds of years ago.

The biographies of many hundreds of Raja=
rshis - or courageous and
implacable God-realized kings - are recorded in t=
he Puranas. Such
philosopher-kings were often known as Chakravartins, due t=
o the fact
that they ruled their kingdoms while wielding the figurative "Wh=
eel
of Dharma". Such Chakravartins and Rajarshis were at once the
personifi=
cations of both Dharmic spirituality and martial nobility.
Such rulers exhi=
bited qualities that represented the very best of
both the spiritual and th=
e practical worlds. They were philosopher-
kings, ascetic-warriors, saintly=
-rulers, and martial-yogis. These
spiritual men-of-action were capable of d=
elivering a profound and
moving discourse on Dharma one day, and then leadi=
ng an army of
multiple phalanxes into bloody battle to defend Dharma the ne=
xt.
These Chakravartins were saints-of-action! They are also perfect
models=
 of the qualities that we so desperately need in Hindu leaders
today.

The =
Dharmic world is waiting with fervent yearning for the arrival of
such Chak=
ravartins today, who will be able to save Sanatana Dharma
with the intensit=
y of their devotion, and the powerful authority of
their sovereign will.

H=
ow many untold thousands of true brahmana (intellectuals/priests)
leaders l=
ike Chanakya have helped to preserve Sanatana Dharma and
served as brave gu=
ardians of Dharmic culture? How many saints have
served as trusted advisors=
 to kings and empires throughout the
history of India, helping to steer the=
 great "ship of state" toward
to the path of Dharma?

How many unlimited nu=
mbers of fearless yogis, gurus, acharyas, and
saints have worked endlessly =
to keep Sanatana Dharma alive in the
face of terrible challenges, conquests=
, persecutions, and betrayals
from within the likes of which so many of tod=
ay's "Hindu activists"
living in the lap of comfort in Twenty-first Century=
 America, New
Delhi, and Mumbai, can only pretend to comprehend, but can ne=
ver hope
to imitate?

Did Swami Vivekananda ignore the real world, or did h=
e fearlessly
engage the world, traveling thousands of miles from the only h=
ome he
knew in order to share the light of Sanatana Dharma with an uncaring=

world? What of such contemporary spiritual soldiers as Sri
Bhaktivedanta S=
wami Prabhupada, or Sri Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, or
Dr. David Frawley (Pa=
ndit Sri Vamadeva Shastri), or Sri Shastri
Pandurang Athawale? It has only =
been due to the hard work of such
sages as these that Sanatana Dharma has b=
een preserved for as long as
it has.

Sanatana Dharma will be saved by the =
emergence of many more such
saints and leaders in the immediate future - an=
d such saintly leaders
will arise, not from the stars above, but from the r=
anks of the Hindu
community itself. Ours is not a messianic, faith-based re=
ligion.
Unlike the Abrahamic sects, spiritually-inspired Hindus do not sit =
in
prayer huts and wait for messiahs, saviors, or avataras (the next of
who=
m will not be arriving for another 420,000 years!). We don't hide
in prayer=
 closets as the world burns around us hoping only for our
own salvation. Ag=
ain, this is only a childish stereotype of the
religious Hindu. Rather, Hin=
dus are a very practical and innovative
people. When times are dire, God-in=
spired leadership always arises
from within the Hindu community.

My messag=
e to the Hindu community is this: if you want to see an
empowered and fearl=
ess Hindu leadership arise to lead Dharma into the
Twenty-First Century, th=
en YOU must become the leaders you seek. And
you must do so, not out of a c=
raving for money, fame, or power, but
as a devotional offering of your life=
 humbly surrendered at the
divine feet of Bhagavan. True Hindu leadership c=
an only arise from
within the Hindu community itself.

It will only be God-=
empowered Hindu leaders, fueled by the blissful
rays of bhakti, fearless in=
 the face of opposition, and dedicated to
giving their lives for the greate=
r benefit of the Hindu People and
the Dharma Nation, who will be capable of=
 leading Sanatana Dharma and
of securing its future in the years to come. I=
ndeed, IT IS ONLY
BECAUSE THEY ARE GOD-EMPOWERED that such leaders will be =
ready,
equipped, and able to storm into the world unafraid and confident in=

their ability to compel positive change upon society, politics, and
cultur=
e. It is only the power of bhakti that can fuel such
dedication and fearles=
sness.

Bhakti can be the only motivational force strong enough to ensure t=
he
degree of self-sacrifice necessary to create true leadership. It is
not =
enough to identify yourself as a "Hindu activist" merely because
you find S=
anatana Dharma interesting, inspiring, a neat culture that
shouldn't disapp=
ear, or just because you somehow think it's your
ethnic heritage. Such triv=
ial concerns are not enough to promote
effective action. The only way a Hin=
du leader will be truly
effective is if he/she has had a direct vision of G=
od in his/her
heart so powerful that they see it as their own personal serv=
ice to
Bhavagan to teach others how to love Him. Any lesser motivation only=

leads to the invisible chains of ego. Only when we have leaders who
are on=
 fire with devotion (bhakti) to God will Dharma be saved.

Throughout the h=
istory of Sanatana Dharma, bhakti has served as a
powerful social force, an=
d has consequently served to change the
course of human history. Bhakti wil=
l once again serve as a social
force today as we face a world that is yearn=
ing for truth, for
goodness, and for meaningful relief from the manifold su=
fferings
produced by the failed offerings of the cold, secular world we hav=
e
created. The life-enhancing power of bhakti, coupled with honest and
fear=
less leadership, will bring about nothing less that the Dharma
Revolution t=
hat we need in our age. I urge you to be Chakravartins.
