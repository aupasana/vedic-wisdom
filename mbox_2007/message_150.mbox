Namaste Narasimha Rao garu,
 
Thank you for giving us the true knowledge an=
d importance of 
pronounciation in a mantra. I look forward to know more ab=

pronounciation of mantras, and will see that I start pronouncing the 
=
mantra correctly. Please mention the important mantras which are mis 
prono=
unced these days, so that we shall start changing our 
pronounciation Sir.
=
 
 
Thank You for sharing your knowledge with us.
 
Hari Om,
 
Rajesh

If you change i=
t into "yaattu" or "yaatu" by adding a vowel sound at 
the end, it becomes =
two aksharas. This increases the number of 
aksharas, changes the chhandas =
and changes the meaning also. You may 
still experience something when medi=
tating on the mantra, but you 
will never experience the mantra to the full=
est with that 
pronunciation.
>  
> Akshara means "unperished". Vowels (swa=
ras) are the praana (life 
force) of an akshara. If you have just a consona=
nt without a vowel 
after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT a=
n akshara. It 
perishes. For example, if you pronounce "t" as is (without a=
dding any 
sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the listener can=
not 
decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.
>  
> In "=
prachodayaat", the whole sound "yaat" is one akshara. 
Because "t" has no p=
raana by itself, it simply joins to the 
akshara "yaa" (which has the vowel=
 "aa" as its praana) and becomes 
part of that akshara. In chhandas, "yaat"=
 is considered one letter 
(one guru). When you pronounce "yaat" correctly,=
 it is difficult for 
the listener to know for sure whether you said "yaat"=
 or "yaak" 
or "yaan". It is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwi=
se 
difficult. The "t" at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient 
sou=
nd without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.
>  
> This makes people add=
 some vowel to it (like "u" or "a" or "o" 
or "i" or some other vowel sound=
 in between them) so that the "t" 
sound gets a praana and becomes clearly =
audible. It suddenly becomes 
an akshara and the chhandas changes.
>  
> Pr=
obably, some big teacher started pronouncing "yaat" as "yaatu" so 
that "t"=
 gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so 
that his stude=
nts would not get confused when learning. Probably the 
students thought th=
e mantra was "yaatu" (instead of "yaat") and got 
used to that mis-pronunci=
ation. Probably, that became a standard 
practice after a couple of centuri=
es.
>  
> If you pronounce the English word "path", you do not change it 
t=
o "paaththu". You say "th" at the end of "path" as a consonant and 
leave i=
t there. You don't force an vowel sound to be added at the 
end. The same t=
hing holds for "t" in "prachodayaat".
>  
> *        *        *
>  
> What =
I said about words ending in consonants applies to all 
consonants and not =
just "t", though "t" is more commonly encountered. 
There can be words that=
 end in "n" or "k" etc also. There also, 
people normally add an artificial=
 vowel sound at the end and end up 
changing the chhandas and altering the =
flow of energy in the mantra. 
That is also wrong.

>  
> One more common mistake is the sound "tha" (as in "kathaa" =3D 
sto=
ry). Most south Indians pronounce this as "dha" (as in "dhana" =3D 
money).=
 In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha 
looks very simi=
lar and just one dot in the middle is different. It is 
possible that some =
people started mispronouncing this sound because 
of their inability to see=
 the dot and others started following. Now 
pronouncing tha as dha became m=
ainstream and one pronouncing 
correctly will be the odd person out.
>  
> =
Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols for 
the same =
sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The 
letters "tha" and "=
dha" are different and their sounds are different 
too. Pronounce "t" (as i=
n "tanu" =3D body or "taamra" =3D copper) with a 
stress/aspiration to get =
"th" (as in "kathaa" =3D story).
>  
> In the sankalpa before many poojas, =
people say "dharmaartha kaama 
moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham=
". This means "for 
attaining the purusharthas (purposes of human existence=
) - dharma 
(fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling =

desires) and moksha (developing detachment)". Most people end up 
pronounc=
ing "dharmaartha kaama moksha" as "dharmaardha kaama moksha". 
It means "ha=
lf of dharma, kaama and moksha". Even "siddhardham" 
means "half attainment=
" and "purushaardha" means "half a human". Mis-
pronunciation in this sanka=
lpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it 
committed by many many trained pri=
ests!
