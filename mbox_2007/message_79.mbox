Dear Vikrant,

since long.......

moksh or mukti then what happens...then what happens to the atman(the soul)=
....if one knows that this is his last physical life in this world and he w=
ill not be born again since he has now cut/stop the cycle of death & re-bir=
th then what happens to his/her soul after this life....in this specific ca=
se where does the soul go after leaving the body...does it get dissolved in=
 the cosmic universe or what...what is the final resting place or final des=

All that there=
 is is Brahman. Just as ripples arise in ocean and the ripples forget that =
they are just ocean and form a separate identity and look at other parts of=
 the same ocean as different ripples/other objects, a part of Brahman forge=
ts that it is Brahman and forms a separate identity. It starts looking at o=
ther parts of Brahman as different objects.
 
Moksha is when one completely=
 loses these false self-identities and realizes one's true nature, i.e. tha=
t one is not a ripple but the ocean itself.
 
There are two kinds. In the f=
irst kind, one enters a Nirvikalpa samadhi. One just merges in Brahman. One=
 no longer has any self-identification (e.g. "I am Vikrant", "I am Narasimh=
a", "I am an astrologer", "I am a good person" etc). One neither perceives =
"self" or "other". One's perception is clear of any objects or duality. One=
 just swims in the bliss that true self is (sat-chid-ananda). There is no e=
xperience. There is no self, no objects to be experienced and no experience=
.
 
If one reaches this state and does not return from the state (Ramakrish=
na Paramahamsa used to say "salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocea=
n and melted and mixed with the ocean"), that is moksha.
 
The second kind =
is even more difficult. In that kind, one enters Sahaja samadhi. One sees d=
ifferent objects of this dual world and interacts with those objects as if =
one is a limited object too. But yet, one fully realizes that all objects a=
re non-different from Brahman. In terms of our ocean-ripple analogy, one re=
alizes that one is not a ripple but ocean and yet acts like a ripple with o=
ther ripples without any corruption in the understanding that all is ocean.=
 Being rooted in non-duality perfectly while perceiving and acting in the d=
ual world is indeed difficult. One who reaches this state is living and yet=
 liberated (jeevanmukta). This is an extremely difficult thing.
 
There hav=
e been many who got moksha, but very very very very few who got moksha whil=
e living in the body and acting in the body. Yogis like Shirdi Sai Baba, Ra=
makrishna Paramahamsa and Ramana Maharshi are indeed rare.
 
BTW, it is my =
feeling that you will benefit from performing Mahaganapathi homam with some=
 regularity. If interested, please pursue the link below.
