rought up a question that I have had for quite some time now:

Sushil-ji wr=

"Om Gung Ganpataye Namah"

In other places,=
 I have seen "Om Gan Ganapathaye Namah", as well as 
"Om Gam Ganapathaye Na=

Will the learned folks kindly provide their guidance on what the rig=
ht
version is, and hopefully provide pronunciation tips as well?

Many Than=
ks in advance!
