Namaste!

Visiting the forum after a long time. Its always good to meet fel=
low 
travellers on the way and say hi, or namaste or whatever.

For some ye=
ars now i try to do sadhana regularly...not expecting 
anything in particul=
ar...just trying to be in the present and live 
each moment with awareness.=


Apart from the practices it is the following shlokas / mantras which 
hav=
e helped, i think...

"Sahana vavatu...."
"Asato Maa...."
"Om namo bhagvate=
 vasudevaya...."

The first two are part of the practices. the third is wha=
t goes on in 
the mind sometimes....without much prompting.

yesterday i re=
ad something about Rahu-Jupiter connection that set me 
thinking. i know th=
is is not an astrology forum and studying charts 
are a no, no. I also know=
 that when we are on the path of sadhana, 
astrology should not distract us=
. But some distraction did occur when 
i read about what rahu does to jupit=
er.

My guru says that we should have no expectations....if something 
happ=
ens its good....if nothing happens it may be even better...

somethings hav=
e happened that i am aware of....some things may be 
happening that i am no=
t aware of....

but what i read about the Rahu-jupiter connection is that s=
ometimes 
rahu eats up jupiter...i dont know what that means.

i have rahu =
in 8th with Mars in Saggi opposed by Sun-Jupiter-Mercury 
combo in 2nd. The=
re is a constant battle between Rahu and Jupiter 
that i am conscious of in=
 my mind....because i dont know the reality.

i also know that no astrologi=
cal answer holds the key. but still i 
would like to ask what such an oppos=
ition signifies...

its also ok if i dont get a response since this is not =
an astro forum.

Let us all think that nomatter what Jupiter's light will a=
lways shine.

Best regards,

Vinita
