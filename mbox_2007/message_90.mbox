Aaapne mere Dil ki baat chhin li... this para gives a wonderful 
mes=
sage as well as clears lot of confusions. the human mind is such 
that it g=
ets involved in many seemingly opposite paths at the same 
time. for instan=
ce in spiritual quest, it engages in Rituals, 
Devotional Songs, Japa on on=
e side whereas on the other side it also 
practices Yoga Maarg, Meditation =
etc and not enough with that it 
also likes to contemplate on 'Self Enquiry=
'. I have always felt that 
Integration is possible and can also prove very=
 effective. But 
bottom line for me is what Thakur said, that is to cultiva=
te Love 
for Almighty is absolutely necessary otherwise there is great dang=
er 
of sticking to the taller buildings while forgeting the ultimate 
leap =
to reach the sky.

I am also firm believer of the statement "Ja ja mata ta =
ta Pata'. 
Faith is the most important. if somebody Takes a Mobile Phone 
i=
nstrument & believes that His God is that, then with sincere belief 
& pers=
istent efforts, he or she will ultimately reach the Goal thro' 
that Mobile=
 instrument.

lot of freewheeling thoughts from me. I am sorry if it sounde=
d 
absurd.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
