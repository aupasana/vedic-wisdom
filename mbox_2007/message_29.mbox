The Teachings of the B=
hagavad Gita

[DEATH AND TRANSMIGRATION OF SOUL]

Just as a person puts on =
new garments after discarding the old ones; 
similarly, the living entity o=
r the individual soul acquires new 
bodies after casting away the old bodie=
s. (2.22)

Weapons do not cut this Spirit, fire does not burn it, water doe=
s not 
make it wet, and the wind does not make it dry. The Spirit cannot be=
 
cut, burned, wetted, or dried. It is eternal, all pervading, 
unchanging,=
 immovable, and primeval. (2.23-24)

The Spirit is said to be unexplainable=
, incomprehensible, and 
unchanging. Knowing the Spirit as such you should =
not grieve. (2.25)

Even if you think that the physical body takes birth an=
d dies 
perpetually, even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this. =

Because death is certain for the one who is born, and birth is 
certain fo=
r the one who dies. Therefore, you should not lament over 
the inevitable. =
(2.26-27)

All beings are unmanifest, or invisible to our physical eyes bef=
ore 
birth and after death. They manifest between the birth and the death 
=
only. What is there to grieve about? (2.28)

You Are Not Your Body

"The body changes with=
 every moment.  We change our minds all the 
time.  Our intellects are cons=
tantly fluctuating =96 sometimes 
expanding, sometimes contracting.  But ou=
r true self, the soul, is 
ever constant.  Our true self is never-changing =
and is immortal.  
Know that true self within and you will know all."

Sama Darshana:  The Natu=
re of True Equality in Sanatana Dharma
 
Dr. Frank Morales
(Sri Dharma Prav=
artaka Acharya)
 
 
Beginning with the so-called "Enlightenment" era in Eur=
opean history, 
the ideological doctrine of radical human egalitarianism ha=
s become 
the most sacrosanct dogma in the realms of both politics and 
cul=
ture.  The fight for equality has been the foremost social-
political conce=
rn globally for the past 250 years, inspiring wars, 
revolutions, Marxist t=
otalitarianism, genocides, and devastating 
social upheaval.  So central ha=
s the concept of Radical 
Egalitarianism been in the modern political lands=
cape that it has 
often overshadowed every other political, philosophical, =
and social 
concern we can think of.  
 
Despite three continuous centuries=
 of forcing "Enlightenment" era 
notions of equality upon humanity, however=
, the world's problems have 
only gotten infinitely worse.  With more pover=
ty, more corruption, 
more wars, more unethical behavior, an ever-deeper se=
nse of 
meaningless in the world's youth, and the increasingly rapid 
coars=
ening and degeneration of traditional cultures globally, many 
intellectual=
s and spiritually oriented people are today beginning to 
ask the inevitabl=
e question:  "Has the dogma of radical 
egalitarianism actually outlived it=
s usefulness?"  
 
The answer to this question, from the perspective of San=
atana Dharma 
(Hinduism) is neither a yes nor a no, but rather leads us to =
the more 
philosophically sophisticated question of:  "What is the nature o=
f 
the human person?"  For only in knowing this can we understand the 
true=
 nature and meaning of equality.  In the following, I will 
explain the Dha=
rmic view of equality juxtaposed to the materialist-
oriented Radical Egali=
tarianism that the world has fervently pursued 
for the last several centur=
ies.  
 
The metaphysical premises of Radical Egalitarianism are based upon=
 an 
outlook of empiricist materialism that views the human individual as 
=
consisting of nothing more than merely the physical, the body.  For 
the ma=
terialist, human beings do not have a soul, or an intrinsic 
essence, that =
transcends the material body, which is itself composed 
of nothing more tha=
n the combination of chemicals and material 
substances formed over myriad =
millennia via the process of 
evolution.  The human individual, for the Rad=
ical Egalitarian, is a 
soulless and ultimately purposeless machine, an aut=
omaton whose only 
meaning lies in whatever material and economic contribut=
ions the 
individual can make to the greater social whole.  Thus, one "livi=
ng 
body" is just as good as any other.  
 
Such a mechanistic view of the =
human individual has led not only to 
the notion of radical equality, but a=
lso to the consequent view that 
all human individuals are ultimately equal=
ly worthless.  Thus we have 
seen the birth of the "end justifies the means=
" form of "ethics" that 
has arisen amongst the Marxists, and the consequen=
t death and 
genocide that has resulted from every Communist regime the wor=
ld has 
ever known.  If all human bodies are of equal worth, then no one 
i=
ndividual is of more importance than any other individual.  Thus all 
are e=
qually expendable.  
 
A society that sees humans as soulless is a society =
that sees human 
beings as being of no more worth than machines.  And machi=
nes are 
simply tools to be used for the benefit of the state.  For the 
Ra=
dical Egalitarian, the human being is no more than a means to an 
end, an o=
bject for their own use, rather than a subject worthy of all 
the dignity, =
appreciation, and respect that a unique human person 
deserves.  
 
The Dha=
rmic view of equality and the human person is considerably 
more sophistica=
ted, compassionate, and thus ethical, than the 
materialist egalitarian app=
roach.  For the conscious and sincere 
follower of Sanatana Dharma, the hum=
an person consists of infinitely 
more than the mere bodily surface appeara=
nce.  The old adage that one 
cannot judge a book by its cover comes to min=
d when we examine the 
wisdom of the Dharmic approach.  
 
Rather than simp=
listically attempting to reduce a human person to 
being merely the visible=
 material body that one can immediately 
detect with the senses, Dharma tea=
ches us that the typical human 
being is actually a multi-faceted and multi=
-dimensional being, with a 
material dimension, a causal dimension, and ult=
imately a spiritual 
dimension that is not always clearly visible to the un=
trained eye.  
The human person consists of a) deha (physical body), b) man=
as (mind 
substance, including impressionistic data, memory, etc.), c) budd=
hi 
(the rational faculties), d) ahamkara (false, individuating ego), and 
=
most importantly e) atman (the true, spiritual self).  
 
According to the =
Dharma world-view, we certainly are beings who 
possess bodies =96 no sane =
person would deny this immediate empirical 
fact.  Indeed, contrary to the =
unnatural and illogical conclusions 
that the Radical Egalitarian draws fro=
m this simple fact, from a 
purely physical perspective, there is actually =
an almost infinitely 
great degree of diversity and inequality that is clea=
rly empirically 
seen.  Physically speaking, no two people in the world are=
 really the 
same.  Some are tall, others short.  One person is strong, ano=
ther 
weak.  Some need glasses, hearing aids, or other devices to "even out=
 
the playing field" (i.e., pretend that we are all physically equal!), 
ot=
her people are free from physical defects altogether.  The 
diversity we fi=
nd in physical bodies is endless.  That is common 
sense.  By extension, wh=
en looking at the minds and the intellectual 
capacities of various individ=
uals, we clearly see that some are more 
intelligent than others.  Some are=
 more naturally artistic and 
creative, whereas some are more analytical an=
d cerebral.  Some people 
will have mental or emotional challenges, such as=
 psychosis, bipolar 
disorder, or retardation, others have minds so healthy=
 as to allow 
them to view reality with tremendous clarity.  
 
Egoic desir=
es, preferences and goals, too, are as diverse in content 
and quantity as =
are the numerous people we see around us.  Some 
aspire to become great wor=
ld leaders.  Others desire wealth, or fame, 
or romantic love.  Some people=
, by contrast, seem to have a profound 
yearning to know God, and serve the=
ir fellow beings with humility, 
simplicity, deep compassion, and quiet det=
ermination.  We are all 
different from one another.  Thus, we are all in s=
o many ways unequal 
in our appearance, our abilities, our preferences, and=
 our desires.
 
Rather than attempting to lie to ourselves and artificially=
 fly in 
the face of clearly discernable empirical facts, Sanatana Dharma 
=
encourages all human beings to respect each other, honor our 
differences, =
and work together in compassion, dignity and harmony, 
despite our undeniab=
le recognition of all our many differences.  
Sanatana Dharma (the Eternal =
Natural Way), thus gives us the 
empowerment to live in accordance with the=
 natural order of the 
universe in a manner that is beneficial to all.  
 
=
For Dharma, the realm of true equality lies not on the physical, 
mental, i=
ntellectual, or egoic planes, but in the realm of spirit.  
Having God as o=
ur sole source, sustainer, and ultimate destiny, we 
all share in the same =
parent.  From a spiritual perspective, then, in 
the deepest essence of who=
 we are as pure spiritual beings (atman), 
we are all equally the children =
of God.  
 
Your true, spiritual self (atman) does not have color, nor dime=
nsion, 
nor race, nor class, nor gender.  In spirit, you are neither a 
cap=
italist, nor a communist.  You are neither Indian, nor Black, nor 
White no=
r Latin.  Rather, your true self is the eternal, perfect, 
blissful spiritu=
al center of your everyday existence: Atman.    
 
Transcending both the bo=
dily dimensions of life and all limited 
materiality, your true self finds =
itself currently situated in your 
body due only to your own free-will desi=
res, motivations, 
consciousness, and actions of the past.  Karma is the ca=
usal 
antecedent of all the diverse material bodies that we see around us. =
 
While our bodies and minds are all radically different, however, the 
sou=
ls of every living being are all equally held in the compassionate 
glance =
of God's merciful and loving gaze.  To God, we are all equally 
His childre=
n, temporarily separated from Him, but all destined to one 
day again be in=
 His loving embrace.  
 
Equality is an exceedingly important goal toward w=
hich we should all 
aspire.  In the political realm, Dharma calls upon each=
 of us to 
always be compassionate, just, and fair to all we encounter, no =

matter how different they may seem to us in physical appearance.  The 
onl=
y truly pure equality that exists, however, is that equality that 
exists o=
n the spiritual realm.  Thus, in the transcendental eyes of 
the yogi, or p=
ure sage, all living being are seen with equal vision 
(sama darshina).  
 =

This concept of spiritually-inspired equal vision is beautifully 
explaine=
d to us by Lord Sri Krishna in His famous Bhagavad Gita (Song 
of God).  In=
 the 18th verse of chapter 5, Lord Krishna instructs His 
devotee Arjuna in=
 the following way:
 
 
Vidya-vinaya-sampanne
Brahmane gavi hastini
Shuni c=
aiva shvapake cha
Panditah sama-darshinah
 
 
"The humble sage, by virtue o=
f true knowledge,
sees with equal vision [sama-darshina]
the learned and ge=
ntle priest, a cow, an elephant,
a dog or an outcaste."
 
 
Indeed, because=
 the humble sage views the diverse beings around him, 
not as mere mechanis=
tic bodies, but as all possessing a pure spirit 
soul (atman), he does not =
even see the difference between different 
species of life, what to speak o=
f different kinds of human beings!  
To the sage, the soul of the cow, and =
the dog, and the elephant is 
just a worthy of dignity, respect, and spirit=
ual equality as is the 
soul contained in the human being.  Sama Darshina, =
or equal spiritual 
vision, is the highest form of equality toward which we=
 can all 
aspire =96 for it sees the inherent equality that exists in the 
=
spiritual essence of all living beings.  Seeing all beings as our 
spiritua=
l brothers and sisters, we will then, by natural extension, 
offer all peop=
le our respect on the political, social, cultural, and 
economic realms.  
=
 
The truly equal society, then, is the Dharmic society, a society 
compris=
ed of citizens who aspire toward the finer and nobler 
spiritual aspiration=
s of life, and who thus view the world from a 
spiritual perspective.  That=
 nation which will most justly serve the 
interests of its people is the Dh=
arma Nation.  Make yourself a truly 
worthy citizen of God's Dharma Nation =
by spiritualizing your own 
vision and viewing your neighbors and fellow li=
ving beings as the 
atmans they truly are.  Begin the Dharma Revolution in =
your own life!
