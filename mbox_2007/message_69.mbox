The Teachings of the Bhagavad Gita


DANGERS OF UNRESTRAINED SENSES

Restl=
ess senses, O Arjuna, forcibly carry away the mind of even a 
wise person s=
triving for perfection. (2.60)

One should fix one's mind on God with lovin=
g contemplation after 
bringing the senses under control. One's intellect b=
ecomes steady 
when one's senses are under complete control. (2.61)

One de=
velops attachment to sense objects by thinking about sense 
objects. Desire=
 for sense objects comes from attachment to sense 
objects, and anger comes=
 from unfulfilled desires. (2.62)

Delusion or wild idea arises from anger.=
 The mind is bewildered by 
delusion. Reasoning is destroyed when the mind =
is bewildered. One 
falls down from the right path when reasoning is destro=
yed. (2.63)

Are Hindus Idol Worshipers?

by Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.
(Sri Dharma =
Pravartaka Acharya)

>From the very earliest dawn of religious consciousness=
 in human 
beings, people have attempted to approach and know the Divine by=
 the 
use of various intermediary devices.  Such vehicles of worship and 
m=
editation have included divine images, sacred relics of saints, and 
hallow=
ed objects of many descriptions.  The use of images as  a path 
through whi=
ch finite humanity can approach the Infinite has been 
found in every tradi=
tional culture, religion, and nation on earth.  
The use of images as a way=
 to know the Divine has been the 
overwhelming norm =96 and not the excepti=
on =96 in the history of the 
world's many religions.  
 
The almost sole e=
xception to this means of approaching God has 
occurred in the relatively r=
ecent religions of the Western world.  
For the majority of adherents of th=
e Abrahamic sects (Judaism, 
Christianity, and Islam), the use of images as=
 tools for meditation 
and prayer has been looked upon as a taboo religious=
 activity.  Many 
Western religions consequently oppose the practice of wha=
t they 
term "idol" worship.  The leaders of these Abrahamic sects have 
re=
peatedly condemned worshipers who employ images of divine figures 
as "Devi=
l worshipers", "idolaters", "heathens" and "infidels", among 
other unchari=
table descriptions.  Those who use icons as a means of 
worship have faced =
persecution, denunciation, and even death at the 
hands of such "idol" smas=
hers.  But is the conscious use of sacred 
imagery in worship and meditatio=
n really to be considered "idol 
worship" and consequently condemned?  Foll=
owers of Sanatana Dharma 
are known to use sacred images as focal points fo=
r meditation and 
worship, and have suffered significant persecution as a r=
esult.  Are 
Hindus actually idol worshipers?  
 
The concept of an "idol" =
does not refer merely to any iconographic 
image that is used in worship.  =
Rather the term "idol" refers 
specifically to an image that is made up, co=
ncocted in the mind of 
its maker, and then claimed to be a divinity.  An i=
dol in the proper 
sense of the term refers to something that one worships =
as a result 
of his or her own whim, and not as a result of the teachings o=
f 
sacred scriptures. 
 
This, however, is not what Hindus are doing when w=
e venerate sacred 
images.  Hindus are not idol worshipers because the imag=
es that we 
employ in worship are not contrived by humans.  
 
Rather than =
"idols", Hindus worship what are properly 
called "Murtis".  Murti worship =
is a divine science revealed to 
humanity in order to facilitate our closen=
ess to God.  Sacred Hindu 
images are not the fanciful creations of the hum=
an imagination.  
Rather, such sacred images were revealed to Hindu worship=
ers by sages 
(Rishis) who have directly experienced the nature of the Divi=
ne.  To 
use objects as a focus for devotional prayer and contemplation is =

perfectly fine, as long as these images are God-revealed.
 
The science of=
 employing divine imagery is found in sacred revealed 
texts known as the A=
gamas and Pancaratras.  In these texts, the 
entire science of image venera=
tion is laid out in a logical and 
reasonable manner.  For example there ar=
e very exacting 
specifications for precisely how such images must be creat=
ed, 
including the exact dimensions of the images, the rituals necessary 
t=
o create them, and what sacred mantras must be recited during the 
process.=
  Indeed, even the exact size of every toe has to be 
according to certain =
strict specifications.  Only when these images 
are in accord with these ex=
act specifications do they then become 
vehicles of the Divine, and proper =
objects of veneration and 
meditation.
 
In following these exact requireme=
nts of the sacred texts of Sanatana 
Dharma the worshiper is performing a v=
ery special sacred process 
known as Murti worship, which is categorically =
distinct from "idol" 
worship.  
 
The term "idol" is a clearly derogatory =
term used by unthinking 
followers of anti-Hindu religions to persecute and=
 revile the 
profound spiritual tradition of Sanatana Dharma.  In the same =
way 
that other derogatory terms have been removed from civilized human 
di=
scourse, the term "idol" must never be used again by either Hindus 
or non-=
Hindus to refer to the sublime science of Murti worship.  
 
Indeed, even H=
indus themselves have often been guilty of using the 
term "idol" in ignora=
nce of the nature of their own religion.  
Whether the term is used by eith=
er Hindus or non-Hindus, the use of 
the term "idol" to refer to our sacred=
 imagery must be immediately 
stopped.  Rather we must begin to use such pr=
oper Sanskrit terms as 
Murti, Archa, etc. when referring to our sacred ima=
gery.  
 
Our own ignorance of our own religion is just as inexcusable as i=
s a 
non-Hindu's ignorance of our religion.  Let us take pride in the 
divi=
ne gift that the Rishis have bestowed upon us in the form of 
Murti worship=
.

that it is w=
rong.  I'm wondering if you could provide any advice 
concerning this.  I w=
ould truly appreciate ANY help.  My husband is 
not, and will not, become v=
egetarian along with me, so this too will 
be a hurdle to overcome.  I very=
 much enjoy reading your blogs.  I 
have found them to be very helpful.  Yo=
ur wisdom is invaluable.
 
Hari Om,"
 
                                   -=
 Pam

---------------------------------------------------------------------=
-
----

Sri Acharya Ji's Response: 

Dear Pam,
 
Namaste.  Thank you for yo=
ur kind message.  It's great meeting you.
 
I'm sorry to hear about the pro=
blems you're having becoming 
vegetarian.  The difficulty definitely varies=
 from person to person.  
 
I became vegetarian when I was first twelve, an=
d was living in a 
family of very dedicated meat-eaters.  One thing that I =
found helpful 
when I first became vegetarian was to try to do it a little =
at a 
time.  It took me about a year before I was a full vegetarian.  
 
Fi=
rst I gave up all red meats - beef, pork, etc.  Then after some 
time, I ga=
ve up on the lighter meats like chicken and turkey.  A few 
months after th=
at, I then stopped eating fish.  Lastly I gave up on 
eggs as well.  
 
Aga=
in, it took roughly a year by the time I entered the last stage.  
In this =
way, the transition was much easier, and each stage gave my 
body and mind =
time to get adjusted to giving up something they had 
been accustomed to ha=
ving for so long.  I would suggest that you try 
a similar approach.  
 
In=
 addition, it is very helpful to do as much reading on the benefits 
of veg=
etarianism as possible in order to keep inspired about why 
you're giving u=
p meat to begin with.  Half the battle is mental!
 
As for your husband not=
 wanting to join you in becoming vegetarian, 
I'm sure that definitely is a=
n added stresser for you.  I would very 
patiently and subtilely just conti=
nue to speak to him about the many 
benefits of a vegetarian diet in a way =
that he would most 
appreciate.  Is he health conscious?  Then stress the h=
ealthy 
benefits of the diet.  
 
The important thing is to not put too muc=
h pressure on him, because 
especially with family members, that can someti=
mes backfire.  No one 
likes to feel as if their spouse is preaching to the=
m.  And the 
normal reaction is often to push back.  Rather, you want to be=
 as 
loving and patient with him as possible, always just gently 
suggestin=
g, and never insisting.  
 
In addition, often a spouse will eventually bec=
ome vegetarian simply 
by seeing their partner's own quiet example, and obs=
erving how their 
vegetarian partner is slowly becoming healthier, more ene=
rgetic, and 
happier as a result of their choice to become vegetarian.  Oft=
en this 
alone is enough to encourage them.  
 
Don't give up on your choic=
e, Pam.  Vegetarianism is the most 
intelligent, healthy, and beneficial di=
et a person can follow.  In 
time, God Himself will give you the strength t=
o follow this path.  I 
hope this was a helpful.  Take care.
 
Om Shanti,
 =

Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya
