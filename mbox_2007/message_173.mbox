Namaste friends,
 
The latest version of "Sri Mahaganapathi Homam Manual: L=
aghu Paddhati (Short Procedure)" is available at the link below. The proced=
ure has been fine-tuned some more for a better results and some explanation=
s have also been refined.
 
Also, a super-short procedure with bare minimum=
 mantras is included as an appendix, as per the advice of my guru. The shor=
t procedure taught earlier was still too complicated for many people and co=
ntains several Sanskrita mantras, some from Veda. The newer super-short pro=
cedure will allow more people to take advatantage of homam. One can do a qu=
ick fire worship of Ganapathi in 15-20 minutes using this super-short proce=
dure.
 
The section on the benefits of homam has also been enriched more.
 =

A new MP3 audio file that matches with the procedure given in the document=
 will soon be uploaded.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
