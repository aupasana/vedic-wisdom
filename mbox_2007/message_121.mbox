Dear Narasimha ji,
Thank you very much for reply. I am also in the same sit=
uation. I am 
staying in an apartment in USA. Could you please elaborate ho=
w the 
people living in apartment in USA are doing? Is it through dry 
coco=
nut pieces?
                                      Thanks and Regards,
     =
                                    Kumar Ghanta
