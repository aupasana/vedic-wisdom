Yours is a loaded question. Let me try to give a =
simple (and simplistic) answer.

Supreme cosmic being (Brahman) does not cr=
eate or destroy anything. Supreme cosmic being has no gunas (attributes/qua=
lities/properties) whatsoever. Though all possible objects, qualities and a=
ttributes lie within Brahman as a pontentiality, Brahman himself/herself/it=
self does not have any attributes. At time minus infinity, there was just B=
rahman and no objects within. The whole universe was filled with Brahman an=
d nothing else.

Then a minute part of Brahman developed an ego (I-ness or =
sense of "I"). Sense of "I" requires some attributes. So, this part of Brah=
man formed an identity based on certain attributes. As a minute part of the=
 ocean may form itself as a wave and think of itself as a small wave instea=
d of thinking of itself as ocean (which it really is), this being thinks of=
 himself as a different being from Brahman.

Thus, several gods with variou=
s attributes come into being. Please note that they are all different from =
Brahman and limited in their scope, bound by the attributes that they have =
given to themselves.

The creator Brahma (different from attribute-less Bra=
hman) comes into being like that from the Supreme Cosmic Being. The attribu=
tes he thinks of when coming into being and forming an ego make him create =
various other beings in this world. He sees it as his purpose.

When we hav=
e a dream in our sleep, we fashion a small part of Brahman as various dream=
 objects with certain attributes. Similarly, Brahma fashions a minute part =
of Brahman as various world objects - such as you and I - with certain attr=
ibutes.

These objects (you and I) have a sense of "I" based on the attribu=
tes imagined by Brahma and they go on interacting with other objects (just =
as objects we see in our dreams interact with each other).

As we experienc=
e and interact with more and more objects, the sense of "I" becomes very ve=
ry dense. After a while, we totally forget that we are actually attribute-l=
ess Brahman. We think that we have certain attributes and our attributes de=
termine our purpose in life.

One of the purposes dictated by the attribute=
s taken by Brahma when he came into being was to create some other deities.=
 Those deities are also made from minute portions of Brahman with several a=
ttributes. Those attributes decide some purposes for them. These purposes h=
ave been designed so that there is some order in this world.

The world is =
hence full of beings that are limited by various attributes. The attributes=
 decide the purpose of the being. If everybody fulfils their purpose, there=
 is some order in the system. Thus, your first answer is valid.

However, a=
ll these beings are nothing but parts of Brahman, who have forgotten that t=
hey are attribute-less Brahman and fancy themselves as objects with various=
 attributes.

Based on the rules made by gods when Brahma was creating all =
these objects, we keep on accumulating karmas (actions, carried out due to =
the attributes) and keep on reaping the fruits of those karmas.

Thus, we k=
eep on moving from one set of attributes to another set, change from one bo=
dy to another, serve one purpose after the other. This is a pontentially en=
dless cycle.

The conditioning of the mind is weak in gods like Brahma, Vis=
hnu, Shiva etc, who too are serving various purposes dictated by their attr=
ibutes, and they can meditate on their true nature for a small time and ful=
ly realize that they are just Brahman. We, on the other hand, change so man=
y bodies and go through so many experiences that the conditioning of the mi=
nd becomes so dense that it is difficult to realize the nature of true self=
. The sense that "I am this body and I am different from others" is so stro=
ng. Still, it is possible to overcome the conditioning and realize the true=
 self.

When a yogi reaches samadhi, it is possible to perceive that the en=
tire world, including oneself, is just the attribute-less Brahman and that =
there are really no objects. In other words, it is possible for us to escap=
e from the dreams/imaginations of Brahma. As as a part of Brahman is stuck =
in our dreams as an object with specific attributes, we too are stuck in th=
e thoughts of Brahma (creator) as objects with certain attributes. We can e=
scape from that and realize our true nature.

To answer your question on wh=
y Supreme Cosmic Being creates all this confusion, the supreme cosmic being=
 does not do or want or think anything. It is the limited manifestation cal=
led Brahma (creator) that does this. He knows no better, because the attrib=
utes he originally thought of for himself compel him to do so. However, he =
left the scope for all the objects fashioned by him to realize their true n=
ature.

To answer your question at a more practical level, this is what eac=
h person can do: (1) Keep doing the duties that come to you naturally. (2) =
At a subtler level, question yourself who you actually are. Think "am I thi=
s body? Did I exist before this body existed? Will I exist when this body i=
s given up?" Cultivate detachment to the body and tell yourself that you ar=
e the attribte-less Brahman.

If you do not understand all that I wrote, do=
 not worry. This is actually high level philosophy explained in simple term=
s. It may be difficult for some to understand or appreciate.

Best regards,=

Narasimha
