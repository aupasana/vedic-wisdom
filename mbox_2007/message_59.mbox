Subject: Mahaganapathi=
 Homam Background


Namaste revered friends and elders,

I mentioned a Maha=
ganapathi homam manual and audio in my mail a few days back. There is a sma=
ll story behind it.

My spiritual guru Dr Manish Pandit had a dream a few y=
ears back. In the dream, eight Siddhas took him to Chennai and showed him a=
 big fire there. They told him that Mahaganapathi homam would be performed =
by lakhs of people in future across the world and that the big fire was due=
 to that movement. They told him that this fire had to be lit now and that =
he had to start spreading Mahaganapathi homam in the world. He wondered if =
spreading homam in Kali yuga was a good idea. They told him it was. They sa=
id that even many religiously inclined and good people do not get to spend =
many hours everyday in sadhana unlike in the old days and that the times ar=
e changing. With people spending a small amount of time on spiritual sadhan=
a everyday, they said a more powerful sadhana like homam is needed. An half=
 hour homam everyday is equivalent to 5 hours of meditation. In old days, p=
eople were happily spending 5 hours in meditation each day. That is no long=
er possible for most people these days and hence homam can help. The Siddha=
s told him that homam was very much needed in today's times. As adharma inc=
reases in the world, more people need to be doing homam on a regular basis =
to counter it.

A few years after this dream, we went to the Kalikambal tem=
ple in Chennai for a Shata Chandi Homam. At that event, Manish Pandit saw t=
he same eight Siddhas who had earlier come in his dream. They were meditati=
ng on the premises of the Kalikambal temple!

After doing his 21st Chandipa=
atham of the Shata Chandi, the Divine Mother appeared before him on a Frida=
y afternoon. The temple was closed then and only Manish Pandit and another =
person were inside. Nobody else was around. The other person did not see th=
e Divine Mother, but he reported that he smelled something out of the ordin=
ary and was baffled. The Divine Mother told Manish Pandit to start spreadin=
g Mahaganapathi homam and said that the resources needed would be arranged.=
 The very next day, Swami Sathasivom had a friend gift some books on Mahaga=
napathi homam to Manish Pandit and me! Later, one thing led to another and =
I have put together the document and the audio that is now available on my =
website (see below). Our idea was to come up with a simple Vedic procedure =
that takes only 30-45 minutes, which any householder can do as a daily prac=
tice. We have some people actually doing this homam daily for several month=
s now.

I have revealed the above with permission from Manish Pandit.

I gu=
ess the Siddhas who decided to spread Mahaganapathi homam simply chose us a=
s the instruments and arranged things for us. In fact, how my wife and I me=
t Swami Sathasivom in Boston and how it was decided to have the Shata Chand=
i Homam with Manish Pandit at Chennai Kalikambal temple was all very intere=
sting. A lot of interesting coincidences led to the preparation of the Maha=
ganapathi homam manual and audio. Hopefully, some more people will be able =
to put the resources to practical use.

Best regards,
Narasimha
