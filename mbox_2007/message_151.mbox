Dear Narasimha ji,

Namaste! You started a very good topic. We will be look=
ing forward to
your nice observations on some common mistakes. I am followi=
ng your
mails for last 6 years and I notice rapid increase of your satwik
b=
hava and decrease of rajasik bhava as reflected in your posting and
replies=
.  

Last time when we were doing chandi path (to which you kindly guided
m=
e), I requested priests to do a sampusti with saranagata
dinaarta...... The=
re were ten priests, some of them were young. And
the sampusti was done by =
each of them on rotation. To my disbelieve,
some of the younger priests wer=
e reciting the verse as "saranagata
dina arta......sarba <khaayati>rr hare =
devi narayani namastute". The
pronunciation was such that khaayti was sound=
ing more like "fame" than
"loss". I did not correct them as that would hurt=
 their pride - being
born to brahmin families. Moreover I did not have any =
wish to get
full-filled from the chandi-patha. So, I thought to leave it to=
 mother
- while correcting the recitation myself during my ahutis.

Best re=
gards,
Swadhin

If you change it =
into "yaattu" or "yaatu" by adding a vowel sound at
the end, it becomes two=
 aksharas. This increases the number of
aksharas, changes the chhandas and =
changes the meaning also. You may
still experience something when meditatin=
g on the mantra, but you will
never experience the mantra to the fullest wi=
th that pronunciation.
>  
> Akshara means "unperished". Vowels (swaras) ar=
e the praana (life
force) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant witho=
ut a vowel
after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara=
. It
perishes. For example, if you pronounce "t" as is (without adding any
=
sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the listener cannot
deciphe=
r what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.
>  
> In "prachodayaat=
", the whole sound "yaat" is one akshara. Because
"t" has no praana by itse=
lf, it simply joins to the akshara "yaa"
(which has the vowel "aa" as its p=
raana) and becomes part of that
akshara. In chhandas, "yaat" is considered =
one letter (one guru). When
you pronounce "yaat" correctly, it is difficult=
 for the listener to
know for sure whether you said "yaat" or "yaak" or "ya=
an". It is
possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The =
"t" at
the end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound without praana. S=
o
it tough to hear clearly.

There can be words that end in "n" or "k" etc also. Ther=
e also, people
normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up=
 changing
the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That =
is
also wrong.

he sound "tha" (as in "kathaa" =3D story).
Most south Indians pronounce thi=
s as "dha" (as in "dhana" =3D money). In
Telugu and Kannada scripts, the sy=
mbols of tha and dha looks very
similar and just one dot in the middle is d=
ifferent. It is possible
that some people started mispronouncing this sound=
 because of their
inability to see the dot and others started following. No=
w pronouncing
tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly wi=
ll be the
odd person out.
>  
> Sanskrit is not English. We never have two =
different symbols for the
same sound or two different sounds for the same s=
ymbol. The letters
"tha" and "dha" are different and their sounds are diffe=
rent too.
Pronounce "t" (as in "tanu" =3D body or "taamra" =3D copper) with=
 a
stress/aspiration to get "th" (as in "kathaa" =3D story).
>  
> In the s=
ankalpa before many poojas, people say "dharmaartha kaama
moksha chaturvidh=
a purushaartha siddhyartham". This means "for
attaining the purusharthas (p=
urposes of human existence) - dharma
(fulfilling duties), artha (work and m=
oney), kaama (fulfilling
desires) and moksha (developing detachment)". Most=
 people end up
pronouncing "dharmaartha kaama moksha" as "dharmaardha kaama=
 moksha".
It means "half of dharma, kaama and moksha". Even "siddhardham" m=
eans
"half attainment" and "purushaardha" means "half a human".
Mis-pronunc=
