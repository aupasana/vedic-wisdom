Hi Rohini,


    Statement about women is absolutely false. Many of the Ved=
ic
mantras were themselves "seen" by women. Check this website by the
Aurob=
indo Institute 
http://www.vedah.com/org2/literature/essence/women_&_rishik=
as.html

So, when women rishikas themselves are the origins of the mantras =
is
there anything left to say!!

PS: This site also has a lot of articles o=
n Vedas for the interested.

Thanks
Vasudev
