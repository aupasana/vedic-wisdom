Dear Narasimha ji

I have a few questions regarding the chandi path and I h=
ope you can 
help me with your knowledge as you have much experience in thi=
s. 

How do you do certain number of chandi paths? Does one person reads 
t=
he book continuously until the number of pathas is completed? 

I was wonde=
ring if it is OK to do simultaneous paths by say 7 people 
to complete sapt=
a chandi path? If that is possible then sata chandi 
path can be completed =
even in one day. But I remember you did that in 
Chennai over a period of 1=
0 days or so. In this case did the person 
(I think you) who took the sanka=
lp to complete the sata chandi path 
stayed in the temple from start to end=
?

I understand from my experience that without mother's wish such a 
thing=
 is not possible but do people invoke mother's protection in 
some way besi=
des choosing an auspicious time (as you did)

Thanks and with my best regar=
ds
Swadhin
