Dear Narasimha, pranaams

A friend of mine is deeply interested in p=
rocuring an idol of
Astadasabhuja Mahalakshmi for his daily worship. Despit=
e being widely
travelled in India/abroad, he has been unable to find one su=
ch idol.

In a previous post about the attributes of Durga saptashati, you
=
mentioned that a priest had come to your house and presented you with
one s=
uch idol. If you know where to get this idol, could you please tell
me?

be=
st regards

Hari
