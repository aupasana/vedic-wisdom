Subject: On Adwaitism, Shiva's Worship and Different Paths

Namaste Kris and others,

I will make a few freewheeling comments. As always, please ignore this fool 
if something sounds silly.

*        *        *

If you are interested in Advaitism (non-duality), I recommend reading the 
works of Adi Shankara. He is considered a great teacher of Advaitism and an 
incarnation of Lord Shiva Himself. In fact, a scripture mentions Shiva 
telling Parvati that he will be born in Kali Yuga as Adi Shankara to revive 
Advaitism and to refine the teachings of Buddha.

*        *        *

I personally consider "Yoga Vaasishtham" to be the highest treatise on 
Advaitism. I have read many authors, but none matches the brilliance of 
Vasishtha. After all, he is a maharshi and one of the saptarshis and it does 
show.

Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) about 
self-knowledge in great detail, in the presence of many gods and rishis 
including Maharshi Vishwamitra. These teachings were later taught by 
Maharshi Vaalmiki (author of Ramayana) to Maharshi Bharadwaja. Yoga 
Vaasishtham is thus a detailed account of Maharshi Vasishtha's teachings 
captured by Maharshi Vaalmiki.

The commentary by Swami Venkatesananda is quite an inspired one and I very 
very strongly recommend it to everyone deeply interested in the highest 
Hindu Advaitic philosophy. You can find it on amazon.com.

*        *        *

In "Yoga Vaasishtham" mentioned above, there is a beautiful narrative where 
Maharshi Vasishtha describes to Lord Rama his meeting with Lord Shiva. Lord 
Shiva teaches Vasishtha how to worship Him. He says, "there are many ways to 
worship me that are used by many foolish people who desire various things. 
They may even get various things worshipping me in those ways prescribed in 
some scriptures. But those are inferior methods of worship. Let me tell you 
the highest worship that is most dear to me. It is how a self-realized 
person worships me." He then describes the method so beautifully.

It is an absolutely beautiful account. I can say that Shiva's teachings to 
Vasishtha on the best way to worship Him are the essence of Vedas, the 
essence of BhagavadGeetha and the essence of the highest Hindu philosophy. 
One interested in self-realization and moksha must read Shiva's teachings 
and keep them at the back of their mind always.

I don't mean to be disrespectful to various aagamas and rituals prescribed 
in various scriptures. They all serve a purpose. But, if one views moksha 
(complete self-realization and the liberation that comes with it) as the 
highest goal, one cannot ignore the worship recommended by Shiva Himself to 
Vasishtha.

*        *        *

Hinduism is indeed a "collection of philosophies". However, that may be a 
misleading statement. It may suggest some inherent self-contradiction. That 
would be unfair.

Though different ripples of an ocean look different, the underlying ocean is 
the same. Similarly, the teachings of rishis form a single coherent 
philosophy (ocean) that appears as many philosophies (ripples) on the 
surface.

After all, Rigveda says "ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti", which means 
"Truth is One, but the learned call differently". Though Hinduism had no "no 
single founder" or ANY founder for that matter, all rishis tapped the same 
"Single Source of Knowledge" (the Self, known variously as Brahman, Shiva, 
Narayana, Krishna, Allah, Buddha etc) and hence there is a consistency in 
their understanding.

Unfortunately, not everyone can dive deep into the ocean of self-knowledge. 
Some are more comfortable floating on the surface (which is fun too). The 
teachings of rishis have something for everyone. This gives the appearance 
that rishis taught different contradicting philosophies. In fact, they 
didn't.

Like the gentleman below mentioned, there are three main views regarding the 
relationship between individual soul and the supreme soul. However, instead 
of viewing them as competing theories, one can also view them as steps in 
the same path. I want to share with all an *analogy* given by my spiritual 
master Dr Manish Pandit:

Imagine God to be a bright star in the sky. When you see from a distance, 
star seems tiny and you conclude that there is only one God. If you start 
moving towards God, you realize as you get closer that the star is in 
reality a huge diamond with 330 million faces. Each face is several miles 
long and wide and has various attributes (gunas). One face may be red and 
hot and another may be blue and cold etc. So, as you get closer to the 
diamond, you have to pick one face to get close to.

Now, when you get too close to a face, the whole world will seem to have the 
attributes of that face. For example, if you get too close to a face that is 
cold and blue, then the whole world will feel cold and blue to you. In other 
words, the God you are getting close to is the Supreme god of the world and 
fills the entire world as you experience it. You think that the whole world 
is filled with his energy. One who gets close to a blue face sees the whole 
world as blue. One who gets close to a yellow face sees the whole world as 
yellow. Similarly, a worshipper of Shiva may get close to Him and see Shiva 
in all deities and all beings. A worshipper of Narayana may get close to Him 
and see Narayana in all beings.

No wonder one scripture says that Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva etc all gods came 
from Narayana, while another scripture says the same about Mahaganapathi, 
while another scripture says the same thing about Shiva; and so on.

Reaching close to the deity is the ultimate goal in sadhana for one adhering 
to Dwaita siddhanta (duality). For them, getting close to ishta devata, 
securing a place near the feet and seeing the entire world as emanating from 
that deity is the highest goal. All gods and entire creation are extensions 
of that deity.

For some, there is a next stage: As you get closer and closer to the face 
you picked, you finally merge with it! This is the ultimate goal in sadhana 
for one adhering to Visishtaadwaita. You create a vaccum within yourself by 
completing killing ego-consciousness and the deity in question fills the 
vacuum.

To Advaitis, this communion with a Saguna ("with attributes") form of God is 
not the final goal. The final goal is to break through the face and jump 
into the inside of the diamond. As you break through any face of the diamond 
and jump into the interior of the diamond, you no longer perceive the faces 
of the diamond or the world outside. There are no longer any objects or 
attributes. There is no I-ness or It-ness or experience. The experiencer, 
experienced and experience all merge into one. The same thing happens 
irrespective of from which face the person jumped into the interior of the 
diamond. Whether one enters a nirvikalpa samadhi through oneness with 
Narayana or through oneness with Sadashiva or through oneness with 
Mahaganapathi, the state reached is identical. The path only is different.

Some people can jump into the interior of this diamond without first 
experiencing oneness with a face. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's Adwaitic guru 
Totapuri did not believe in any form and worshipped only the Formless 
Reality. He would directly jump into the interior of the diamond in this 
analogy. However, his disciple Ramakrishna Paramahamsa chose to first reach 
oneness with Mother Kaali and then reach the interior of the diamond by 
jumping from the face of the diamond representing Kaali. Both are valid 
paths.

I have written too much tonight. Let me end here now.

Best regards,
Narasimha
