Pranam friends, Pranam Narsimhaji,

you have written, 

"You take any Vedic=
 verse, learn the correct chanting and keep 
chanting it mentally."

As alw=
ays your messages make the synapses connect, come alive and 
start blinking=
....

My question is, how does one know what is the correct chanting? 
Some=
times, the person who initiates explains this. Whenever a mantra 
is recite=
d it is accompanied by a particular chanda. But then we 
hear mantras being=
 recited in different ways by different people? 
MAybe two gurus will use t=
wo different chandas to recite the same 
mantra. Are they both "correct"?

=
I am asking this because once somebody made a statement that in the 
ultima=
te mantra is nothing but a chanda.

Warm regards,

Vinita
