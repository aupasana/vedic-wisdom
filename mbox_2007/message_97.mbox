Namaste Mahahradanatha,

You do not sign at the end of your emails and hence I do not know who you 
are. I am guessing your name from the email ID. If I am addressing you 
incorrectly, I am sorry.

The Shakti that binds one also liberates one. She is the one who puts a veil 
and she is the one who removes it. Thus, the vedantic view is not "100% 
opposite", but it actually encompasses the view you mention and captures 
additional aspects of Shakti ignored in the view you mention.

Though She is referred to as "vidya avidya swarupini" (embodiment of all 
knowledge and ignorance), one may be comfortable worshipping certain aspects 
of Her and ignore others. Agamas are selective and offer a limited picture 
for practical utility, while vedanta is comprehensive and offers the big 
picture.

I maintain that what you referred to as "vedanta viewpoint", i.e. the 
teachings of maharshis, is actually the big picture that covers the essence 
of everything. Because it is very complex to understand and appreciate, some 
great teachers have taken limited aspects of the big picture and elaborated 
them so that more people can understand and appreciate it and make progress.

Thus, I suggest that seemingly different viewpoints of different religious 
traditions originated from the same teachings of maharshis.

Instead of approaching these view points with a "this OR that" attitude, I 
suggest approaching them with a "this AND that" attitude. The teachings of 
maharshis are the key in synthesizing everything.

If you are convinced that the teachings of vedanta and the teachings of 
aagamas are totally different and that there is no commonality, then we can 
respectfully agree to disagree.

Best regards,
Narasimha
