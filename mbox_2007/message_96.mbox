Dear members

Have the definition and characteristics of spirituality chang=
ed over 
time? Of course I do realise that it is not for people like me to =

judge whether a person is spiritually advanced, for one has oneself 
to be=
 at an advanced level to truly recognise another at a similar 
level. Yet, =
these days one comes across people who claim to 
be 'spiritually advanced',=
 to be able to go into 'samadhi' etc. The 
traditional picture, as I unders=
tand it, of an advanced soul is very 
different from what these people seem=
 to be. Traditionally, a 
spiritually advanced person is supposed to be dva=
ndvatita, non-
materialistic and so on. But then how does one recognise the=
se 
qualities with certainty? Are there any basic outer signs one looks 
fo=
r? Or is it that one just 'knows'?

A related question - is it true that pe=
ople who are born with 
physical and mental disorders are actually advanced=
 souls 
who 'choose' this difficult path? Is it possible to 'choose' your 
=
path? I always thought that good begat good, and bad bad, and that 
that wa=
s the only way one could 'choose' a path. 

Thank you

Rohini
