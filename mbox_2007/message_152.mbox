Namaste friends,
 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once said that even Vedas are co=
rrupted these days. It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.
 
=
It is my feeling that many people, including highly learned Vedic scholars,=
 pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantras) incorre=
ctly.
 
Of course, pronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the=
 spirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, pronunciation =
is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is very important in Ved=
a mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the most =
complete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who can=
 memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually "experienc=
e" a mantra.
 
Over the next few months, I will write my views on correct p=
ronunciation and point out some common errors. If you do not think that cor=
rect pronunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment of th=
e errors or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please ignore =
my writings on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to changing=
 your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views and adopt my s=
uggestions if you find them appropriate.
 
I shared a few observations on 2=
007 Nov 16. Some more observations will follow today.
 
*        *        *=

 
Take the "ai"/"ae" sound in the beejaakshara "aim"/"aem".
 
North Indian=
s pronounce this sound almost like the sound "a" in the English words "fan"=
, "man", "hat" etc. South Indians pronounce this sound almost like the soun=
d "uy" in the English words "buy" and "guy".
 
In general, south India was =
relatively shielded from the western invaders in the last couple of millenn=
ia, who entered India from the northwest. As a result, the corruption in th=
e tradition is less in south India. However, it is incorrect to say that so=
uth Indian pronunciation is always superior to north Indian pronunciation. =
The above is a case where I side with the north Indian pronunciation.
 
Let=
 us examine this logically. There are rules in Sanskrita grammar for combin=
ing different sounds ("sandhi" - joining sounds). The rules in Sanskrita gr=
ammar is logical and nor arbitrary. This is a big clue to deducing the corr=
ect pronunciation of certain sounds that are corrupted today.
 
Take the fo=
llowing two sounds:
 
(1) Take the sound "aa" (as in "mahaa", "tathaa" etc)=
. This is pronounced as "a" in the English words "car" and "far".
(2) Take =
the sound "e" (as in "etat", "evam" etc). This is pronounced as "a" in the =
English words "make" and "take".
 
If sound 1 is followed immediately by so=
und 2 without any break whatsoever, they combine and become one sound. That=
 combined sound is supposed to be the sound "ai"/"ae" in "aim"/"aem" beeja.=
 This is called "vriddhi sandhi" in Sanskrita grammar.
 
Now, try to pronou=
nce sound 1 and, without a break, immediately pronounce sound 2. That resul=
ts in the sound similar to "a" as in "fan", "man" and "hat" (you can verify=
 this for yourself). This suggests that the north Indian pronunciation is m=
ore accurate. I am convinced that the south Indian pronunciation of the "ai=
m"/"aem" beeja is incorrect and the north Indian pronunciation is correct.
=
 
This particular letter comes in many mantras - Vaidika, Taantrika and Pou=
raanika. My advice is to pronounce it as "ae" in all the mantras.
 
*      =
  *        *
 
There is one more issue related to beejaaksharas that a yaho=
ogroup member asked me to talk about. Some people pronounce "aem hreem klee=
m" as "aeng hreeng kleeng". In other words, the anunaasika (nasal sound) at=
 the end of each beejaakshara is pronounced as "ng" (the nasal in "ka varga=
") instead of "m" (the nasal in "pa varga").
 
Unfortunately, grammar rules=
 do not help here and I do not have a clear stand. My guess is that both ar=
e correct and give different results.
 
*        *        *
 
In Veda mantr=
as, there is one issue regarding the pronunciation of nasal sounds. The roo=
t of the above issue that I skirted may be related to it actually.
 
The "m=
" at the end of words sometimes changes into a different nasal sound when y=
ou join two words into one word (i.e. no break in between in pronunciation)=
. For example, take "gaNapatiM havaamahe". If you remove the break between =
the two words, the nasal at the end of the first word changes from "m" to a=
 different nasal sound. This is represented by a dot with a crescent Moon i=
n Devanagari texts and with a "g" and then a "m" symbol in texts transcribe=
d in south Indian languages. Unfortunately, most Vedic scholars trained in =
south Indian traditions pronounce this nasal as "gum" or "gam". They pronou=
nce "gaNapatiM havaamahe" as "gaNapatigum havaamahe" or "gaNapatigam havaam=
ahe".
 
This is definitely wrong, though it is an extremely extremely wide-=
spread convention.
 
A nasal (m) cannot change into a consonant (g), an vow=
el (u or a) and then another nasal (m). That is quite absurd. In fact, you =
are adding one extra akshara when you do it. The word "gaNapatiM" has 4 aks=
haras. But, if you pronounce it as "gaNapatigum" or "gaNapatigam", it ends =
up being 5 aksharas, with "gum"/"gam" being a separate akshara by itself. I=
f a consonant has an vowel after it, the vowel serves as the praana (life f=
orce) and it becomes an akshara. The sound "M" as the end of "gaNapatiM" is=
 not an akshara - it clings on to "ti" and becomes an extension of the prev=
ious akshara. On the other hand, "gum"/"gam" is a separate askahra due to t=
he praana in it (u or a).
 
Thus, people are adding one akshara to Veda man=
tras when pronouncing with "gum"/"gam". This changes the chhandas and also =
messes up the meaning.
 
A clue to the correct pronunciation of this exists=
 in another corrupt tradition in another part of India. The word "narasiMha=
" is pronounced as "narasingha" in some parts of India. In Veda mantras, it=
 is written as "narasi(gM)ha", where (gM) is the sound mentioned as "gum" o=
r "gam" above (e.g. "tanno naarasi(gM)haH prachodayaat" in Narasimga Gayatr=
i).
 
I suggest that the truth is in between these two corrupt traditions!
=
 
My view is that the anunaasika (nasal) in these cases (mostly, a nasal co=
ming just before "y", "r", "l", "v", "sh", shh", "s", "h" or just before vo=
wels) should be pronounced as the nasal in "ka varga". This is like the "n"=
 sound in the English words "monkey" or "king". When you say "narasi<nasal>=
ha", the <nasal> is neither n nor m. It is the nasal that comes just before=
 k or g. So, start pronouncing it as though you are going to pronounce "nar=
asing" and stop just before you say "g" and say "ha" instead. Then you get =
something very similar to "narasingha", but without "g" being explicit! The=
re should be an intention of "g" but no explicit "g". This can be represent=
ed as "narasin(g)ha". This same sound is probably represented in Vedic lite=
rature as "gM".
 
I am not 100% sure if what I suggest is correct, but I am=
 100% sure that the standard pronunciation as "gum"/"gam" is wrong. If one =
just pronounces it as "gaNapatiM havaamahe", for example, one will be bette=
r off. It is atleast meaningful and obey chhandas. What people normally say=
 has no meaning and breaks chhandas.
 
*        *        *
 
There are seve=
ral other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in the pronunc=
iation of Sanskrita mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the next=
 few days/weeks/months, whenever the Mother allows me to.
 
Please give me =
your consideration and take my input into consideration in altering your pr=
onunciation (if you are open to it). If you don't find any sense in what I =
am saying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I can understand tha=
t. I am not here to change everybody's pronunciation. But, because She insp=
ired me to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing that there are S=
OME who are destined to change their pronunciation based on my views. That =
is why I am writing these mails.
 
If you do not like this discussion, I am=
 sorry and just ignore this idiot!
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
