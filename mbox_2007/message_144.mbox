Continuing from the earlier message, i complete this topic by providing
so=
me more extracts, as under, from the same book.

--------------------------=
------------------------------------

I am what i AM, a confused, confounde=
d entity. At one moment i am sweet
little thing, at another, a terrible mon=
ster, because of variety of
gratifications of my physical demands of lusts,=
 mental demands for
emotional satisfactions and because of my perturbed int=
ellect, tossed by
its endless mischievous thoughts. somehow, I am aware of =
all this. Yet I
cannot get out of it. Why this helpless bondage? All this p=
ernicious
sorrows arise because I, the Atman, misunderstand myself to  be t=
he
not-Self (an-atman).

Suppose in a drunken mood you misunderstand yourse=
lf to be your own
shadow. Terrible suffering must then start for you. You f=
ind that you
are lying down on the road, and the traffic is incessantly pas=
sing over
you. Your head is sometimes in the filthy, way-side gutter.  You =
refuse
to move because you are being dargged. Thus, all the sufferings of t=
he
Shadow become your sufferings. A simple misunderstanding that you are
yo=
ur shadow becomes the source of a chain of terrible sufferings.

Similarly,=
 the misunderstanding, "I am the anatman", is the spring-board
for all bond=
ages and limitations that are suffered in voiceless agony by
our personalit=
y. To end this misunderstanding would be redeeming at once
our personality =
from the encrustations of matter and its tyranny. One
who is released from =
the tyrannies of matter is  a God-man on
earth--Perfect, free, liberated to=
tally from the weaknesses which
characterise a mortal.

GOD, apparently suf=
ering the sorrows of persecuting matter is man
(human)

     In the dream w=
hen i forget my real nature, I identify with the
things projected by me in =
the dream and suffer the consequences. The
sufferings of the dream last onl=
y till i wake up. The moment i wake up
and realise my real nature, all the =
sorrows of the dream end. When in a
drunken state i forget my real nature, =
i keepthe wrong relationship with
the world around me, and consequently, i =
come to suffer. A mad man,
because of some psycological changes in him, for=
gets himself, and start
behaving wrongly in the world around him. In the sa=
me manner I, who am
God, the Paramatman, the pure self, not understanding m=
yself, in the
Non-apprehension of my real nature, start creating misapprehe=
nsions.
Then, identifying myself with the not-self, which i am not, i come =
to
suffer the pains of existence created by myself for myself.

This identi=
fication with the not-Self in each one of us is the cause of
our life's suf=
ferings. In a cinema-hall, we identify ourselves with the
hero or the heroi=
ne on the screen. We feel happy at their happiness and
agony at their sorro=
ws.

Many Salutations ! to Jag=
adguru Adi-Shankaracharya and Swami
Chinmayananda.
