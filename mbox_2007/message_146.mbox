Here are the two very helpful verses from VC of Jagadguru
Shankaracharya. =
(As given in the book of Swami Chinmayanada).

GHATODAKE BIMBITAMARKBIMB-
M=
AALOKYA MUDHO RAVIMEV MANYATE !
TATHAA CHIDAABHAASMUPAADHISANSTHAM
BHRAANTY=
AHMITYEV JADOBHIMANYATE !! (218)

218 : The fool, on seeing the reflection =
of the sun in the water in a
jar, considers it to be the sun itself. so too=
, the fool through
delusion, identifies himself with the reflection of the =
Chit caught in
the Intellect and considers it to be the "I"---his own ident=
ity.

Anyone who cries out, "The sun has fallen into a bucket of water on t=
he
verandah", is indeed, a fool. Those who considers themselves fallen into=

the PFT (Perceiver, Feeler, Thinker) are equally foolish. In both cases
it=
 is only the reflection. The sun is reflected in the water, and
consciousne=
ss plays upon the thoughts in the mind.

This "reflections" of Reality upon=
 the thoughts is called Chitabhasa. It
is the consciousness playing upon th=
e thoughts, and dancing to the
rhythm, just as the reflected sun in the buc=
ket dances when the water
are disturbed. I say, "I am agitated", "I am bad"=
, "I am good". What is
this "I"? It is the Chitabhas , the  "reflected cons=
ciousness" ---this
is the PFT, the Consciousness functioning through my BMI=
 (Boay, Mind,
Intellect) equipments.

Once you understand that the sun is i=
n the heavens, then let the sun in
the bucket be broken in to a thousand pi=
eces, you are not worried about
the future existence of the sun. Only an in=
sentient fool, who considers
the reflected sun to be the real one, will wor=
ry about its safety when
he actually "sees" the sun in the bucket shattered=
 to a thousand pieces.

I was looking into a lake and admiring my charming =
form when suddenly my
reflection broke into pieces. Will i be foolish enoug=
h to weep and die,
saying, "I am broken"? I understand that it is my reflec=
tion only. If I
have not forgotten myself, I can watch the reflection and e=
njoy whenever
the waters are rippled by the breeze and my reflection conseq=
uently gets
corrugated. I shall laugh at the ugliness of my reflection and =
still
remain unaffected. But if a fool has forgotten himself, and has
ident=
ified himself with his own reflection, he will suffer when he
directly perc=
eives himself to be squeezed out of shape in the restless
waters by some cr=
uel breeze, created by an unmerciful and blind God.

GHATAM JALAM TADGATMAR=
KBIMBAM

VIHAAY SARVAM VINIRIKSHYATERKAH !

TATSTHA ETATTRITAYAAVABHASAKH

=
SWAYAMPRAKASHO VIDUSHAA YATHAA TATHAA !! (219)



219: The Intelligent man =
leaves aside the jar, the water and the
reflection of the sun in it and see=
s the self-luminous sun. So too, the
wise realize the self-luminous Reality=
 which illumines "these
three" and recognize It as independent of them all.=




             When we perceive the reflected sun in a jar of a water,
th=
ere are three things=97the Jar, the water in the jar and the
reflection of =
the sun in it. As long as our attention is on the
reflection, the real sun =
is not perceivable. In order to see the sun, we
will have to life our eyes =
high up from the jar, the water and the
reflection. In the sun there is no =
jar, no water and no reflection.
These three are symbolic examples to help =
us understand the play of the
self. This is called Tatastha-lakshana. You k=
now the sun to be without
the jar, the water and the reflection. If you are=
 told, "The house
on which the crow is sitting is Sri Gopal's residence", t=
hen
every time you pass by, you don't look for the crow, do you? Once
you k=
now the house, the crow becomes dispensable. In the case, the crow
is only =
a convenient, temporary, extraneous factor which helped in the
first instan=
ce to distinguish Gopal's house from the array of all
other houses. This me=
thod is called "Tatastha-lakshana"; the
crow is no part of the house, but i=
t helps us to distinguish a
particular house. The crow is tatastha.



Once=
 you know the sun, you will understand that it is the illuminator of
the ja=
r, the water and the reflection. Nobody need illumine the sun. it
is self-e=
ffulgent. It is its own light. In the light of the sun all
other things are=
 illumined.



Similarly, the wise man realizes the self. Apply the analogy=

subjectively to your own life and contemplate. Jar: the body, Water: the
t=
houghts, the reflected sun: the ego. The sun in the heavens: the
supreme Re=
ality which illumines all these.



Om Tat Sat
