Book Counters Academic Distortions of Hinduism in America

Americans have been engaged in Hindu-bashing for more tha=
n a hundred 
years. (I have dwelt on this aspect previously: 
http://www.mo=
delminority.com/article1017.html). And it's not just 
writers like Katherin=
e Mayo or films like `Indiana Jones and the 
Temple of Doom;' the web too h=
as a surfeit of anti-Hindu propaganda. 

In recent years Indian Americans h=
ave been concerned about the 
stereotypes about India and Hinduism that are=
 taught as fact in 
American classrooms. They know it will negatively impac=
t students of 
Indian or South Asian origin who are struggling to work out =
their 
identity in a multicultural, predominately Anglo-Christian 
environm=
ent. 

Moreover, some academicians too are engaged in Hindu-bashing. For 
i=
nstance, scholars have disparaged the Bhagavad Gita as "a dishonest 
book";=
 declared Ganesha's trunk a "limp phallus"; classified Devi as 
the "mother=
 with a penis" and Shiva as "a notorious womanizer" who 
incites violence i=
n India; pronounced Sri Ramakrishna a pedophile who 
sexually molested the =
young Swami Vivekananda; condemned Indian 
mothers as being less loving of =
their children than white women; and 
interpreted the bindi as a drop of me=
nstrual fluid and the "ha" in 
sacred mantras as a woman's sound during org=
asm. 

This depiction of Hinduism in a manner perceived as provocatively 
d=
emeaning by the Hindus themselves is the subject of a recent 
book: `Invadi=
ng the Sacred- An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in 
America.' It is a seriou=
s and significant response to the challenge 
posed by Hinduphobia in Americ=
a. And it now calls upon all fair 
minded Americans and Hindus to read the =
book, and take steps to bring 
the vilification of India and of Hinduism to=
 an end. 

The first person within the Indian-American community to bring 
=
Hinduphobia, or distortions and negative portrayals of the Hindu 
religion =
out into the open was Rajiv Malhotra. Since at least 2002, 
his single mind=
ed campaigning, his scholarly criticisms, and his 
courageous stance has br=
ought the issue into focus =96 thanks to the 
world-wide-web. In many of th=
ese articles, Malhotra argues that 
misinterpretations of Indian culture, e=
specially philosophy and 
religion have created a Hinduism for American soc=
iety that is very 
different from the religious philosophy as practiced by =
its 
followers. 

The core complaint that Malhotra asserts is that the curr=
ent 
education system and media in the USA and India are deeply and 
uncons=
ciously Eurocentric =96 a system that is breeding the next 
generation of E=
urocentric Americans, and that many Indians have 
adopted this Eurocentric =
trend also. Malhotra, who studied physics at 
India's St. Stephens College =
and computer science at Syracuse 
University, now works full time at the In=
finity Foundation, a 
nonprofit he founded in 1995 to "upgrade the quality =
of understanding 
of Indian civilization in the American media and educatio=
nal system, 
as well as among the English language educated Indian elite." =


In September 2002, Malhotra wrote an article criticizing the 
representat=
ion of Hindu religion in the North American discipline of 
Religious Studie=
s on Sulekha.com, a web portal popular among the 
Indian diaspora. The arti=
cle, named "Wendy's Child Syndrome," 
identified a number of American schol=
ars in Religious Studies working 
on Hinduism, arguing against their suitab=
ility to write or teach 
about Hindu religion, instigating debate within th=
e academe. 
Malhotra's summaries of the concerned writings and his evaluati=
ons of 
the scholars involved, caused an indignant uproar on the Internet 
=
amongst Hindus, primarily Indian Hindus, all over the world and 
particular=
ly in North America. In follow-up columns, Malhotra 
continued with his arg=
ument about the necessity of the Indian 
diaspora to wake up to such misrep=
resentations. These portrayals, he 
asserts, are responsible for the negati=
ve image of Indians and 
Hindus, leading to their racist treatment in Ameri=
can society. His 
articles garnered some of the highest number of readers a=
nd drew the 
largest number of comments. 

Malhotra condemned "the eroticis=
ation of Hinduism by Wendy Doniger, 
who is undoubtedly the most powerful p=
erson in academic Hinduism 
Studies today," and "her large cult of students=
, who glorify her in 
exchange for her mentorship." He noted that religious=
 studies=97a field 
that teaches about a religion without preaching its bel=
iefs=97is rare 
in India, making academic discussions of Hinduism a mostly =
Western 
conversation. "Under Western control," he argued, "Hinduism studie=
s 
has produced ridiculous caricatures that could easily be turned into 
a =
Bollywood movie or a TV serial." 

Indeed, Malhotra was the first to voice =
his concerns regarding the 
misrepresentation of Hinduism in America, when =
he noted: 

=95 Hindu kids and even adults in America are apologetic about =
their 
religion, generally preferring to distance themselves from it and 
k=
eep quiet about it. =95 Educational material used to teach about 
Hinduism =
focuses on caste, idol worship, lack of social values among 
Hindus, and ot=
her negative portrayals. =95 A major academic web site 
examines the Bhagav=
ad Gita in negative terms of Arjuna killing his 
relatives because of his H=
indu outlook. =95 Teaching grants to train 
secondary school teachers on re=
ligious pluralism have been used to 
develop material that portrays Rama as=
 'oppressing' women and lower 
castes. =95 There is minimal coverage given =
to the positive 
contributions by India's civilization to mathematics, scie=
nce, 
medicine, metallurgy, linguistics, logic, and other 'rational' areas;=
 
and when pointed out, such avoidance is sometimes defended. =95 Most of 
=
the educational material on Indic religions is written very 
authoritativel=
y by Americans who have advanced degrees in Sanskrit 
and/or Religious Stud=
ies, who have spent years researching in India, 
and would easily impress a=
nyone with their scriptural knowledge about 
India. =95 Very few Indians ha=
ve gone for academic careers in Religion 
or Philosophy, and those in such =
careers must be very cautious not to 
step out of line in complaining about=
 the above matters. 

V. V. Raman, Emeritus Professor Rochester Institute o=
f Technology 
says: "Mr. Malhotra is a serious and well-grounded scholar. H=
e did 
not come to this field via the standard academic route, but his 
wri=
tings reflect more erudition and a greater grasp of important 
issues than =
many Ph.D.'s I know. =85Because of his firm stand and 
sometimes angry styl=
e, he has angered the Western academic 
establishment on Indology, and alie=
nated a great many, including some 
Hindu scholars=85But he has also shaken=
 many to look deeper into the 
assumptions and unrecognized prejudices whic=
h shape their 
interpretations. And he has served as a bold and well-inform=
ed voice 
for many Hindus in the West as well as in India who have often fe=
lt 
hurt and insulted by some of the psychoanalytic interpretations of 
the=
ir culture and divinities. Personally, I don't agree with Mr. 
Malhotra's s=
tyle and mode, and I don't always resonate with his 
demarcation lines betw=
een the East and the West, but I have great 
respect for his scholarship, m=
uch sympathy for the core of his 
theses, and I applaud his long-range goal=
. One more thing: To my 
knowledge, he is not affiliated with any Hindu `fu=
ndamentalist' 
group. 

Anant Rambachan, Professor of Religion, Saint Olaf =
College in 
Minnesota writes: "Rajiv Malhotra is a prominent and insistent =
voice 
questioning and inviting dialogue with the scholarly community, on 
=
the content and methodology of studying and teaching Hinduism at 
instituti=
ons of higher education in North America. This initial 
collection offers a=
 salient summary of his critique and concerns, and 
is a valuable historica=
l resource for those who want to understand 
better this debate, and those =
who wish to become participants in the 
conversation that he has passionate=
ly initiated and sustained. 
Scholars should welcome a critical voice from =
the community that is 
the focus of their study, for a mutually enriching d=
ialogue." 

In his preface to the book, Arvind Sharma, Professor of Religio=
n at 
McGill University, writes: `The book singes with the sparks that flew=
 
as the psychoanalytic approach to the study of religion became the 
light=
ning rod of the grievances of the Hindu Americans against a 
cross-section =
of the academic community in North America devoted to 
the study of Hinduis=
m. It goes on to document the way these 
grievances were articulated and ve=
ntilated, as well as the response 
from the world of the Western academia a=
nd, to a certain extent, from 
the media, as the issue came to a head. Most=
 importantly, the book is 
a pointer to the fact that the Hindu community i=
n North America has 
now reached the demographic critical mass, when its re=
actions can no 
longer be disregarded.' 
The book, edited by Krishnan Ramas=
wamy, Aditi Banerjee, and Antonio 
T. de Nicolas, probes the invisible netw=
orks behind biased approaches 
to Hinduism and the questionable scholarship=
 of the American experts 
on Hinduism. Furthermore it goes on to narrate th=
e Indian Diaspora's 
recent challenges to such scholarship, and documents h=
ow those who 
dared to speak up - including academic scholars critical of s=
uch 
scholarship - have been branded as "dangerous". 

The authors of this =
study say that today Hinduism is under siege by 
forces who have found thei=
r playing fields in a section of the 
American Academy of Religion and the =
Departments of South Asia 
Studies. Their game plan is to denigrate Hinduis=
m by focusing 
narrowly on its social ills, misinterpreting its texts and i=
n the 
process overlooking the substantial content of Hinduism, its 
unequa=
lled intellectual wealth, the fact that India has, by virtue of 
Hinduism a=
nd Sanskrit, `a place in the history of the human mind' as 
Max Mueller onc=
e noted. 

Kapil Kapur, Former Chair of Department of English, Jawaharlal N=
ehru 
University, opines: "The intellectuals featured in this book, with 
t=
heir bold decision to take on this scholarship, have entered into a 
seriou=
s dialogue about motives, methodology and substance and, using 
their own t=
ools, have reversed the gaze back on to the scholarly 
establishment to the=
ir understandable discomfort. This book is 
important because it records th=
e background, the issues and the 
arguments in this debate, and the debate =
is not over. This has been a 
historic intervention. The record of this ent=
erprise is a lesson for 
a large number of young Hindus who must learn to c=
ombat adverse 
western scholarship by using the weapons of the enemy." 

Ba=
l Ram Singh, Director, Center for Indic Studies, University of 
Massachuset=
ts, Dartmouth, points out: "The Indian diaspora of over 20 
million around =
the world faces the acute problem that much of its 
civilizational portraya=
l has been controlled by outsiders for many 
centuries. However, a sharp in=
crease in the prominence of Indians in 
the global scene has forced a showd=
own between the old guard's 
established ideas and the young, vibrant commu=
nity. "Invading the 
Sacred" is a first serious, albeit provocative, effort=
 to challenge 
the parochial characterization of Hindus by western and/or 
=
westernized scholars. The book is path-breaking and takes to task 
those sc=
holars who have been falsely stereotyping Indian culture, and 
shows the im=
portance of challenging such biases. It will hopefully 
lead to more balanc=
ed and respectful discourse, debate, and 
discussion on many issues facing =
humanity as a whole, for which Indic 
civilization is an important resource=
." 

To the question as to why Indian scholars acquiesce to and even 
imita=
te mistakes committed by Euro-American Indologists, in spite of 
the fact t=
hat they could and should know better, one academic says it 
is partly due =
to India's colonization and a widespread overestimation 
of western culture=
 and the blind belief that anything of western or 
European origin cannot b=
ut be superior to the corresponding element 
of Indic culture. The resultin=
g "inferiority complex" has had a 
shattering and traumatic effect upon Ind=
ic scholarship and academic 
output. Unfortunately, this trend continues ev=
en in post-independent 
India and among Indians living in the diaspora toda=
y, the authors of 
Invading the Sacred point out. 

The irony is that this =
denigration of Hinduism is happening at a time 
when the widespread accepta=
nce of many elements of Sanatana Dharma 
seems to point to a "Hinduization"=
 of the American cultural milieu. 

Just consider this. In 2005, roughly 18=
 million Americans are 
practicing Yoga. In multiple polls of American reli=
gious beliefs and 
attitudes, up to 25% of Americans believe in reincarnati=
on. Tens of 
millions of Americans meditate. Over 20 million are vegetarian=
. 
Almost half the population has turned to alternative health systems, 
su=
ch as Ayurveda, herbal medicine and massage. 

What may be happening, at le=
ast according to one American Hindu Frank 
Morales, is that Americans are i=
nterested in Yoga asanas, but are not 
as interested in become self-realize=
d Yogis. They are interested in 
meditation for its calming effects, but no=
t necessarily as a means to 
achieve samadhi. Americans are keen to incorpo=
rate Ayurvedic 
medicine - but only as a complementary or alternative syste=
m - mostly 
for controlling obesity or for the rejuvenative aspect of 
Panc=
hakarma. They are primarily interested in the many goodies that 
Hinduism h=
as to offer, but without taking the next logical step of 
becoming Hindus, =
or in many cases without even acknowledging the 
purely Hindu origins of th=
e many practices that they have derived so 
much benefit from. 

Morales sa=
ys that while elements of Hinduism such as Yoga, ayurveda 
and meditation b=
ecome more popular in America, Hinduism itself is in 
danger of being assim=
ilated into the greater cultural milieu, just 
another ingredient =96 albei=
t a nicely spicy one =96 of the great 
American melting-pot. "We face the v=
ery real possibility of authentic 
Sanatana Dharma becoming co-opted into t=
he greater American cultural 
matrix as nothing more than a menagerie of di=
sparate elements used to 
market New Age spirituality" writes Morales in an=
 essay 
entitled `Does Hinduism Have a Future in America?' 

As a practicin=
g Hindu, Morales is concerned about the 
academic/media/education/governmen=
t matrix in America that fosters 
anti-Hindu stereotypes. "Rather than stan=
ding up and fighting against 
such anti-Hindu portrayals, the Hindu communi=
ty has been so slow to 
respond to these attacks in the past that many of t=
he anti-Hindu 
bigots in academia feel they have a free reign to propagate =
any lies 
about Sanatana Dharma they wish. They also know that if the Hindu=
 
community ever even responds at all, it is usually too little, too 
late,=
 and in a purely reactionary manner. We need to counter any and 
all attack=
s against Sanatana Dharma immediately, forcefully and 
professionally." 

T=
his book is the first attempt at talking back to the academicians 
and is a=
 must read for all people of Indian origin, especially Hindu 
Americans. As=
 one perceptive observer noted: "in these jehadi times, 
when Islamists run=
 around the globe killing innocent people to prove 
that their Prophet and =
their book are the best, now and forever, the 
Hindu idea becomes even more=
 relevant - What grander idea of faith 
can there be than that everyone is =
entitled to their own truth?" 

The contributors to the book, which is publ=
ished by Rupa, are Aditi 
Banerjee, Antonio T. de Nicolas, Alan Roland, Arv=
