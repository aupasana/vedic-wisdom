Dear Sri Narsimha ji,

I follow your teachings and lesso=
ns very closely and have been 
reflecting on beginning the Ganapati havan a=
s per your teching and 
illustrations.
However I live in a modern apartment=
 in UK,with fire/smoke alrams; 
have no personal open ground or balcony. Is=
 there an option I can 
explore with candle or small lamp and following you=
r homam procedure.

I will appreciate your views, please do forgive me if t=
his is not an 
appropriate forum for this query and do ignore.

Thanks and =
best wishes,

Sharat
