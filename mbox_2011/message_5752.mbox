How has all the knowledge in the world been gained but by the concentration=
 of the powers of the mind? The world is ready to give up its secrets if we=
 only know how to knock, how to give it the necessary blow. The strength an=
d force of the blow come through concentration. There is no limit to the po=
wer of the human mind. The more concentrated it is, the more power is broug=
ht to bear on one point; that is the secret.
