Sai left earth at 0740 AM, Sunday, Uthrashada, Sapthami Thidhi. At that time Taurus was rising, Taurus was his Eighth House, He being born in Libra. 

May His soul rest in peace. 

Patham Udayam or the 10th Rising of the Sun is very auspicious, as the Sun is in deep exaltation ! He was indeed a Maha Purusha !

He was born with Libra rising, like Bhagavan Ramana Maharishi, with Mars in Aries, forming Rucha Maha Yoga. Jupiter is debilitated in Capricorn, but Retrograde, equalling exaltation. He was an embodiment of Love, Compassion and Service.

The Roman Calender used the solar years of 365.25 days. In the Indian Calender, many years exist. We have the 

Solar Year - of 365.25 days ( Sam Vatsaram ) 
Lunar Year - 29*12 days ( Indha Vatsaram ) 
Stellar Year - 27*12 days ( Nakshatra Vatsaram )  

Anu vatsaram pari vatsaram indha vatsaram eva cha
Samvatsarm vatsarascha vaidhooryeva prabhashathe 

Since the Ecliptic or the Zodiac is tenanted by 12 Signs of 30 degrees and 27 constellations or Nakshatras, one stellar or sidereal ( " pertaining to the stars ") month is 27 days and one Stellar Year is 12*27 = 324 days.This stellar month stem from Beta Arieties ( Aswinit ) to Zeta Piscium ( Revathi ) and is of 27 days. 

Hence if we calculate Sai's age, he was 96 when he left his body. He had lived 30, 834 days, from his birthdate from 23 Nov 1926 to 24042011. We get 95 years and 54 days and Sai was in his 96th year.

The Western Tropical Calender is not exact and the Gregorian Calender came into being as a modification of the Julian Calender. Gregory decreed on Oct 4 th that the next days is Oct 14th. So the Western Tropical Calender needs modifications from time to time, as the Tropical Zodiac is ever moving, in contrast to the Indian Sidereal Zodiac, which is static.

  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] How to Recognize an Authentic Guru - New Video


    
  The question of what constitutes a real and authentic guru is crucial for all sincere spiritual seekers. In this very direct, authoritative and no nonsense talk, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.) provides the conclusive criteria necessary to recognize who is - and is not! - an authentic and legitimate guru. Even if you have been on the path of Sanatana Dharma for decades and feel that you already know what a real guru is, prepare to have your understanding radically expanded!
