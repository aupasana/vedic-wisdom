Namaste Nagraj Ji 

Vimalananda mentions this at many places in the three b=
ooks and also Tantra agamas mention this fact very prominently. The human b=
ody is the best Yantra one could hope for .External Yantras no doubt might =
be powerful but somebody equally powerful has to consecrate them beforehand=
 and it will revert most people to square one. 

Narasimha ji answered the =
earlier question that was raised about placing beeja akshara's at various p=
laces in one's body. One would have to visualize the subtle body and then k=
now the procedure of placing the aksharas in whatever form there.

Again mo=
st yantras sold nowadays are just Placebo's marketed cleverly.The power of =
an yantra lies both in the geometry and the consecration process, any imper=
fections in the shapes and material will render it useless and in some marg=
inal cases will cause it to invite non benefic energies.

One can definetly=
 learn to draw the Sri Chakra.Sri Amritananda Natha ( Seer behind the Roche=
ster devi temple and head of Devipuram centre ) has put together a beautifu=
l ppt on how to do it using a simple compass and ruler. The process of draw=
ing the Sri chakra itself is supposed to work like a chisel on one's consci=
ousness and cause eventual purification.

http://devipuram.com/downloads/ca=
talog1.html

Please see the link "how to draw sri chakra ".

That drawing c=
an serve as one's 2D personal yantra. Sri Meru would be the 3D representati=
on. The intersections of the triangles are mapped in theory to crucial 64 n=
adi junctions in the human body with the energies being the ruling deities =
of the body and cosmos.


Mantra ,Yantra,Homa ,Vigraha Pratishta all of the=
m are made alive only by emotion and the earnestness with which the sadhaka=
 calls the diety.

Narasimha ji is right when he says all that matters is j=
ust doing what one knows and submitting like a child to the mother and not =
worry about specific sadhanas.

Vemparla Ram Kishore
