Translation-The Fathers who sit on sacred grass,=
 come here with aid;
these offerings have we made for you, accept them.So c=
ome to us with
most auspicious favour, and give us health and blessing free=
 from hurt
Interpretation - We invoke the offerings(havyaa) made for you (t=
he pitru
devataas), pitru devataas who sit on the layer of sacred grass
(ba=
rhiShad) come here with kindness (uuti/uutii) and accept the
offerings and =
favour us by coming here in most auspicious form,
thereafter grant us the b=
lessings that are free from sin.
  the invocation is being made to pitru de=
vataas to come and accept the
offerings prepared by us and then favour us b=
y providing health and
blessings free from sin - seems to be a bribe being =
made to pitru
devataas, certainly not. the request is to bestow sinless pea=
ce and
tranquility upon us, the word rapaH is a synonymn for sin and arapaH=
 is
opposite of that i.e. sinless. the request is to grant peace and
tranqu=
ility that is sinless upon us (naH shaM yoH arapaH dadhaata). One
will atta=
in sinless peace when there is "in-action in action" and that
is sacrifice/=
yaGYa/pitru kaarya, one can attain peace (temporary) by
"no-action" but tha=
t is sinful, and sacrifices such as yaGYa/pitru
kaarya are ones dharma (act=
ually a RRiNa), hence the requisition is for
a dharmic cause - to help us (=
uuti) by providing sinless peace (arapaH -
shaM), arapaH also means free fr=
om disease (i.e health) so the
requisition can also be translated as - to h=
elp us by providing
auspicious blessing and health (connected to earlier ri=
k RV10.015.03 -
where the invokation was for progeny  - napaataM  to contin=
ue with yaGYa
- viShNoH)
