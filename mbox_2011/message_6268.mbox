Dear Rama, 

Very nicely put. 

I agree that every event (in itself good or=
 bad) can be further interpreted in good and bad way. It is human nature to=
 seek the rationality/reason/formula. somewhere we seek courage, confidence=
, in this rationality. One has to transcend these rationality and stand fir=
m in Sincere Devotion.

I appreciate the line "do homams for the love of ho=
mams" but while doing homam i could sense that it is a very powerful act/th=
ing/tool. 

strotra, mantra, homam are spiritual tools and i can tell for s=
ure that these tools themselves have varying degree of power. The common an=
d most important underlying thing being Sincere Devotion and identifying wi=
th the all pervading atman.


You summed very nicely
"Summing it up, I comp=
lain to Lordships if things donot go well, still I chant everyday as I love=
 them. Exalted devotees of Iskcon will not do it that way and may not crib =
like me, but the point is they are the Lords."

A sincere spiritual devotio=
nal attitude is i think must for any beginner. A personal relationship need=
s to be cultivated. thanks for reminding me this.

I am highly shaken and u=
ncertain in life right now, so i really appreciate all the wonderful points=
 you have shared.

love and regards
Priyank

 Srila Prabhupada once told Harikesa maharaj "Go to Russia and start preach=
