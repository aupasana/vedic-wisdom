Aye, if there is anything in the Gita that I like, it is the two verses, co=
ming out strong as the very gist, the very essence, of Krishna's teaching: =
'He who sees the Supreme Lord dwelling alike in all beings, the Imperishabl=
e in things that perish, he sees indeed. For seeing the Lord as the same, e=
verywhere present, he does not destroy the Self by the self, and thus he go=
es to the highest goal.'
