      <p>Namaste friends,<br>
<br>
Regularity and uniformity are the=
 keys to success.<br>
<br>
People of Kali yuga do not want to love their mo=
ther (or father) <br>
everyday, but want to dedicate one day every year for=
 that. They do not <br>
want to ensure that their breathing is uniform, reg=
ular and relaxed all <br>
the time, but they want to do a breathing exercis=
e for 10 minutes <br>
everyday and ensure uniform, regular and relaxed brea=
thing during that <br>
time. People do not want to eat healthy food in mode=
ration always, but <br>
want to overeat junk at most times and fast now and=
 then to compensate <br>
for it. They do not want to pray to god regularly,=
 but want to make it <br>
up one day every week or month or year by going t=
o a temple/church or <br>
doing a ritual.<br>
<br>
Friends, this approach i=
sn't useful. Maintaining regularity and <br>
uniformity can work wonder=
s.<br>
<br>
Breath calmly and regularly at all times and not just during pr=
anayama. <br>
Eat a balanced good moderately, just to sustain the physical =
body, and <br>
stop eating emotionally because something looks nice or smel=
ls nice and <br>
fasting now and then. Pray to god more regularly and, in f=
act, keep god <br>
in your mind at all times. Carry love and caring attitud=
e for people <br>
around you, like parents, siblings, spouse, children, fri=
ends and <br>
relatives, at all times and not just on special days.<br>
