I was doing my japa without anga nyasa
One day i got a intution to do anga =
nyasa
so iam doing it anyway
i have to read the sentence from the computer =
to do it but i still do not know 
where to place the mantra and with what i=
ntention
so I thought some higher elevated person will be in the group who =
can describe 
it scientifically
I hope one day I will get the answer
if I g=
et the answer i will do it in my native language tamil using my mind power =

instead of in sanskrit

Namaste,

I never said our ancestors did anything=
 "foolishly". I was only saying 
that most people today cannot replicate wh=
at the ancestors did/meant and 
hence I suggest not wasting time. Let me cl=
arify using an analogy.

Suppose someone eats a raw gooseberry every mornin=
g for health benefits. 
Suppose a copycat having no gooseberries eats a can=
dy gooseberry made of 
sugar syrup and green color. The copycat is obviousl=
y not going to get 
any health benefit from that candy gooseberry. If that =
person gets too 
technical and asks about how much the gooseberry should we=
igh, what 
should be the radius, how exactly it should be eaten etc, I may =
say that 
it does not matter and just eat it however you want and wait for =
the day 
you get access to a real raw gooseberry. That does not amount to c=
alling 
the original gooseberry eater foolish!

"Scientific" is a word that=
 is understood in a very narrow sense today. 
Science as we understand now-=
a-days is limited to the material world and 
objects in it. But, spiritual =
sadhana, on the other hand, is not limited 
to the material world. So the s=
cience that governs spiritual sadhana is 
not limited to the material world=
.

Just as one not having access to a telescope cannot do visual 
experimen=
ts related to observing and measuring planets and stars, 
similarly one una=
ble to perceive one's own subtle body cannot do real 
anganyas (i.e. place =
syllables in various places in it). Of course, just 
to get practice or jus=
t for fun, one can pretend to look through a toy 
telescope and pretend tha=
t one is seeing so and so star or planet. 
Similarly, one can touch the tip=
s of the corresponding fingers and say 
the syllable and pretend that the s=
yllable has been placed there.

If one follows yama and niyama, if one remo=
ves all conditioning using 
whatever sadhana one follows, if one achieves a=
n equanimous mind that is 
established in Truth, then one's mind itself is =
a powerful instrument 
that can helps one master spiritual science. On the =
other hand, if one's 
mind is colored by dense conditioning and is vibratin=
g to the tune of 
apparent material reality, then one is lacking the scient=
ific instrument 
for making accurate observations and measurements in the s=
piritual 
realm.

Narasimha

Namaste,

As I sai=
d before, the nyaasa people do today is merely a formality. 
Nyasa literall=
y means placement. You *place* certain sound combinations 
in certain chakr=
as (energy centers) in various body parts (e.g. tips of 
ring fingers, tips=
 of little fingers, heart, top of head, between eyes 
etc).

If you touch a=
 body part in a particular way and say the sound, will 
that really *place*=
 that sound in that chakra? Will that chakra vibrate 
with that sound then?=
 Of course, not.

Those who have been taught a procedure by somebody can fo=
llow what they 
are taught. Those who do not know need not worry.

Just as =
the streets and surroundings of your house may automatically be 
repaired i=
f the Prime Minister of India decides to visit your house, 
various chakras=
 in your subtle body will automatically vibrate with the 
correct sounds if=
 the deity decides to express to you in some form or 
the other.

Building =
devotion and surrender is far more important and useful than to 
focus on t=
echnicalities and try to master them.

Narasimha

Namaste,<br>
<br>
As I said =
before, the nyaasa people do today is merely a formality. <br>
Nyasa litera=
lly means placement. You *place* certain sound combinations <br>
in certain=
 chakras (energy centers) in various body parts (e.g. tips of <br>
ring fin=
gers, tips of little fingers, heart, top of head, between eyes <br>
etc).<b=
r>
<br>
If you touch a body part in a particular way and say the sound, wil=
l <br>
that really *place* that sound in that chakra? Will that chakra vibr=
ate <br>
with that sound then? Of course, not.<br>
<br>
Those who have been=
 taught a procedure by somebody can follow what they <br>
are taught. Those=
 who do not know need not worry.<br>
<br>
Just as the streets and surroundi=
ngs of your house may automatically be <br>
repaired if the Prime Minister =
of India decides to visit your house, <br>
various chakras in your subtle b=
ody will automatically vibrate with the <br>
correct sounds if the deity de=
cides to express to you in some form or <br>
the other.<br>
<br>
Building d=
evotion and surrender is far more important and useful than to <br>
focus o=
n technicalities and try to master them.<br>
<br>
