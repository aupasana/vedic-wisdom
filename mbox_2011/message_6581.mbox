You have been  only hearing  of all these spiritual things. Now realise
the=
m. You have done enough study and reasoning. Now do some
spiritual practice=
. First  take up that aspect of  God  which appeals to
you most. Follow you=
r own path of  Sadhana. When you realise  God
through it, you will  feel th=
e  joy of  realising Him also  in  other 
aspects and through other paths.
=
One should meditate on the form of the Ishtam  along with  Japam. 
Otherwis=
e  Japam  does  not become effective. If  you cannot think of
the whole  fo=
rm, think only of a part. Begin your meditation on the
"lotus feet" of the =
 Deity.Continue to do it  even if you fail  in the
beginning. Why should yo=
u stop until you succeed? Succeed you must.
Practice will make everything e=
asy.
Is  meditation  an easy  affair?  Remember, it  is  next only to
Samad=
hi. Try to leave everything to the Lord, Resign yourself wholly
unto Him. T=
hen, through  your  Sadhana, self-surrender  and  everything 
will come fro=
m within.
