 Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, industrialists and
scien=
tists have fantasized about a symbiotic factory setup. Consider two
hypothe=
tical factories A & B. Suppose the two factories could be arranged
such tha=
t the waste product of factory A would serve as a raw material for
factory =
B and the waste product of factory B would serve as a raw material
for fact=
ory A. Then the factory setup would able to run perpetually with
zero expen=
diture and unlimited profit! However this has always been nothing
more than=
 a fantasy. The raw materials in every factory are quite expensive
to obtai=
n and the waste products are quite useless and expensive to even
dispose of=
f.

Amazingly enough, such a symbiotic factory setup already exists in natu=
re:
human respiration & plant photosynthesis. At every moment we human bein=
gs
breathe in O2 & give out CO2.

O2 is life-sustaining & CO2 is life-destr=
oying, if present in excessive
quantity. Therefore the human respiration by=
 itself would diminish the
supply of O2 & increase CO2 in the atmosphere so=
on making the atmosphere &
the planet inhabitable for human beings and inde=
ed all O2-breathing
creatures.

But there is a magnificent balance system i=
n nature which exactly takes in
the waste product of the human respiration =
CO2 & gives out the raw material
for respiration O2 - plant photosynthesis.=


Isn=E2=80=99t it remarkable that what the best scientists on the planet c=
ould
nothing more dream about has already realized by nature? Albert Einste=
in has
remarked, "There are two ways to live life. One is to see nothing as=
 a
miracle & other is to see everything as a miracle."

Some people say tha=
t nature certainly works remarkably, but its working is
automatic & more or=
 less governed by chance. They argue that seeing any
divinity or God contro=
lling nature is just a sentimental longing coming from
an unscientific ment=
ality.

However the word =E2=80=98automatically=E2=80=99 used in this conte=
xt is somewhat misleading
because it doesn=E2=80=99t indicate the absence o=
f a controller, but rather the
absence of the knowledge of the controller.
=

When we say that a machine works automatically, what it means is that the
=
machine doesn=E2=80=99t require continuous interaction with the operator. B=
ut still
there is an operator who activates the machine and monitors its wo=
rking. Is
that the case with nature?

E.g. If you want to have fun with a c=
hild, then you might get an automatic
toy i.e. either a mechanically or in =
some other way programmed toy. By
staying out of view of the child, you rel=
ease the toy & it comes moving into
the view of the child.

Seeing the toy =
moving automatically, the child becomes astounded and thinks
that the toy i=
s working by itself. But you a wise person will never be
misled into the co=
nclusion of an inexperienced child. You know that even if
the toy is moving=
 automatically, it is programmed by you.

Similarly the magnificent phenome=
na in nature are not just occurring
automatically; they are working under t=
he expert but remote and therefore
invisible programming of God.

Uninforme=
d people, like the naive child, may think that nature is working
automatica=
lly, but wise people throughout history =E2=80=93 religious and scientific
=
=E2=80=93 have always understood that there is a super-intelligent designer=
 behind
nature. Thus it is that the famous physicist Lord Kelvin has remark=
ed, "If
you think deeply enough you will be forced by science to believe in=
 God."
