 relations with Asuras and Why he did not attack ayodhya previously or any =
other countries? =A0=A0

People say there are 3 crores of devathas. Is it j=
ust a figure of speech or is there any way I could find the details of thos=
e devathas. Actually I need details of all the Devethas who are believed to=
 be existing in the Epics.=A0
