Namaste Nagraj ji,

I would like to write about couple of points you asked.=


1. My practical suggetions out of my own practise is like this:

After In=
vocation of Chandi & Panchopchar Pujan, just give Aahuti of Navaarna Mantra=
 18 times, then directly 13 chapters (you may also skip Dhyaan Mantra of al=
l chapter except 1,2 &5th chapters), after that Again 18 times Navaarna Man=
tra Ahuti and directly Uttaraangam.

In above suggetion, you can also skip =
Navaarna Mantra altogether.
Try this out and see how long it takes. 

2. Ye=
s, Mumbai trains journey is a manufacturing plant of robust people. I have =
enjoyed that Journey (Virar train especially) since i was in 8th standard t=
ill i was 29 years old. it requires Immense interest to do sadhana after on=
e has come back home travelling through Mumbai train.

4. Spousal support f=
or me is not bad though. initial there were lot of Kach-kach...chik-chik bu=
t now its all settled. She her self does lot of things now. It would be wis=
e to pray for the support of Spouse to Mother and keep doing steadfastly ag=
ainst all odds whatever you can manage. 

Best Regards
