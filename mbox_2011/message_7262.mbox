Dear Narasimha,

Our family sastrigal is from Chennai. He taught me perform=
ing amavasai tarpanam. His instructions are exactly the same as mentioned b=
y Hiramalini S. He advised that THE SESAME SEEDS SHOULD NOT GERMINATE AND H=
ENCE THROW THEM AWAY IN KITCHEN SINK WHICH WILL END UP ULTIMATELY INTO FLOW=
ING WATER. He advised throwing Pavitra and Tarbha into Trash so that no one=
 incidentally does not walk on them.

I also remember that Seasome seeds wa=
ter was thrown in the first 15 days and they germinated. He took those germ=
inated leaves and offered them in the homam. 

I look forward for your advi=
ce.

Thanks,
Shankar
