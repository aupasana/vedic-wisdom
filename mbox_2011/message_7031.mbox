Narasimha Ji and Rajarshi Ji

It is interesting to see the following exchan=
ge and definetly it has elevated Ramakrishna's status atleast in my viewpoi=
nt.

I do have an question which is sort of related to the thread.I hope ei=
ther of you would be able to throw some light on this subject.

1.Are the  =
Siddhas and Naths one and the same. 
Matsyendranath is called MatsyaMuni in=
 the south.
Gorakshanath is known as Gorakkar in the south.

Also the south=
ern tradition includes the Sapta Rishis as Siddhars and takes the figure to=
 be eighteen.

Sri Pathanjali Siddhar- Patanjali Maharishi
Sri Agasthiar Si=
ddhar---- The great sage Agasthya
Sri Kamalamuni Siddhar
Sri Thirumoolar Si=
ddhar
Sri Kuthambai Siddhar
Sri Korakkar Siddhar----- Gorakkar or Gorakshan=
ath/Gorakhnath
Sri Thanvandri Siddhar
Sri Sundaranandar Siddhar
Sri Kongana=
r Siddhar
Sri Sattamuni Siddhar
Sri Vanmeegar Siddhar----None other than Va=
lmiki 
Sri Ramadevar Siddhar--- 
Sri Nandeeswarar Siddhar---Lord Nandeeshwa=
ra is taken as Siddha
Sri Edaikkadar Siddhar
Sri Machamuni Siddhar---- Maty=
sendranath 
Sri Karuvoorar Siddhar--- Dhanvantri is referred to Karuvoorar
=
Sri Bogar Siddhar----- Bhoganatha/ Bo Yang who travelled to china and becam=
e Lao Tse who founded Confucisionism 
Sri Pambatti Siddhar



This list var=
ies from text to text and also the list of Nath's varies from one tradition=
 to another. 

2.Would you recommend any good book that would give me an ch=
ance to learn about the divine life of these elevated beings.


3.The list =
of Sapta Rishis also varies from source to source.Just using Wikipedia have=
 the following

" The Shatapatha Brahmana and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (2.2=
.4) acknowledge the names of seven rishis (or Saptarshis) as:"

    Atri
  =
  Bharadvaja
    Gautama
    Jamadagni
    Kashyapa
    Vasishta
    Vishva=
mitra

" Krishna Yajurveda in the Sandhya-Vandana Mantras has it as:"

    =
Angiras
    Atri
    Bhrigu
    Gautama
    Kashyapa
    Kutsa
    Vasishth=
a

Brihat Samhita gives the Seven Rishis' names as:

    Marichi
    Vasish=
tha
    Angiras
    Atri
    Pulastya
    Pulaha
    Kratu


Which one of t=
hese is the right version .Sage Vasistha is universally present in all thre=
e lists attesting to his immense stature.

Vemparla Ram Kishore
