Namaste,

The full eclipse is from 11:33:36 UT to 17:29:57 UT
Eclipse (Umbr=
a) from 14:06:16 to 14:57:24
Eclipse (Penumbra) from 12:45:43 UT to 16:17:5=
8 UT
Eclipse (Greatest) at 14:31:49 UT

Equivalent Singapore timings are +8=
 hours. Thus eclipse will be between
7:33:36 pm SST (10-Dec) to 2:29:57 am =
SST (11-Dec)
