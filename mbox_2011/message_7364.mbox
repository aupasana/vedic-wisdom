Namaste!
I am a rather 'heart driven' person; so I get very carried away by=
 emotion and use the tharpana op to not just say thrupyatha, but also krita=
jnatha and aparaadhaan kshamaswa and a great big we-love-you to our dear de=
parted pet parrot and our dear departed pet dog...I pour the water for all =
the same way- over thumb and over the web tween thumb n forefinger. Learned=
 readers may please correct if something needs correction.

You do get nice=
 dreams and nice mental visions of some kith n kin; all in all it leaves yo=
u feeling good.So dont worry too much about whats real and unreal; anyway a=
ll of life is supposed to be a dream - in the waking state and in sleep.. A=
s long as your heart feels good its okay, is my humble opinion.

I use the =
white sesame seeds and pour them with shraddha into the sink; I hope the sh=
raddha will compensate for not pouring them into river/sea .. But what i un=
derstood from the correspondence of more learned and experienced people at =
vedic wisdom is that its important that you take pains to pour the seeds in=
to flowing water and ensure they dont sprout; something like doing duty wit=
hout attachment so that u dont incur karma???

Finally I offer the water to=
 every soul gone by, for they are all divya athma swaroopalaara in the prec=
ious name of my Guru-God, Who to me is Paramathma swaroopa, and of Whom all=
 who ever were, are and will be, are an inseparable part... By this time I =
am generally too overwhelmed with love and gratitude and a sense of oneness=
 to chant anything properly !! Not much of a proper tharpana! But thats all=
 am able to do ! I feel very happy though at the end of it all ; hope all t=
he souls remembered feel that way too.. !!!

dunno if this helped you or if=
 i just confused you even more ! But our learned readers may have some answ=
ers and i look fwd to hearing from them; and that includes Narasimhagaru=A0=
 ... once again Narasimhagaaru, thankyou so much for being there for all of=
 us..


And once again, all at vedic-wisdom, thankyou so much for getting m=
e started on tharpana; it has added so much value to my life !

ni seshadri
