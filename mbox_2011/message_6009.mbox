Worship of God, worship of the holy ones, concentration and meditation and =
unselfish work, these are the ways of breaking away from maya's net; but we=
 must first have the strong desire to get free. The flash of light that wil=
l illumine the darkness for us is in us; it is the knowledge that is our na=
ture (there is no 'birthright', we were never born). All that we have to do=
 is to drive away the clouds that cover it.
