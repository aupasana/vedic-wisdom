Ramkishoreji,

There is no disagreement in my mind on Sri PVRji's view that=
 caste is not determined by birth. But thanks for showing all these example=
s to drive the point. 

Ajit Krishnanji,

Thank you for your kind advice! 
=

Srinivasji, 

You are blessed to make such progress in a short span of tim=
e. Although my daily homams started only in the last 2-3 weeks, I had been =
doing weekly homams from the last two years. Still, I did not make such pro=
gress! I am realizing how karmas could be blocking one from progressing. Bu=
t yeah, we will overcome these and light is indeed there at the end of the =
tunnel! 

Nagraj

daily homam about 5-6 months later, as a precursor to publishing the manual=

 months before that, in late 2005, I had an interesting dream that actually=
 felt real (i.e. not like a dream). In the dream, there was a strong and pl=
easant naad (buzz) that used to accompany my Kundalini rises through sushum=
na during those days. It was dark and there was a huge fire. I was sitting =
in front of the fire. A person with a powerful persona, whom I had never se=
en before, sat in front of me. He was teaching me some yoga involving fire =
and what yoga means etc. He taught several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he =
changed into Manish. Then shakti came down, naad stopped, "dream" ended, an=
d I was aware of my body lying on bed. The face of the person I saw was viv=
id in my mind. I did not know who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish =
a week or two later. He said he did not know who it was, but asked me a wee=
k later to check out the photo of a specific yogi. When I did a search on t=
he internet, I found a photo (apparently the only photo

hat yogi). It looked very close to what I saw in my dream, except that the =
person in my dream seemed like a slightly younger version of that photo. Th=
is was a famous yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never=
 seen his photo before that or read much about that lineage or their teachi=
ngs, his coming in my dream was strange. Also, teaching me some yoga involv=
ing fire was strange, because homam movement did not start then and I was n=
ot thinking of fire or fire ritual at all.
