Dear Narasimha gaaru and learned group members:

Can someone help me with t=
he details of the following?

1. Where can I find the steps to ShodaSopacha=
ara puja for Ganapathi?

2. How to do Kalasa suddhi?

3. If I learn the var=
ious mudras (e.g. dhenu, various others descried in the Sani homam procedur=
e such as aavaahini)

4. Anganyaasam - how to do this?

5. During the pradh=
aana homam of Sani, do I have to recite the 108 names of Sani 4 times?

I c=
onsider myself so fortunate that I have come across this site. Whoever woul=
d have imagined that the internet could foster knowledge of this kind? When=
 I heard that some friends did homam, I told myself I would do it, too, aft=
er I retire and return to India. I never imagined that I could do it much m=
uch sooner than that. I have no words to thank you enough.

Ranga
Regards
