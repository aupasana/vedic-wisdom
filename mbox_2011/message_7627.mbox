"Yoga Spirituality: Going from Asana to Sadhana"
A New Video Presentation W=
ith
Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

"Yoga is not merely the aerobics of Indi=
a", explains Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya. Yoga is nothing less than Sanat=
ana Dharma in practice. Yoga and Sanatana Dharma are synonymous. There is n=
o meaning to one without the other. More, the only way to truly understand =
and derive full benefit from the Yoga system is by choosing to make the jou=
rney from mere asana (physical postures) to sadhana (spiritual discipline).=
 

In this historic talk, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya presents the system=
atic and authoritative Vedic perspective on the teachings, philosophy and s=
piritual goal of the path of Yoga. He also explains the origin and mystical=
 elements of this increasingly popular, if incredibly misunderstood, Vedic =
discipline. If you have just taken your first Yoga class, or if you have be=
en practicing for the last four decades, this presentation will expand your=
 understanding of Yoga tremendously!
