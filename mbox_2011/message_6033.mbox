You must retain great strength in your mind and words. 'I am low, I am low,=
' repeating these ideas in the mind man belittles and degrades himself. The=
refore the shastras say, 'He who thinks himself free, free he becomes; he w=
ho thinks himself bound, bound he remains'. This popular saying 'As one thi=
nks, so one becomes' is true. He alone, who is always awake to the idea of =
freedom, becomes free; he who thinks he is bound, endures life after life i=
n the state of bondage.
