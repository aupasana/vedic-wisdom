This ground-breaking paper by Sri Acharyaji was originally written in 1996,=
 and was later presented as an academic paper at World Association for Vedi=
c Studies Conference, Stevens Institute of Technology, July 29, 2000. It ha=
s become legendary since 1996, and is often cited as one of the first paper=
s in history documenting anti-Hindu bias in academia, as well as leading to=
 the global movement against anti-Hindu bigotry.


"Word As Weapon: The Mis=
use of Terminology in the Study of Hinduism"

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acha=
rya


"The term 'Sanatana Dharma' more accurately communicates the axiomati=
c
metaphysical nature of this concept than do the less meaningful and conco=
cted terms 'Hindu/Hinduism'. Thus, when the terms 'Hindu/Hinduism' are repe=
atedly used by both Euro-American and Indian scholars, as well as by actual=
 followers of this eternal spiritual tradition, we fall very far short from=
 fully communicating the metaphysical, ethical and ontological components o=
f the world-view of Sanatana Dharma. The former term =96 i.e., 'Hinduism' -=
 is a word
mistakenly created to describe a culture in a purely ethnic, nat=
ional and social context. The latter =96 'Sanatana Dharma' - is describing =
an illustrious science of Being in a purely philosophical - and therefore h=
ighly rational, and inherently beautiful - sense. It is understandable that=
 the terms 'Hindu/Hinduism' will continue to be used periodically as a matt=
er of convenience. After all, it takes time, coupled with continuous educat=
ion, for people to break themselves of a two hundred year old habit. For th=
e sake of accuracy, as well as to uphold the dignity, beauty and grandeur o=
f our ancient
and sacred religion, however, we must always do our utmost to=
 use the much more meaningful, linguistically correct and beautiful name Sa=
natana Dharma when referring to our religion. Our religion is Sanatana Dhar=
ma.

The use of inaccurate, and often consciously and maliciously distorted=
, terminology has been a double-edged source of oppressive discourse. The u=
se of such terms has been made use of by an intellectually lethargic tradit=
ion of South Asian scholars who view the religion of Sanatana Dharma, not a=
s the noble living tradition that it is, but as their personal academic pla=
ything. On the other hand, Hindus themselves have then blindly accepted the=
se non-indigenous and inaccurate terms, and unknowingly adopted them as the=
ir own. Thus, while the bulk of the blame must be placed squarely on the sh=
oulders of the oppressors, the victims too need to free themselves of a col=
onialist-induced mentality of inferiority and acceptance of their oppressio=
n. It is my fervent hope that we
followers of Sanatana Dharma will stop usi=
ng the terminology of our antagonists to describe our religion. We must beg=
in to call our religion by its true name: Sanatana Dharma. We must never us=
e the words 'idol' and 'mythology' to describe, respectively, our murtis an=
d sacred stories again. We must reclaim our heritage. Such positive change =
might come about slowly, one person at a time. Every revolution, however, b=
egins with thoroughly grasping the power of the word...."
