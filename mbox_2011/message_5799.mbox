ect: [vedic-wisdom] getting bad dreams....

   
Namaskaram Narsimha garu,

=
Lately I am getting repetitive bad dreams. Most of them are premonitions of=
 bad 
events(fire,train derailment,murder,kidnapping etc) going to happen a=
round the 
world. The fear tension that gropes around a person when he is k=
idnapped or 
murdered etc runs through my body. Almost everyday I get up at=
 the middle of 
night upset/scared apply vipudhi and sleep. Shouldn't homam=
s give one bliss then 
why do I feel so much pain of people? How is this re=
lated to spirituality? 
Kindly advice and is there a solution to this. 


M=
any thanks,
Priya
