 Translated by Prof. A. A. Ramanathan
Published by The Theosophical Publish=
ing House, Chennai

I-8. When the mind is calmed down into its source and g=
oes in the true path,
the results dependent on activities are unreal as the=
 objects of the senses
are confounded (i.e. actions performed do not affect=
 him as he is without
attachment).

I-9. It is the mind that constitutes wo=
rldly life; this should be purified.
As the mind, so the things appear colo=
ured by it; this is the eternal
secret.

I-10. By the purity of the mind on=
e destroys (the effect of) good and bad
actions. When with a pure mind one =
remains in the Self one enjoys
inexhaustible bliss.

I-11. If a person=E2=
=80=99s mind, which is well attached to the region of the
sense-objects, we=
re turned towards Brahman, who will not be released from
bondage ?

I-12-14=
. One should feel the supreme Lord to be present in the midst of the
lotus =
of one=E2=80=99s heart as the spectator of the dance of the intellect, as t=
he
abode of supreme love, as beyond the range of mind and speech, as he res=
cue
ship scattering all worry (of those sinking in the sea of worldly life)=
, as
of the nature of effulgent Existence alone, as beyond thought, as the
=
indispensable, as incapable of being grasped by the (active) mind,
possessi=
ng uncommon attributes, the immobile, steady and deep, neither light
nor da=
rkness, free from all doubts and semblance, and is consciousness
consisting=
 of the final beatitude.

I-17. Those ignorant people who stick to castes a=
nd orders of life obtain
the (worthless) fruit of their respective actions.=
 Those who discard the
ways of caste, etc., and are happy with the bliss of=
 the Self become merged
in Brahman (lit. Purushas).

I-18. The body consist=
ing of various limbs and observing the (rules of)
castes and orders has a b=
eginning and an end and is only a great trouble.
Free of attachment to one=
=E2=80=99s children, etc., and the body, one should live in
the endless sup=
reme happiness.

II-3. True knowledge consists of seeing non-different (in =
all); deep
meditation consists of the mind freed from thinking on sensory o=
bjects;
bathing is the removal of impurity in the mind and cleansing consis=
ts of
controlling the senses.

II-4. He should imbibe the nectar, Brahman, =
go about for alms to preserve
the body, and becoming devoted to the one (Br=
ahman) live in the solitary
place of oneness free from duality.Thus should =
a wise man spend his life; he
alone will attain liberation.

II-5. This bod=
y is born and it has death; it has originated from the impure
secretions of=
 the mother and father; it is the abode of joy and sorrow and
it is impure.=
 Bathing in the form of discarding attachment to it is ordained
when one to=
uches it with the idea that it belongs to one.

II-9. Viewing the body as =
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and mine is smearing oneself with faeces and
urine in t=
he place of cosmetics. Thus pure cleansing has been spoken of (in
the verse=
s above). Cleansing (the body) with mud and water is (the external
one) pra=
ctised in the world.

II-10. Cleansing which purifies the mind consists of =
the destruction of the
three inborn tendencies (loka-vasana, shastra-vasana=
 and deha-vasana);
(real) cleansing is said to be by washing with mud and w=
ater in the form of
(true) knowledge and dispassion (Jnana and Vairagya).

=
II-12. After embracing renunciation of his own accord the wise man shall
mo=
ve away from his native place and live far away, like a thief who has been
=
released from prison.

II-13. No sooner has (the ascetic) moved away from t=
he son of ego, the
brother of wealth, the home of delusion and the wife of =
desires than he is
liberated (from worldly bondage); there is no doubt abou=
t it.

II-14-15. How shall I perform the twilight worship (Sandhya, i.e., t=
here is
no need for it) when the mother of delusion is (just) dead and the =
son of
true awakening is born, causing two-fold impurity ? How can I perfor=
m
twilight worship when the bright sun of consciousness ever shines in the =
sky
of the heart and it never sets or rises ? (i.e. there is no twilight at=
 all
and hence there is no scope for worship).

II-17. There is liberation =
for those who are free from doubts; there is no
emancipation even at the en=
d of repeated births for those whose minds are
invaded by doubts (about the=
 non-duality of the Atman). Hence one should
have faith.

II-19. One, to wh=
om all primary desires, etc., (such as for wife, wealth and
progeny) appear=
 like vomit and who has discarded pride in his body, is
entitled to renunci=
ation.

II-21. He who renounces worldly life for amassing wealth (contribut=
ed by
rich disciples) or for the sake of (assured) boarding and clothing or=
 for a
stable position (as the head of a monastery) is doubly fallen (i.e. =
he has
neither the full pleasures of worldly life nor liberation); he does =
not
deserve final beatitude.

II-23. A fool in vain takes (theoretical) del=
ight in Brahman without
practically experiencing it (as I am Brahman), like=
 the joy of tasting
fruits found in the branch of a tree reflected (in a la=
ke).

II-26. Even learned people have their minds deluded by the illusion c=
reated
by me and without realizing me, the Atman, who am omnipresent, they =
but
wander like cows to fill the wretched belly !

III-14. I am not the wor=
ld, I witness all and I am devoid of eyes, etc., I
am immense, I am awake, =
I am serene and I am Hara (Shiva).
