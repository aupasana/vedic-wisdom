Namaste.

Again every example is taken by the followers as they wish to :-)=


Let me read / twist your example - "my grand father likes sweets, so I wi=
ll not give tarpanam using sesame seeds + water". Then we talk of rules wha=
t must be done to the departed, why only sesame, etc. So, the rule here is =
the existing parent gets the permission / authority or whatever we want to =
call it, to please his ancestors who are departed. When the ancestors are a=
live, any one can meet him; even his uncles, friends, neighbours, etc. If b=
y the same logic, any one can do tarpanam to anyone, I have no issues, just=
 that I am not yet convinced :-)

Like I mentioned, to each his / her own. =
Frankly, I have seen mundane logic stops somewhere for most of the rituals;=
 that is when we look for other learned's inputs or shastra's inputs. 

Aga=
in, I am merely stating what I was told as even I was prepared to start tar=
panam for this pitr paksha until I was told and realized it is against some=
 shastras. 

On the root of the tree example, I was going with this, http:/=
/www.asitis.com/9/25.html

Without flaming on the devas !=3D demigods :-), =
if there are any insights you can offer on why Lord mentioned it like this =
from any other angle, it will be much appreciated.

Lastly, thanks for your=
 inputs.

regards
rAma
