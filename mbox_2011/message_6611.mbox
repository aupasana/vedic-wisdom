THE SWAMI      There  are Sadhakas(aspirants) who meditate upon the Guru
i=
n the

                                Sahasrara(thousand-petalled lotus in=
 the
brain), and next they merge

                                 the form=
 of the Guru into that of the
Ishtam.  Sri Ramakrishna used

              =
                   to say very clearly: "The Guru appears
before the discip=
le in his

                                 spiritual vision; then pointing=
 out the
Ishtam to him he says,  'Look,

                                 t=
here is your Ishtam?=E2=80=99 and loses
himself in it."Really the Guru is n=
ot

                                 different from the Ishtam. There are s=
o
many practices in the

                                 spiritual life.Ho=
w can I tell you about
all of them?

                                 Follo=
w the spiritual path in right
earnest. When the mind becomes

             =
                    pure through religious practices you
will understand al=
l the truths of

                                 the spiritual world. Reme=
mber,there is
no end to them; they are
                            countles=
s. The spiritual aspirant remains
wholly absorbed in them.
