We say that it is freedom that we are to seek, and that that freedom is God=
. It is the same happiness as in everything else; but when man seeks it in =
something which is finite, he gets only a spark of it. The thief when he st=
eals gets the same happiness as the man who finds it in God; but the thief =
gets only a spark with a mass of misery. The real happiness is God. Love is=
 God, freedom is God; and everything that is bondage is not God.
