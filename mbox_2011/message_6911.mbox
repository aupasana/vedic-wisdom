The voice of the conscience alone is not sufficient to guide man in his lif=
e. Without taking sannyasa you cannot live the life of detachment and renun=
ciation through mere independent thinking and through conscience. The dutie=
s of life will be misunderstood without the shastras and the words of the r=
ealized persons (apta-vakya). The Lord Krishna says in the Gita: =E2=80=9CH=
e who, having cast aside the ordinances of the scriptures, follows the prom=
ptings of his desires, does not attain perfection, nor happiness, nor the h=
ighest goal.=E2=80=9D

Tired with the mundane life of the world, and strivi=
ng for the realization and correct knowledge of the Self, pondering over th=
e wisdom of the Upanishads which appertain to the science of Brahman, a rea=
lly wise man should abandon his home and take to the life of sannyasa. Thos=
e Brahmanas who, declaring protection to all creatures (i.e., sannyasins), =
leave their homes and take to asceticism, attain to effulgent regions.
