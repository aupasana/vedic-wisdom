namaskarams shri PVRji,

karpanyadoshopahatasbhavah prichAAmi!

pranams to =
your lotus feet,

I ask this humble question, 

How to know if I should hav=
e any hope of Divine grace! I have asked several direct questions to you wh=
ich u never answered, probably owing to divine master algoritms! But please=
 understand that I am suffering here with what practices to indulge in! I a=
m almost ready to divorce my wife and leave my kids' fate to themselves and=
 join an ashram at hrishikesh or himalayas, as my fate takes me, but I am s=
eeking your divine intervention, as you are my true manasika guru!

Humbly =
at your feet, 

Nagaraj
