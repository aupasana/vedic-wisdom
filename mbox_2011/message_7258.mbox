Namaste friends,

I agree with Utpal. Sink is the last option. Things poured in sink mix 
with all kinds of junk.

The best option is to pour the water at the base of a plant/tree. If 
that is not possible, pour it in a place where people usually don't 
walk. Pour in sink only if unavoidable.

Thanks,
Narasimha
