Namaste

I would like to share my opinion but the other gurujans on the boa=
rd might have more valid viewpoints. People often only take the external im=
agery and concentrate a lot of attention on the peel of the orange rather t=
han the fruit within.

Cow's ghee is praised in Ayurveda as one which can i=
ncrease both the material that forms the spleen ,bones and nervous system.P=
regnant women are often told to take a lot of ghee for good formation of th=
e foetus in the womb.Also it is a very good practise to use Ghee instead of=
 Oil while cooking even though modern nutrition experts will scare people i=
nto beleiving it will increase harmful cholestrol.

Cow's ghee when lit in =
a lamp or in a homa releases many organic compounds and vapours which are q=
uite beneficial to the human body. Also Cow's ghee is one of the most sattv=
ic substances that can be found. IIT -BHU has a published paper on the chem=
ical compounds formed during a homa and the temperature study. You could go=
ogle for it on the net. 

Lighting such a substance would never displease M=
other Lakshmi or any other god for that matter.

Doing any ritual should in=
spire one to change oneself internally as well. Just external rituals will =
not take anybody much further.

Narasimha ji's message can be found in the =
archives where he summarized the meaning of lighting three wicks in the lam=
p ( Ida,Pingala ,Sushumna ) and I think you can happily offer a ghee lamp w=
ith the same attitude.
