As i understand..it's only our karmas that act for our good / bad...there =
is nothing like god intervention of doing good / bad..he only gives his gra=
ce.. one who gets that grace..his karmas will be automatically burned..
Any=
 thoughts by the learned members?
ThanksKK

Hell=
o,

Any form of spiritual sadhana will bring only good results, leave aside=
 all doubts and worry.

Read Ch 6 from Autobiography of a yogi - Paramhansa=
 Yogananda
http://www.ananda.org/autobiography/#chap16

I moral i learnt fo=
rm that chapter is that wahtever issue/suffering/event is written in your k=
arma will futify when times comes, but depending on your sadhana or your gu=
rus grace the intensity and time period of that event will be shortened. 

=
In simple word if its written in your karma that a tiger will bite you, bec=
ause of your sadhana maybe a rat or ant will bite you. :)

regards
