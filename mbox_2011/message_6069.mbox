Hello,

If we compare this with analogy given by Respected Narasimha Rao ji=
 (A diamond with many facets), we can compare these as follows

First stage=
 (of seeing as head and tail)is when we see the diamond from far aways. we =
see it as a big shining star.

Next stage (of seeing the coin as made of me=
tal) is like coming very close to diamond. realising that this is a big dia=
mond with many facets instead of a big star. After we come more closer we s=
ee only that facet and not whole diamond

Next stage (of seeing as protons/=
neutrons etc) is like entering the diamond and getting assimilated in the d=
iamond matter itself. We realise that all facets are same from inside and a=
re made of same matter.

Deep Regards
with grace of Lord Krishna :)

usually do so. In short I can say that Duality and Non-duality these should=
 not be confused as contradictory. but they are two different properties of=
 same god.
