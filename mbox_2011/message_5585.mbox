Namaste,

Recently, one early morning my daughter made me, an overseas call=
, from
Australia. She said, she was intrigued with a wierd, vivid, hypnogog=
ic dream,
she had had last night.

She saw herself sitting on the pulpit of=
 a grave, in a grave yard, and read the
following inscribed on the Cross in=
 French: EUGENIE ALEXANDRINE, DIED: ON
SEPTEMBER 8TH 1969. She said that na=
me was very familiar to her, though she had
never heard of it. On an impuls=
e I checked Wikipedia, and there was a report on
Alexandra David-Neel (Euge=
nie Alexandrine)died on September 8th 1969. She is
reported as a French Wri=
ter on Bhuddism, with more than 21 important works to
her credit.

My daugh=
ter was born on SEPTEMBER 8TH 1979. There is ten years gap, but some
connec=
tivity seemed. Now she is a Dentist with Academic distinctions in French
la=
nguage. She has submitted many research works. She is fond of Budhism to th=
e
extent of becoming a Budhist Nun. She has no inclination for marriage or
=
motherhood. There is exact facial resemblance too. My daughter is very
spir=
itual, so keen on women's liberation, philonthropic, worried on social
welf=
are of humanity.

to some extent, can make use of this relia=
ble information for their work.
