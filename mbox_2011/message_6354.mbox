New Video! - "A Real Brahmana Knows Brahman"

A brahmana is a Vedic priest,=
 scholar and teacher - a guardian of Vedic culture. As Sri Dharma Pravartak=
a Acharya explains in this amazingly informative talk, a real brahmana is k=
nown by his inherent qualities of goodness, wisdom, cleanliness, peacefulne=
ss, knowledge of the Vedic scriptures, humility, and adherence to Dharma. M=
ore, a real brahmana knows Brahman - God. Thus, brahmana initiation is open=
 to any man or woman who knows Brahman - regardless of their ethnicity, rac=
e, language, nationality, or any other material factor. There is no such th=
ing anywhere in the Vedic scriptures as a "caste" brahmana. 

Sri Acharyaji=
 conclusively explains the nature of a real brahmana with more depth and cl=
arity than has ever been presented by anyone else before.
