 (Extracted from =E2=80=98Face to Face with Sri Ramana Maharshi=E2=80=99)

=
Annamalai Swami (1906-1995) since his childhood had a natural inclination
t=
owards spirituality. He came to Sri Ramana in 1928 and got a job with the
A=
shram. After being closely involved in many construction projects for ten
y=
ears under direct supervision of Sri Ramana, he shifted to Palakottu near
t=
he Ashram to live alone and meditate.

In 1928, a wandering sadhu gave me a=
 copy of Upadesa Undiyar by Sri Ramana.
It contained a photo of the Maharsh=
i. As soon as I saw the photo I had the
feeling that this was my Guru. Simu=
ltaneously, an intense desire arose
within me to go and see him.

That nigh=
t I had a dream in which I saw the Maharshi walking from the lower
slopes o=
f the hill towards the Ashram. Next morning I decided to go and have
his da=
rshan . Having arrived at about 1 p.m., when I approached the hall, a
part =
of the dream I had repeated itself in real life. I saw Bhagavan walk
down t=
he hill as I had seen in the dream. When I sat down and Bhagavan gazed
at m=
e in silence for about 10-15 minutes, I had a great feeling of physical
rel=
ief and relaxation. It was like immersing myself in a cool pool after
being=
 in the hot sun. I asked for permission to stay, which was granted and
I go=
t a job as Bhagavan's attendant. At that time Madhava Swami was doing
the j=
ob by himself.

About ten days after my arrival I asked Bhagavan how I coul=
d attain
Self-realisation? He replied, "If you give up identifying with the=
 body and
meditate on the Self,you can attain Self-realisation." As I was p=
ondering
over these remarks, Bhagavan surprised me by saying,"I was waiting=
 for you.
I was wondering when you would come." As a new comer I was too af=
raid to ask
him how he knew, or how long he had been waiting. But I was del=
ighted to
hear him speak like this because it seemed to indicate that it wa=
s my
destiny to stay with him.

A few days later I asked, "Scientists have =
invented and produced the
aircraft which can travel at great speeds in the =
sky. Why do you not give us
a spiritual aircraft in which we can quickly an=
d easily cross over the sea
of samsara?'' Bhagavan replied, "The path of se=
lf-enquiry is the aircraft
you need. It is direct, fast,and easy to use. Yo=
u are already travelling
very quickly towards realisation. It is only becau=
se of your mind that it
seems that there is no movement." In the years that=
 followed, I had many
spiritual talks with Bhagavan but his basic message n=
ever changed. It was
always: "Do self-enquiry, stop identifying with the bo=
dy and try to be aware
of the Self, which is your real nature."

When I fir=
st came to the Ashram there were still some leopards in the area.
They rare=
ly came into the Ashram but at night they frequented the place
where Bhagav=
an used to urinate. Once when a leopard appeared he was not in
the least af=
raid. He just looked at the leopard and said, =E2=80=98Poda=E2=80=99 [Go aw=
ay!]
and the leopard walked away.

Soon after I came I was given a new name=
 by Bhagavan. My original name was
Sellaperumal. One day Bhagavan mentioned=
 that I reminded him of Annamalai
Swami, who had been his attendant at the =
Skandasram. And within a few days
my new identity got established.

When I =
had been an attendant for about two weeks,the Collector of Vellore,
who cam=
e for Bhagavan's darshan , brought a large plate of sweets, which I
was to =
distribute to everyone in the Ashram. While I was distributing the
sweets o=
utside the hall I went to a place where no one could see me and
secretly he=
lped myself to about double the quantity that I was serving to
others. When=
 I went back to the hall and kept the empty plate under
Bhagavan's sofa, he=
 looked at me and said, "Did you take twice as much as
everyone else?" I wa=
s shocked because I was sure that no one had seen me do
it. This incident m=
ade me realise that it was impossible to hide anything
from Bhagavan.

Afte=
r serving as an attendant for a month, Bhagavan asked me to supervise
const=
ruction work within the Ashram. My big assignment was supervising the
const=
ruction of the cowshed. The problem was of funds, which came almost
under m=
iraculous circumstances.

The editor of The Sunday Times, Madras, published=
 a long complimentary
article about Bhagavan after he had his darshan . Thi=
s article came to the
attention of a prince in North India, who was much im=
pressed by Bhagavan.
Sometime later, the prince went for a tiger hunt. He m=
anaged to track down
the tiger but when he raised his rifle to shoot, he fe=
lt paralysed by a wave
of fear. Suddenly he remembered about Bhagavan and p=
rayed saying, "If
successful, I will not only send you Rs.1000, but also do=
nate the head and
skin of the tiger." The paralysis left him and he killed =
the tiger and saved
his own life in the process, as the tiger was within at=
tacking distance.

Two days after all the quarrels about the size of the co=
wshed, the postman
appeared with Rs. 1,000. Our finances were always in a p=
recarious position
but we never experienced any real financial crisis. Whil=
e the work was going
on, enough donations would come to cover all costs.

B=
hagavan took a keen interest in the construction work, guiding me at all
st=
ages of the work. In the evening, when I went to him with my daily report,
=
he would tell me the work to be done the following day. For any difficult
j=
obs he would even explain how to go about it.

In the 1930s Bhagavan alone =
decided when and where the buildings should be
built, on what scale and wha=
t material be used. He drew up the plans for
Ashram buildings, and told me =
what to do. If instructions were complicated
he would sometimes sketch a fe=
w lines on a piece of paper to clarify or
illustrate what he was saying. Wh=
en he gave me plans he would always say
that it was only a suggestion. He n=
ever presumed to give me orders.

Bhagavan himself wrote in Tamil =E2=80=98=
Pakasalai=E2=80=99 in big letters on a piece of
paper. These along with the=
 year =E2=80=981938=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Sri Ramanasramam=E2=80=99 in deva=
nagari
script, appear today on the top of the eastern wall of the dining ha=
ll.

Bhagavan would frequently come out to see what we were doing. He bomba=
rded
us with advice and instructions and would occasionally join in the wor=
k
himself. But he would say, "I am not connected with any of the activities=

here. I just witness all that happens=E2=80=9D. We would start projects wh=
en no
money was available to pay, happily ignoring all predictions of immin=
ent
financial doom made by the sarvadhikari. Bhagavan never asked anyone fo=
r
money and he forbade the sarvadhikari from asking for donations. Yet some=
how
enough donations came to complete every building.

Once when Bhagavan w=
as very sick, Maurice Frydman gave Rs. 1,000 to the
sarvadhikari for buying=
 fruits for Bhagavan. Knowing that Bhagavan would not
eat fruits unless eve=
ryone else was given an equal share, he avoided use of
the money for the pu=
rpose. Some months later, Frydman complained to Bhagavan
that his donation =
had not been properly spent. Bhagavan said rather angrily,
"When you give s=
omething you should regard the matter as closed. Why use
this gift to furth=
er your ego?"

Annamalai Swami moved to Palakottu (a colony abutting the As=
hram) in 1938.
Till the end of his life in 1995, he lived peacefully and si=
lently in his
little ashram. He also provided spiritual guidance to seekers=
 who wanted his
help and guidance.
