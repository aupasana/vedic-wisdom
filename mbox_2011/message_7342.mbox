 *Translated by Vidyavachaspati V. Panoli*

1-I-27. *Man cannot be satisfie=
d with wealth.* If we need wealth, we shall
get it if we only see thee. We =
shall live until such time as thou wilt rule.
But the boon to be asked for =
(by me) is that alone.

*1-II-2. The preferable and the pleasurable approac=
h man. The intelligent
one examines both and separates them. Yea, the intel=
ligent one prefers the
preferable to the pleasurable, (whereas) the ignoran=
t one selects the
pleasurable for the sake of yoga (attainment of that whic=
h is not already
possessed)* and kshema (the preservation of that which is =
already in
possession).

*1-II-5. Living in the midst of ignorance and deem=
ing themselves intelligent
and enlightened, the ignorant go round and round=
 staggering in crooked
paths, like the blind led by the blind.*

1-II-16. T=
his syllable (Om) indeed is the (lower) Brahman; this syllable
indeed is th=
e higher Brahman; whosoever knows this syllable, indeed, attains
whatsoever=
 he desires.

1-II-18. *The intelligent Self is not born, nor does It die.*=
 It did not
come from anywhere, nor did anything come from It. It is unborn=
, eternal,
everlasting and ancient, and is not slain even when the body is =
slain.

1-II-22. The intelligent one having known the Self to be bodiless i=
n (all)
bodies, to be firmly seated in things that are perishable, and to b=
e great
and all-pervading, does not grieve.

*1-II-23. The Self cannot be a=
ttained by the study of the Vedas, not by
intelligence nor by much hearing.=
* Only by him who seeks to know the Self
can It be attained. To him the Sel=
f reveals Its own nature.

1-II-24. None who has not refrained from bad con=
duct, whose senses are not
under restraint, whose mind is not collected or =
who does not preserve a
tranquil mind, can attain this Self through knowled=
ge.

*1-III-3. Know the Self to be the master of the chariot, and the body =
to be
the chariot. Know the intellect to be the charioteer, and the mind to=
 be the
reins.

1-III-4. The senses they speak of as the horses; the object=
s within their
view, the way. When the Self is yoked with the mind and the =
senses, the wise
call It the enjoyer.

1-III-9. But the man who has a discr=
iminating intellect as his driver, and a
controlled-mind as the reins, reac=
hes the end of the path =E2=80=93 that supreme
state of Vishnu.*

*1-III-10=
. The sensory objects are subtler than the senses, and subtler than
the sen=
sory objects is mind. But intellect is subtler than mind and subtler
than i=
ntellect is Mahat (the Hiranyagarbha).

1-III-11. The unmanifested (avyakta=
) is subtler than Mahat (Hiranyagarbha)
and subtler than the unmanifested i=
s Purusha. There is nothing subtler than
Purusha. That is the end, that is =
the supreme goal.*

1-III-16. Narrating and hearing this eternal story of N=
achiketas told by
Death, the intelligent man attains glory in the world of =
Brahman.

*2-I-4. Knowing that great and all-pervading Self by which one se=
es (the
objects) both in the sleep and the waking states, the intelligent m=
an
grieves no more.*

2-I-12. The Purusha, of the size of a thumb, dwells i=
n the body. (Realizing
Him as) the Lord of the past and the future, one doe=
s not (henceforward)
want to protect oneself. This verily is that (thou see=
kest).

2-III-7. The mind is subtler than the senses; subtler than the mind=
 is the
intellect; Mahat (Hiranyagarbha) is subtler than the intellect; sub=
tler than
Mahat is Avyakta (Unmanifested).

2-III-8. But subtler than Avyak=
ta is Purusha, all-pervading and without a
linga (distinguishing mark) inde=
ed, knowing whom a mortal becomes freed and
attains immortality.
