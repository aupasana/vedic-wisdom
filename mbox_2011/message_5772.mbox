 Every breath that flows in the nose,
Every beat that throbs in the heart,
=
Every artery that pulsates in the body,
Every thought that arises in the mi=
nd,
Speaks to you that God is near.

Every flower that wafts fragrance,
Eve=
ry fruit that attracts you,
Every gentle breeze that blows,
Every river tha=
t smoothly flows,
Speaks of God and His mercy.

The vast ocean with its pow=
erful waves,
The Mighty Himalayas with its glaciers,
The bright Sun and sta=
rs in the wide sky,
The lofty tree with its branches,
The cool springs in t=
he hills and dales,
Tell me of His omnipotence.

The melody of sweet music,=

The oration of powerful orators,
The poems of reputed poets,
The invention=
s of able scientists,
The operations of dexterous surgeons,
The utterances =
of holy saints,
The thoughts of the Bhagavad Gita,
The revelations of the U=
panishads,
Speak of God and His wisdom.

Even many educated men now say bol=
dly that there is no God, that everything
in this world goes on and evolves=
 according to definite laws. Can law arise
by itself? Can any law come out =
of nothing? Surely there must be an ultimate
cause. That is God.That is the=
 supreme Brahman or the Absolute. God is
self-existent Being. He is infinit=
ely powerful, wise and good.

The deepest craving, the deepest aspiration i=
n man is for eternal happiness,
eternal knowledge and eternal Truth. Man sh=
ould search for some supernatural
entity which can satisfy his deepest crav=
ings and aspirations.

Nature is not a mere chance collection of events, a =
mere jumble of
accidents, but an orderly affair. The planets move regularly=
 in their
orbits, seeds grow into trees regularly, the seasons succeed each=
 other in
order. Now Nature cannot order itself. It requires the existence =
of an
intelligent being, i.e., God, who is responsible for it. Even Einstei=
n, the
great scientist, was strongly convinced of the creation of the unive=
rse by a
Supreme Intelligence.

Albeit everything is transitory in this wor=
ld, people purchase enormous
plots of land, build bungalows in various plac=
es and erect five-storied
houses. They want to establish eternal life in th=
is sense-universe. This
shows that man is essentially immortal. In spite of=
 the knowledge that
everyone has to die, man thinks that he will live for e=
ver and makes very
grand arrangements to live here perpetually. Further, no=
body wants death.
Everybody wants to live, and takes treatment when ill, sp=
ending any
amount. Hence,
the essential nature of man should be eternal exi=
stence.

Even a fool thinks that he is wise. Everyone wants to show that he=
 knows
more than others.Nobody likes to be called a fool. Children tease th=
eir
parents with various sorts of questions. The desire to know is ingraine=
d in
them. These indicate that our essential nature is knowledge.

When a m=
an laughs, people seldom ask why he is laughing. On the other hand
when a m=
an cries, everybody asks why he is crying. This shows that our
essential na=
ture is bliss. No one wants misery, but everyone wants
happiness, and all o=
ne=E2=80=99s activities in life are directed towards the
acquisition of hap=
piness. This also proves that our real nature is bliss. In
deep sleep when =
there are no objects, senses or mind, we feel bliss; hence
our essential na=
ture should be bliss. That again is the reason why people
ailing from painf=
ul maladies even desire to give up their bodies and thus
get rid of the pai=
n.

You find that even the world's best doctors fail to cure a dying king. =
You
might have also heard of many instances where patients ailing from the =
worst
type of diseases are cured miraculously where even the ablest doctors=
 have
declared the cases hopeless. This itself is a clear proof that there =
is the
divine hand behind all cures.

Some people die when they are eighty =
years old; some die when they are in
the womb; some die at twenty; some at =
forty. What is the cause for the
variation? Who has fixed the span of life =
for all? This clearly proves that
there is the theory of Karma, that there =
is one Omniscient Lord, who is the
dispenser of the fruits of the actions o=
f the Jivas, who fixes the span of
life of the Jivas in accordance with the=
ir nature of Karma or actions, who
knows the exact relation between Karmas =
and their fruits. As Karma is Jada
or insentient, it certainly cannot dispe=
nse with the fruits of their
actions.

Close your eyes and imagine for a mo=
ment that you are dead.You can never do
so. You can never think that you wi=
ll not exist (after death). You will
imagine that your dead body is lying d=
own and that you are witnessing the
dead body. This clearly proves that you=
 are always the witnessing subject
(Sakshi, Drashta).There is an inherent f=
eeling in everybody 'I exist,' 'Aham
Asmi'.

There are five Indriyas (organ=
s that grasp) and five Vishayas (objects). Eye
can see
forms. Forms are mad=
e up of Agni-tattwa (fire principle). Eyes are also
formed out of fire Tanm=
atra. So there is a relationship between eye and
form. Eyes cannot hear sou=
nds. Ear is made up of Shabda-tanmatra (sound
element). Sound emanates from=
 Akasa (ether).There is a relationship between
ear and sound. Ear cannot se=
e. All the five senses are insentient or
non-intelligent. They borrow their=
 light and power from Atma or pure Spirit
which is at the back of these sen=
ses just as a cup of water, when exposed to
the sun, borrows the heat from =
the sun.

In sleep there are no senses, no objects, no mind apparent and ye=
t you
experience peace and bliss. When there are no objects, wherefrom have=
 you
derived the bliss? The mind rests in Brahman during sleep and it is fr=
om
Brahman this bliss is derived. Further during sleep when there are no ot=
her
persons 'I' alone exists.
