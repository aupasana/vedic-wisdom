Free Will and Destiny ...

Free will , would entail all that is under your =
own control < from choosing and
making your destiny etc etc

Destiny - woul=
d entail all that is already there for us to get ( good / bad ) ,
we don't =
make choices here


though i have heard and read a few things in this regar=
d , i have seen people
explain this according to their own level of conscio=
usness , which does not make
it absolute , it becomes a relative concept al=
together , which changes with
people

Which can not be true , as truth is a=
bsolute and not relative , our
understanding could be relative , which chan=
ges with time .


some would say that there is destiny , but we have choice=
s which we can make to
reach there , and the choices are an exercise of fre=
e will and the result a part
of destiny .

but isn't that suiting your own =
self , that is good to keep both the camps happy
, that u believe in destin=
y but all is not accepted or else what would drive
people .


I want to put=
 across this thought to the whole forum , if we believe in destiny
why don'=
t we believe the whole of it , and if we believe in free will why don't
we =
accept the whole totality of it .

Predicting the future and analyzing the =
past are both very difficult and both
science and jyotish may have a point =
, but I think the knowledge to both is
limited , which is why we don't get =
complete answers to all questions from
either of them .
