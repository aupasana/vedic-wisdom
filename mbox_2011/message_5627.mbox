After long searches here and there, in temples and churches, in earths and =
in heavens, at last you come back, completing the circle from where you sta=
rted, to your own soul and find that He, for whom you have been seeking all=
 over the world, for whom you have been weeping and praying in churches and=
 temples, on whom you were looking as the mystery of all mysteries shrouded=
 in the clouds, is nearest of the near, is your own Self, the reality of yo=
ur life, body, and soul.
