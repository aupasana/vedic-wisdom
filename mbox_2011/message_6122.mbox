=C2=A0



  


    
      
      
      Dear Sir/Madam,
Fo=
llowing are my replies to your questions below.


1.What is the significanc=
e of showing various mudra in homam procedures
I am not aware of the deeper=
 meaning of the various mudras in a homam. My understanding is that after t=
he deity is invoked in the fire, the mudras are symbolic of asking the deit=
y to sit down and make him/herself comfortable, accept the offerings etc.=
=C2=A0


2.Is there any dimensions that has to be followed to do homakundam=


do we need to place homa kundam on any yantra like  figures.can we make h=
oma kunda using bricks.Do wee need to decorate it
If you are talking of bui=
lding a homa kundam in the ground, then there are specific rules to be foll=
owed in the construction of the homakundam. Do consult a learned agnihotri =
/ temple priest in this regard. Robert Svoboda in the Aghora series of book=
s gives some information relating to this question.
=C2=A03.Any purificatio=
n procedure is there for spoons used for providing aahuthi
I have seen some=
 priests sprinkle holy water on the spoons and instruct that the spoons be =
held above the fire for a few seconds.

4.I have seen people using 2 types =
of spoon .One with flat end  similar to one   used for making dosa   and th=
e other one the normal spoon  why is it so 
I think it is to avoid wastage/=
spillage of ghee when transferring from the bowl to the homa.=C2=A0



5.I =
have seen people using herbal sticks/ twig of banyan trees/sesame etc .What=
 is the purpose of it
They all constitute items which can be offered to the=
 fire. Each offering has its own unique effect.=C2=A0



6.How to make ring=
 using dharba grass/any rules are there 
Please see following link for info=
rmation on this:=C2=A0http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/sri-vaishnava-foru=
m/702154-use-following-steps-make-dharbha-pavithram-pictures.html=C2=A0



=
7.I have seen people wearing white towel made as a rope   as cross over the=
ir abdomen just like people use to  wear sacred  thread while doing homa
I =
think that the towel is tied over the stomach mainly to prevent the dhoti f=
rom falling down! =C2=A0



8.some times priests used to pour water in homa=
 kunda.what is for that
I have not seen this but I think it may be some tar=
panam sort of offering. Is the pouring of water done before or after the fi=
re has been lit?=C2=A0



9.which classical text can be refereed for authen=
tic information about homa
Sri Narasimha can guide in this question.
