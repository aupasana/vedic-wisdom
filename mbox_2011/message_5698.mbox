The absence of the thought of self is the essential characteristic of the l=
ove for God. Religion nowadays has become a mere hobby and fashion. People =
go to church like a flock of sheep. They do not embrace God because they ne=
ed Him. Most persons are unconscious atheists who self-complacently think t=
hat they are devout believers.
