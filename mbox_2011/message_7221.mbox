Mrs Vani,

Tithi is a lunar day as per indian calendar. For example I was b=
orn on Margasira Sukla Navami, 9th day in the first half of 9th Lunar month=
.=C2=A0 This typically does not exactly align with English date, you need t=
o refer to online indian calendar to translate to an english date every yea=
r.

=C2=A0
Regards,
SSR
