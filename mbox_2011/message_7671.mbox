Namaste Rajarshi,
Thank you very much for your kind and extremely detailed,=
 through and
enlightening explanation to the question.
It has definitely op=
ened up in me another dimension altogether.
Pranaams and heartfelt sincere =
thanks.
Warmest regards..

fearlessness.

a creation of some. It is the way it is, and has been r=

and over by people who have realized the different forms in=

duality. If the iconography of a deity holds a weapon, it is =
not for
show purposes. And if it holds plenty of weapons, then there are pl=
enty
of good reasons where=C2 he/she amply uses them. If you worship Smasha=

Kali at home, She will make the area you live in into a smashan, whether
=
you want it or not. Some opine that the smashana is merely=C2 in the
heart =
of the sadhaka, and She is not really that fierce. This is solid
misunderst=
anding based on a bookish understanding superimposed with
Vedanata type thi=
nking. Where the smashana will be created for Kaali
depends on your persona=
l conditioning. If you are continuously living in
perfectly universal condi=
tion, unattached to anything, THEN you
literally ARE the Universe. Then the=
 smashana is only
>  inside your heart, which in that case has become the w=
hole world.=C2
Else, for the rest whose minds still firmly work in the fiel=
d of
duality, the smashana is both outside and inside, depending on the
deg=
ree of connection the person has to the universal. Smashana Tara told
Vimal=
ananda that she cannot come to his home, he has to go to the
smashana every=
 night. Thats the way it is. Similarly, an ugra form
is=C2 actually ferocio=
us. A soumya form is actually non-ferocious.=C2
Some will love the former, =
some will love the later. Chandi, the very
name, comes from the root word "=
chand", which is also the root word for
Chandala. One who does not follow r=
ules, cannot be made to confirm to
any rule, breaks down rules and restrict=
ions.=C2 This derivation is
mentioned in some of the texts on Chandi sadhan=
a. That gives a slight
hint of what kind of energy She manifests.
