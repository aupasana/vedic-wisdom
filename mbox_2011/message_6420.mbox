If you cannot live a perfect life in the world, kick the world mercilessly.=
 Practice tapasya. Purify your mind. Serve and love others with a divine bh=
ava! Now you are ready for sannyasa. Become a paramahansa sannyasin and att=
ain the jivanmukti state.
The knowledge of Brahman should be taught to thos=
e who have purified their hearts by practising the sadhana-chatushtaya, who=
 are well-versed in the shastras, who possess faith, who are centered in Br=
ahman, and who have duly practiced the vow of shirovratam. Sirovratam is th=
e well-known Vedic vow mentioned in the Atharva Veda. This obviously means =
the head-vow, the vow of sannyasa or renunciation. This is the ceremony in =
which the head is shaven.
