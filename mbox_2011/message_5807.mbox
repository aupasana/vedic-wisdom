Hi All,
FYI:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D7rXkogdIw88
Feb. 3: Thousands=
 of Shirdi Sai Baba devotees thronged the famous Dilsukhnagar Sai Baba temp=
le on Thursday following reports that a =E2=80=9Cdivine light=E2=80=9D had =
been seen in the temple premises.
Traffic came to a halt on the busy Dilsuk=
hnagar road for several hours as thousands of devotees rushed to the temple=
 to perform special pujas to Sai Baba. Describing the =E2=80=9Cdivine light=
=E2=80=9D as Sai Jyoti, some devotees said that Sai Baba himself had manife=
sted in the temple while others termed it as a =E2=80=9Cmiracle=E2=80=9D. T=
he temple, attracted more than 30,000 devotees on Thursday, which was a rec=
ord of sorts and TV news channels deployed scores of OB vans near the templ=
e.
Several local news channels aired visuals of the =E2=80=9Cdivine light=
=E2=80=9D throughout the day, said to be recorded by CCTV cameras installed=
 in the temple premises. However, the temple authorities claimed the =E2=80=
=9Cdivine light=E2=80=9D was recorded by the CCTV cameras on January 13, 16=
 and 20 after the temple had closed at 10 pm. They said the =E2=80=9Cdivine=
 light=E2=80=9D had appeared at different times in the night during those t=
hree days but they had maintained =E2=80=9Csecrecy=E2=80=9D as they did not=
 want the temple to run into =E2=80=9Cunnecessary controversies.=E2=80=9D
T=
he TV visuals showed the =E2=80=9Cdivine light=E2=80=9D appearing near the =
main gate of the temple inside the premises for a few minutes. It hovered a=
round the place for sometime where the box containing =E2=80=9CSai Baba vib=
uthi=E2=80=9D was placed before it disappeared. Meanwhile, some rationalist=
 associations claimed that the =E2=80=9Cmiracle=E2=80=9D was due to some =
=E2=80=9Ctechnical problems=E2=80=9D in the cameras.
Not sure if god has to=
 really show such miracles :)
CheersKK
