Sannyasa has got its own glory and advantages! The freedom of a sannyasin c=
an hardly be described. Only a sannyasin can entirely cut off all connectio=
ns and ties. Though you have colored your heart, still all members of your =
family will cling to you like leeches till the end of your life. You cannot=
 entirely eradicate moha or infatuated love and attachment for your family.=
 When you fall sick You will be tempted to go in for their help and vice ve=
rsa. The old samskaras will get a new life and moha will bind you with stro=
nger chains once again. It is only when you take sannyasa that they will le=
ave you free. They will leave all hopes which they had on you. Only then yo=
u become dead for them. They will not approach you again.
