9. Thus even in the mutual love between husband and wife the incentive is
=
one=E2=80=99s
own desire for happiness.

10. A child, when kissed by its fa=
ther, may cry, being pricked by the
latter=E2=80=99s bristly beard, still i=
ts father goes on kissing the child =E2=80=93 it is
not for its sake but fo=
r his own.

12. A merchant forces his bullock, though unwilling, to carry a=
 load. He
loves the bullock for his own sake, how can it be for the bullock=
=E2=80=99s ?

60. A son is dearer than wealth, the body dearer than the son=
, the
sense-organs dearer than the body, life and mind dearer than the sens=
e
organs and the Self is supremely dearer than life and mind.

65. When a m=
arried couple desire to have a son and do not have one, they are
disappoint=
ed and miserable. After conception, a miscarriage or the pain of
labour
cau=
ses sorrow.

66. When a son is born he may suffer from diseases or from the=
 position of
the
planets at his birth, or he may be stupid or obstinate, or=
 after the
investiture of
sacred thread, he may study nothing or if he is l=
earned, he may remain
unmarried.

67. Again he may start pursuing the wives=
 of others, or he may have an
unwieldy
family and remain in poverty, or he =
may grow wealthy and yet die in his
youth.
Infinite are the sorrows of pare=
nts.

68. Having considered all this, the disciple must abstain from formin=
g an
attachment
to other things. He should focus his love on the Self and c=
ontemplate It day
and
night.

83. Knowing that for some Yoga is difficult a=
nd for some others knowledge,
the great
Lord Sri Krishna speaks of these tw=
o paths.

XIII. THE BLISS OF NON-DUALITY

10. So the illusive appearance of=
 the world in the partless bliss can be
explained.
Like the power of a magi=
cian, the power of Maya may be said to bring the
objective
world into being=
.

14. =E2=80=9CThe supreme Brahman is eternal, perfect, non-dual and omnip=
otent=E2=80=9D, so
says
the Veda and Vasistha supports this.

18. =E2=80=98=
Just as a tree with its fruits, leaves, tendrils, flowers, branches,
twigs =
and roots is latent in the seed, so does this world abide in Brahman=E2=80=
=99.

20. =E2=80=98O Rama, when the all-pervasive, eternal and infinite Sel=
f assumes the
power of
cognition, we call it the mind=E2=80=99

21. =E2=80=
=98O Prince, first arises the mind, then the notion of bondage and release
=
and then the universe consisting of many worlds. Thus all this manifestatio=
n
has been fixed or settled (in human minds), like the tales told to amuse
=
children=E2=80=99.

27. =E2=80=98Thus to those who have no discrimination t=
he world appears to be real
like the
tale repeated to the child=E2=80=99.

=
35. The pot is not different from the clay, as it has no existence apart
fr=
om the clay; it is neither identical with the clay, as in the unmoulded
cla=
y it is not perceived.

47. Though a man appears head downwards when reflec=
ted in water, he is not
so.
No one would ever mistake it for the real perso=
n standing on the bank.

48. According to the doctrine of the non-dualists,=
 such knowledge (i.e., the
knowledge of the unreality of the superimposed t=
hing, the world), gives
liberation,
the supreme goal of life. As the substr=
atum clay is not rejected, the
appearance of a
pot in it is accepted.

49. =
In an actual modification of the substratum, when milk is turned into
curd =
(for
example), the former form, milk, disappears. But in the modification o=
f clay
into a
pot or gold into an ear-ring, the substratum does not change.=


50. (Doubt): When a pot is broken into pieces, they do not resemble the
o=
riginal
clay, for broken pieces only are seen. (Reply): It is not so, for w=
hen
reduced to
powder they do. The persistence of gold in the ear-ring is v=
ery clear.

62. The nature of Brahman is existence, consciousness and bliss=
, whereas the
nature of the world is name and form. In the Nrisimha-Uttara-=
Tapaniya
Upanishad existence, consciousness and bliss are said to be the
=
=E2=80=98indications=E2=80=99 of Brahman.

64. After creating names and for=
ms Brahman remains established in His
nature, i.e.,
remains as immutable as=
 ever, says the Purusha Sukta. Another Shruti says
that
Brahman as the Self=
 reveals names and forms.

65. Another Shruti says that before creation the=
 universe was unmanifest and
that
afterwards it became manifest as name and=
 form. Here Maya, the inexplicable
power
of Brahman, is referred to as =E2=
=80=98unmanifest=E2=80=99.

69. Sri Krishna said to Arjuna: =E2=80=98O desc=
endant of Bharata, beings are
unmanifest in the beginning, manifest in the =
present and unmanifest again at
the end=E2=80=99.

79. Both name and form a=
re without any real existence because they are
subject to
creation and dest=
ruction. So know them as superimposed by the intellect on
Brahman, just as =
waves and foam are on the ocean.

86. Just as in the sleeping state a power=
 inherent in the Jiva gives rise to
impossible dreams, so the power of Maya=
 inherent in Brahman, projects,
maintains and destroys the universe.

90. I=
n a sleeping man various dreams are created; similarly the power of
Maya
cr=
eates diverse appearances in the immutable Brahman.

92. Brahman characteri=
sed as existence, consciousness and bliss is the
common
basis of both the a=
nimate and inanimate objects; they differ only in their
names and
forms.
