Isolation of the soul from all objects, mental and physical, is the goal; w=
hen that is attained, the soul will find that it was alone all the time, an=
d it required no one to make it happy. As long as we require someone else t=
o make us happy we are slaves. When the Purusha finds that It is free, and =
does not require anything to complete Itself, that this Nature is quite unn=
ecessary, then freedom is attained.
