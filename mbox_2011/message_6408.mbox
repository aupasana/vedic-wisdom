In the presence of my Master I found out that man could be perfect, even in=
 this body. Those lips never cursed any one, never even criticized any one.=
 Those eyes were beyond the possibility of seeing evil, that mind had lost =
the power of thinking evil. He saw nothing but good. That tremendous purity=
, that tremendous renunciation is the one secret of spirituality.
