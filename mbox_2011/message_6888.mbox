Namaste Dr Bhatla,

I do use dry coconut with murmure(puffed rice) and til(=
black and white) and for poornahuti i use a full dry cocnut.
But since i ha=
ve been doing it on daily basis for a while, it has resulted in the blacekn=
ing of walls.
I am afraid, i may have to stop it.
Thats why i need some sug=
gestions.

And smoke is no problem for me,there is enough ventilation in my=
 room and  i can bear it.

Thanks
Jitender
