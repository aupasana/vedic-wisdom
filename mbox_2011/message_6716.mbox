The indispensable necessity and the extreme importance of sannyasa can be v=
ery well imagined by the fact that it was not men alone but also women that=
 took sannyasa in doing sadhana for self-realization. We know of the existe=
nce of sannyasinis, bhairavis and yatiswaris who have been a glory not mere=
ly to womankind but to the nation and the world as a whole. The chronicles =
of Christian mystics teem with immeasurable instances of such renowned all-=
renouncing nuns who were the examples of fiery aspiration, intense vairagya=
 and supreme tyaga.

In India, the earliest records speak of the renunciati=
on of Maitreyi, after hearing the sublime upadesha by Sage Yajnavalkya. She=
 was permeated with the true spirit of sannyasa. She renounced the world. S=
he is an ideal for all women, for all times.
