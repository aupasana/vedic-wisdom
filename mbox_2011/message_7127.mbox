Thank you very much for the wonderful Gift and Service that you have done f=
or mankind by providing with different Homam procedure on the vediastrologe=
r.com website.
 
There are lot of people like me who never understood the d=
epth  and divinity of Hindu Religion and the Sankrit language and for such =
people your offering is like a boon
 
After watching the Audio and Video  H=
oman for Lord Mahaganapathi Homam i have been doing the homam for a while a=
nd now i an undergoing major changes  in life and i am certain that everyon=
e are going throught the same .
 
I would request you from the bottom of my=
 heart to do the same for others also (Sri Mahalakshmi,Sani and Chandi Homa=
m) and provide us with an Audio instruction since there are many people out=
 there like me who are awaiting.
 
 
Thank you once again for the wonderful=
 service and Lord Ganesh bless you and your entire family with infinite ble=
ssings.
