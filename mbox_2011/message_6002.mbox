Embracing the Infinite Possibilities of=
 Sanatana Dharma

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya


"Sanatana Dharma is th=
e most personally expansive and psychologically empowering religion on eart=
h. It is a path that teaches its followers to be fearless, dedicated, focus=
ed, strong, assertive, self-controlled, virtuous, self-reliant, and to stri=
ve for excellence in all endeavors. Sanatana Dharma teaches us how to be ar=
ya - noble. Sanatana Dharma can only empower us is such a manner, however, =
when the full philosophy and lifestyle of Dharma is actually followed and p=
racticed in daily life. 

Sanatana Dharma is a religion of the possible. It=
 is a tradition that teaches us that anything and everything that we can dr=
eam is attainable. In Sanatana Dharma, we are radically free to perform any=
 positive task, to reach out boldly toward any constructive goal, to achiev=
e any vision that our imaginations can reveal. Dharma frees us from the bon=
ds of ignorance and fear that bind us, and gives mighty wings to realize ou=
r inner yearning for peace, joy, and unlimited freedom.

Ours has historica=
lly been a religion that has fostered Possibility-Thinking. Sanatana Dharma=
 is a religion that reflects the very essence of the diverse and infinite p=
ossibilities that the universe has to offer us. The infinitely expansive ra=
nge of thinking, feeling, and experiential possibilities that the Dharmic w=
orld-view offers is without limit...."
