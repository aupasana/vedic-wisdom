We trace our ancestry from Lord Narayana. From Narayana was born Brahma. Fr=
om Brahma=E2=80=99s mind was born Sage Vashistha, the reputed embodiment of=
 wisdom, the spiritual preceptor of the kings of Ayodhya. He gave us the Yo=
ga-Vashistha, the transcendental guide-light to humanity. Vashistha=E2=80=
=99s son was Sakti. From Sakti was born sage Parasara. From Parasara was bo=
rn Vyasa, the great Badarayana, or Krishna-Dvaipayana, who divided the Veda=
s, and wrote the Mahabharata. Vyasa=E2=80=99s son was the ideal sage Suka D=
eva, who gave the Bhagavata to Parikshit. Suka was initiated into sannyasa =
by Lord Shiva himself. Read the Suka-Rahasya Upanishad. You will find that =
Suka was initiated into the Mahavakyas by Sadashiva at the request of Sri V=
yasa Maharshi. The blood of Suka-Deva is said to run in the veins of Gaudap=
ada, the famous advaitic metaphysician, the father of Advaita-Vedanta.Gauda=
pada initiated Govindapada into sannyasa, who, in turn, initiated into sann=
yasa Sri Shankara, the wondrous giant of Indian philosophy and religion. Sh=
ankara=E2=80=99s name will be remembered as long as the Divine Names of Ram=
a and Krishna will last in this world. But for the timely incarnation of Sh=
ankara the upanishadic wisdom would have sunk into oblivion. Glory to the g=
reatest sannyasin, Shankara, the =E2=80=9CLoka-Shankara,=E2=80=9Dwho shower=
ed the rain of peace all over the land!
