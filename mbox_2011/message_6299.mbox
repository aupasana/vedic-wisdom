Congratulations on your First Homam, hope Ganesha gives you=C2=A0strength=

As Narasimha keep saying, try =

can. Do not bother about the initial hiccups, you'll get over them with=C2=

ThanksKK

      Hari Om Shr=

I finally did my first homam in the fire pit =
I purified and painted to match the 3 gunas. It was fine but I will need pr=
actice to keep the fire going as the wind made it go out twice and I didn't=
 bring all the materials I had planned to, so I didn't have extra camphor. =
However it was a great experience and I felt very energized after and got a=
 lot of work done which I had been putting off.

I included parts of the ma=
nual for before and after and used the way I have seen in our community whi=
le growing up.

I didn't do a panchopachar puja as I did a more general hav=
an with mantras to many devtas as the main part. I know for the specialized=
 homam, different deity mantras may not be recommended due to their differe=
nt energies but I am hoping to do a general version on most Sundays now.


=

However, for Narasimha Chaturdashi I would like to know how we should do p=
rana pratishta and anganyas, karanyas, etc? I know the beej mantra is kshra=
um but I am not sure if we can use that in all of anganyas and karanyas ?

=
We should observe this vrat on Sunday in the West, correct? and would the b=
est time for homam be in the twilight when Lord Narasingha appeared?
