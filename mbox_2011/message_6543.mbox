Dear Sir,
Please clarify the complete procedure of satyanarayan vratam. Fro=
m my childhood I have always listen the vrat-katha only. Each year we organ=
ise satyanarayan katha in our house and invite our relatives to hear the ka=
tha chanted by our panditji. I feel that it is not only the katha but there=
 must be some other detail retuals as it is known as vrat and nobody do any=
 fasting or sankalp nor our panditji told us ever.
Sometimes i try to ask h=
im but everybody opposes that we are doing this from many years and this is=
 the complete procedure. Still i am doubtfull.
Recently i heard that you ar=
e also organising this vratam at your home, thus the desire to know from yo=
u. Please calrify.
=A0
Best Regards
Ashish Agarwal
