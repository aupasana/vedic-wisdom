The All-merciful God resides in the chambers of your heart, He is quite clo=
se to you. You have forgotten Him. But he still cares for you. Troubles are=
 His blessings in disguise. He wants to mould your body and mind as fit ins=
truments for His unhampered play or Lila. He ministers or attends to your w=
ants in a better manner than you yourself will do. Keep the load down that =
you are carrying on your shoulder unnecessarily on account of your egoism. =
Give up your self-created responsibilities and be at perfect ease. Have per=
fect faith in Him. Do total unreserved self-surrender. Run to Him now. He i=
s waiting with outstretched hands to embrace you. He will do everything for=
 you. Believe me. Take my word for it. Open your heart to Him quite freely =
like a child. All miseries will come to an end. Say unto Him at least once =
with Bhava sincerely : I am Thine, my Lord. All is Thine, Thy will be done.=
