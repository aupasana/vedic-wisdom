Hari Om,

I have cleaned, purified and and painted to match the 3 gunas a f=
ire pit at my parents and nephews new house.
I wanted to know if during the=
 first homam I should do Agni prana pratishta and panchopacar puja first or=
 maybe just stick to a Ganapathi homam, I was thinking this sunday would be=
 good. maybe all the mantras in Homa install Agni devta but since this will=
 be the first time use I wanted to know if prana pratishta and panchopachar=
 puja should be done.

The homa we do in our community mandirs is different=
 from the Rig Vedic style, it is more general and basic, the Arya Samaj way=
 (close to this - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havanam) except for offering=
 ahutis for our Devis and Devas before Gayatri mantra. I wanted to incorpor=
ate a bit from both styles like drawing the six lines with darbha, dikpaala=
ka puja, sudhaana bali, and vasordhaara with 3rd verse of chamakam.
Shree N=
arasimha ji and any other knowledgable Dharmic persons, please give your op=
inions.

Thank you,
Chetan
