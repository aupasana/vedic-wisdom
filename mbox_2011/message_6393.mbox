Realization of the Absolute is not a talk, is not a, play, It is the most d=
ifficult and the hardest of all tasks. It demands the price of one=E2=80=99=
s very self! Will you pay it? It demands your individual life. It demands y=
our ego; it demands your very being as the cost for self-realization! If th=
at is everyone=E2=80=99s goal, if that is every one=E2=80=99s ideal, should=
 not the more experienced impart that secret to the lesser ones? Should not=
 every child in the cradle be initiated into the mysteries of existence? Wh=
y do you think that you are spoiling the career of the child by teaching it=
 sannyasa and Vedanta? Let the world cease to exist! Let all become sannyas=
ins and Vedantins! Let there be no more creation! Let there be no more proc=
reation! Let every son and every daughter be taught the truths of renunciat=
ion and knowledge of Brahman! Only then does life become fruitful! Only the=
n man becomes a real man!
