Namaste Sundeep...

'Yet the day I do Savitur Gayatri homam, the Gayatri re=
sults seems a bit weaker - I have no idea why.'

In the last shloka of Kali=
 sahasranam she is named as  "AtmavidyA brahmavidyA parabrahmasvarUpiNI"  i=
s this any different than savItri gAyatrI sarasvatI?

However 'krIM' bija a=
lthough connected to Brahma and the primordial creative potential belongs t=
o the Ka varga that is ruled by Mars. As opposed to 'klIM which has the pri=
thvi in it and is 'softer'.

I dont believe there is any such thing as 'str=
onger' or 'weaker' nor is there a conflict between the two. 

it seems that=
 the Kali mantra is addressing your problems more directly and the fire of =
Maa Kali is forcing you to deal with your dualistic concepts of self and th=
e desires that perpetuate such notions-having a self (with a particular poi=
nt of view), being separate from others, failing to recognize one's 'self' =
in the other etc.

"But things have changed now. The Kali mantra is very pu=
nishing in a mental tightness kind of way, yet still helps me deal with men=
tal hardship without completely giving up/getting angry/stressed."

Maa Kal=
i is not punishing in any way, it is only our perpetual clinging attachment=
 that causes us to wince when we approach her. Think of the skirt of severe=
d arms with the hands still attached which she sports.  Its high fashion in=
 the Real World where our relative existence as jivas must meet the Ultimat=
e Existence and fully reckon with the ignorance that we have mistaken for k=
nowledge.

Please forgive me...i am still a saMsAri caught like a wild anim=
al in the trap of dualistic concepts. " This is good, this is better....".

Warm Regards

Ajaya
