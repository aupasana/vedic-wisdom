Namaste,

I wish to express my view point on this specific case of Biswajit=
.
He was looking for Mantras for Mother Bagalamukhi. He got it from some so=
urce and started giving Ahutis with the Mantra during his Maha-Ganapati Hom=
am. As he has written, First day he had troubles in office and 2nd day his =
bike was stolen resulting in his shaken confidence due to obvious worries.
=

Looking at the situation, IMHO, it is very early to think about stopping t=
he same. Though intentions for specifically invoking Mother Bagalamukhi is =
not known, I believe that it was for some or the other Saatwik desire (Even=
 it may have been mundane and not speeding up spiritual progress). Also, it=
 defies the logic to attach incidences to Homam with experiences of just a =
couple of days.
For that matter, even Maha-Ganapati Homam was not easy if I=
 take my own personal experiences. I have chiefly performed Maha-Ganapati H=
omas as well as Chandi homas and I have had many set backs and some good th=
ings as well but again those are all part & parcel of life. Even without Ho=
mam, one may experience such dualistic situations.

I understand your insis=
tence and your prudent advice to worship Soumya Devatas and I agree to your=
 logic which is most probably out of your experiences, however I also think=
 that Ugra Devata should not be that fearful while Soumya Devatas are not t=
hat Goody-goody. Ultimately, it is all about attraction/liking for a partic=
ular deity. It is my personal view that one needs to decide upon a Homam of=
 a deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or Ugra-Soumya in external Nature) to which=
 one feels most attracted and then forget about the rest. It would be a des=
tabilizing effect on mind of a person to start judging and relating day to =
day experiences with homam. The chosen deity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi=
 or Krishna or Shiva or Hanuman or any other deity. Once person starts surr=
endering to the chosen deity, one is in safe hands. Even if things starts g=
oing wrong, one need not despair and should keep faith till it is impossibl=
e because if God exist, there never would be a breaking point and that hold=
s true for all of us whether we have families to look after or not.
I compl=
etely tend to agree and hence repeat for benefits of others that Ganapati i=
s not a Lower devata. He is capable of everything. If one has a great likin=
g for him, one can keep on performing his homam without need of switching. =
Actually to switch from Maha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is NOT chan=
ging of Levels (especially from Lower to upper) which some may think.

Best=
 Regards,
Utpal
