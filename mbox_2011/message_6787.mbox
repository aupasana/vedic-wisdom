Namaste friends,

As long as one is embodied on earth, senses do their job and sensory 
mind does its job. A yogi who considers each sensory experience as an 
aahuti (oblation) to the agni (fire) of indwelling Self, does not get 
attached to sensory experiences and remains free from attraction and 
aversion for them. Whatever one sees (physically or within the mind!), 
whatever one hears (physically or within the mind), whatever touch one 
feels etc, one considers it a sacred offering to the fire of indwelling 
Self.

Similarly, whatever action one performs, one considers it as an offering 
to the fire of all-pervading Self and remains free from the sense of 
doership.

This is the real internal homam performed by a liberated yogi. This is 
the goal of sadhana.

However, most of us are not able to avoid attraction/aversion for 
various sensory experiences and the sense of doership over actions. One 
needs to purify one's consciousness to free oneself and prepare for this 
internal homam. One can perform an external homam to purify and prepare 
oneself.

*        *        *

When one feels attraction or aversion for something one perceives 
physically or mentally, one can try to take a steo back and consider the 
perception itself to be an offering to the fire of Self or Brahman 
burning brightly inside one (and outside too). When feels pride or shame 
for an action one performed, one can try to take a step back and 
consider the action to be an offering to the fire of Self or Brahman 
burning brightly everywhere. Even a non-liberated person can try to 
alter one's thinking slowly, with practice.

Best regards,
Narasimha
