Namaste all,

For last many days i am chanting "ganapati mool mantra with t=
arpayami at end" 444 times daily. 

I had read about this particular sadhan=
a on net and took it up. Since narsimha has already indicated that all the =
gods are part of your own consciousness i subsituted the external water off=
ering part with some internal visulalization. I was doubtful initially if t=
his is the right way but now i can say for sure it works :) I am nearing th=
e completion of 40 days. 

1. Please suggest me mantras for Laxmi-Narayan a=
nd their source as now i am keen on some mantra for them. Any beej mantra/ =
moola mantra will be perfect.

2. Shreem is beej mantra for narayan. Is the=
re any beej mantra for Narayan.

regards
Saurabh
