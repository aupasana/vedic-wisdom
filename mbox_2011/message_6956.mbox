Dear Hari,

I can share what I am thinking by way of an example.

If someone is trying to lose weight by going to the gym, but insists on
eating every single piece of junk food that they see, they are unlikely to
make much progress. On the other hand, if the same person goes to the gym
*and* changes their eating habits, they are likely to make tremendous
progress.

The point is that we have 24 hours in a day, and all 24 hours count as
sadhana. If you spend an hour doing severe sadhana, and then spend 23 hours
actively undoing it, it is not the sadhana's fault. By all means, develop
the internal agni that helps you burn whatever you throw at it ... but,
reducing the crap that you throw at it is also useful ... and, probably
necessary at the beginning. We need to get to a point where, instead of
eating all the junk food of the world around us, we avert our gaze, or we
merely glance at it without eating it.

I am not making any statements on what homam can and cannot do. All I'm
saying is, if you want to control your anger, well ... maybe you should
*also* actively work on it. There is a split-second before things like anger
overcome us. We are so used to certain patterns of action, that we simply
perform the action without thinking. Sadhana like homam really help you by
giving you that split-second pause. But, at the end of the day, it is still
your choice. You can still choose to lose control, and get angry with a full
sense of doership.

Anyway, these are just some thoughts from another seeker. Group discussion
is good ... as all of us have a lot to learn from each other. Nature has
brought all of us together, through this group, for some reason. Truly, I am
not learned. I have met some learned people, and they are in a different
league.

sasneham,

     ajit
