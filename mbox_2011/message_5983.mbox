 57 It is only the one supreme reality that appears as the three, namely th=
e
world, God and the soul. But asserting this [as a doctrine] is not right
=
awareness. Right awareness is just the death of the ego.

We have seen befo=
re that right awareness =E2=80=93 the experience, in the supreme
state, of =
the real Self as pure consciousness =E2=80=93 is mind-free. Now we learn
th=
at it is also egoless. The natural state is therefore also called the
egole=
ss state.

The next three verses deal with the problem of controversies, wh=
ich abound
so long as the ignorance is not transcended.

58 Indifferent to =
the actual experience of the real Self, the sectarians
affirm their dogmas =
with fanatical vehemence, saying =E2=80=98There is a reality=E2=80=99,
=E2=
=80=98There is none=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It has a form=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It =
is formless=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is one=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is
twofold=
=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98It is neither=E2=80=99.

This is the substance of verse=
 34 of Ulladu Narpadu. All the main creeds are
here briefly enumerated. Amo=
ng these, even the advaitic doctrine is
mentioned, to show that mere adhere=
nce to a doctrine, even though it is
true, is useless. The last creed, =E2=
=80=98It is neither=E2=80=99, seems to be an
intermediate creed between the=
 advaitic and dvaitic, which is to the effect
that the soul is different fr=
om God and yet part of God. These creeds are
possible because of continuing=
 ignorance and an indifference to the quest
for the real Self.

The disputa=
nts resort to logic in order to establish their own creeds as the
true ones=
. But logic is inconclusive. This is stated in the following verse.

59 The=
re is no end to logical discussions, for logic does not come to rest
anywhe=
re. The supreme transcends the world. How can it become known by the
logica=
l mind?
The truth of the supreme state is not within the scope of intellect=
ual
speculation. The sole authority for its nature and means of attainment =
is
the actual experience of it by a sage. Logic can proceed only through fa=
cts
given by worldly experience, which is tainted because its parent is the=

primary ignorance. Until one attains that state by the same experience, on=
e
has to rely on the authority of a competent Guru.

The attitude of the sa=
ge to the diverse creeds is stated next:

60 Since the sage has no creed of=
 his own, he never engages in [useless]
discussions. All creeds are approve=
d by him. He does not [seek to] unsettle
the faith of anyone.
All creeds ar=
e like paths leading to the same goal. So, the sage does not
seek to impose=
 any faith on anybody, but helps everyone to follow the path
that he choose=
s for himself.

It is the sadhana that is of value, not the beliefs. This i=
s explained next.

61 Therefore, the aspirant should, with a mind at peace,=
 cease from hatred
of other faiths and from all disputation, and engage in =
sadhana as taught by
his own faith, intent on winning deliverance.

The nar=
row mind, which causes one to assume that one=E2=80=99s own religion is alo=
ne
true and all others are false, is a defect of character which must be gi=
ven
up if one is to reach the egoless state, for all religions alike are
in=
ferior to that state. The beliefs inculcated are of no value except as
insp=
iring zeal for the practice of the prescribed sadhana.

The earnest aspiran=
t, says Bhagavan, does not need to come to any definite
conclusion on the m=
ost vexed question, which concerns the reality or the
illusory nature of th=
e world, because the main thing is to know the truth of
oneself. The first =
step towards that knowledge is just to cease thinking of
the world altogeth=
er as an obstacle to one=E2=80=99s quest. This is set forth in the
next ver=
se.

62 There are the two [diverse] creeds held, respectively, by those who=
 say
the world is real and those who say it is unreal. The earnest aspirant=
 for
deliverance can win experience of the truth of the Self without taking=
 up a
definite stand on this question.

That this seemingly important quest=
ion can be by-passed by one who is intent
on becoming free is explained nex=
t.

63 All creatures alike want [perfect] happiness that is unmixed with
su=
ffering and which will last forever. [This is not wrong because] happiness
=
is the real nature of all creatures. So one should enquire where such
happi=
ness can be had.

That happiness is the very nature of the Self is the grea=
t discovery made by
all the sages. In the =E2=80=98Bhrigu Valli=E2=80=99 of=
 the Taittiriya Upanishad it is said
that as a result of this quest for the=
 truth he realised this truth, that
the supreme reality, the Self, is bliss=
. He also knew at the same time that
bliss is the source of all living crea=
tures, their support during life, and
the goal they have to come back to in=
 the end. Bhagavan also used to say in
answer to the question =E2=80=98How =
to become free?=E2=80=99: =E2=80=98Go back to the source, out of
which you =
came forth.=E2=80=99

Where then is that perfect happiness?

64 To the seek=
er of deliverance who has perfect non-attachment, Bhagavan
tells in what st=
ate that happiness dwells and by what means it can be won.

65 The state of=
 deep sleep is dear to all creatures, and it is dear because
it is happy. B=
ut in that state there are no objects of enjoyment! What can
be the source =
of this sleep-happiness?

It is supposed by all people that happiness consi=
sts of a series of
pleasures that come by the contact of external objects t=
hrough the senses.
But deep, dreamless sleep is a state of happiness, thoug=
h there are no
objects of enjoyment therein. Everyone describes his sleep e=
xperience thus,
=E2=80=98I slept happily, but I knew nothing then=E2=80=99.=
 So this poses a question, rarely
asked, =E2=80=98What is the cause or sour=
ce of this happiness?=E2=80=99 That this question
needs to be posed and an =
answer obtained we learn for the first time from
the Guru-sage. Only he can=
 give us the answer, which is set forth in the
next three verses.

66 Deep =
sleep and the supreme state are similar; in both the mind and the
world are=
 absent. But in both the mind and the world there is the eternal
reality, t=
he real Self. It therefore follows that [the Self] is the cause of
the happ=
iness in both of these states.

Human intelligence cannot give this answer,=
 but when this fact is revealed
by the Guru, it is at once seen to be true.=
 That the Self does not cease to
exist, but is present in deep sleep, as in=
 the other states, is undeniable,
because, as Bhagavan has pointed out, exc=
epting the highly sophisticated but
purblind scientists, no one is able to =
say that he did not exist in sleep.
This will be dealt with in detail later=
. So, we learn that the real Self,
the supreme state, is the source of slee=
p-happiness.

It is next revealed that this happiness of the Self is infini=
te, whereas the
happiness of sleep is nothing when compared to it.

67 The =
happiness of sleep is fitful and meagre, because the mind survives
there in=
 seed form. In the supreme state there is infinite bliss, known as
ananda i=
n the vedantic lore.

The happiness of the mind-free state is perfect. That=
 of sleep is not to be
compared to it. To distinguish it from the pleasures=
 of worldly life, it is
named ananda in the Upanishads.

It is next shown t=
hat even worldly enjoyment, though seemingly coming by the
contact with obj=
ects, really has its source in this happiness-nature of the
Self.

68 Only =
by receiving a minute fraction of that supreme happiness do all the
creatur=
es enjoy life in this abode of the souls. If this source of happiness
were =
not present, who would care to live in this world for even half a
moment?

=
This is what is revealed in the =E2=80=98Ananda Valli=E2=80=99 of the Taitt=
iriya Upanishad,
and all the sages have confirmed this fact.

What then is =
the conclusion? Bhagavan, the Guru, gives the answer:

69 Hence it follows =
that to all alike the dearest of all things is the real
Self that shines in=
 the supreme state as pure bliss. Therefore, to all
creatures alike the mos=
t beloved of all is that supreme state, and nothing
else.

Since it is the =
happiness of deep sleep that all people love, not the state
itself, and sin=
ce that happiness has its source in the real Self of the
egoless state, it =
would be right to conclude that what they really love is
that Self, and the=
 state in which its true nature is included, though only
unknowingly. This =
is exactly what the Sage Yajnavalkya told his wise wife,
Maitreyi, in this =
passage: =E2=80=98Not for the sake of the husband is the husband
dear, but =
for the sake of the Self is the husband dear; nor for the sake of
the wife =
is the wife dear, but for the sake of the Self is the wife dear.=E2=80=99
A=
nd on to the end of the passage: =E2=80=98Not for the sake of anything is t=
hat
thing dear, but for the sake of the Self is anything dear.=E2=80=99

It=
 is due to ignorance of the Self that the love that we bear for the Self
is=
 mistakenly interpreted as love for something or other. So the problem of
f=
inding real happiness and escaping from suffering is solved only by
becomin=
g aware of the Self as it really is. The teaching is proved by the
next pas=
sage that concludes with the declaration that the Self is all that
there is=
.

If this teaching is accepted, what then is the use of the enquiry about =
the
reality or unreality of the world?

70 For the aspirant who has thus le=
arned from the sage-Guru that the supreme
state is the home of eternal happ=
iness, and who is therefore indifferent to
this world and intent on =E2=80=
=98winning=E2=80=99 that State, what is the use of any
enquiry concerning t=
he world?

That is explained next.

71 Let the world be real or otherwise. =
What is there in it for this aspirant
to strive for? And let the reality in=
 the supreme state be non-dual or
otherwise. It is That alone that he wants=
 to win, naught else.

The two questions, one concerning the reality of the=
 world, the other
concerning the non-duality of the real Self, are really o=
ne. Both questions
become superfluous for one who has resolved to strive fo=
r that state.

There is also another reason for this.

72 Only by becoming =
firmly established in the real Self of that supreme
state can one know defi=
nitely whether that reality is non-dual or not. How
can anyone become aware=
 of that truth while still wandering confusedly in
the three states?

Bhaga=
van gives the following analogy to impress this fact.

73 Just as it is pro=
per to throw away the heap of shorn hair without
scrutinising it, so it is =
right for the aspirant to turn away from the
world, which [for him] is of n=
o value, without enquiry concerning it.

74 The aspirant will naturally tur=
n away from the world at once and, with
his mind turned inwards, will striv=
e for the goal. It is by turning the mind
away from the world that the ques=
t is made, and for that reason the world is
certainly to be renounced.

The=
 quest taught by the Master implies turning away from the world. The mind
h=
as to be turned inwards towards the Self because it dwells within. But this=

has been said for the fully ripe aspirant who is not attached to the world=
.
For those who are not yet ripe for the quest, this enquiry is not useless=
,
as will be seen presently.

75 But those who have not the needed strength=
 of nonattachment, believing,
as they do, that the world is real in its own=
 right, cannot turn the mind
inwards for the quest; so, for them, this enqu=
iry is surely needful.

76 These, by making the enquiry on the lines indica=
ted by the Master, would
become convinced that the world is not real in its=
 own right. Then, by
reflecting on this truth, they will become able, by de=
grees, to turn their
minds inwards.

This knowledge is therefore not a mere=
 luxury of speculative philosophy, but
is of practical value, as shown here=
. The necessity for guidance by the
Master in making this inquest on the wo=
rld is next explained.

77 An enquiry conducted on the basis of worldly exp=
erience [alone], by
reliance on one=E2=80=99s own [unaided] intelligence, i=
s vain. One should resort to
a Guru who is a sage and make this inquest on =
the world as guided by him.

No enquiry can be made in a vacuum, but only o=
n the basis of reliable
evidence. Speculative philosophers, as in the West,=
 proceed on the false
assumption that worldly experience, the offspring of =
the primary ignorance,
is good enough to be used as evidence for coming to =
a conclusion on a truth
that transcends the world. Also, they believe that =
their intelligence is
equal to the task of making a dispassionate enquiry. =
The knowledge derived
from worldly experience is ignorance. Hence, it canno=
t be used as evidence.
If relied on, it will lead to wrong conclusions. The=
 reason is next given
briefly.

78 All worldly experience is rooted in igno=
rance. It is dream-like; it takes
place in worldliness; it pertains to men =
ignorant [of the real Self]; and it
is false. It is therefore no evidence f=
or the seeker of deliverance in
[this] discrimination between the real and =
the unreal.

It has been explained that the three states of life, waking, d=
ream and
sleep, take place in the profound sleep of ignorance, and hence ev=
en waking
experience is dreamlike. And this enquiry involves disentangling =
the real
from the unreal. Worldly
experience is at best suspect; its realit=
y is itself in question. It is
inseparable from the world, whose reality is=
 in question. It must not
therefore be assumed to be valid evidence. What t=
hen is valid evidence?

 is revealed in the =E2=80=98Ananda Valli=E2=80=99 of the Taittiriya Upanis=
had, and all the sages have confirmed this fact.<br><br>What then is the co=
nclusion? Bhagavan, the Guru, gives the answer:<br><br>69 Hence it follows =
that to all alike the dearest of all things is the real Self that shines in=
 the supreme state as pure bliss. Therefore, to all creatures alike the mos=
t beloved of all is that supreme state, and nothing else.<br>

<br>Since it=
 is the happiness of deep sleep that all people love, not the state itself,=
 and since that happiness has its source in the real Self of the egoless st=
ate, it would be right to conclude that what they really love is that Self,=
 and the state in which its true nature is included, though only unknowingl=
y. This is exactly what the Sage Yajnavalkya told his wise wife, Maitreyi, =
in this passage: =E2=80=98Not for the sake of the husband is the husband de=
ar, but for the sake of the Self is the husband dear; nor for the sake of t=
he wife is the wife dear, but for the sake of the Self is the wife dear.=E2=
=80=99 And on to the end of the passage: =E2=80=98Not for the sake of anyth=
ing is that thing dear, but for the sake of the Self is anything dear.=E2=
=80=99<br>

<br>It is due to ignorance of the Self that the love that we be=
ar for the Self is mistakenly interpreted as love for something or other. S=
o the problem of finding real happiness and escaping from suffering is solv=
ed only by becoming aware of the Self as it really is. The teaching is prov=
ed by the next passage that concludes with the declaration that the Self is=
 all that there is.<br>

<br>If this teaching is accepted, what then is the=
 use of the enquiry about the reality or unreality of the world?<br><br>70 =
For the aspirant who has thus learned from the sage-Guru that the supreme s=
tate is the home of eternal happiness, and who is therefore indifferent to =
this world and intent on =E2=80=98winning=E2=80=99 that State, what is the =
use of any enquiry concerning the world?<br>

<br>That is explained next.<b=
r><br>71 Let the world be real or otherwise. What is there in it for this a=
spirant to strive for? And let the reality in the supreme state be non-dual=
 or otherwise. It is That alone that he wants to win, naught else.<br>

<br=
>The two questions, one concerning the reality of the world, the other conc=
erning the non-duality of the real Self, are really one. Both questions bec=
ome superfluous for one who has resolved to strive for that state.<br>

<br=
>There is also another reason for this.<br><br>72 Only by becoming firmly e=
stablished in the real Self of that supreme state can one know definitely w=
hether that reality is non-dual or not. How can anyone become aware of that=
 truth while still wandering confusedly in the three states?<br>

<br>Bhaga=
van gives the following analogy to impress this fact.<br><br><span style=3D=
"font-weight:bold">73 Just as it is proper to throw away the heap of shorn =
hair without scrutinising it, so it is right for the aspirant to turn away =
from the world, which [for him] is of no value, without enquiry concerning =
it.</span><br>

<br>74 The aspirant will naturally turn away from the world=
 at once and, with his mind turned inwards, will strive for the goal. It is=
 by turning the mind away from the world that the quest is made, and for th=
at reason the world is certainly to be renounced.<br>

<br>The quest taught=
 by the Master implies turning away from the world. The mind has to be turn=
ed inwards towards the Self because it dwells within. But this has been sai=
d for the fully ripe aspirant who is not attached to the world. For those w=
ho are not yet ripe for the quest, this enquiry is not useless, as will be =
seen presently.<br>

<br>75 But those who have not the needed strength of n=
onattachment, believing, as they do, that the world is real in its own righ=
t, cannot turn the mind inwards for the quest; so, for them, this enquiry i=
s surely needful.<br>

<br>76 These, by making the enquiry on the lines ind=
icated by the Master, would become convinced that the world is not real in =
its own right. Then, by reflecting on this truth, they will become able, by=
 degrees, to turn their minds inwards.<br>

<br>This knowledge is therefore=
 not a mere luxury of speculative philosophy, but is of practical value, as=
 shown here. The necessity for guidance by the Master in making this inques=
t on the world is next explained.<br><br>

77 An enquiry conducted on the b=
asis of worldly experience [alone], by reliance on one=E2=80=99s own [unaid=
ed] intelligence, is vain. One should resort to a Guru who is a sage and ma=
ke this inquest on the world as guided by him.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font=
-weight:bold">No enquiry can be made in a vacuum, but only on the basis of =
reliable evidence. Speculative philosophers, as in the West, proceed on the=
 false assumption that worldly experience, the offspring of the primary ign=
orance, is good enough to be used as evidence for coming to a conclusion on=
 a truth that transcends the world. Also, they believe that their intellige=
nce is equal to the task of making a dispassionate enquiry. The knowledge d=
erived from worldly experience is ignorance. Hence, it cannot be used as ev=
idence. If relied on, it will lead to wrong conclusions.</span>=C2=A0The re=
ason is next given briefly.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">78 Al=
l worldly experience is rooted in ignorance. It is dream-like; it takes pla=
ce in worldliness; it pertains to men ignorant [of the real Self]; and it i=
s false. It is therefore no evidence for the seeker of deliverance in [this=
] discrimination between the real and the unreal.</span><br>

<br>It has be=
en explained that the three states of life, waking, dream and sleep, take p=
lace in the profound sleep of ignorance, and hence even waking experience i=
s dreamlike. And this enquiry involves disentangling the real from the unre=
al. Worldly<br>

experience is at best suspect; its reality is itself in qu=
estion. It is inseparable from the world, whose reality is in question. It =
must not therefore be assumed to be valid evidence. What then is valid evid=
ence?<br><br>
