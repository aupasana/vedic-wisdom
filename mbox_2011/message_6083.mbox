Namaskaaram Hari,

Long time No see (I mean hear):)

Just finished Homam. F=
ull Dry coconut was offered as Purnahuti as usual. I just offer it without =
any other offerings and without cutting it. It was burning so breathtakingl=
y! Inexpressible!

I suppose your suggestions of cutting it etc...has some =
meaning to it.
Let us know if there is something more subtle in this.

Warm=
 Regards,

Utpal
