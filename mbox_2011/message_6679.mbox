Namaste,

I have seen people who talks about moksham. There are stories in =
which people try to attain it in different ways. I still did not understand=
 the concept of moksham. If it is a state of being, what is that state? Is =
that state defined any where in Puranas ? Who found it and being a human wh=
y I have to go for it?

Thanks
Viswanath
