One should qualify himself with sadhana-chatushtaya before entering into sa=
nnyasa. He must be above the tricks and bondages of samsara. He should deve=
lop dispassion towards objects which he sees or hears. He must be encircled=
 by the fence of dispassion from all sides. As soon as disgust arises in th=
e mind for all objects of the world, then one should take to sannyasa witho=
ut any further hesitation. A passionate man should not take sannyasa. A per=
son who takes sannyasa even when he is being overpowered by passion, goes t=
o the regions of darkness and gloom. Whose tongue, genital, stomach and han=
ds are properly disciplined, that man is fit to take sannyasa. A Brahmana s=
hould take to sannyasa even while he is yet a brahmachari=E2=80"without mar=
riage=E2=80"for samsara is essenceless. He should try to seek that Essence =
through renunciation. A man who possesses deep dispassion cannot marry. Wor=
ks and duties are only for the worldly man; not for the man of renunciation=
.

As soon as the supreme truth is ascertained, one should abandon his hous=
e, family, and take up a staff and leave off his sacred thread and the hair=
s on the head.
