Interesting! Wisdom- vedic or otherwise is about pursuit of the truth and n=
ot ideology. If one considers the Veda as the sum of all knowledge, as Vidy=
a- then it is wrong to spend time and effort on defining it. 

The word 'su=
pernatural' in this context is also not an Indian or Vedic concept. In the =
Indian view, everything is Prakriti- the only thing other than Prakriti is =
Shiva. Shiva and Prakriti are essentially two aspects of the same reality- =
so where does 'supernatural' come in to being ? Can we who are part of Prak=
riti even consider anything outside prakriti ?

It is dangerous and un-prod=
uctive to get into definitions- would Vedas be the Vedas of the Vedanta or =
the Vedas as defined by the Gaudiya vaishnava ? Though theoretically the sa=
me, their interpretations are very different. 

These questions may or may =
not help the querier take to spirituality and wisdom- but adding on additio=
nal layers of definition and boxes to fit things into certainly will not he=
lp.
