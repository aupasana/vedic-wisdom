Michael Cremo: I have been called a Vedic creationist. Today, by =
creationist, people generally mean someone who accepts that God, or some ot=
her intelligent being or beings, has something to do with the origin of lif=
e and the universe, with the order and complexity that we observe around us=
. So I accept that. Until fairly recently, when people used the term creati=
onist, they generally meant a Biblical creationist. So although I am a crea=
tionist, my ideas are inspired by my studies in the Vedic literature. There=
fore some people call me a Vedic creationist. I prefer being called a Vedic=
 creationist over being called a Hindu creationist. The word Hindu does not=
 appear in the ancient Sanskrit writings of India. It is a term that came i=
nto use a few hundred years ago.
