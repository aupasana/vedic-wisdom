"The Scriptures of Sanatana Dharma"
A New Video Presentation
With Sri Dharm=
a Pravartaka Acharya

The Vedic scriptures are a vast collection of hundred=
s of sacred Sanskrit texts that constitute the greatest spiritual heritage =
possessed by humanity. The exact nature, contents and purpose of these anci=
ent scriptures, however, remain unnecessarily shrouded in esoteric mystery =
for all too many spiritual seekers. In this incredible talk, Sri Dharma Pra=
vartaka Acharya explains the precise
nature of these powerful texts, uncove=
rs the wisdom contained in them, and reveals aspects of Vedic spirituality =
that have been unknown to almost all followers and teachers of Sanatana Dha=
rma until now. If you can understand the scriptures of Sanatana Dharma, you=
 then possess the very foundation of spiritual realization.
