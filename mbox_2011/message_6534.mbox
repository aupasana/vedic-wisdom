 Translated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai
=

244. After a man has realised the nature of the rope, the trembling caused=

by the
erroneous idea of the snake disappears gradually only and the idea =
of the
snake still
sometimes haunts him when he sees a rope in darkness.

2=
47. In the example already cited, the tenth man, who may have been crying
a=
nd
beating his head in sorrow, stops lamenting on realising that the tenth =
is
not dead;
but the wounds caused by beating his head take a month gradual=
ly to heal.

255. Let the ignorant people of the world perform worldly acti=
ons and desire
to possess wives, children and wealth. I am full of supreme =
bliss. For what
purpose should I engage myself in worldly concerns ?

279. =
The realm of duality, destroyed by knowledge, may still be perceived by
the=

senses, but such perception does not affect illumination. A living rat
can=
not kill a cat;then how can it do so when dead ?

VIII. THE LAMP OF KUTASTH=
A

21. That consciousness which witnesses the interval between the
disappea=
rance and the rise of successive Vrittis and the period when they do
not ex=
ist and which is itself unmodifiable and immutable, is called
Kutastha.

37=
. The Upanishad says that the Self (Atman) thought: =E2=80=98This body with=
 the
organs
cannot live without me=E2=80=99, and so cleaving the centre of =
the skull it entered
into the
body and started experiencing the changeable =
states (e.g., wakeful, dreaming
etc.,).

39. The Self becomes the ego ident=
ifying itself with the body composed of
the five
elements and when the body=
 perishes (once for all) the ego too perishes with
it.
Thus said Yajnavalky=
a to Maitreyi.

40. =E2=80=98This Self is not perishable=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93=
 thus the Shruti differentiates the
Kutastha from
everything else. =E2=80=
=98The Self is associationless=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 such statements sing the
=
everdetached state of Kutastha.

41. The passage which says that the body o=
nly dies and not the Jiva does not
mean
that he is released but only that h=
e transmigrates.

43. A man may be mistaken for the stump of a tree; but th=
e notion of the
stump is destroyed when the man is known to be a man. Simil=
arly, when the
Jiva knows =E2=80=98I am Brahman=E2=80=99, his notion =E2=80=
=98I am Buddhi (the ego-consciousness in
the mind)=E2=80=99 is destroyed.

=
48. The consciousness, the substratum on which the illusion of Chidabhasa
t=
ogether
with the body and the sense organs is superimposed, is known as Kut=
astha in
Vedanta.

57-58. As the support of the unreal world, its nature is=
 existence; as it
cognises all insentient objects, its nature is consciousn=
ess; and as it is
always the object of love,its nature is bliss. It is call=
ed Shiva, the
infinite, being the means of revelation of all objects and be=
ing related to
them as their substratum.

63. When we sleep, our dreams cre=
ate even Jiva and Ishvara. What wonder is
there then that the Great Maya cr=
eates them in the waking state ?

IX. THE LAMP OF MEDITATION

14. After ind=
irectly knowing the one indivisible homogeneous Brahman from
the books on V=
edanta, one should meditate on or think repeatedly =E2=80=98I am
Brahman=E2=
=80=99.

15. Without realising Brahman to be one=E2=80=99s own Self, the ge=
neral knowledge of
Him
derived through the study of the scriptures, viz., =
=E2=80=98Brahman is=E2=80=99, is here
called indirect knowledge, just as ou=
r knowledge of the forms of Vishnu
etc., is called.

16. One may have knowl=
edge of Vishnu from scriptures as having four arms
etc., but if one does no=
t have a vision of Him, he is said to have only
indirect knowledge,inasmuch=
 as he has not seen Him with his eyes.

18. From the scripture a man may ha=
ve a conception of Brahman as existence,
consciousness and bliss but he can=
not have a direct knowledge of Brahman
unless
Brahman is cognised as the in=
ner witness in his own personality.

33. If a person does not realise the S=
elf even after practising till death,
he will surely realise it in a future=
 life when all the obstacles will have
been eliminated.

34. Knowledge will=
 arise either in this birth or the next, says the author
of the
Brahma Sutr=
as. The Shruti also says that there are many who listen to the
teachings
on=
 non-duality and yet do not realise in this life.

35. By virtue of the pra=
ctice of spiritual enquiry in a previous birth,
Vamadeva had realisation ev=
en while in his mother=E2=80=99s womb. Such results are
also seen in the ca=
se of studies.

36. In spite of reading many times a boy may not be able to=
 memorise
something,but sometimes, next morning, without any further study,=
 he
remembers all that he has read.

47. Because of his practice of enquiry=
 such a Yogi enters into the heaven of
the
meritorious and then if he is no=
t freed from desires, he is born again in a
pious and
prosperous family.
