Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Incidents Related To Ramana Maha=
rshi's Mother 
Alagammal's MahaNirvana

  
May 19, 1922 (Dundubhi year and =
Vaisakha month) was her last day; everyone could 
sense the impending end t=
hat day. Yet they had to do whatever was possible in a 
spirit of detachmen=
t leaving the result to the Lord. As long as she was 
conscious, Bhagavan g=
ave her spiritual instructions. When she lost consciousness 
Ganapati Muni
=
and others commenced vedic chants, some others chanted the Rama-nama.

Afte=
r the violent gasps (urdhva-swasa) began, Bhagavan placed his right hand on=
 
her heaving heart and the left one on her head. He looked at her intently=
. The 
day passed that way. Subsequently Bhagavan himself narrated what had=
 happened 
thus:

The latent tendencies and thoughts which are the cause of=
 future births flared 
up. She had just then lost consciousness of the exte=
rnal world. Hence in the 
subtle world her subtle body was witnessing scene=
 after scene of what was to 
happen. By this sequence of experiences, the s=
oul went through the future births 
and travelled towards the highest.

How=
 could she experience this? It was because of the current of Bhagavan's 
sp=
iritual power transmitted by touch that she experienced all within herself,=
 
without having to be born over and over again. There was a battle between=
 her 
soul forces and Bhagavan's spiritual power in which her latent tenden=
cies 
gradually weakened and ultimately got vanquished. Bhagavan actually d=
escribed 
the scenes she witnessed in the subtle state including their inte=
nsity.

The end came peacefully by eight in the night. Among those present,=
 Ganapati and 
Niranjanananda Swami heard a sound indicative of the mother'=
s death.

In this manner, the mother's individuality submerged in Atma, God=
. She attained 
mahanirvana. She had no more births. Due to her son, who wa=
s Arunachala in human 
form, she attained mukti or became established in th=
e Atma.

Mother's body acquired a new brilliance which persisted till the a=
bhisheka on 
the following day As the mother's end was nearing nobody in th=
e ashram ate 
anything that day. After her end, the Maharshi got up, and wi=
th no trace of 
grief said, "We may now eat. There is no pollution." How co=
uld there be any 
pollution when they were in the presence of the Lord in w=
hom the holy lady 
merged? Such a body was a holy shrine in itself. The ash=
ramites had a quiet 
meal.


The entire night passed in the singing of devo=
tional songs. According to 
Manavasi Ramaswamy Iyer, "Bhagavan had no grief=
 whatever. On the other hand, he 
appeared to be relieved like a bird relea=
sed from a cage." These words were 
recorded in his diary. True, why did he=
 have to grieve?

The mother attained the supreme state. Some days after th=
e event somebody 
remarked to the Maharshi, "Mother has passed away." Immed=
iately Bhagavan 
corrected him saying "No, mother has merged, she has becom=
e one."

On another occasion, when the matter of his according mukti to the=
 mother came 
up, Bhagavan said, "Yes my attempt in her case was successful=
. Earlier, in the 
case of Palaniswami I attempted the same. Thinking that =
he had attained the 
ultimate I removed my hand, thereupon he opened his ey=
es. The prana passed 
through the eyes. That is how my attempt at that time=
 failed." On still another 
occasion, Bhagavan said, "Where has mother gone=
? She is here." Hence there need 
be no doubt as to where Alagammal had dep=
arted. The Maharashi meant that she 
merged in Easwara and was with him (as=
 he also was abiding in the atma).

Mother has not passed away. She has mer=
ged. She has become one.

The question as to whether the body was to be cre=
mated or buried came up on the 
very night of mother's expiry.

Bhagavan po=
inted out that according to chapter 13 of Ramana Gita the body of one 
who =
attained mukti was to be buried and not cremated. The disciples decided to =

bury the body. Early next dawn, they carried the body from Skandasramam do=
wn the 
hill to a spot near Paliteertham.

Meanwhile, some relatives from o=
ther places came and though they argued in 
favour of a cremation, they wer=
e overruled. The news of the mother's death 
passed round the town, in spit=
e of every effort to keep it private. As a result, 
numerous people turned =
up at the burial ground.Your text goes here.

A pit was dug below an aswath=
a tree. The body was lowered into it. The pit was 
filled with camphor, vib=
huti, salt and other aromatic materials and later 
covered. The disciples e=
rected a brick samadhi and by some coincidence, a Siva 
linga from Kasi arr=
ived just then. It was placed atop the samadhi and named, 
Matrubhuteswara =
(Mother who was Easwara).

The Swami was watching the proceedings as a mere=
 witness.With the samadhi of the 
mother the son's filial duty ended.

As S=
wami had entreated Arunachala in 1914, the mother was consumed not by the 
=
fire of cremation but by the fire of Jnana .

For the Mahapooja day, Ganapa=
ti Muni wrote six verses entitled Soundaryamba 
shatkam (Six verses on Soun=
daryamba) ? (Soundaryamba has the same meaning as 
Alagamma). This is the s=
ubstance of the verses:

1. In the first quarter of the night of Friday, th=
e ninth day of the dark 
fortnight of Vaisakha month, Dundubhi year

2. Wif=
e of Sundaram born in the exalted lineage of Bharadwaja, Parasara and 
moth=
er of Ramana Maharshi born as an avatara of Guruguha (Subrahmanya) , the 
b=
lessed lady,

3. One devoid of any attachment, one cleansed by bhakti to Si=
va, one whose prana 
was arrested by the touch of Guha (Ramana Maharshi), o=
ne whose tendencies were 
all destroyed that very moment

4. She, Soundarya=
mba, became that Light which can be known only by the Vedantic 
Vakyas, whi=
ch is all-pervasive, and which was known by her son.

5. At that samadhi of=
 Soundaryamba the stream which poured out of the lotus 
palms of Ramana Mah=
arshi became a new teertha, the Aghasamana teertha (the 
teertha which remo=
ves all sins).

6. Glory to the holy mother of sacred Ramana!
Glory to the =
samadhi!
Glory to the linga consecrated by the Maharshi!
Glory to the new A=
ghasamana teertha!

The Maharshi later said something interesting. After he=
r passing away, 
Alagammal's body acquired a new brilliance which persisted=
 till the abhisheka on 
the following
day at the time of samadhi; it disapp=
eared soon after water was poured. Further, 
at the last breath in all case=
s a faint sound emanates. In the mother's case, 
Bhagavan did not notice it=
 but others present did.

Every year, to commemorate the anniversary, pooja=
 is performed to 
Matrubhuteswara. Thousands of devotees from various parts=
 of the world assemble 
to join the observance.
