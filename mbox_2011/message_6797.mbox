Namaste narasimha,

"take a steo back and consider the perception itself to=
 be an offering to the fire of Self"

How exactly to do this?

should we ch=
ant a mantra or something. I think it will be better we use a fixed pattern=
 to offer perception everytime. That will help us identify the perception w=
e can offer.

Kindly suggest some ways

regards
priyank
