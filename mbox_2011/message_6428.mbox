Namaste,
  Most of the ready-made homam/havan samagri sold in market have s=
trong
spices like Clove (laung), Cardamom (elaichi), Bay leaf (Tej patta), =
Black
pepper (kali mirch) etc... They are probably added to preserve
other =
ingredients. and hence IMHO if you can find any shop selling the raw
materi=
al of samagri better buy that and prepare samagri yourselves by
avoiding th=
e above strong spices (they are more suited for preparing a
biryani). (OR) =
avoid the ready-made homam samagri and stick to items such as
murmura/black=
 til/kishmis/nava dhanya/gur (jaggery)/mishri etc...

regards,
-sarma.
