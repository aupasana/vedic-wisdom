The life of Sri Ramakrishna was an extraordinary searchlight under whose il=
lumination one is able to really understand the whole scope of Hindu religi=
on. He was the object-lesson of all the theoretical knowledge given in the =
shastras. He showed by his life what the rishis and Avataras really wanted =
to teach. The books were theories, he was the realization. This man had in =
fifty-one years lived the five thousand years of national spiritual life, a=
nd so raised him self to be an object-lesson for future generations.
