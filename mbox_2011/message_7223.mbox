Namaste Narasimhaji,

Your new verse on Lord Hanuman is beautiful!

Our fam=
ily has moved into a rented apartment in a new city. We have set up the poo=
ja sthaan in one of the rooms. My question is about the deities that we hav=
e placed in our pooja sthaan. For some deities, we have many idols of them =
(like Ganesha in 5 idol forms, 1 form with family, 1 as a Lakshmi-Ganesha f=
orm in coin and one in a picture form) and we have placed them in our pooja=
 sthaan in this house and earlier houses and prayed before them. Now we wis=
h to keep only one form of each deity in our pooja sthaan (as while praying=
 to Lord Ganesha I am tempted to look at/face all the different forms in th=
e pooja pedestal and hence I am not able to maintain focus) Could you pleas=
e suggest if it is fine to do this (that is have only one form in the pooja=
 sthaan)? What should we do with the remaining idols/forms of the same deit=
y? Is it ok to donate them at a nearby temple or immerse them in a nearby r=
iver/ocean? 

Please provide your kind guidance. If it is not right to do t=
his or even think like this, I apologize sincerely. But if it is ok, kindly=
 advise. 

On the same note, I also wanted to ask you if someone gifts an i=
dol/picture of a deity, should we keep them also in the pooja sthaan, and i=
f we do, then it brings us back to the original question of having more tha=
n one idol for each deity. 

Awaiting your view/advise to get more clarity.=


Kind regards,

Manish
