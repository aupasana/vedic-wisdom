Sulabha was a reputed lady sannyasini. She wandered about as a parivrajaki =
or itinerant woman and had a controversy with Raja Janaka. She was a Brahma=
jnani.

Sri Gauri Mataji was a sannyasini. She was the president of the Sar=
adamani Ashram. Sri Durga Mataji is the present president of the ashram. Sh=
e is a graduate.

Sri Omkar-Ishwari was a learned sannyasini. She was a Ved=
antini. She lived in Rishikesh. She had a small group of disciples; some we=
re males, some were females.

Sri Swami Malayalaswami of Vyasa-Ashram, Yerp=
edu, Chittor Dt., has many sannyasini disciples.

The late Swami Poornanand=
a of Sivalaya, Rishikesh, a cultured sannyasin of great reputation, had san=
nyasini disciples.

The daughter of the late Sri Chakravarty of Uttara-Brin=
davan, Almora, has taken sannyasa.

Even ladies born in rich families, like=
 Sri Sushila Mangaldas of Bombay, do not want to marry and want to follow t=
he spiritual path. This clearly shows that there is a sannyasa tendency in =
them.
