Namaste friends,

On twitter, Rajarshi was asking about Krishna's statement in Bhagavad 
Gita that "I am Sama Veda among Vedas".

> @I_am_Rajarshi: The verses of the Sama Veda are all taken from the Rig 
> Veda. Difference being that Sama Veda is to be sung, not chanted.
> @homam108: SamaVeda is also "chanted" with rigid specification on 
> timing & pitch. It sounds closer 2 songs & may hv given rise 2 music. 
> @I_am_Rajarshi: Your views on why Lord Krishna compares Himself to 
> SamaVeda among Vedas?

When Krishna says "I am so and so among so and so", please note that "I" 
stands for "unconditioned Self", which is the *essence* of Creation. 
Also, do not think that X is superior to Y and Z, if Krishna says "I am 
X among XYZ". It means that X is the *essence* of XYZ.

*        *        *

For comparison, take a couple of other things Krishna says. He says "I 
am Om among all sacred mantras". Of course, there are so many powerful 
mantras, like panchakshari, ahstakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, hare 
krishna mahamantra, so many Vedic hymns, so many purana mantras, so many 
beeja mantras etc. But, Om is the *essence* of all mantras. One with 
different kinds of conditioning can use other mantras to overcome 
conditioning. But, once all conditioning is gone, one's unconditioned 
mind is established in the essence, which is represented by the mantra 
Om.

Similarly, Krishna says, "I am japa among yagyas". One with a 
conditioned mind benefits from homas/yagyas performed materially with an 
external fire and overcomes conditioning. But, once one's conditioning 
drops and one become very pure, one's own internal fire is strong and 
japa itself is a yagya. As one meditates with a mantra, all of one's 
thoughts and desires are sacrificed in the internal fire and one is 
established in the divine.

*        *        *

Now, regarding Vedas. The word "R^ik" in Rigveda is from the root "R^ic" 
and means "to praise/extol". The word "yajus" in "Yajurveda" is from the 
root "yaj" and means to sacrifice. The word "sAma" in Samaveda is from 
the root "sama" and means "same, equal, in oneness". The hymns of 
Rigveda extol various aspects of Supreme Self. The hymns of Yajurveda 
describe how to sacrifice conditioning to realize unconditioned Self. 
The hymns of Samaveda describe an experience of various aspects of 
Supreme Self (in oneness). That is why Samaveda is the essence of Veda 
and Krishna says "I am Samaveda among Vedas", just as He said "I am Om 
among mantras".

Best regards,
Narasimha
