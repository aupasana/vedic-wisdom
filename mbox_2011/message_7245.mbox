ve obtained here the gracious pitru devataas, and the
projeny and the wide =
strand of viShNu,they who sit on dharbha/kusha, and
who share the oblations=
 and pressed drink (soma), they come here gladly.
Interpretaion -  viShNu's=
 strands are called vikramaNa (the steps that
viShNu has taken as vaamana a=
vataara in Bali's yaGYna), these steps
cover the entire universe from lowes=
t to the highest realms and places,
pitru devataas who are in those realms =
are being invoked here, i.e. i
invoke the gracious pitru devataas of lower =
to highest of the higher
realms (see 10.015.01), and having obtained them i=
 pray for projeny,
since because of projeny the race is preserved,  and the=
 sacrificial
rites can continue.  pitru devataas, who sit on dharba/kusha (=
pitru
devataas in tarpaNa/shaardha rituals are usually invoked on a layer o=
f
dharba/kusha/sacred grass, since they sit on dharbha grass pitru
devataas=
 are also known as barhishad - barhi meaning dharbha & shad/sad
meaning sit=
) are being invoked are asked to come here gladly, and share
(bhajanta) the=
 oblations (svadhayaa) and soma drinks (sutasya pitvaH).
   napaataM also m=
eans our friend and beloved agni, viShNu also means
yaGYna, svadhayaa can b=
e translated as comfortably, and sutasya as "of a
child", so an alternative=
 interpretation can be as follows -    I invoke
the gracious pitru devataas=
 here and pray them to come along with agni
for this yaGYa/sacrifice (we wi=
ll see the connection of agni and pitru
devataas in the later riks, of-cour=
se agni in one of its forms
(kravyaada) has converted the bygone ones to pi=
tru devataas), also
napaatam means non-destruction, hence this can also be =
translated as -
i invoke the gracious pitru devataas for non-destruction of=
 this yaGYa
(the sacrificial rite of pitru kaarya).  Pitru devataas who sit=
 on
sacrificial grass and who comfortably accept and share the oblations
of=
fered by son (i.e. the performer of this yaGYa - the pitru kaarya) are
aske=
d to come here gladly for this ritual.
