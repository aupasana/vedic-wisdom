5-6. Always one hesitates as regards the instinctiv=
e actions of the
unregenerate; one never refers to what may compromise othe=
rs, but attends to
their righteous deeds. One does gentle deeds that pain n=
one; always dreads
sin and avoids all forms of sense-gratification.

7. Suc=
h a one=E2=80=99s speech is informed by affection and love; it is lovely an=
d
fit, with due regard to time and place.

8. With proper thought, act and =
speech, one waits upon the virtuous. Getting
them from all conceivable sour=
ces, one studies the Shastras.

9-10(a). Then one attains the first stage o=
f Yoga. Whoever entertains such
thoughts as regards the crossing of transmi=
gratory life is said to have
attained a state of Yoga. The rest are said to=
 be just =E2=80=98noble=E2=80=99 (arya).

10(b)-11. Coming to the next stag=
e of Yoga, called =E2=80=98Analysis=E2=80=99 (vichara), the
sadhaka resorts=
 to the foremost scholars, well-known for their serious
interpretations of =
Sruti and Smriti, good conduct, fixed attention,
contemplation and activiti=
es.

18. As a result of his meritorious actions, the righteous (sadhaka) pa=
sses
his time in the delights of detachment, repeatedly studying the positi=
ve
Shastras.

23. =E2=80=98Enjoyments and non-enjoyments are dread diseases=
; possessions are great
disasters. All contacts just promote separation. Su=
fferings are diseases of
thoughts=E2=80=99.

27. The first stage that occur=
s is sweet on account of the satisfaction and
joy (that attend it). The sad=
haka (puman) has just stepped into the sequence
of states. The first is an =
ambrosial sprout.

28. The first stage is the internal, cleansed, birth-pla=
ce of the other
stages. Thence one attains the second and third stages.

29=
. Among these, the all-pervading third (stage) is superior. Here the
sadhak=
a has outgrown all proneness to imagine (and get ensnared).

30. Those who =
reach the fourth (stage) after the dwindling of nescience
through the exerc=
ises of the three stages look on all things with the same
eye.

31. When no=
n-duality is established and duality dissolved, those who have
reached the =
fourth stage look upon the phenomenal world as a dream.

32. The first thre=
e states are said to be the waking state; the fourth is
called the dream st=
ate. And the mind dissolves like the fragments of an
autumnal cloud.

34. R=
eaching the fifth stage called =E2=80=98deep sleep=E2=80=99, the sadhaka re=
mains as
pure non-dual being, all particulars having completely vanished.

=
35. Having reached the fifth stage, one stays consolidated in deep sleep,
j=
oyful, inwardly awake, all dual appearances gone.

36. Looking inwards, eve=
n when attending to outer things, he appears always
indrawn, being extremel=
y exhausted.

37. Practising in this fifth stage, free from all innate impu=
lses, one
reaches, as a matter of course, the sixth stage named =E2=80=98th=
e Fourth=E2=80=99.

38. Where there is neither the non-existent nor the exi=
stent, neither the
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 nor the non-=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, wit=
h all analytic thinking gone, one stays alone,
totally fearless, in non-dua=
lity.

40. Having dwelt in the sixth stage, he shall reach the seventh. The=
 state
of disembodied liberation is called the seventh stage of Yoga.

47-4=
8. Therefore, thou sinless one, renouncing everything, be devoted to
Truth.=
 Think: I am Brahman, solid Intelligence and Bliss, free from
impurity, hol=
y, lifted above mind and words, beyond the darkness of
ignorance, beyond al=
l appearances. This is the secret doctrine.
