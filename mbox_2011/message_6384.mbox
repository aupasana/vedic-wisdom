Hi Prasad, 

I agree if a person has a strong desire then by all means have=
 that desire. work for it.

We all think that we are thinking our individua=
l thoughts, we develp our desires and perspective in life thinking that its=
 our individuality. but to be very very frank a persons pschylogy itself, t=
houghts itself, desires itself are all governed by this chart. We have free=
 will/choice in terms of how to go about achieving those desires.

Yes by a=
ll means go for highest material benefits, but in a balanced and sustained =
way.

The way to to that will be to start sincere prayers to ganapati and d=
urga. The reason i told ganapati is that he gives results very quickly, rem=
oves all obstacles, takes care of material and spiritual benefits. Durga's =
fierece energy will help you streamline and maximise the rahu's effects on =
you.

In case you are really focussed and charged up do a short homam to ga=
napati and durga morning and evening. all the best.

regards
priyank
