Hi Priya,

All these news items are not worthy of any attention whatsoever.=
 Please do
not mix supernatural in spirituality. This deadly combination ha=
s done
tremendous harm to us. Not only it takes people away from yearning t=
o learn
authentic spirituality, it also promotes our religion as consisting=
 of just
allures of miracles.

Remember Fall of Somnath when somebody talks=
 such stuff. It is said that
when Ghajni attacked, people were so confident=
 that the temple idol will
save them from destruction, that they did not ev=
en stand up to fight. What
happened is terrible history.

That is just one =
example of the trouble which we can face if we promote
supernatural part of=
 spirituality.

Regards
Puneet
