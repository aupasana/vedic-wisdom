Dear Nagraj,
> But I am not able to control my anger at all!


IMO, homam d=
oes not *directly* help you control your vices. It is a
wonderful supplemen=
t, but you need to actively work on other things as well.
In sandhyAvandana=
m, one of the things we do is say "kAmo.akArShIt.
manyurakArShIt". (Desire =
did it ... Anger did it). We say this exactly once
in atonement of sins. Li=
ke many things in sandhyAvandana, this is a
"technique" that you can use. S=
aying it once, 10 times or 100 times in a row
during sandhyAvandana is of l=
imited use. In fact, it is practically useless.
But, there is a way to make=
 it extremely useful. Try saying it every time
after you realize that anger=
 controlled you. Then, after some time, try
saying it while you are mad. Th=
en, after some time, try saying it just
before you get mad. Using it this w=
ay, by saying this mantra 10 times
throughout the day is more useful than s=
aying it 100 times in a row each
morning. Just my 2 cents.

Sometimes I won=
der if I should just keep quiet instead of posting. Most of
us are beginner=
s working on the same problems :-)

sasneham,

   ajit

 there are blessings of some great saints/yogis behind this. When we did Sh=
ata Chandi homam at Chennai in March 2006, we casually selected a muhurta f=
or the sankalpa of the week-long ritual, so that maha-poornahuti happens on=
 an Ashtami day. It was during this week that Manish received a command fro=
m the divine Mother to spread homam. When I and Manish took the sankalpa at=
 the temple on the first day, it was Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's lunar bi=
rthday and it was within 5 min from the exact time when the angle between S=
un and Moon matched that at his birth. When I started daily homam about 5-6=
 months later, as a precursor to publishing the manuals a few months later,=
 there was another coincidence. It was exactly 120 lunar years since Ramakr=
ishna left his physical body. Moreover, I had a vision of Ramakrishna Param=
ahamsa a day before Manish had the vision of divine Mother, during that
 we=
ek of Shata Chandi at the Kali temple in Chennai. I am not attached to form=
s and I rarely get visions.</font></div>

<font color=3D"#000000" size=3D"2" face=3D"Verdana">Several months before t=
hat, in late 2005, I had an interesting dream that actually felt real (i.e.=
 not like a dream). In the dream, there was a strong and pleasant naad (buz=
z) that used to accompany my Kundalini rises through sushumna during those =
days. It was dark and there was a huge fire. I was sitting in front of the =
fire. A person with a powerful persona, whom I had never seen before, sat i=
n front of me. He was teaching me some yoga involving fire and what yoga me=
ans etc. He taught several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed into Man=
ish. Then shakti came down, naad stopped, "dream" ended, and I wa=
s aware of my body lying on bed. The face of the person I saw was vivid in =
my mind. I did not know who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish a week=
 or two later. He said he did not know who it was, but asked me a week late=
r to check out the photo of a specific yogi. When I did a search on the
 in=
ternet, I found a photo (apparently the only photo available of that yogi).=
 It looked very close to what I saw in my dream, except that the person in =
my dream seemed like a slightly younger version of that photo. This was a f=
amous yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never seen his =
photo before that or read much about that lineage or their teachings, his c=
oming in my dream was strange. Also, teaching me some yoga involving fire w=
as strange, because homam movement did not start then and I was not thinkin=
g of fire or fire ritual at all.</font></div>
