You are also that undivided Brahman. This very moment you can realize it, i=
f you think yourself truly and absolutely to be so. It is all mere want of =
direct perception.... Being again and again entangled in the intricate maze=
 of delusion and hard hit by sorrows and afflictions, the eye will turn of =
itself to one's own real nature, the Inner Self. It is owing to the presenc=
e of this desire for bliss in the heart, that man, getting hard shocks, one=
 after another, turns his eye inwards=E2=80"to his own Self. A time is sure=
 to come to everyone, without exception, when he will do so; to one it may =
be in this life, to another after thousands of incarnations.
