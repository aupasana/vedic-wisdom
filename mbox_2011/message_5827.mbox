Namaste, 

Is there anything to substitute the beetel leaves in Satya Naray=
ana Vratam? In the US, sometimes they are not available unless arrangements=
 are made well in advance. Tomorrow is Pournimasya and we intended to do th=
e Satyanarayana Vratam and we are having difficulty in procuring the beetel=
 leaves. 

Nagraj
