Hello Utpal,

"Supari is Symbolical of our false Ego and Pride. =

After reading your advise=
 as to watch out after offering supari, i am a puzzeled. It will be nice if=
 you can substantiate your statement.

Doing homam for gods will bring only=
 good. All prevading god is not waiting for a chance to break your ego. He =
will guide you by providing better sense of dicrimination and wisdom. 

As =
per my limited knowledge.
Betel leaves and betel nuts are good for digestio=
n and thats why we offer it to god also in the Shodasha Upachara after Naiv=
edyam offering as we want God to feel comfortable after eating.

I think at=
 best it should improve one's digestion. Supari is considered auspious othe=
rwise also.

Would request Narasimha to guide us on this. I am sure lot of =
people would like to know substance we can offer in homam and their possibl=
e benefits.

regards,
Akshaya
