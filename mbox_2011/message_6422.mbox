In Defense of Reality

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

When did we lose t=
he final memory of our sustaining Reality?  At what point did we relinquish=
 our understanding of the Eternal Natural Way?  When did we lose our precio=
us connection to Dharma? 

Was it when all the ancient sacred temples of th=
e past became the archeological ruins of today?  Was it when the medicinal =
arts, consisting of healing herbs and plants, was replaced by the synthetic=
 poisons we now call pharmaceuticals?  Was it when animals went from being =
our beloved companions to becoming our tortured food?  Was it when good con=
duct and ethical behavior ceased to be a universal value and became, instea=
d, merely a matter of subjective opinion?  Was it when nature was no longer=
 seen as a manifestation of God's loving abundance, but instead seen as a l=
ifeless commodity?  Was it when the gods ceased to be beings whom we could =
speak with face-to-face, and instead became the subject of "myth".  Was it =
when the bliss of love was replaced by the orgiastic carnival of lust?  Was=
 it when works of art stopped being manifestations of beauty and meaning, a=
nd became instead exhibitions of narcissistic psychosis on canvas?  Was it =
when we lost the innate human ability to use philosophical discernment and =
reason, and instead began using our amorphous feelings to make important li=
fe decisions?  Was it when we sacrificed natural diversity, hierarchy, soci=
al sophistication, qualitative depth and personhood upon the altar of artif=
icially imposed conformity and radical egalitarianism?  Was it when we aban=
doned our innate necessity for the expansiveness of freedom and liberty, an=
d submitted instead to the ever-intrusive shackles of the welfare state?  W=
as it when the study of the history of religion eclipsed the impetus to mak=
e religious history?  Was is when we began to worship dog more than we wors=
hip God?  Was it when the uninformed opinions of worthless celebrities beca=
me more authoritative sources of truth for us than the sacred teachings of =
the liberated sages?  Was it when we merely settled for mediocrity, rather =
than strove for the very greatest that the cosmos has to offer?  When did R=
eality recede from our vision, and reality television take its place? 

We =
can once again reestablish our cherished connection with Dharma, with a way=
 of living that leads to health, joy, abundance, meaning and spiritual fulf=
illment for ourselves and for all sentient beings.  We can heal ourselves a=
nd our Earth by once again relearning and reclaiming the Eternal Natural Wa=
y.  Begin now.
