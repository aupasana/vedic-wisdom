A Guru is absolutely necessary for every aspirant in the spiritual path. It=
 is only the Guru who will find out your defects. The nature of egoism is s=
uch that you will not be able to find out your own defects. Just as a man c=
annot see his back, so also he cannot see his own errors. He must live unde=
r a Guru for the eradication of his evil qualities and defects.

The aspira=
nt who is under the guidance of a Master or Guru is safe from being led ast=
ray. Satsanga or association with the Guru is an armour and fortress to gua=
rd you against all temptations and unfavourable forces of the material worl=
d.

Cases of those who had attained perfection without study under any Guru=
 should not be cited as authority against the necessity of a Guru; for, suc=
h great men are the anomalies of spiritual life, and not the common normali=
ty. They come into existence as spiritual masters as a result of the intens=
e service, study, and meditation practised in previous births. They had alr=
eady studied under the Guru. The present birth is only its continuative spi=
ritual effect. Hence, the importance of the Guru is not lessened thereby.
