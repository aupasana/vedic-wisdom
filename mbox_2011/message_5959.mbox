The above=
 lighter quote is actually a practical worry which many aspirants harbour a=
nd rightly so. I am inspired to write my story in this regard. Hoping that =
it can inspire somebody on the list and removes mainly the fear factor.<br>=


<br>
***<br>
about 2.5 years back, Narasimha wrote to me this: "Do w=
hatever compromises, but 20 minutues Homam every day is a must. find out wa=
ys to do that". I remember different fears i was having in my mind. I =
was then staying as a paying guest with a family. though i had a separte ro=
om, i was not sure if they would allow me to do something related to fire. =
that was the main worry. then there was self doubt concerning my ability to=
 perform Homam but I decided to perform and did the first Homam which was M=
aha Ganapati homam on 1st day of Ashwin Navaraatri. I remember that i took =
me around 2.5 hours total including all the preparation after that rest of =
the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homams. each Chandi homam took around 4 hour=
s. I remember that on the Ashtami day, some of My colleagues with family ca=
me to see my chandi Homam and they told me that the smoke was even visible =
in the ground floor (The Apartment i was staying was on 4th) and there were=
 nice smell every where. The interesting thing is that Old lady of the fami=
ly actually co-operated with me. she used to help me in cutting Dray coconu=
t in to small peices with knife. I cut my finger on several occasions while=
 cutting coconuts for chandi homam. I used to offer the blood stained cocon=
ut peices in Chandi Homas.<br>

<br>
My all previous fears thus proved abso=
lutely Non-existent. From the very first Homam, It was a smooth ride. I was=
 exahusted after Navaratri and could not continue and there was a break of =
a week or so. Then again i started daily Maha Ganapti Homam while learnt th=
e technic of breaking Dry coconut halves by crushing it with both palms.<br=
>

<br>
After few months, I had to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tr=
ied to search for it. few families rejected when i put the condition of doi=
ng Homam everyday. at last One christian family agreed for that. I paid big=
ger amount but they allowed me to do homam and i continued there for around=
 3 months. during that time i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path eve=
ryday for 1 year.<br>

<br>
after 3 months, i started searching for my own =
separate Rental Apartment because my family was joining me. Again the same =
concern (Prime) is to search for Apartment where there is no obstacle to do=
 Homam. I got a brand new apartment. I observed the flat and finalised the =
dealing. continued Homam every day for 1 year. The whole flat became black.=
 even the Home applicances liem refrigerator etc.. were covered with black =
dust of Homa smoke. clothes in the wardrobe, Openings of Central A/c etc...=
 were all filled with black dust. My whole brand new apartment became dark =
due to the Homam. Smoke particles travelled to my lungs and throat and i st=
arted coughing badly. I suffered with severe Cough for many months and ther=
e was pressure from near ones to stop Homam or atleast perform it once ever=
y week. But there was lot of determination provided by *some power* which i=
 like to call as "Mother".<br>

<br>
After 1 year in that Apartme=
nt, i started serching different place. I searched whole area and was looki=
ng for a apartment which also has Balcony so that My homam goes smoothly wi=
thout nmaking my whole aprtment look black and there are no more complaints=
 from my wife .<br>

I could not get one such perfect place which gives me =
a Blacony and at the same time there are no buidlings in front which can ob=
serve me doing homam in balcony and make a instant complaint to police and/=
or fire Brigade. Balcony was very comfirtable and required option so that i=
 can do it there and smoke handling becomes very easy but at the same time =
it is also that much risky because any road-side person can complain seeing=
 smoke comming out.<br>

Finally i got one aprtment without balcony but wit=
h a special location. When i vacated the previous apartment, the owner'=
e representative was shell-shocked looking at the condition of the apartmen=
t :) He told me over Phone - "Aaap Kya karata tha flat me?". He t=
hen deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the compensation. I happily agree=
d because i knew that it was a great deal instaed of going to police statio=
n.<br>

<br>
In new Apartment (current one), security is very tight. But I =
decided to make an arrangement so that i do not *spoil* condition of the  A=
partment. hence i came out with the Idea of Chimney. (Please see the more p=
ictures in photo section) and started doing Homam. Though the chimney is vi=
sible to neighbours and other flat owners, no body has complained till now.=
 neither to police nor to security personnel. Only once Security person cau=
tiuoned me. I stopped for a few days and started as usual. It is going on t=
ill today. I do not know about tomorrow but i do not worry. becuase after 2=
.5 years of experience, it is more than clear to me that It is not I who is=
 arranging all these but there is Mother behind all these. SHE is making my=
 road clear so that i can perform Homam as i wish.<br>

<br>
***<br>
The mo=
ral of the story is that if you genuinely desire to perform Homam/Havan, th=
en It will be done. No obstacle will stand on your way.<br>
Do not fear. Al=
l the fears will break like Papads once you start walking over them to do h=
omam. i can swear for it!<br>
<br>
No owner will kick you out, No neighbour=
 will call 9-1-1 and even if that happens, there will open a way!<br>
<br>
