Supply and Demand
God-realisation is a question of supply and   demand. Do =
you really want
God? Do you really thirst for His grace? Have you   got rea=
l spiritual
hunger? Only he who thirsts for God will develop real   love. U=
nto him
alone He will reveal his real nature.

Pray fervently like child Pr=
ahlada. Sing like   Mira. Repeat His Name
like Valmiki, Tukaram and Tulasi =
Das. Do Kirtan like   Gauranga. God is
love. Through the cultivation of pur=
e love you can realise   Him
quickly. Have Satsanga with Sadhus, Sannyasins=
 and devotees. This will  
give you Viveka, Vichara and Vairagya, as well a=
s spiritual strength and
peace of mind. By regular Satsanga your mind will =
be saturated with
thoughts   of God, with divine glory, with divine presenc=
e, with
sublime,   soul-awakening spiritual ideals. Thus, only will you be
=
established in the   divine consciousness.
