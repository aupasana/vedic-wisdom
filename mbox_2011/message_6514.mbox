n a thousand brahmacharins, a hundred vanaprasthas and even a crore of grih=
asthas. The Lord has two forms: moving and unmoving. The moving form is the=
 sannyasi and the unmoving is the idol worshipped in temples.=E2=80=9D

 Krishna says to Uddhava: =E2=80=9CI am sannyasa among ashramas.=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=9COnly the man of renunciation with knowledge attains Brahman, and n=
