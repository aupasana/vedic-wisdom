Namaste,

I am cc'ing this mail to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, containing seve=
ral 
people who do homam regularly, without revealing your identity.

1. It=
 is perfectly fine. If one does a one-off homam, leftover materials 
from h=
omam are considered God's prasad and auspicious for consumption by 
oneself=
. If one does regularly, one can add more and use the next day.

2. That's =
fine. Some people discard it at the base of a tree.

[Note for others: Pavi=
tram is a special ring made of darbhas. It is worn 
on the right hand ring =
finger when doing homam. It is left out in the 
manuals to simplify.]

3. Y=
ou can offer ghee, dry coconut pieces, raisins, nuts, grains etc 
with swaa=
haa. It is fine to offer sticks/wood pieces also with swaahaa. 
But the con=
vention is to dip them in ghee and offer (instead of plain 
wood pieces).

=
Wood symbolizes physical body. Ghee symbolizes longevity. Instesad of 
offe=
ring plain wood (akin to dead body), we offer wood with some ghee on 
it.

=
Best regards,
Narasimha
