Since it is difficult to talk about 'sounds' in writing, could you please=

provide some additional clarification? I'm having trouble reconciling the
=
conclusion above with the standard statement "i-cu-ya-shAH tAlavyAH". With
=
the tongue positioned to pronounce "cha", and "ya", the closest variation o=
f
the three options below (to my mouth) is the first option (namely, "shame=
")
rather than the last option (namely, "saturn").

Also, there is a fundam=
ental difference between telugu speakers and
non-telugu speakers for these =
three letters. Non-telugu speakers pronounce
"Sha" (ShaShTi) with the same =
tongue position as the mUrdhanya Ta, which,
IMO is not captured by any of t=
he three options that you presented below.
This follows the statement "Ri-T=
u-ra-ShAH mUrdhanyAH".

> Sanskrit has three s sounds:

Given that you are =
drawing a firm conclusion that I am not able to follow
(yet), can you pleas=
e share the text that you are using as a pramANa?
