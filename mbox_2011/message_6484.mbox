Dear Narasimha and all

   I happened to come across the AGNI book by Fritz=
 Staal which has details of 'Atirathram'. It is great work of 2 volumes aro=
und 700+ pages each, containing great details of the Yajna, but still lacki=
ng full details. The preparation for this is very huge and  equally expensi=
ve , since they start with making vessels and items required as per the spe=
cifications at the site and many involving recitations of specific mantras =
along with it. It made me think
whether it is even possible to make a small=
 Soma Yajna manual which one could do individually, albeit occasionally, li=
ke the various Havir Yajnas or Homa manuals made by Narasimha Manish and ot=
hers! Any ideas or Volunteers?

Thanks
Shashi
