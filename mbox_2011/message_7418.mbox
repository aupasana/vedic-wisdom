Namaste Narasimha garu,

Could you please clear up on the follwoing info:

=
"A few years after this dream, we went to the Kalikambal temple in Chennai =
for a Shata Chandi Homam. At that event, Manish Pandit saw the same eight S=
iddhas who had earlier come in his dream. They were meditating on the premi=
ses of the Kalikambal temple!"

Why did Siddas appear in the premsises of t=
he Kalikambal temple? Are these Siddhas belongs to native or kind of celest=
ial beings. Did they have any message again to pass on to Manish ji? Did Ma=
nishji get chance to speak with them? Have you seen these Siddas?

Out of c=
urio i am asking, Please reply if you feel worth to answer.

Thank you,
Sri=
ni.
