Namaste, 

I dotn know much, all i read about vedic/tantric mantra is follo=
wing.
5) the Vedic and Tantric mantra of Mahaganapathi- when do you say eac=
h of them? Also, what is the special quality of each?
Ans: Tantric mantras =
are usually shorter. Vedic mantras don't generally need a guru. Tantic mant=
ras derive power from aliving guru.
