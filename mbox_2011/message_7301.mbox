Namaste.

One learned person I know gave an example that an acting CEO or a=
cting prime minister does not exist when the real CEO or PM exists. So the =
tarpanam has to be done by the generation that is alive; if father, else so=
n.

At Iskcon, we were taught, "Sarva dharmAn parityajya.." so chanting Har=
eKrsna mahamantra takes care of the other devas / pitrs, etc. Pouring water=
 to the roots takes care of the whole of the plant / tree.

Looks like to e=
ach his / her own.

regards
rAma
