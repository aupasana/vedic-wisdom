Take religion from human society and what will remain? Nothing but a forest=
 of brutes. Sense-happiness is not the goal of humanity. Wisdom is the goal=
 of all life. We find that man enjoys his intellect more than an animal enj=
oys its senses, and we see that man enjoys his spiritual nature even more t=
han his rational nature. So the highest wisdom must be this spiritual knowl=
edge. With this knowledge will come bliss. All these things of this world a=
re but the shadows, the manifestations in the third or fourth degree of the=
 real Knowledge and Bliss.
