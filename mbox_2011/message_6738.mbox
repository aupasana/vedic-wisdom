Dear Anand Ji,

About wood used for Homams: The best ones for good purposes=
 are the milk giving 
tree's wood. (I mean dried ones.). In south mostly wo=
od of Jackfruit tree is 
used and in its absence there is another tree rese=
mbling fruits like that 
of jack fruit but small in size (in south it is ca=
lled small-jack-fruit or 
pivalsa or peja kayi and  I don't know its name i=
n other languages)
 Where as in other circumstances where such wood is not =
accessible then any wood 
can be used which is not of sour taste. 
The oute=
r coverings (shells) of Coconut are also used for creating the base of 
hom=
a and also for carrying agni as it is being one of the part of Kalpavriksha=
 
(coconut tree is also called kalpavruksha on earth as no part of it is wa=
sted) 
it is considered to be pure.

About Sadhanaas or homams on funeral P=
yre: Yes such saddhanaas do exist but they 
are not meant for the common pe=
ople like us.  There is no doubt that such 
sadhanaa is also equally yieldi=
ng as that of the mainstream simple saadhanas or 
homams carried out by nor=
mal people like us, but the challenge is to have mental 
strength to do it =
and most importantly knowing their meanings. It is near to 
impossible for =
people like us to do such saadhanas unless we get some guru who 
is always =
there to protect us. so though being parallel path to that of 
mainstream s=
aadhanas it is not recommended to common people.  And as far as my 
opinion=
 is concerned it is best to not to venture into such saadhanas without 
kno=
wing them properly.

Thanks & Regards,
Chetan

Hi,

Addendum to below explanations.

W=
e can explain meaning of burning diyas as following...

i) it  is one type =
of sewa offered to god.
ii) by burning it in front of god we are asking god=
 to remove the andhakaar or 
tamas that has covered us and show the path of=
 light and take us towards the 
ultimate which is devoid of any gunas and f=
ull of light and self illuminating 
(swayamprakash)
iii) by burning it in f=
ront of god we are asking him to burn all our karmas 
(good bad and all ) a=
nd make us free from bondages of karmas and to take us back 
in him who is =
free from all karma bandhanaas.

so the method and materials used in doing =
it has its own impact on it.

Sesame Seeds and its Oil:-- The quality of (g=
un) sesame Seeds and its oil is 
coolness (sheetal gun).( The sesame seeds =
are used to reduce problems of heat or 
Ushna baadhas) and  the  burning of=
 same (oil) gives coolness to environment and 
to the mind too. hence most =
of the times in temples sesame oil is used for 
burning diyas. It is also h=
elpful if you are trying to do meditation it will 
help in creating a envir=
onment for it.

Ghee -- And in ghee it is only ghee of gaay or cow  should =
be used and in that 
too of one which has its calf alive( nowadays we don't=
 come to know it as we buy 
it from shops so this point cannot be applied b=
ut it is still observed in rural 
areas where people prepare ghee for thems=
elves)
The reason I mentioned this because its only cows ghee is pure and i=
s of satvic 
gun and can give similar fruits if used where as the ghee of f=
emale buffalo 
(bhains) is said to be of gaadh tamas and use of same would =
give similar results 
i.e. yield more tamas.( And so is difference in milk =
too...)

And most importantly it is said that the devatas eat with their dr=
ishti and by 
sensing the fragrance. hence in  appeasing any deity the resp=
ective material 
needs to be used for offering or burning. where as ghee is=
 most widely used in 
homams as comon material the remaining offerings vary=
 as per deity.
  

Thanks & Regards,
Chetan

Shri Ananda Ji,

I understand that Agni is a carrier of i=
nformation (subtlest possible one) to 
the system(read as god/the other/etc=

based on the combinations of th=

 In the case of a candle the fuel is generally paraffin wax (which <br>>=
 is a by-product of petroleum), which is primarily tama-raja predominant
 a=
nd
 <br>> hence it emits tama and raja-tama frequencies. As a result, it=
 also attracts <br>> similar frequencies from the environment. This does=
 not have a beneficial effect <br>> on the immediate environment and is =
least conducive to attract any divine <br>> principle.<br>> <br>> =
Ghee: Clarified butter has a predominance of the sattva component in it and=
 <br>> hence the flame generated by burning it emits sattvik frequencies=
. Due to the <br>> predominance of sattva component in the flame, it att=
racts and emits divine <br>> consciousness and one gets the experience o=
f purity in the environment.<br>> <br>> Sesame seed oil: The frequenc=
