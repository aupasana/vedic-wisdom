Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.' 'The Kingdom of Heav=
en is within you.' Where goest thou to seek for the kingdom of God? asks Je=
sus of Nazareth, when it is there, within you. Cleanse the spirit, and it i=
s there. It is already yours. How can you get what is not yours? It is your=
s by right. You are the heirs of immortality, sons of the Eternal Father.
