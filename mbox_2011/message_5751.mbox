 A discussion in the hall centred on the story of Kulasekhara Alwar, which
=
had appeared in the Vision magazine. During a Harikatha, Kulasekhara
identi=
fying himself so completely with the situation of the story, felt it
his du=
ty as a worshipper of Rama to at once hasten to Lanka and release
Sita. He =
ran to the sea and entered it to cross over to Lanka, when Rama
appeared wi=
th Sita and Lakshmana and showered His grace on him.

This led others in th=
e hall to remark, =E2=80=9CSome Maratha saint also did a
similar thing. He =
leaped up to the roof, I think.=E2=80=9D

Thereupon Sri Bhagavan related th=
e story.

EKANATH WAS WRITING the Ramayana, and when he came to the portion=
 in which
he was graphically describing that Hanuman jumped across the ocea=
n to Lanka,
he so identified himself with his hero Hanuman that unconscious=
ly he leaped
into the air and landed on the roof of his neighbour=E2=80=99s=
 house.This neighbour
had always had a poor opinion of Ekanath,taking him f=
or a humbug and
religious hypocrite. He heard a thud on his roof, and comin=
g out to see what
it was, discovered Ekanath lying down on the roof with a =
cadjan leaf in one
hand and his iron stile in the other. The cadjan leaf ha=
d verses describing
how Hanuman leapt across the sea. This incident proved =
to the neighbour what
a genuine bhakta Ekanath was and he became his discip=
le.

After a pause Bhagavan also related:

=E2=80=9CGod appeared in a dream=
 to Ekanath and asked him to go and repair the tomb
of Jnaneswar. When Ekan=
ath went there accordingly, he found a contractor
ready to do all the work =
and take payment at the end. The contractor opened
a big account in which a=
ll expenses were entered, with the names of all the
workmen and wages paid.=
 Everything went on systematically. When the work of
repairs was completed,=
 the accounts were looked into and the contractor paid
his dues. Then the c=
ontractor and his big account book totally disappeared.
Then alone Ekanath =
came to know that God was his contractor and did the
work. Such things have=
 happened.=E2=80=9D
