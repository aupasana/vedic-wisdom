The Guru is God Himself manifesting in a personal form to guide the aspiran=
t. Grace of God takes the form of the Guru. To see the Guru is to see God. =
The Guru is united with God. He inspires devotion in others. His presence p=
urifies all.
The Guru is verily a link between the individual and the immor=
tal. He is a being who has raised himself from this into That, and thus has=
 free and unhampered access into both the realms. He stands, as it were, up=
on the threshold of immortality; and, bending down he raises the struggling=
 individuals with his one hand, and with the other lifts them up into the e=
mpyrean of everlasting joy and infinite Truth-Consciousness.
