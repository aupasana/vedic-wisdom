Please clear this confusion regarding the sesame seed=

 sapling, theres every chance of thee seeds germinating... is that ok ?
Aga=

the belief or 'aithihyam' behind it ?

doing the tarpanam with sincerity and devotion. 
=C2=A0
Just wondering why =
it is not advisable for the sesame seeds to germinate? I suppose Nature kno=

We do have a mango sapling in our backyard. But if the water and sesame=
 seeds are thrown ot its base isnt there a risk that the seeds may germinat=

Right now I empty the water se=

I put the darba at the base of the mango sapling=
; which is where we put all old puja flowers etc etc. The sapling has grown=
 out of a mango that we got as prasad from Swami, our Guru-God-All.. So its=
 a sort of sacred sapling for us..
There is certainly a feeling of satisfac=
tion and peace after doing tharpana.
Whats more the first day, a Muslim suf=

aughingly complained that I had omitted him ! which I had ! I said I would =
go back home and do it one more time. he said, No; thats fine; tomorrow rem=

Today some others on my husbands side turned up in my mental vision jus=
t at the right time ! So I cd offer them too..
It has been a truly great le=

Thankyou Priya! Thankyou Narasimhagaru !
As scientific =
