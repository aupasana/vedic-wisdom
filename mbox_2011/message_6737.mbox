=C2=A0 
Hi,

Addendum to below explanations.

We =
can explain meaning of burning diyas as following...

i) it=C2=A0 is one ty=
pe of sewa offered to god.
ii) by burning it in front of god we are asking =
god to remove the andhakaar or 
tamas that has covered us and show the path=
 of light and take us towards the 
ultimate which is devoid of any gunas an=
d full of light and self illuminating 
(swayamprakash)
iii) by burning it i=
n front of god we are asking him to burn all our karmas 
(good bad and all =
) and make us free from bondages of karmas and to take us back 
in him who =
is free from all karma bandhanaas.

so the method and materials used in doi=
ng it has its own impact on it.

Sesame Seeds and its Oil:-- The quality of=
 (gun) sesame Seeds and its oil is 
coolness (sheetal gun).( The sesame see=
ds are used to reduce problems of heat or 
Ushna baadhas) and=C2=A0 the bur=
ning of same (oil) gives coolness to environment and 
to the mind too. henc=
e most of the times in temples sesame oil is used for 
burning diyas. It is=
 also helpful if you are trying to do meditation it will 
help in creating =
a environment for it.

Ghee -- And in ghee it is only ghee of gaay or cow=
=C2=A0 should be used and in that 
too of one which has its calf alive( now=
adays we don't come to know it as we buy 
it from shops so this point canno=
t be applied but it is still observed in rural 
areas where people prepare =
ghee for themselves)
The reason I mentioned this because its only cows ghee=
 is pure and is of satvic 
gun and can give similar fruits if used where as=
 the ghee of female buffalo 
(bhains) is said to be of gaadh tamas and use =
of same would give similar results 
i.e. yield more tamas.( And so is diffe=
rence in milk too...)

And most importantly it is said that the devatas eat=
 with their drishti and by 
sensing the fragrance. hence in appeasing any d=
eity the respective material 
needs to be used for offering or burning. whe=
re as ghee is most widely used in 
homams as comon material the remaining o=
fferings vary as per deity.
=C2=A0 

Thanks & Regards,
Chetan=C2=A0

Shri Ananda Ji,

I understand =
