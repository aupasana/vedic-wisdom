Dear Narasimha,

I have a question about the rudram vedic chant. Other than=
 a few
mantras in the beginning and end, the core portion of the rudra
pras=
hna is a simple litany of names ... and there are so many other
lists of 10=
8 / 1008 etc names of various devatas. What is it that
makes this particula=
r list so important / powerful?

bhavadiiyaH,

=A0 =A0ajit
