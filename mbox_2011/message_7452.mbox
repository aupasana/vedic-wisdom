Namaste PVR ji, 

Sir i have a great desire to learn to recite Laxmi naraya=
n Hrudayam. I tried some times but since i dotn know sanskrit after few pag=
es of effort it becomes impossible to read and recite. after completing it =
i feel really sad. 

I tried to search recital audios but the one on prapat=
ti is blurred and one on You tube is in classical singing. There is no othe=
r source at all.

Sir i sincerly request that whenever you are chanting LNH=
 next time, to please record your chanting so that all can benefit. 

regar=
ds
Priyank
