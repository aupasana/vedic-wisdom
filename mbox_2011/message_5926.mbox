Thank your Narasimha 



1. You mentioned "Om Shrim Hrim Aim" Since it cont=
ains 3 beej of 3 aspects of devi is there any need to add any one name of d=
evi after this mantra.



2. I thought mantra had to have a seer before it =
qualifies as being a mantra.

is there any other good source on net for und=
erstanding and knowing mantras by some realized yogi/guru

One source i kno=
w is
"Meditations from the Tantras" by Paramahamsa Swami Satyananda Saraswa=
ti listed at http://www.astrojyoti.com/mantras3.htm



3. I know that vedic=
 mantras / gayatri have to have correct pronunciation. 

a. Is the realisat=
ion of mantra hidden in the way its chanted or was this condition set to ma=
ke sure the words of vedas dont change over hundreds of years and possibly =
lead to different literal meaning?

b. What are your experiences with liste=
ning ghanam of vedic mantras?



4. With my limited meditation background i=
 reach a state where i can see/feel my mind/thoughts. which of 3 options i =
best to stick to.

a. If i remain still and let thought waves pass, it simp=
ly remains clear for some time. mental clarity/peace is result

b. If i cha=
nt "Om" a particular kind of bliss/energy/feeling is result.

c. If i chant=
 any diety mantra, mind like monkey starts to cling on image on god concept=
s/grace related to god.

Thankyou for your guidance Narasimha.

Akshay
