Do you know the parable of the oyster as told by Sri Ramakrishna?  The oyst=
er floats about on the surface of the sea with its  shell wide open, for a =
little drop of the Swati-rain(rain falling when the star Swati or Arcturus =
is in the ascendant).As soon as it gets a rain drop,it dives down to the oc=
ean-bed and there forms a fine pearl.Like the oyster,you too should be up a=
nd doing and then dive deep into the ocean of meditation.        
    You h=
ave no self-reliance.Personal exertion is an indispensable    factor for su=
ccess in the spiritual life.Do something for a period     of atleast four y=
ears.Then if you do not make any tangible progress, 
come and take me to ta=
sk.
