Hi Nagraj,

Same doubt aroused for me. I thought to pause after Ganapati m=
antras before offering Naivedyam (punahpuja) and to jump into Vratha katha(=
Vinayaka chavithi story). Once after completion of it, would like to offer =
Naivedyam and will be carrying on to Uttarangam. 

Happy Vinayaka Chavithi
=

Srini.

again multiple times. So, how about re-using the remaining ghee with some f=
resh ghee mixed together for the next day homam?
