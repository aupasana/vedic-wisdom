Namaste,

I have heard people say that India (and some parts of SE Asia) is the "Karma
Bhoomi", and America is considered a "Bhoga Bhoomi", and as such even nithya
karmas like Oupaasanam performed in the USA are not valid.  Since Oupaasanam
is the basis for many of the sroutha and smatth karmas, those karmas,
inlcuding Deva yajnas and pitru yajnas, are not valid outside of India.  Is
this true?

I am new to this group and I tried my best to search for an answer to the
above but did not find one. There is a lot of good information in this group
from many learned and informed people. I would very much appreciate any
clarificaton that anyone can provide.

Ram
