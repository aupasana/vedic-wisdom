A couple of=
 additional references: Apastamba prescribes a mandatory
samskAra to shiva =
known as "iishAna bali". This is a homa to shiva
with the rudra prashna. Bo=
dhayana prescribes a homa to shiva in the
section "iishAna kalpa". This bes=
tows all desires to the performer. In
South India, mrityunjaya homa is popu=
larly performed according to the
procedure given by the famous sage Shaunak=
a. Many standard samskAras
and shAnti-karmas (like Rtu-shAnti) include Ahut=
is to shiva with the
rudra-sUkta. There is a prescription -- hutvA.aajyam r=
udra-sUktena.

It didn't take long to find these references.

sasneham,
