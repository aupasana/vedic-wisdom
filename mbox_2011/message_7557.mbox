How to Recognize an Authentic Guru - Video
A Dharma Teaching With
Sri Dharm=
a Pravartaka Acharya

Accepting the guidance of a guru - an enlightened, qu=
alified and ethical guide on one's spiritual path - is a foundational neces=
sity in the tradition of Sanatana Dharma. In our present age, however, find=
ing such a rare person has become a tremendous challenge. Indeed, it has be=
en estimated that 95% of individuals who claim to be legitimate gurus, Swam=
is, Acharyas, and enlightened spiritual mentors are not! The precise unders=
tanding, then, of what constitutes a real and authentic guru is crucial for=
 all sincere spiritual seekers if they wish to avoid falling into the trap =
of fake teachers. In this very direct, authoritative and no nonsense talk, =
Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya provides the conclusive criteria necessary to=
 recognize who is - and is not! - an authentic and legitimate guru. Even if=
 you have been on the path of Sanatana Dharma for decades and feel that you=
 already know what a real guru is, prepare to have your understanding radic=
ally expanded! Before surrendering to someone who claims to be a legitimate=
 guru, watch this informative video.
