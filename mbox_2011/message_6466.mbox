The Yogis Shall Lead Us 

by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya


Aum Tat Sat.  =
Vedic India is the spiritual mother of the Earth. She was, at one time at l=
east, the land of yogis, of sages, of philosophers and of saints. Today, sa=
dly, after over 60 years of anti-Vedic, crypto-Marxist misrule, India is no=
w infamous as one of the most corrupt nations in the world. Swami Ramdev ha=
s revived an age-old tradition of wise and selfless yogis leading the way f=
rom the evils of government corruption and despotism, to the re-establishme=
nt of Dharmic governance, and the honesty, prosperity, freedom and justice =
that such Vedic governance ensures. Like Chanakya Pandita, Swami Vivekanand=
a and Srila Prabhupada before him, Swami Ramdev has shown us that, when our=
 politicians have abandoned the people and have all become scoundrels, we a=
re to then look to the yogis for leadership. As the Middle-East has experie=
nced its Democratic Spring with the fall of one long-standing dictator afte=
r another, now the beginning stages have been dramatically set in place for=
 India, Bharat Mata, to have its own Freedom Spring, and to reverse over si=
xty years of crypto-Marxist totalitarian corruption. When the politicians h=
ave become an enemy of the people, the saints will lead us toward the light=
.

There are 20 million yogis in America, and tens of millions in Europe.  =
Yet, sadly, very few Western yogis are even aware of the fact that, until o=
nly recently, Yoga faced the possibility of extinction in India herself - t=
he very birthplace of Yoga.  Almost no Western yogis are aware of the fact =
that since her independence in 1947, most Indian national governments have =
been atheist regimes that were radically dedicated to the eradication of Hi=
nduism, Vedic spirituality, and Yoga practice.  Up until just a decade ago,=
 more people were practicing Yoga in the American state of California than =
in all of India combined!  Sri Swami Ramdev changed all that.  Almost singl=
e-handedly, Swami Ramdev revived Yoga practice in the birthplace of Yoga, e=
ncouraging tens of millions to begin practicing Yoga for the very first tim=
e.  Now he is leading a peaceful social reform movement to remove rampant c=
orruption from despotic government institutions and practices.  For his cou=
rageous efforts, his life is in now danger.  Tens of thousands of peaceful =
yogis and meditators have been violently attacked by government thugs, and =
this selfless servant of truth was temporarily arrested.  His crime was sit=
ting in meditation, fasting, and calling for ethical integrity in governmen=
t.  With his unimaginable arrest and persecution at the hands of a viciousl=
y despotic government, a spark of peaceful outrage has been ignited that ha=
s not been seen in India since the days of Mahatma Gandhi.  Sri Swami Ramde=
v has shown the world the quiet, dignified power of Yoga in action.  He has=
 shown us that Yoga is so much more that merely a series of physical asanas=
, and that Yoga has the power to make our entire world better in every way.=
 

We Western yogis must extend our unwavering support to our brother and s=
ister yogis in India.  We must now translate the peace, joy and wisdom that=
 Yoga has gifted us with in practical terms in our desire for a better worl=
d - a world of freedom, justice and peace for all living beings.  India wil=
l be free.  India will re-embrace her divine heritage of Vedic civilization=
.  The world will taste the bliss of liberation.  The Yogis shall lead the =
way.  Welcome to the Dharma Revolution. A revolution of love.  Aum Shanti S=
hanti Shanti.
