 645 The statement in revelation that prarabdha karma survives is only in
c=
onformity with the view of the ignorant. From their point of view, those
ac=
tions have results, because in their view the sage is embodied.

But this i=
s only in some stray contexts. More emphatically in many places
the Vedanta=
s support the teaching of the sages.

646 The vedantic text, =E2=80=98The p=
leasant and unpleasant effects [of actions] do
not affect the sage, who dwe=
lls bodiless as the Self,=E2=80=99 shows the
unfruitfulness of the actions =
of the sage.

This is also confirmed by the following from the Yoga Vasisht=
am.

647 Even when a sage=E2=80=99s body is cut or burnt, there is no swerv=
ing from his
real nature, just as jaggery [raw, brown sugar] does not lose =
its natural
sweetness even when powdered or boiled over fire.

A practical =
instance of this occurred when Bhagavan, who had cancer of the
left arm, fi=
nally submitted to an extensive operation, which was insisted
upon by the s=
urgeons and doctors sent for by the ashram authorities.
Bhagavan did not ha=
ve any anaesthetic, and the operation lasted for nearly
three hours.If he f=
elt the pain, he did not show it.

Later, when asked about the pain, he quo=
ted the verse from the Yoga
Vasishtam whose meaning has been given above.

=
There were other instances in his life which showed his unlimited power of
=
endurance of pain. The Bhagavad Gita has this line: =E2=80=98Remaining wher=
ein, he
is not shaken [from his natural state] even by great pain.=E2=80=99=


All this would suffice to show that the sage is really bodiless, that he =
is
thus truly asanga, unattached, as the Self is said to be in the Upanisha=
ds.

This raises the question of the apparent distinction between the two k=
inds
of deliverance spoken of: deliverance with the body and deliverance wi=
thout
the body, the former being supposed to be the state in which the body=

continues to live, and the latter after the body=E2=80=99s death. To this =
Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
answer is given in the following verse.

648 In conformi=
ty with the beliefs of the ignorant, two kinds of deliverance
are stated, o=
ne with the body [jivanmukti] and another without the body
[videhamukti]. R=
eally, no free one has a body. All deliverance is bodiless.

What is meant =
is that though the body remains alive, the sage is unattached,
because his =
causal body, which is ignorance, has been destroyed. Without
this, there is=
 nothing to connect the real Self, which the sage is, with the
subtle and t=
he gross bodies.

Now the question of the prarabdha karma is resumed.

649 =
The power of the prarabdha karma extends only to the body; it does not
affe=
ct the Self. Since his body has been surrendered to prarabdha by the
sage, =
how can he be affected by the karma?

650 =E2=80=98The sage, having given o=
ver his body to prarabdha karma, remains in his
own state without the sense=
 of =E2=80=9Cmineness=E2=80=9D in the body.=E2=80=99 Thus, the great Guru
S=
ankara has shown the truth of this in his Manisha Panchakam.

The truth tha=
t the real Self is unattached is further elucidated.

651 If it is said tha=
t the subtle body of the sage survives, [the answer is
that] since the caus=
al body consisting of ignorance has been extinguished,
how can there be att=
achment of the sage [the Self] to the subtle body?

652 Since Brahman is un=
attached, so is the sage, who also appears to be in
samsara, like the sky. =
Hence, the changes in the body and in the mind do not
touch the sage.

653 =
The sage, who is wide-awake in his own natural state [as the Self], is
said=
 to be like one soundly asleep in a carriage. The body is likened to a
carr=
iage, and the ten sense organs are likened to the horses [of the
carriage].=


654 The sleeper in the carriage does not know anything about the going, t=
he
stopping and the unyoking of the horses [of the carriage]. Just so, the =
sage
who is asleep [to the world] in the carriage, the body, does not know =
its
changing conditions.

655 But the sage, being immersed in his natural s=
amadhi, is seen by the
ignorant as if he were doing actions and going throu=
gh various [bodily or
mental] conditions. Seeing these, the undiscriminatin=
g ones are confused.

656 It appears to the ignorant that he has three dist=
inct states, sleep,
samadhi and bodily activities, and the ignorant one thi=
nks that these are
distinct from one another.

657 But the sage is always t=
he same. His state is one of eternal samadhi.
This samadhi [of his] is not =
in any way hindered in the least by actions,
nor are actions hindered in th=
e least by the samadhi.

Samadhi is the state of awareness of the Self alon=
e.

If the sage remains in samadhi all the time, how can actions be perform=
ed?
The answer is given in the verses that follow:

658 There are two thoug=
ht-free samadhis. One is called kevala, the other is
called sahaja [natural=
]. By attaining kevala one does not become a sage. He
alone is a sage who i=
s firmly established in sahaja.

These two are further distinguished and ex=
plained in the verses that follow.

659 The kevala samadhi mentioned here i=
s one that comes to a yogi by the
mind going into latency. For him, it is w=
ell known that there are two
distinct states, samadhi [introvertedness] and=
 coming back [to the common
waking of samsara].

It has been shown before t=
hat mental quiescence is of two kinds: latency and
complete and final extin=
ction, and that the latter alone leads to sagehood.
This makes all the diff=
erence, as shown below.

660 The yogi=E2=80=99s mind, in his samadhi, remai=
ns latent with all its vasanas.
After remaining for a very long time, it is=
 brought out to samsara by a
vasana.

661 When he is thrown out from the sa=
madhi, he resumes samsara just where he
left it, just as an anaesthetised p=
erson [on recovering consciousness]
resumes an activity left unfinished bef=
ore.

This was illustrated by Bhagavan by the story of a yogi. He had awake=
ned
from samadhi and being thirsty asked his disciple to bring water to dri=
nk.
But before the water was brought he again went into samadhi and remaine=
d in
it for about three centuries, during which the Muslim raj came and wen=
t and
was superseded by the British raj. When he awoke, he called out, addr=
essing
his disciple who had long since died, =E2=80=98Have you brought wate=
r?=E2=80=99

662 The yogi, returning in this way to samsara, again enters s=
amadhi with
effort. But the sage, being established in the natural state [s=
ahaja
nirvikalpa samadhi] neither loses it nor gets it back [but remains in=
 it
uninterruptedly].

663 The sage never comes back to samsara. Samadhi is=
 his natural state.
There is no moment when he is without samadhi. Hence it=
 is called sahaja
[natural].

This samadhi is different from the kevala of =
the yogi in that it does not
prevent the sage being seemingly active in the=
 world while remaining in his
samadhi.

664 The sage, remaining uninterrupt=
edly in his natural state of samadhi,
never swerving from it as a jivan muk=
ta, is able to be active in the world,
just as the sages of old such as Sri=
 Sankaracharya did.

665 The yogi, while he is immersed in his kevala samad=
hi, is unable to do
any work. When he comes out of the samadhi, then he doe=
s work, and is
subject to ignorance.

666 The yogi is not equal to the task=
 of teaching the truth of the real Self
[and the sadhana for realising it] =
to disciples. The sage alone, remaining
always, unswervingly, in the suprem=
e state, is perfectly competent to teach
and guide disciples.

667 If this =
sahaja samadhi is not accepted, it will follow that the sacred
books, such =
as the Gita etc. are false. Sacred books are authoritative for
the aspirant=
s to deliverance, since they are filled with the teachings of
sages.

668 I=
t is the succession of sages that preserves the correct tradition of
the sc=
ience of right awareness of the real Self for the benefit of the
aspirants =
to deliverance.

669 The final proof is one=E2=80=99s own experience of the=
 truth, wherein doubts can
no more arise. Until such experience is attained=
, the utterances of the
sages are authority for the aspirants.

The differe=
nce between the two kinds of nirvikalpa [thought-free] samadhis
was explain=
ed by Bhagavan as follows.

670 The sage [who is in sahaja samadhi] is like=
 the river that has joined
the ocean and become merged in it. The yogi in t=
he kevala state is like a
bucket let down into a well by means of a rope ti=
ed to it.

671 The bucket, when drawn up by the rope, comes out of the well=
. Just so
the mind immersed in kevala samadhi is pulled out of it by vasana=
s back to
samsara.

672 Thus it has been shown by the most holy one that th=
e sage in the natural
samadhi has no activity. But though by nature the sag=
e is no actor, yet he
is also a great actor, without being attached [or bou=
nd].

The sage has the whole potency of God in doing his appointed work, an=
d hence
there is no limit to his power, because, being egoless, the divine =
power
works through his subtle and gross bodies.

The great blessing that d=
isciples and devotees of the sage derive from
associating with him is next =
expounded.

673 What is called association with the holy [satsang] is assoc=
iation with a
sage. The term sat [truth, reality] means Brahman, and the sa=
ge is identical
with that.

674 It must not be doubted, =E2=80=98Since all =
alike are Brahman, what is there
special in the sage?=E2=80=99 In others, t=
he real [Brahman] is eclipsed by the ego,
but in the sage Brahman shines in=
 its fullest effulgence.

675 In the company of sages, attachment vanishes,=
 and with attachment,
illusion. Freed from illusion, one attains stability,=
 and thence liberation
while yet alive. Seek therefore the company of sages=
.

676 Not by listening to preachers, nor by study of books, nor by meritor=
ious
deeds nor by any other means can one attain that supreme state, which =
is
attainable only through association with the sages and the clear quest o=
f
the Self.
