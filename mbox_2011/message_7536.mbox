namaste,

give ahutis of coconut pieces at the end or offer more coconut pi=
eces during uttarangam. in purnahuti, you can think of offering "whole Dry =
coconut" which is available in the market. cut the whole coconut in 2 halve=
s (serves 2 purposes -you can check if the cocnut is not rotten from inside=
) & you can then tie up both the halves, with a thread used in holy rituals=
,after filling it with some offerings.

this will surel increase your medit=
ation time to atleast half an hour. if whole dry coconut is not available, =
try to offer 2 dry halves as purnahuti.

one last suggetion, do not worry i=
f fire goes away while meditating. fire actualy still remains in the remain=
s. while meditatinf if you fell that fire is going out, you can mentally re=
quest your deity, remaining still in meditation pose, to come out from fire=
 and idol and get in to your heart. then you will be satisfied that your ri=
tual is completed and can go ahead with mediation as long as you wish witho=
ut worrying about anything else.
