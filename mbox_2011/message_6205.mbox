 481 The devotee or the seeker of the Self who becomes discouraged by the
t=
hought =E2=80=98When shall I attain the natural state?=E2=80=99 hinders pro=
gress on the
path of deliverance by having such a thought.

482 The aspiran=
t for deliverance must be full of enthusiasm, with his mind
in the sattvic =
mood. He should engage in this quest, remembering the
teaching that time is=
 unreal.

483 Always and everywhere there are doorways for getting at the q=
uestion
=E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 By any one of these the seeker must aga=
in and again engage his
mind in this quest.

The nature of the answer to th=
is question is next indicated.

484 The answer to this question is not an i=
ntellectual conclusion. The
correct answer to it is only the experience of =
the real Self. The supreme
state arises on the death of the ego, the questi=
oner who calls himself the
individual self.

485 The real Self will shine a=
s it really is only in the natural,
thought-free state of the Self. In othe=
r states the real Self will not shine
as it really is due to its being mixe=
d up with intellectual views.

Another hindrance to success in the quest is=
 now stated.

486 If the mind thus engaged in the quest becomes unconscious=
 [as in deep
sleep], the effort so far made becomes unfruitful. [So,] the s=
eeker should
awaken the mind from this unconsciousness and again engage it =
in the quest.

What is needed is not unconsciousness of the mind, but its c=
omplete
extinction. This is clearly stated next, and it was also pointed ou=
t in
Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Upadesa Saram.

487 Mental quiescence has been expl=
ained by the Guru as being of two kinds,
as latency in unconsciousness and =
final extinction. In hatha yoga there are
many methods of attaining unconsc=
iousness, such as suspension of the breath.

The difference between these t=
wo is then explained.

488 The mind, when it has gone into latency together=
 with its habits of
activity, will later become active again to produce the=
 worldly life. The
mind that has been extinguished will lose its habits of =
action and thus
becomes like a seed that has been roasted.

As roasted seed=
 does not sprout, so the mind that has become extinct cannot
be reborn agai=
n.

489 Ignorance binds the ignorant one by means of [these] habits. If the=
 mind
remains wide-awake in the quest, then the destruction of these habits=
 will
ensue.

490 Right awareness dawns on the complete extinction of the m=
ind, whereby
all the mental habits also are lost. Deliverance is affirmed b=
y all sages to
be none other than the final and complete destruction of the=
 mental habits.

Apart from latency there is another obstacle, craving for =
sense-pleasures.
This is pointed out next.

491 One should overcome both de=
sire and latency and keep the mind
concentrated in the quest. In the quest =
for the real Self, this is like
balancing on the keen edge of the razor.

T=
he uniqueness of this method, the quest, is next explained.

492 In all the=
 other yogas it is assumed that there is an entity called the
=E2=80=98soul=
=E2=80=99, having defects, namely action and the rest, and the yogi makes
e=
fforts to make himself free from those defects.

493 For eradicating the de=
fect of being an actor, there is the yoga of
action; for getting rid of sep=
arateness [from God] there is the yoga of
devotion; for the cure of the def=
ect of [seeing] differences there is the
yoga of mind-control; and for the =
eradication of ignorance there is the yoga
of right awareness.

These yogas=
 are ridiculed by pointing out the truth of the real Self.

494 While being=
 himself the same as the Supreme Being, the ignorant man,
thinking himself =
to be someone other than He, through delusion tries to
become one with Him =
by various yogas! What else is there more absurd than
this?

The superiorit=
y of the quest is then shown.

495 When, by taking hold of the consciousnes=
s-element of the soul, the quest
is made for the Self, the root of the soul=
, the Self, who is free from all
defects, shines alone; there the soul does=
 not survive.

496 Hence this [quest] is named =E2=80=98the great yoga=E2=
=80=99. There is no other yoga
equal to this, or greater. All the yogas are=
 included in it, and may be used
as auxiliaries to this one, as may be foun=
d suitable.

497 This yoga, the quest of the source of the soul, is itself =
all the yogas.
It is the yoga of action, the yoga of devotion, the yoga of =
restraining the
mind and also the yoga of right awareness.

This quest of t=
he real Self, it is next pointed out, is not to be practised
as a meditatio=
n.

498 Since this quest takes the form of a question, it is not to be prac=
tised
as a mode of meditation. By this question, the mind dives into the He=
art,
which it does not do by any series of meditations.

499 Some practise =
continuous meditation on the truth of one=E2=80=99s own Self,
after listeni=
ng to and reflecting upon that truth. This method is different
from the que=
st for the Self that is taught by Ramana.

The method taught by Bhagavan is=
 not an affirmation, but a question. The
threefold process is further expla=
ined.

500 In the Chandogya Upanishad the identity of the Supreme Being and=
 the
real Self is taught by the sentence, =E2=80=98Thou art That=E2=80=99. =
This identity is
confirmed by distinguishing between the literal and the in=
tended meanings
[of the terms used].

The terms =E2=80=98Thou=E2=80=99 and =
=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99, if taken in the literal sense, tend to show
that th=
ere can be no such identity. Hence, the intended meanings are sought,
so th=
at the identity may be accepted as true. The identity is not of the
apparen=
t self, but of the real Self, with the Supreme Being. At the same
time the =
Supreme Being is not the personal God but the impersonal being of
the Upani=
shads. Both are of the nature of consciousness, and it is this
consciousnes=
s that is the real essence of both. Thus, the identity is true.

It has bee=
n assumed by the traditional schools of Advaita Vedanta that this
sentence =
conveys an injunction to meditate on the teaching. Actually, as
Bhagavan sa=
ys, the sentence states only a fact. The acceptance of it as a
fact is not =
enough. And meditation is no better. What is needed is to verify
the fact b=
y reaching and remaining in the mind-free state, called also the
natural st=
ate. What he has said is as follows:

501 Sri Ramana says that, without an =
enquiry into the intended meaning of
the term =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99 in the=
 sentence, one should make a quest for the truth of
the real Self, who is i=
ndicated by the term =E2=80=98thou=E2=80=99.

This quest leads up to the mi=
nd-free state in which the real Self shines
unhindered by the veil of ignor=
ance, which is the ego, the false self. Then
it will be realised that there=
 is only one entity, which is the real Self
and also the impersonal Supreme=
 Being of the Upanishads.

Bhagavan calls the quest the direct path. It byp=
asses the meditation
mentioned before.

502 By this quest the aspirant obta=
ins the direct experience of the real
Self in the transcendental state. For=
 him that has thus succeeded in this
quest, there is no need for continuous=
 meditation or prolonged reflection.

It is here taken for granted that the=
 aspirant accepts the teaching of the
identity as true. This acceptance ari=
ses through his faith in the Guru who
has that experience, and who is there=
fore a competent witness of that truth.

So, there is no injunction to medi=
tate in the sentence cited.

503 In the sentence of the ancient revelation =
=E2=80=98You are That=E2=80=99, no meditation
has been enjoined. What is sa=
id by implication is that in the egoless state
the sage has the experience =
that the impersonal is identical with his own
real Self.

504 Since it is s=
ettled by the sentence of the Vedanta that one=E2=80=99s own real
Self, dis=
entangled from the veiling sheaths, is the supreme reality, to
attain the e=
xperience of identity between that reality and the Self, what
else will wor=
k except the quest of that Self?

This is obvious, says Bhagavan. The real =
meaning of the text, =E2=80=98Thou art
That,=E2=80=99 is next set forth acc=
ording to the spirit of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teachings.

505 The meaning of t=
hat vedantic text [You are That] is this: the Supreme
Being himself shines =
as the real Self. If, seeking that Self, one gives up
the notion =E2=80=98I=
 am the body=E2=80=99 and becomes aware of one=E2=80=99s true nature, one
b=
ecomes firmly fixed in the Heart and shines as That.

Has the meditation on=
 the truth any use at all?

506 The quest of the truth of the Self is alone=
 the direct path to the right
awareness of the Self. The meditation spoken =
of is a preliminary aid to this
quest. It is for breaking up the idea of th=
e body as the Self.

This is what Bhagavan has said. In the way shown the m=
editation is useful
for those who are not able to free themselves from thei=
r ego-sense, by which
the body is identified as the Self.

The obstacles th=
at may lie on the path are next dealt with.

507 Diving into the Heart in t=
his quest of the Self does not occur in those
who have weak minds. For them=
, the mind=E2=80=99s strength, being subdivided among
innumerable thoughts,=
 is insignificant.

One-pointedness of the mind is needed. A mind that is o=
ne-pointed will be
strong enough for this purpose. Curbing of the variety o=
f thoughts is the
expedient to be adopted.

508 The one-pointedness of the =
mind in the quest is itself the strength of
mind that is needed, and nothin=
g else. He who has this strength of mind is
called =E2=80=98valiant=E2=80=
=99 because he has the skill to protect his intellect from
being frittered =
away.

509 By the practice of meditation mental strength will be intensifie=
d.
Therefore meditation is an aid to the quest. After first achieving still=
ness
of mind by meditation, the valiant aspirant must seek the truth of his=
 own
Self.

Then the question arises, =E2=80=98What is to be taken as the o=
bject of meditation?=E2=80=99

510 For the seeker of deliverance the best o=
f all possible objects for
meditation is the consciousness that has the for=
m =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, since this is the
essence of the real Self. By this =
meditation alone, the mind will naturally
dive into the Heart. Such is the =
teaching of our great Guru.

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, he has pointed out, is th=
e name of that impersonal being, the subject
matter of the Vedantas. He has=
 said that this name is even holier than the
pranava [Om].

An alternative =
method for stilling the mind=E2=80=99s thoughts, as recommended by
Bhagavan=
, is stated next.

511 Alternatively, if the aspirant for deliverance still=
s the mind by pure
kumbhaka [retention of breath], without puraka and recha=
ka [inhalation and
exhalation], and thus engages in the quest, then his min=
d will dive into the
Heart.

Ordinary pranayama consists of the three parts=
, breathing in (puraka),
retaining the breath within (kumbhaka), and breath=
ing out (rechaka). But
here the middle part (kumbhaka) alone is recommended=
 as a means of stilling
the mind. This may be mastered by steady practice. =
This is called kevala
kumbhaka.

The same process is prescribed in the Yoga=
 Vasishta, as quoted below.

<br>500 In the Chandogya Upanisha=
d the identity of the Supreme Being and the real Self is taught by the sent=
ence, =E2=80=98Thou art That=E2=80=99. This identity is confirmed by distin=
guishing between the literal and the intended meanings [of the terms used].=
<br>

<br>The terms =E2=80=98Thou=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99, if t=
aken in the literal sense, tend to show that there can be no such identity.=
 Hence, the intended meanings are sought, so that the identity may be accep=
ted as true. The identity is not of the apparent self, but of the real Self=
, with the Supreme Being. At the same time the Supreme Being is not the per=
sonal God but the impersonal being of the Upanishads. Both are of the natur=
e of consciousness, and it is this consciousness that is the real essence o=
f both. Thus, the identity is true.<br>

<br>It has been assumed by the tra=
ditional schools of Advaita Vedanta that this sentence conveys an injunctio=
n to meditate on the teaching. Actually, as Bhagavan says, the sentence sta=
tes only a fact. The acceptance of it as a fact is not enough. And meditati=
on is no better. What is needed is to verify the fact by reaching and remai=
ning in the mind-free state, called also the natural state. What he has sai=
d is as follows:<br>

<br>501 Sri Ramana says that, without an enquiry into=
 the intended meaning of the term =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99 in the sentence, o=
ne should make a quest for the truth of the real Self, who is indicated by =
the term =E2=80=98thou=E2=80=99.<br><br>This quest leads up to the mind-fre=
e state in which the real Self shines unhindered by the veil of ignorance, =
which is the ego, the false self. Then it will be realised that there is on=

 of the Upanishads.<br>

<br>Bhagavan calls the quest the direct path. It b=
ypasses the meditation mentioned before.<br><br>502 By this quest the aspir=
ant obtains the direct experience of the real Self in the transcendental st=

<br>It is here taken for =
granted that the aspirant accepts the teaching of the identity as true. Thi=

 to the quest. After first achieving stillness of mind by meditation, the v=
aliant aspirant must seek the truth of his own Self.<br>

<br>Then the ques=
tion arises, =E2=80=98What is to be taken as the object of meditation?=E2=
=80=99<br><br>510 For the seeker of deliverance the best of all possible ob=
jects for meditation is the consciousness that has the form =E2=80=98I=E2=
=80=99, since this is the essence of the real Self. By this meditation alon=
e, the mind will naturally dive into the Heart. Such is the teaching of our=
 great Guru.<br>

<br>=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, he has pointed out, is the name =
of that impersonal being, the subject matter of the Vedantas. He has said t=
hat this name is even holier than the pranava [Om].<br><br>An alternative m=
ethod for stilling the mind=E2=80=99s thoughts, as recommended by Bhagavan,=
 is stated next.<br>

<br>511 Alternatively, if the aspirant for deliveranc=
e stills the mind by pure kumbhaka [retention of breath], without puraka an=
d rechaka [inhalation and exhalation], and thus engages in the quest, then =
his mind will dive into the Heart.<br>

<br>Ordinary pranayama consists of =
the three parts, breathing in (puraka), retaining the breath within (kumbha=
ka), and breathing out (rechaka). But here the middle part (kumbhaka) alone=
 is recommended as a means of stilling the mind. This may be mastered by st=
eady practice. This is called kevala kumbhaka.<br>

<br>The same process is=
 prescribed in the Yoga Vasishta, as quoted below.<br><br><span style=3D"fo=
