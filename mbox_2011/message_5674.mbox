Respected Jhaji/ PVR and other Members,

Lately I came to know (and I was s=
urprised to learn) that the earliest script used for writing sanskit is Bra=
hmi and not Devanagri! Why would the oldest language in the world and so ad=
vanced at that not have a script? Or is this knowledge hidden from us till =
date?

It is hard to imagine that such a perfect and beautiful language so =
widely used (and maybe for secular purposes also) would not have a script! =
E.g. if yantra's were made what script were they written in?

Is it also po=
ssible that we lost many precious treasures of knowledge over the years as =
they were not written down? Writing down is somehow similar to burying a po=
t of gold to be recovered later on, isn't it?

Also, if Devanagari was used=
 later on to write sanskit how come it suddenly sprang from Brahmi? And cam=
e to be widely used throughout India? Who would have spread the writing? Is=
 there any record?

Please pardon any foolish statements made above as I am=
 just curious.

Respectfully,

Girish
