 Translated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai
=

93. Just as many objects are seen in a picture, so the various names and
f=
orms exist in Brahman. By negating both names and forms, one can understand=

that what remains is existence, consciousness and bliss.

94. Even though =
a man standing on the bank of a river sees his body
reflected upside down i=
n the water, he nevertheless identifies himself with
his own body in the sh=
ore; similarly an aspirant after realisation of
Brahman should know himself=
 as Brahman.

96. Different mental creations are formed every moment, while=
 those which
pass are
lost for ever. The objects of the practical world sho=
uld be looked upon
similarly.

97. Childhood is lost in youth and youth is =
lost in old age. The father once
dead does not return. The day which is pas=
t never comes back.

100. As the big rock lying in the bed of a river remai=
ns unmoved, though the
water flows over it, so also while names and forms c=
onstantly change, the
unchanging Brahman does not become otherwise.

102. W=
ithout seeing the mirror it is impossible to see the objects reflected
in i=
t.
Similarly wherefrom can there be any knowledge of names and forms withou=
t a
knowledge of their substratum, which is existence, consciousness and bl=
iss ?

103. Having learnt of Brahman as existence, consciousness and bliss,=
 one
should fix the mind firmly on Him and should restrain it from dwelling=
 on
names and forms.

XIV. THE BLISS OF KNOWLEDGE

13. As water does not st=
ick to the leaves of a lotus so after realisation
future actions cannot sti=
ck to the knower.

15. Sri Krishna says: =E2=80=98Just as a blazing fire re=
duces the fuel to ashes, so,
O Arjuna,the fire of knowledge burns up all ac=
tions=E2=80=99.

16. =E2=80=98He who has no notion of I-ness and whose mind=
 is not tainted by desire
for results of action is not really a killer even=
 if he kills people; he is
not bound by his actions=E2=80=99.

42. Let the =
ignorant people of the world perform worldly actions and desire
to
possess =
wives, children and wealth. I am full of supreme bliss. For what
purpose
sh=
ould I engage myself in worldly concerns ?

XV. THE BLISS OF OBJECTS

7. (A=
nother Shruti says): =E2=80=98The supreme Self, though one only, exists in
=
every object.
Like the moon reflected in water, though one It appears as ma=
ny=E2=80=99.

35. May the Lord who is both Hari and Hara ever be pleased by=
 this =E2=80=98Bliss of
Brahman=E2=80=99 and may He protect all creatures w=
ho take refuge in Him and are
pure in
heart.
