Namaste.

Thanks for your response. I have seen the diamond example, but no=
t the other inputs before.

Unlike the diamond example, here is another fac=
et I learnt. Lord Krsna has 64 qualities while Lord Narayana has 60 qualiti=
es only. Brahman is the effulgence of LordKrsna and the ones who follow adv=
aita get into a situation of no birth, no death and merge in the brahma jyo=
thi. This is under the rulership of Lord SadaShiva (the supreme to all Siva=
s). The devotees of Lord Krsna (let us take it as dvaita) can have an etern=
al relationship with Lord serving them (Lord is never alone, his hladini sh=
akti as Radharani is always with him) either as a cow or lotus plant or kad=
amba tree. 

Even in the example you have given, the facets of diamond are =
fine. But why do we need to attribute one facet's relation with the other. =
So, either the relations are just an allegory or they are real. If they are=
 real, then the relations have to respected as is. It also can mean, the su=
preme who has expanded himself or created the rest of the facets. If it is =
the latter, there is only one supreme and the next question is, who is that=
 original ?

Anyways, I am just thinking loud as the stories / allegories l=
ook good to some extent, beyond which it is tough to imagine some scenarios=
. Unless it has been corrupted, Sanathana Dharma has made understanding the=
 Lord very difficult.

Lastly, I liked Sh Manish's response to one of my co=
ncerns on one of these kind of questions - "See, don't care what anyone say=
s; Just do Sadhana like crazy, ok !" 

regards
rAma
