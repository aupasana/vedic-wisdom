"For the enlightened yogi, the lover of God, neither time nor place have th=
e same overpowering significance that they do for those still attached to t=
he illusion of body. Such beings live always in the eternal. Vaikuntha (the=
 spiritual realm) is their only true home, Truth is their proper vehicle of=
 language, and love is their reason for being." - Sri Dharma Pravartaka Ach=
arya


"Enlightened yogis inherently personify wisdom, compassion, moral go=
odness, dispassion, peace and spiritual love as the very essence of their b=
eing. Such yogis are, thus, the natural leaders of any society. Envision a =
world in which every president, prime minister and head of state were just =
such an enlightened yogi. Now help manifest that vision into reality." - Sr=
i Dharma Pravartaka Acharya
