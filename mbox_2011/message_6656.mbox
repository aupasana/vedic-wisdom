Sure, thanks.

I spoke to another priest who are from Sringeri mutt and he =
mentioned to me to use loha only and use ghee in copper container. He told =
me homam is done in loha or in a pit with bricks boundary. I will stick to =
the loha homa kundam for now.

Lastly, I have seen the videos of Sh Narasim=
ha and Sh MM Pandit (should've done that first) and realized that they put =
dry coconuts before the camphor is lighted inside the kundam. I then recoll=
ected how the twigs are put first and camphor lighted on them. I tried the =
same today and the agni was burning nice.

Thanks again for the responses.

rAma

 post Ajit. I am also one of those people who, because of guilt factor of s=
kipping sandhyavandana, unable to do the homa daily. I do it every week. Bu=

 So, if I have do both nithyapooja and homam daily, it is really time takin=
