Dear Tp India,

The posts by Narasimha and G.Kumar remind me of a variant o=
f a well-known
modern parable:

<=3D=3D=3D

A man is flying low to the grou=
nd in a hot air balloon and realizes he is
lost. He spots a man below and s=
houts: "Excuse me, I am lost. Can you tell
me where Varanasi is?"

The man =
below says: "Yes, it is at 25N20 83E."

"You must be an engineer" says the =
balloonist.

"I am" replies the man. "How did you know."

"Well," says the =
balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically
correct, but it's n=
o use to anyone."

=3D=3D=3D>

A simple statement of fact may be short. But=
, is it actionable? Does it have
any practical value? If you have a GPS, a =
set of coordinates is the perfect
answer. If you don't have a GPS, a set of=
 coordinates is worthless. Most of
us don't have a spiritual GPS.

sasneham=
,

   ajit
