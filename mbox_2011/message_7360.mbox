--The Mountain Path, July 1982

I h=
ad the great privilege of being born in a family which was deeply devoted t=
o Bhagavan Ramana.My grandparents, Sri M. Ramu Setty and Smt.Muniammal, wou=
ld take me for Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s darshan.=C2=A0

Thus I started visiti=
ng the Maharshi right from my childhood. Being a native of Tiruvannamaiai,i=
t was my great good fortune that I was able to have Bhagavan=E2=80=99s dars=
han till His Mahasamadhi in 1950.

When Bhagavan was staying at Virupaksha =
Cave, devotees would come to town singing=C2=A0Aksharamanamalai. We would e=
agerly wait for their arrival to offer them cooked food. Only after such of=
fering would we eat. This continued without a day=E2=80=99s break till Bhag=
avan=E2=80=99s mother started cooking at Skandashram. Our house was open to=
 devotees=C2=A0of Bhagavan at all times.

Even while Bhagavan was at Virupa=
ksha Cave, occasionally we used to go there and offer biksha. On one such o=
ccasion the leaf-plates we had brought were just enough for the devotees pr=
esent and there was none for me. Being young, I started crying. Bhagavan ca=
lled me and coming to know the reason, consoled me by providing me with a l=
eaf. Bhagavan understood a child=E2=80=99s feelings, and He has been gracio=
us to me throughout my life!

It was Bhagavan who introduced me into religi=
ous texts. Once Bhagavan wrote the first verse of Dakshinamurti Stotra on a=
 slip of paper and told me to learn it by heart and repeat it on my next vi=
sit.Thus I learnt the Dakshinamurti Stotra. I would often forget the first =
word of a verse and Bhagavan would help me. Then writing down the first wor=
d of each verse of Dakshinamurti Stotra, Bhagavan gave me the slip of paper=
 to help remember the sequence.

On the first of each Tamil month I would g=
o round the Hill along with my mother, and on the way we would walk into th=
e Ashram to pay homage to Bhagavan who would receive us with a smile and so=
metimes ask us to take breakfast.=C2=A0Once, when as usual two iddlies were=
 served on my plate, I asked for one more.

Bhagavan turned to me and said =
that I could have one more after eating the two. When I had finished eating=
 them, Bhagavan asked whether I would like to have more, and I replied No. =
Bhagavan, said with a smile: Why did you ask for more even before starting =
to eat? Thus Bhagavan taught the lesson that one should not be greedy.

Whe=
n my mother passed away, I went to the Ashram to convey the news to Bhagava=
n. Bhagavan graciously looked at me and relieved me of my intense grief.Bha=
gavan smilingly told me that my mother was as old as his stay at Arunachala=
. With folded hands I prayed to Bhagavan to protect our family, and He grac=
iously nodded His head by way of approval.

Bhagavan was not merely a spiri=
tual Master of the highest order, but our mother, our father and our all!
