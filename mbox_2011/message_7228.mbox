Namaste,

People have their own idiosyncracies based on where they are from=
. But 
the correct pronunciation is derivable by reverse engineering the 
g=
rammar rules, as I said before.

Note that visarga becomes sha, Sha and sa =
if ca, Ta and ta come after 
it. Pursue this link!

The consonants sh (as i=
n "shiva"), Sh (as in "uShA") and s (as in 
"sama") are pronounced very sim=
ilar to the consonants ch (as in 
"charitra"), T (as in "kaTAkSha") and t (=
as in "tapas"), respectively.

When you pronounce ka, cha, Ta, ta and pa, t=
he tongue is raised and 
touches the upper surface of mouth somewhere. For =
ka, it is at the back. 
For cha, it moves a little forward. For Ta, it move=
s further and in the 
alveolar region. For ta, it is at the teeth. For pa, =
it is at the lips. 
So, as you move from ka-group to pa-group, the place wh=
ere tongue gets 
raised and touches the upper surface of mouth moves gradua=
lly from the 
back of the mouth (near throat) to the lips. (Isn't it beauti=
ful that 
alphabet is arranged in a systematic and scientific manner?)

Now=
, carefully feel that positions for cha, Ta and ta. Then try to 
pronounce =
those sounds with tongue not actually touching the upper 
surface of mouth,=
 but leaving a little gap, so that air can keep going 
thru. Then you autom=
atically get sha, Sha and sa sounds. If you 
practice, you will get the thr=
ee sounds perfectly. You will also then 
realize why they are linked to cha=
, Ta and ta in visarga sandhi!

*        *        *

BTW, god gave me birth=
 in Virgo lagna in this life with a scholarly 
horoscope. So I did and will=
 talk about technicalities, correct 
pronunciation etc. But please note tha=
t this is only 5% important and 
devotion and correct thoughts in mind are =
far more important. If it is 
possible to correct your pronunciation, pleas=
e do so. But don't be under 
the delusion that that is all that matters. Th=
at is a small factor.

Best regards,
Narasimha
