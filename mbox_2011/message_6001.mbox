Namaskaram Girish Ji,

Good to know that you repainted your room twice. Eve=
n if you leave your room with "Black Shades" would be fine and actually mor=
e beautiful :)
***
Answers to your questions:

1) YES. It is portable. Ever=
y day I adjust it near my window and after finishing homam, i take it back =
little inside so that window can be closed. I am able to adjust it myself a=
lone in just a few *seconds*.

2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galvanized Iron=
) of 22 Gauge. This was manufactured by a Local EPC contracting company dea=
ling in AC Duct installation. A Technical Supervisor of that company is my =
close family friend. He did this for me. I suggest checking with any Restau=
rants. They all are having such arrangements and they would be able to help=
 you to contact such manufacturers.

3) YES, because it is a Metal (GI Shee=
t) it gets quite heated up. One can not touch during Homam. However, it als=
o cools down quickly. Within half an hour after Homam is finished, temperat=
ure of the chimney comes down to room temperature. 

4) It has a Metallic F=
AN at the end. I was starting that FAN only when Fire goes of and lot of Sm=
oke is generated. Reasons are as follows:
      i)The fan is powerful and m=
akes a lot of noise which disturbs concentration.
      ii) In the beginnin=
g, when Fire is very small, the powerful exhaust by the fan, disturbed the =
flames and sometimes extinguished it.
      1ii) When Fire is there in the =
Homam, one need not worry about smoke handling. the reason is that the smok=
e naturally travels upward and it is automatically guided to the exit of th=
e chimney. Once the fire becomes strong, it generates vacuum around Homam k=
undam area and starts pulling outside air. For instance, smoke from incense=
 stick (Agarbatti), though outside of chimney and quite far away, actually =
gets diverted into the Chimney via square opening at the bottom. Hence duri=
ng homam, FAN is not required.

      iv) Now very important thing. I used =
fan for many months (only at the end of Homas). One day my fear proved righ=
t. Due to heat of chimney, the cable of the Fan got burnt and there was a s=
hort-circuit. mccb tripped. Since then I am not using the Fan. You may have=
 to go for Heat resistant cable for the FAN if you wish to use it but i am =
fine without using the fan in my chimney.
Actually without Fan, The whole a=
rrangement will become much Lighter and much easier to handle. Please also =
do not forget to make a support. You can see that in pictures which I have =
loaded. Support is a separate part

(Please check the Picture of Fan which =
i have added in the Photo section)

If you have further queries, please do =
not hesitate to ask.

Best Regards,

Utpal
