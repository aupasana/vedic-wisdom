 79 For the aspirant who seeks to win the supreme state by transcending the=

relativity [of the three states], the supreme evidence is the experience o=
f
the sage. He alone knows also the truth about the world because of his
aw=
areness of the reality [the Self] in that state.

This will become intellig=
ible as we proceed.

80 The sage not only testifies to his own experience, =
but also furnishes
flawless reasons [drawn from our own worldly experience]=
. But the disciple,
if wise, will not go on posing questions without end, f=
or the world of the
saviour is not to be doubted by the aspirant.

The sage=
=E2=80=99s own experience is for us conclusive evidence. He is the
compassi=
onate one, the saviour who has assumed human form for redeeming
those who h=
ave begun to feel the illusory quality of worldly life. So, one
must as a r=
ule accept what he says without cavil. At some state the series
of question=
s must come to an end, and the way to the verification of the
truth by one=
=E2=80=99s own experience must be entered upon. As the Gita says: =E2=80=98=
The
inveterate doubter does not win the goal of life.=E2=80=99

81 There wi=
ll be no end to doubt until one gets established in the supreme
state. Only=
 in that state is there an end of all doubts, due to the
extinction of the =
doubter, [the ego].

Here is a reference to the upanishadic text: =E2=80=98=
When the one that is the truth
of the high and the low is experienced, then=
 the heart-knot is cut, all
doubts are dispelled, and all his actions are l=
iquidated.=E2=80=99

Doubts, we are here told, arise in the ego-ridden mind=
, not in the egoless
state.
What then must the aspirant do?

82 Since there=
 is no finality in reason, the aspirant should at once give up
reliance on =
reason. With faith in the Master=E2=80=99s teaching, he must strive to
win =
God on the lines taught by him.

83 If a doubt arises he should ask himself=
: =E2=80=98Who is it that doubts in this
way?=E2=80=99 If by thus seeking, =
he attains the supreme state, then both doubt and
doubter will cease to be.=


The question =E2=80=98Who is it that has this doubt?=E2=80=99 is the mean=
s prescribed by
Bhagavan to turn the mind away from the doubt to the doubte=
r, the ego. The
answer to this question will be =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. From t=
his the question will arise, =E2=80=98Who
Am I?=E2=80=99, which is the ques=
t. In the same way, any extraneous thought that
intrudes, distracting the m=
ind from the quest, can be used as a means of
returning to the quest. If th=
e quest is persistently pursued in this way,the
ego, the doubter, becomes e=
xtinct, and no more doubts will arise because the
mind-free state is then a=
ttained.

Now we come to the question, =E2=80=98Is the world real?=E2=80=99=
 Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching on
this point is given in the next seven verse=
s.

84 The Guru, who is a sage, teaches the unreality of the world in accor=
dance
with his own experience, also giving reasons supporting it. The disci=
ple who
aspires to become
free should accept this teaching with perfect fai=
th and [with its help]
strive for this goal.

85 The universe, comprising t=
hese three =E2=80=93 the soul, God and the world of
visible objects =E2=80=
=93 is superimposed by the mind on the real Self, which is the
sole reality=
 of the supreme state. Hence all this [universe] is just an
outcome of igno=
rance.
The mind is the creator of the universe. Ignorance is the primal cau=
se of
the mind. Hence it is said here that this ignorance is the cause of t=
he
universe.

86 That being so, when this ignorance is annihilated by the l=
ight of
awareness of that Self, then, along with it, the consequence of it =
[the
world] will, like the darkness that disappears before sunlight at dawn=
,
cease to appear.

This will become more and more intelligible as we proce=
ed. What is stated
above are the actual facts of the Guru=E2=80=99s own exp=
erience. The conclusion that
follows for the disciple is given next.

87 Th=
is universe [we see] shines in the dense darkness of ignorance, but
does no=
t shine in the great splendour of the light of Self-awareness. If
this univ=
erse were real, why does it not shine in the supreme state, lit as
it is by=
 the conscious, effulgent light of the real Self?

An axiomatic distinction=
 between the real and unreal, which is implicit in
vedantic metaphysics, is=
 next enunciated.

88 That which survives in the experience of the real Sel=
f is the supreme
state. [That] alone is real. All else is only unreal. This=
 is the
distinction between the real and the unreal, revealed to us by the =
teachings
of all the sages.

By this test the world is shown to be unreal. =
The next verse elaborates on
this.

89 Since multiplicity is experienced on=
ly in the state of ignorance, it is
declared to be unreal. On the other han=
d, because the unity of the Self is
experienced on the liquidation of ignor=
ance, that unity is real.

It may be questioned: =E2=80=98If ignorance is t=
otal darkness, how can anything be
experienced in this state?=E2=80=99 The =
explanation is that this ignorance is not
like perfect darkness, but like a=
 greatly diminished light. In dim light a
rope is not invisible; it is mere=
ly perceived wrongly as a snake. In the
same way, in ignorance, what is rea=
l, the Self, is not invisible; it is
mistakenly taken to be the world.

The=
 reality is only that which survives in the supreme state.

90 =E2=80=98The=
 sole reality is that peaceful Self which shines by the light of its
own na=
ture as pure consciousness in the supreme state wherein the world is
lost.=
=E2=80=99 Such is the teaching of our holy Guru.

Here it is shown that the=
 state is one of peace because there is no duality
there. This is what we l=
earn from all the Upanishads.This teaching is
further confirmed by the anal=
ogy of the dream world.

91 As the dream world is known to be unreal for th=
e reason that it vanishes
upon waking, so this waking world is also proved =
to be unreal by its
vanishing in the light of the real Self.

It is next po=
inted out that those who seek to discredit this teaching are
those who do n=
ot ardently aspire to the supreme state.

92 But ignorant men, who are aver=
se to winning the supreme state, put forth
an endless series of arguments, =
[trying to refute this teaching]. The sages
clear the doubts generated by t=
hese arguments so that earnest aspirants may
not be deluded by them.

The t=
eaching is addressed not to all men, but only to those who aspire to
win th=
e supreme state, because they alone are qualified to receive it.

93 This t=
eaching of the unreality of the world is not addressed to those who
look up=
on the body itself as the Self, or consider the Self to be the owner
of the=
 body. For these people the world is real, not unreal.

The teaching has to=
 be adapted to the person being taught. The same teaching
is not good for a=
ll. Here it is shown that he who believes that the Self is
not the body, bu=
t the owner of it, or the dweller therein, is for this
purpose in the same =
category as the one who believes the body itself to be
the Self.

Why is it=
 that the world is real to these people?

94 The teaching =E2=80=93 that th=
e trinity of the soul, God and the world is unreal
=E2=80=93 is indivisible=
. If one is convinced that one of these is real, the other
two also will ap=
pear to be real.

That is, the teaching must either be accepted as a whole =
or rejected wholly.
There is no option to split it up and accept it partial=
ly, rejecting some of
it.

95 To those who seek deliverance, the teaching i=
s that all these three are
equally unreal. This teaching must [therefore] b=
e accepted, exactly as it is
taught, by those who are earnestly seeking to =
win deliverance by the
extinction of ignorance.

For different aspirants th=
ere are different paths prescribed. This
particular teaching is addressed o=
nly to those who believe that for them
deliverance must come by right aware=
ness.

An analogy is next given to explain the indivisibility of the teachi=
ng.

96 One who is wise will either accept the teaching as a whole, or reje=
ct the
whole of it. Who can make use of half of a hen for cooking, reservin=
g the
other half for laying eggs?

A hen must be killed and cooked for food=
, or the whole hen must be allowed
to live for laying eggs. The same indivi=
sibility is characteristic of this
teaching.

Now we come to a discussion o=
f the objections of those who assert the
perfect reality of the world.

On =
what evidence do they base their belief?

97 To begin with, it needs to be =
considered why the world is taken to be
real. For the burden of proving the=
 reality of the world lies on him that
asserts it, [not on those who simply=
 deny it].

98 Everyone who is ignorant [of the real Self] thinks the world=
 is real
because it is seen. This is no proof because it proves too much. T=
he same
reason would prove the reality of the mirage, the rope in the snake=
, etc.

Usually, the knowledge that arises from seeing is mixed up with ima=
gination,
or a false impression of what is seen. This reason is therefore
i=
nconclusive.

The question then arises: =E2=80=98What does the seeing of th=
e world prove?=E2=80=99

99 The fact of being seen is not conclusive proof =
that the world exists
exactly as imagined [by the seer]. From the seeing it=
 is proper to infer
only that there is a substratum in which the world appe=
ars.

In the first verse of Ulladu Narpadu Bhagavan says: =E2=80=98Because =
we see the
world, it is indisputable that there exists a first cause [subst=
ratum or
basic reality] which has the power to appear as many.=E2=80=99 In =
the same verse he
proceeds to reveal, in the light of his own experience, t=
hat that substratum
is only the real Self, on which are superimposed the fo=
ur elements of the
world appearance, the pictures of names and forms, the s=
eeing individual
soul, the screen and the light. The seeing subject and the=
 spectacle seen
form the appearance imposed on the substratum. The lighted =
screen is the
substratum. Here the analogy of the cinema show is suggested.=
 The pictures,
in which the seer is included, come and go, but the lighted =
screen exists
unaffected throughout. The power by which the appearance is s=
uperimposed on
the substratum is known as maya. All that is meant by callin=
g the world =E2=80=98an
effect of maya=E2=80=99 is that things are not what=
 they seem to those who have not
known the real Self as it really is.

100 =
Even scientists have proved that things are not exactly as they appear
[to =
the seer], for they say that the solid-seeming objects are really little
mo=
re than empty space.

Atomic physics now tells us that the atom is not a so=
lid particle, but a
closed space in which electrons are rotating around a n=
ucleus, composed of
protons and neutrons, etc. The electrons rotate at diff=
erent distances from
the nucleus. The whole atom thus resembles a solar sys=
tem. That things are
not what they seem is thus indisputable. On the other =
hand, there is no
proof that things are what they seem to be. There is, in =
fact, an antithesis
between appearance and reality. It is this that is call=
ed maya, which is the
illusion by which reality appears as the world, that =
spectacle which
resembles a cinema-show. Due to this illusion there is igno=
rance (avidya)
which works through the mind that wrongly identifies the bod=
y as the Self.
For this reason the truth about the world is a profound myst=
ery, one that
transcends the human intellect, but it is no mystery to the s=
age, who alone
is competent to tell us the truth as it really is. The next =
verse points
this out.

101 Only the sage who knows the substratum of the w=
orld appearance, the
reality, by being firmly established in the supreme st=
ate, is competent to
reveal the truth of the world.

By his unawareness of =
that truth the common man, being a victim of his
ignorance, cannot know the=
 truth about the world.

102 When vision is focused on the outside, who can=
 know the truth, whether
of the real Self or of the world? But, with the mi=
nd turned inwards, the
sage knows the truth of both by the eye of right awa=
reness.

It is with the knowledge of this uniqueness of the sage that the d=
isciple
has to approach him and listen to his teaching.

arises: =E2=80=98What does the seeing of the world prove?=E2=80=99<br>

<br=
>99 The fact of being seen is not conclusive proof that the world exists ex=
actly as imagined [by the seer]. From the seeing it is proper to infer only=
 that there is a substratum in which the world appears.<br><br>In the first=
 verse of Ulladu Narpadu Bhagavan says: =E2=80=98Because we see the world, =
it is indisputable that there exists a first cause [substratum or basic rea=
lity] which has the power to appear as many.=E2=80=99 In the same verse he =
proceeds to reveal, in the light of his own experience, that that substratu=
m is only the real Self, on which are superimposed the four elements of the=
 world appearance, the pictures of names and forms, the seeing individual s=
oul, the screen and the light. The seeing subject and the spectacle seen fo=
rm the appearance imposed on the substratum. The lighted screen is the subs=
tratum. Here the analogy of the cinema show is suggested.=C2=A0<span style=
=3D"font-weight:bold">The pictures, in which the seer is included, come and=
 go, but the lighted screen exists unaffected throughout. The power by whic=
h the appearance is superimposed on the substratum is known as maya.</span>=
=C2=A0All that is meant by calling the world =E2=80=98an effect of maya=E2=
=80=99 is that things are not what they seem to those who have not known th=
e real Self as it really is.<br>

<br>100 Even scientists have proved that =
things are not exactly as they appear [to the seer], for they say that the =
solid-seeming objects are really little more than empty space.<br><br>Atomi=
c physics now tells us that the atom is not a solid particle, but a closed =
space in which electrons are rotating around a nucleus, composed of protons=
 and neutrons, etc. The electrons rotate at different distances from the nu=
cleus. The whole atom thus resembles a solar system. That things are not wh=
at they seem is thus indisputable. On the other hand, there is no proof tha=
t things are what they seem to be. There is, in fact, an antithesis between=
 appearance and reality. It is this that is called maya, which is the illus=
ion by which reality appears as the world, that spectacle which resembles a=
 cinema-show. Due to this illusion there is ignorance (avidya) which works =
through the mind that wrongly identifies the body as the Self. For this rea=
son the truth about the world is a profound mystery, one that transcends th=
e human intellect, but it is no mystery to the sage, who alone is competent=
 to tell us the truth as it really is. The next verse points this out.<br>
=

<br>101 Only the sage who knows the substratum of the world appearance, th=
e reality, by being firmly established in the supreme state, is competent t=
o reveal the truth of the world.<br><br>By his unawareness of that truth th=
e common man, being a victim of his ignorance, cannot know the truth about =
the world.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">102 When vision is foc=
used on the outside, who can know the truth, whether of the real Self or of=
 the world? But, with the mind turned inwards, the sage knows the truth of =
both by the eye of right awareness.</span><br>

<br>It is with the knowledg=
e of this uniqueness of the sage that the disciple has to approach him and =
listen to his teaching.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">Source</spa=
