 132 No one is able to know the unreality of the dream world during the
dre=
am itself. In the same way, no one is able to know the unreality of the
wak=
ing world while he is in the waking state.

The primary ignorance dominates=
 the ego mind at all times, either while
dreaming or in the waking state, a=
nd this is the cause of the inability of
most men even to entertain the tho=
ught that the waking world may not be
real. The disciple is in a better pos=
ition because of his faith in the
competence of his Guru. The Guru, who has=
 the experience of the egoless
state, can tell him the truth about the worl=
d and of the worldless, egoless
state.

The flaw in the contentions of thes=
e disputants is next indicated.

133 There is no flawless evidence tending =
to prove that the world exists
outside [apart from the mind of its seer]. B=
ut these partisans assume the
truth of their contention, which is required =
to be proved, and then concoct
arguments for their case.

The arguments put=
 forward by these disputants, if carefully scrutinised, are
found to be bas=
ed on a subtle process of what logicians call =E2=80=98begging the
question=
=E2=80=99.

One such argument is stated and discussed in the following vers=
es.

134 If it is said that the sense impressions of sounds and the rest ar=
ise
inside the mind, while their cause, the world, lies outside, how is thi=
s
division of inside and outside to be accepted as unreal?

This argument i=
s not a proof, but a mere assertion. Its inadequacy is seen
in that it assu=
mes the reality of the distinction between inside and
outside, which is an =
outcome of the assumption that the body is the Self. In
that assumption the=
 body is assumed to be real, without offering any proof
of its reality. We =
have seen that since the body is a part of the world,
whose reality is in d=
ispute, this assumption is improper.

135 All the divisions experienced in =
worldly life appear as real only in
relation to the body. No separate proof=
 is offered by them to prove the
reality of the body!

Another argument is =
noticed next.

136 The argument, =E2=80=98The mind is small and the world i=
s vast. How can it be
within the mind?=E2=80=99 is also mistaken. It has be=
en taught by the sage that it
is the mind that is vast [not the world].

13=
7 The mind is vaster than even the sky, and in it are the five elements of
=
creation, the outer space [sky] and the rest. Consciousness in its
motionle=
ss state is Brahman; the same when moving is mind. Thus it has been
made cl=
ear [by Bhagavan] that the mind is of the nature of Brahman.

Bhagavan and =
Vedanta recognise three skies: the outer [physical] sky, the
mind-sky and t=
he sky of pure consciousness. This last is styled as a sky,
because it cont=
ains the mind-sky, which in its turn contains the outer sky
and all the wor=
lds.

The fact that the world ceases to appear in deep sleep =E2=80=93 wher=
ein the
exposition of the mental nature of the world is based =E2=80=93 is =
sought to be
countered by the following contention.

138 =E2=80=98If you do=
ubt whether or not the world existed during your sleep, then
ask those who =
did not sleep [during the time you slept], and know from their
words that t=
he world existed continuously [without a break].=E2=80=99

This is consider=
ed by the dvaitins to be an unanswerable argument. But
Bhagavan himself, wh=
en this argument was stated as a difficulty to be
overcome, showed that thi=
s also is a case of =E2=80=98begging the question=E2=80=99, as will
be show=
n next.

139 This argument, put forward by the ignorant, takes as proved th=
e truth of
their main contention. The men who are not asleep are part and p=
arcel of the
world under
enquiry.

What Bhagavan said on this point is give=
n next.

140 We see these men who did not sleep only after we wake, not in =
our sleep!
No separate proof is offered to prove the reality of these men w=
ho did not
sleep.
The reason for not accepting the reality of the world was=
 that it is not
seen during deep sleep. That same objection holds good in r=
espect of these
men who did not sleep when we slept. Hence, this argument o=
f the dualists
fails utterly. It would be a valid argument, suggests Bhagav=
an, if we saw
them during our dreamless sleep, which of course is impossibl=
e.

These men too have no valid argument for believing the world to be real=
, as
is shown next.

141 Even those who remained awake [while we slept] kno=
w the world only by
the mind and never otherwise. Hence, for all alike the =
world is only mental,
both in waking and in dream.

Another argument is sta=
ted and refuted next.

142 The objectivity of the world is also asserted on=
 the grounds that it
appears the same to diverse seers. But the Master refu=
tes the argument by
asserting that the diversity of observers is unreal.

T=
his diversity of souls is part of the world illusion. It is therefore no
mo=
re real than the rest of it. The truth of this point is expounded by
Bhagav=
an in the next verse.

143 Both in dream and in waking this diversity [of s=
ouls] is only a mental
creation, since in deep sleep, which is mind-free, t=
his diversity does not
appear.

144 The mind itself creates the world in th=
e waking state, as it does in
dream. But the mind does not know, either in =
waking or in dream, that this
is its own creation.

145 The mind creates th=
e world subject to a superior power [avidya-maya] and
therefore is unable t=
o create it to its own liking. The mind, believing the
world to be real, is=
 deluded and suffers the woes of samsara.

That the mind has this anomalous=
 power, which is also a weakness, is shown
next.

146 This is the very natu=
re of the mind, that it takes as real all that it
creates. This is seen in =
day-dreaming, witnessing dramas, or listening to
stories.
These instances a=
re taken from our waking experience itself. They
demonstrate this self-tort=
uring quality of the mind, which is even worse in
dreams.

The conclusion i=
s then stated.

147 Creation is not other than seeing; seeing and creating =
are one and the
same process. Annihilation is only the cessation of seeing =
and nothing else,
for the world comes to an end by the right awareness of o=
neself.

The next step is the demonstration that the mind also is unreal. T=
he next
verse begins this exposition.

148 As it is settled that the world =
is mental, the world would be real if
the mind were real. However, if the m=
ind is unreal, then the world would
also be unreal. Hence, it becomes neces=
sary to enquire whether the mind is
real.

But there is a preliminary quest=
ion to be taken up and answered: the test or
tests of reality to be applied=
.

149 First, it is necessary to enquire by what tests one can distinguish =
the
real from the unreal, because, in [this] enquiry as to what is real, th=
e
test of reality approved of by the worldly ones is not valid.

150 The pa=
rrot who wishes to eat the fruit of the silk-cotton tree [at last]
goes awa=
y disappointed. How can the beliefs of one, who thus deludes
himself, be ac=
cepted as reasonable?

This conduct of the parrot, whether true or not, is =
proverbial. Man is in
the same situation. He expects to reap unalloyed happ=
iness in worldly life
and is always disappointed. This demonstrates his cap=
acity for
self-deception. Philosophers would not be philosophers if they ac=
cepted the
credulous views of unthinking men.

Unless used under the guidan=
ce of a perfectly competent Guru, the worldly
means of knowledge are certai=
n to prove misleading. This truth is expressed
in the next verse.

151 The =
intellect, the sense organs, and the mind are servants of the
primary ignor=
ance. Hence, the worldly methods of seeking knowledge do not at
all favour =
success in this enquiry.

The worldly means of knowledge, called proofs, ar=
e direct perception,
inference, analogy, tradition, and so on. These are un=
derstood and practised
by logicians and philosophers. In vedantic reasoning=
 these are not to be
relied upon for the reason stated, namely that they ar=
e naturally the
servants of ignorance, having been created in order to prot=
ect and confirm
that ignorance.

152 The test of reality that is considered=
 good by the worldly is unreliable
because it is a child of ignorance. For =
the sadhakas the reliable test for
distinguishing truth from falsehood is t=
hat which the sages have stated.

That test is next set forth.

153 That wh=
ich shines by its own light [of consciousness], without change,
and without=
 setting and rising, is alone real. All that is not so is unreal.
So say th=
e sages.

This is the test approved of in vedantic metaphysics, and it is t=
hat which
is used in the Upanishads.

The Bhagavad Gita is next referred to=
.

154 =E2=80=98There is never any [real] existence for the unreal, neither=
 is there
any non-existence for the real.=E2=80=99 Thus Bhagavan Sri Krishn=
a himself stated
the distinction between the real and the unreal.

Thus, th=
ings that appear at certain times and disappear at other times are
excluded=
 from the category of the real.

155 What had no existence in the beginning=
 and will not exist after some
time is non-existent even in the intervening=
 period [during which it seems
to exist]. The notion that anything which ap=
pears limited in space or time
[is real] is ignorance.

156 The analogy for=
 the real is gold and the analogy for the unreal is
jewellery [made of gold=
]. Gold is real in comparison with jewellery; the
latter is unreal because =
it is perishable.

157 The jewellery was gold before [being made] and it is=
 gold even in the
middle [when it appears as jewellery] and also at the end=
, [when it is
melted down]. [Thus] the unrealities appear as real on a subs=
tratum of the
real, just as unreal jewellery appears as real on a substratu=
m of gold
[which is comparatively real].

This is one of the analogies empl=
oyed in the Chandogya Upanishad to
illustrate the truth taught here, that t=
he one supreme reality, which is the
real Self, is the substratum of the wo=
rld appearance.

158 If the two, the world and the mind, are scrutinised in=
 this way, they
are found to be unreal. The process of this demonstration, =
as taught by the
most holy one [Bhagavan], is here set forth.

159 The worl=
d that is made to shine and the light, namely the mind, which
caused the wo=
rld to shine, arise and set together [as one]. Since this pair
does not app=
ear uninterruptedly, the pair should be known to be unreal.
