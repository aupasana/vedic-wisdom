Dear Narasimhaji,

Few days ago, there was a discussion in this group about=
 siddhis and in one of those emails, someone mentioned about Sapta Rishis..=
.. I have a doubt on the sapta rishis. Hope you answer this question. I tho=
ught that the sapta rishis too were 'temporary' i.e they too changed in eac=
h Manvantara [or age of Manu]...Wikipedia says that it takes 14 Manus and t=
heir respective Manvantaras to create a Kalpa, Aeon, or a `Day of Brahma'[S=
orry, I dont know Sanskrit, so I have to use Google & Wikipedia to lookup i=
nfo]....So, does it not mean that in each Manvantara, there are "a differen=
t sets of Sapta Rishis", which means that 'Sapta Rishis' too are temporary,=
 something like the analogy of the'fruits on the tree at the side of the ro=
ad' of one's journey to the top of the mountain, the mountain here meaning =
one's own Self or the eternal BRAHMAN? 

Please forgive my ignorance, I'm t=
rying to understand better....
