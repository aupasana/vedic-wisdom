Real austerity is based upon three principles =E2=80" First, take refuge in=
 the truth. Truth is the pillar to which you must always hold while perform=
ing any action. Second, conquer lust. Third, renounce all cravings. Observe=
 these three principles. That is real austerity, and the greatest of these =
is to conquer lust.
