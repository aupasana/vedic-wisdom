Without abandonment of the concerns of worldly life, knowledge cannot be pu=
rsued with unabated vigor and devotion. It does not mean that the sannyasin=
 undervalues human society and discards all men without helping them at all=
. As the life of a sannyasin is meant only to reach the highest Reality, an=
d as he has already passed through the lower stages of spiritual evolution,=
 he may appear to be not working for the rest of humanity at large; but it =
is to be borne in mind that he exercises a silent and unnoticed but powerfu=
l influence for the good of the public. That itself is the service he is re=
ndering to the society and that is the highest and the most beneficent serv=
ice that one could ever do to man. One who is intent upon realizing the pea=
ce, the bliss, the One Without a Second=E2=80"Shantam, Shivam, Advaitam=E2=
=80"is the most powerful and the useful friend of the world!
