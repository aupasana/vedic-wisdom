Dear Narasimha,

Is there any relationship between performing homam and pan=
changam? Specifically, are there any days that should be avoided?

Recently=
 I came across this information:

-Quote:

"It is advisable to do Homam(Hav=
an) when the fire is on earth and in the Homahuti when Guru, Shukra or Budh=
a receives aahuti. 

Many astrologers requested to include homahuti into pa=
nchangam. This is based on the distance between the sun's nakshatra and the=
 moon's nakshatra. It is auspicious to do shanti karma/ shraut karma when t=
he fire location is on earth and the ahuti goes to Budha -- showers intelli=
gence., =A0Venus --> all material wishes fulfilled, worldly wealth property=
. Jupiter -> fulfillment of desires. moon->crops will be inundated, Sun->de=
struction of auspicious effects, Mars->fear of fire, Saturn->destruction of=
 wealth, Rahu/ketu-> loss of every kind, famine, health troubles. 

However=
, please remember for performing devi yaaga different chakra is used. "

-U=
nquote

***

All these are beyond the comprehension of someone illiterate i=
n astrology and the effects of planets. What strikes as a "warning" though =
is the statement that during certain planetary positions there could be adv=
erse results if performing homam.

If one is performing a Ganapati or Chand=
i homam (at a beginner level) with the sankalpa of simply attaining spiritu=
al development and liberation in mind, would this "warning" be of any relev=
ance?

Thank you.

Warmest regards..
