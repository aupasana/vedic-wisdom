Dear Nagaraj,

     <<But I am not able to control my anger at all! I am ve=
ry short tempered person and cannot tolerate delays and keep yelling at my =
kids and wife a lot! I am not seeing that homam is helping me there>>

I wa=
s also strangled by intense anger before this Sadhana.I am QA person in a  =
Software Company. I also never use to tolerate the delays, negligence etc..=
Now there is a lot of change happened within me.I conditioned whenever Ange=
r,greed,ego..etc.. enters my mind alike "please identify and start discoura=
ging and mortify them". So, when an anger provokes within..simultaneously t=
his condition also start works.. I am enjoying the game between them.

I am=
 sure you can control this kind of stuff very soon. keep up the momentum.Ca=
rry on performing Homam without break.

 I just started Homam on Feb 7th th=
is year and was able to complete 108 homams by July 19th.During this short =
period(around 6 months) itself I have seen a very good material and spiritu=
al progress. I had a desire of visiting Himalayas (kedarnath,Badrinath,Gang=
othri,Yamunothri..)it was fulfilled during, all my immovable properties val=
ue has been drastically increased, also I am put in very comfortable positi=
on in my office. 

So, Please do not worry, focus on your Sadhana.. you wil=
l enjoy the bliss.

Thank you,
Srini
