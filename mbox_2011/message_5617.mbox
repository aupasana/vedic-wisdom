Namaste Prashanth:

Good to see that you are actively sending mails again :=
) Missed your daily
Ramana's email for a while. It was like a daily lesson =
to me :)

Everytime when I read these Sutras, I get a feeling of clear unde=
rstanding,
and it still continues like that.

"Self-restraint in actions in=
cludes abstention from violence, from
falsehoods, from stealing, from sexua=
l engagements, and from acceptance of
gifts."

Why is acceptance of gifts i=
s such a bad thing ? What about giving gifts ?
If accepting gifts is undesi=
rable, then giving gifts should also be
undesirable??

I request members to=
 share their thoughts.

Regards,
Hemanth

f good and evil is bound to persist so long as
