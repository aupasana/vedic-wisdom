 677 When one has learned to love the company of sages, why all these rules=

of discipline? When a pleasant cool southern breeze is blowing, what need =
is
there for a fan?

678 Fever is overcome by the cool light of the moon; w=
ant by the
wish-yielding tree; and sin by the holy Ganges. Those three =E2=
=80=93 fever and want
and sin =E2=80=93 all flee at the august sight of the=
 peerless sage.

679 Holy rivers, which are only water, and idols, which ar=
e made of stone
and clay, are not as mighty as the sages are. For while the=
y make one pure
in the course of countless days, the sage=E2=80=99s eye by =
a mere glance purifies at
once.

680 Bathing in the Ganges removes the sins=
 of man, not the sinner in him.
But association with a sage destroys the si=
nner also. There is nothing so
powerful to purify the mind as association w=
ith a sage.

The sage=E2=80=99s greatness is further set forth as follows.
=

681 He is the conqueror of death, of the demon of three cities, of cupid,
=
and of the demon Naraka. He is the Self of all the great gods, and all alik=
e
worship only him.

How he is the killer of the demon Tripura and of the d=
emon Naraka is
explained next.

682 Since it is through him that the three =
bodies [encompassing the Self]
exist, he is therefore the killer of Tripura=
. Because he has put an end to
the ego, he is therefore also the killer of =
Naraka.

The three bodies are the gross, subtle and causal, already stated.=
 Naraka is
the personification of the ego.

683 Since in the Gita Bhagavan =
Krishna himself says, =E2=80=98I myself am the sage,=E2=80=99
it therefore =
follows that there is none equal to or greater than he. His
greatness is im=
measurable.

684 Since the sage is God himself, his teachings are of the hi=
ghest
authority. Thereafter, and by his words alone, the Upanishads also ha=
ve
authority.

685 Since the Guru, if he is a sage, is the second form of G=
od=E2=80=99s grace, the
aspirant practising devotion to him [as to God], wi=
ll reach his goal.

Divine grace has three forms in three stages: first as =
God, then as Guru and
finally as the real Self. The above verse is based up=
on this ancient
teaching, and was repeated by Bhagavan.

686 In the sage=E2=
=80=99s presence and even far away from him there is a mysterious
power. Wh=
oever is caught hold of by it will not be let go, but will surely
be taken =
to the state of deliverance.

Therefore, those that are positively determin=
ed not to obtain deliverance,
being greatly in love with samsara, should be=
ware of sages!

687 The Guru has said, =E2=80=98Just as a fawn caught by a =
tiger becomes its food,
so, if a good man is caught by the gracious look of=
 the sage, he will surely
attain the state in which the sage dwells.=E2=80=
=99

688 Being outside he [the Guru] turns the mind of the sadhaka inwards =
and
from inside he pulls the mind into the Heart and then fixes him, by his=

power, in the supreme state.

689 That supreme state of the sage transcend=
s both words and intellect. What
has been set forth here is just a little, =
which has been vouchsafed by the
sages for the sadhaka.

690 Thus has been =
expounded the natural state of the Self, along with the
means of attainment=
 [sadhana]. Hereafter is set forth the essence of the
teachings for reflect=
ion by sadhakas.

The remainder of the work sets forth Bhagavan=E2=80=99s o=
wn commentary on the first
benedictory verse of the Forty Verses.

691 Ever=
y creature is aware of its own spectacle, the world, and its seer,
himself.=
 He understands these two as real in their own right. This delusion
is the =
cause for its samsara.

692 If the two were real in their own right, they w=
ould appear continuously.
How can something that appears at some times and =
does not appear at other
times be real?

693 This pair [the world appearanc=
e and the one who sees it] shines in dream
and waking only by the functioni=
ng of the mind. In deep sleep both of them
fail to shine. Therefore both of=
 them are mental.

694 That into which the mind goes into latency and where=
from it rises again
is alone real. That one, being without settings and ris=
ings, is real in its
own right, and is the home of deliverance for the aspi=
rant.

695 That reality named Brahman, which is only one without a second a=
nd
complete in itself, is the giver of existence to the whole world. It als=
o
gives the light of consciousness to the whole mind, which in itself lacks=

consciousness.

696 That itself dwells in the Heart of all creatures as on=
e=E2=80=99s own Self, like
a witness without thoughts, unrelated to anythin=
g. But that one is concealed
during the outward-turned state of the mind by=
 the false appearance of the
world, which is a manifestation of the mind.

=
697 Therefore, due to illusion, no one in the world knows this real Self.
B=
eing persuaded that the gross body is itself the Self, one wanders through
=
innumerable lives, suffering unhappiness.

698 This world must be discovere=
d to be the supreme, who is the real Self,
by extinction of the mind. Then =
the pure real Self will shine unhindered, as
he really is, as the sole real=
ity, Brahman.

699 If and when one makes efforts for deliverance, equipped =
with
discrimination and detachment, following the means taught by the holy =
Guru,
one becomes free from the bondage of samsara by attaining birth in on=
e=E2=80=99s own
source, Brahman.

700 By turning one=E2=80=99s thought-free=
 mind inwards and diving into the Heart in
the quest of one=E2=80=99s own r=
eal Self, by becoming free from delusion by the
extinction of the ego-mind,=
 one attains the state of deliverance. Such a one
is a sage.

The following=
 is the concluding verse.

701 To that supreme one, the Self in all creatur=
es, which became our Guru,
Sri Ramana, let there be thousands of namaskaram=
s until there comes about
the extinction of the ego.
