Subject: What are allowed ways to put out remaining fire after homam?

dear learned members, 
I am wondering if its alright to put out remaining f=
ire in homam with sprinkling water at the end? Are there any repercussions =
to it? Are there any allowed ways besides letting it burn out on its own? 
=

Thanks
Kshroum
