Dear All,

Please see Narasimha's comments on this:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1079

The short version:

> Some people hold the view that one with a living father cannot do it and
> one's father must do it instead. The other view is that anybody can do it.
>
> I subscribe to the later view.
