Respected Jhaji/ PVR ji and other Members,

Lately I came to know (and I wa=
s surprised to learn) that the earliest script
used for writing sanskit is =
Brahmi and not Devanagri! Why would the oldest
language in the world and so=
 advanced at that not have a script? Or is this
knowledge hidden from us ti=
ll date?

It is hard to imagine that such a perfect and beautiful language =
so widely used
(and maybe for secular purposes also) would not have a scrip=
t! E.g. if yantra's
were made what script were they written in?

Is it also=
 possible that we lost many precious treasures of knowledge over the
years =
as they were not written down? Writing down is somehow similar to burying
a=
 pot of gold to be recovered later on, isn't it?

Also, if Devanagari was u=
sed later on to write sanskit how come it suddenly
sprang from Brahmi? And =
came to be widely used throughout India? Who would have
spread the writing?=
 Is there any record?

Please pardon any foolish statements made above as I=
 am just curious.

Respectfully,

Girish
