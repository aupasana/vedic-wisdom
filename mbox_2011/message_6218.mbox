To the Hindu, man is not travelling from error to truth, but from truth to =
truth, from lower to higher truth. To him all the religions, from the lowes=
t fetishism to the highest absoluteism, mean so many attempts of the human =
soul to grasp and realize the Infinite, each determined by the conditions o=
f its birth and association, and each of these marks a stage of progress; a=
nd every soul is a young eagle soaring higher and higher, gathering more an=
d more strength till it reaches the glorious Sun.
