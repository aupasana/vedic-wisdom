Sannyasa should not fatten the ego and Vedanta should not make one vain and=
 hollow. Blind faith should be turned into rational faith and reason should=
 be turned into experience. As a pitiable instance at the present day, it m=
ay be pointed out that the most treacherous kind of =E2=80=9Ccomfortable re=
ligion=E2=80=9D and comfortable philosophy is being preached by many of the=
 ultra-rationalists and pedants, and it has become a fashion and a cunning =
pleasure to talk against renunciation, against the order of sannyasa. =E2=
=80=9CRenounce the ego, there is no need of abandoning family and society; =
Upanishads declare like that; Gita says like that=E2=80=9D=E2=80"this is th=
e perverted interpretation of the man of vanity and attachment, lust and gr=
eed! Man is ashamed to admit his folly in not abstaining from the loathsome=
 sensual enjoyments; he wants to lead a cowardly life of sense-indulgence, =
and tries to protect himself within the fort of crooked commentaries on the=
 philosophical scriptures. He uses philosophical argument to justify worldl=
y enjoyment. Even a devil has begun to quote the authentic scriptures in or=
der to fulfil its desires and ambitions. Examples of Janakas and Vashisthas=
 are cited as indisputable and authoritative justification for adherence to=
 family life.
