Namaste,

"Such is the power of Gyaneshwar Maharaj who moulds the conscious=
ness of all who go there."

The begger could speak out such a high practica=
l knowledge is very refreshing but there was the other begger who still loo=
ked to be money minded and suggested to beg on Abhangas.

There must be som=
e eligibility to benefit from Sant Gnyaneshwar's grace even people living i=
n Alandi around his samadhi sthana. i am sure not everyone would think like=
 the begger-saint there.

best regards,

utpal
