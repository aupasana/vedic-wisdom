The sannyasin is dead to the world and his family. The very color, the very=
 orange robe gives strength and purity. I do not believe those people who s=
ay, =E2=80=9CWe have given coloring to our hearts.=E2=80=9D This is timidit=
y and hypocrisy. If there is real internal change, the external change is b=
ound to come. You cannot be a sage inside and a rogue outside. The inner na=
ture will not allow you to keep an opposite nature outside. I do not admit =
that merely an attainment towards eradication of egoism, sankalpas and vasa=
nas, does really constitute sannyasa. The ashrama-bheda is absolutely neces=
sary. Why did sages like Shankara and Sri Ramakrishna take sannyasa? Why di=
d Yajnavalkya take sannyasa even after the realization of Brahman? Where is=
 the necessity for this order at all?

Some people say, =E2=80=9CThink for =
yourself, there is no need of spiritual rules or spiritual initiation.=E2=
=80=9D O ignorant man! How can you think for yourself? If I ask you to enqu=
ire Who am I?=E2=80=9D you will think you are Mr. so and so, born of such-a=
nd-such a person, with such a height and weight, and having such a name. Is=
 this the enquiry of =E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D Is this thinking for yours=
elf? Ignorant people cannot think for themselves.
