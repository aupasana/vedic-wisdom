How do you know that Vivekananda, Yogananda etc did not do that=
 (or possibly even more)? Because they did not mention "I did so and so" us=

Well, they not only regarded him as "higher th=
an them", but they also regarded him as the highest. They regarded him as t=

aramahamsa", who according to you is "lower" than "siddhas, nathas and rish=

Fatness is external and judgable=

My two main messages:

(1) One need=

and neither necessary nor sufficient for liberation.
(2) It is unwise to pa=

I assume because Vimalananda mentions that they are greater to each ot=

=C2=A0 
Simple! Ramakrishna says =
Vivekananda was a part of a Rishi who came down. An amsa is not a Rishi in =
fullforce, but sufficient part of the Rishi's consciousness that comes down=
 for a secific purpose and once the purpose is served, goes back to the sou=
rce. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. Therefore, very technically, Swami Vi=
vekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi, a projection of a Rishi. Not the Rishi i=
s full. BTW, all of these Siddhas, Naths, Munis etc are projection Rishis o=
ne way or the other. Each is kept is ingorance of their real being (Rishi) =
such that the play can go on (not my words, Vimalananda's words). They are =
Nitya-siddha because even if they take birth over and over, being parts of =
extremely higher beings, these emanations/projections/amsas will surely eve=
ntually go back to the source when the work is done. 
=C2=A0 
However, in t=
heir forms as specific individuals like Vivekananda, whether these amsa att=
ain the specific stages which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will determine=
 if they are to be called so. They may not need to do so since they are her=
e for a purpose. But, the only way a person can be called a siddha in true =
sense is when he, as Vimalananda puts it, "picks a petal", (some specific s=
haktis) an "orbit" and moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into =
it, deeper and deeper.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0 
There is a book of conversations betw=
een Totapuri and a certain sadhaka (his disciple) when Totapuri lived in Pu=
ri. He used to stay in the Swargadwara smashana and later someone build a s=
mall ashram for him. Totapuri's ashram still exists in Puri. In that conver=
sation, Totapuri also mentions a similar ideas of what is a siddha and high=
er. And how only a Siddha and none less is a true Vigyani. He further menti=
ons that Swami Vivekananda did not (need) to go to the stage of a Siddha. H=
is work was specific, he did the work and went off. He did not need to and =
therefore did not become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. 
=C2=A0 
Adde=
d to this the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the discipl=
es of Ramakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual being=
, and higher than them. Here too I see no confusion. 
=C2=A0 
<<It is not n=
ecessary that there is a clear order of greatness. Infinity is neither grea=

=C2=A0 
This is what I cal=

 on this matter. And my previous explanation actually clarifies this statem=

You assumed that P=
aramahamsa, Siddha, Natha (Mahasiddha) and Rishi are fixed categories and e=
xponentially "greater" than each other. You assumed that Ramakrishna is a P=
aramahamsa on that scale, because he is famously known so. Then you conclud=
ed that Vivekananda is lower than a "Paramahamsa", because he is lower than=
 Ramakrishna. You assumed that Vimalananda is a rishi because someone you r=
espect "says so". So you concluded Vivekananda is 2 and Vimalananda is 2pwr=
16. 
=C2=A0 
Now, Ramakrishna himself said that Vivekananda and six other s=
ishyas were "Ishwara Koti" or "Nitya Siddhas". Can you tell me where this f=
alls on Vimalananda's scale? What do you think "Nithya Siddha" (nithya=3Det=

Dear Narasimha, 
=C2=A0 
I=
n the discussion that happened, here is my stand, in case you have not unde=

=C2=A0 
1) He was something special - which I ca=

gement more than your or mine. 
=C2=A0 
2) Some siddhis as you noted are sp=
ecial. Only very higher level beings can attain the same. Since the topic o=
f siddhis did come up, Vimalananda's ability to suck up a ton of mercury by=
 Vajroli and bring it out from his hair infront of someone of Vishudhananda=
's spiritual calibre, is not a easy feat. This is not a run-of-the-mill sid=
dhi. 
=C2=A0 
3) I never compared Vimalananda with Ramakrishna, but with Ra=
makrishna's disciples. That is a crucial difference.=C2=A0 My comparisons a=
re always based NOT on my understanding, but clear words of great spiritual=
 people. That is why I am 100 perecent clear that Ramakrishna is spirituall=
y higher than a Vivekananada or an Abhedananda. You may not want to judge t=
hem., thats your point of view. I on the other hand would rather rely on th=
e clear words of Vivekananda and Abhedananda on this matter rather than spe=
culation. Both Vivekananda and Abhedananda used to say Ramakrishna is their=
 Guru and spiritually far higher than they were. 
=C2=A0 
4) Whether Ramakr=
ishna was a paramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda's scale is merely your sp=
eculation. Vimalananda's books however betray no such speculation. I would =
rather rely on the words of the book. 
=C2=A0 
5) In this age everyone like=
s to take a title for himself. Many spiritual people name themselves Rishis=
, and we know it they are not.=C2=A0 So the Nityananda comparison does not =
stand. Vimalananda on his part never used any titles, not even the term Gur=
u. I base my judgement of this man on a) critical study of the books b) Man=
ish's words. And I have not found you giving any sound logic for why I shou=
ld change the same. 
=C2=A0 
6) If you do not want to compare spiritual peo=
ple, that is perfectly fine. I or anyone else is not forcing you. However, =
that does not mean the world will not do so, specially when the great spiri=
tual people themselves have clearly done so on different occassions. Viveka=
nanda says Ramakrishna a greater spiritual man. I take his words as true. P=

=C2=A0 
Dear All,

Maharshi Vasishtha's teaching to =
Lord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The goal of existence and sadhana i=
s self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither specifically sought nor speci=
fically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature gives one some siddhi(s), o=
ne should accept them with neither excitement nor disappointment. But one s=
hould NOT run after them, for they are neither necessary nor sufficient for=
 self-realization and liberation. 
=C2=A0 
Vivekananda used the same princi=
ple when Ramakirishna proposed to give his siddhis to Vivekananda. He asked=
 whether the siddhis will enable him to realize god. Ramakrishna said no. V=
ivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, when Ramakrishna gave=
 them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda's two actions demonstrate=
 Vasishtha's instructions well.

Let us use=
 the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one's spiritual sadhana. =
Reaching the top is liberation. Different people climb the hill from differ=
ent sides and using different paths. There may be trees with nice fruits on=
 the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special abilities. 
=C2=A0 
If =
one gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and collecting fruits, one's=
 journey gets delayed and one may not reach the top. That is why Vasishtha =
says a seeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. 
=C2=A0 
But if some fru=
its fall in one's lap by themselves, one can keep them. Similarly, siddhis =
that come to one by themselves can be accepted by a seeker of Self. 
=C2=A0=
 
Now an important distinction: 
=C2=A0 
There are some trees that are foun=
d at lower altitudes also, but some really special trees are found at very =
high altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, it shows that one has climbed=
 great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do not mean much, but some siddhis =
are very special and only really elevated sadhakas can obtain them (whether=
 by trying or without trying). If a sadhakas demonstrates such a siddhi, yo=
u can see that one progressed a lot. However, the key is that one who climb=
ed the same or more distance may not have that or any other fruit. 
=C2=A0 =

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Unlike in the example of climbing hill, which is=
 an external activity, spiritual progress in real life is *internal*. There=
 is NO way for anyone to know for sure how much progress one has made, how =
much self-control one has internally and what exactly goes on in one's mind=
. We may try to judge it from external factors such as actions, words etc, =
but it is not necessarily accurate. 
=C2=A0 
Here, some people swayed by si=
ddhis may be tempted to use one's siddhis to judge how high one climbed. Bu=
t that is faulty. One person who reached the absolute top may not have any =
fruits, while one person who still has ways to climb may have gotten some r=
eally nice fruit. Using externaslly demonstrable siddhis that are neither n=
ecessary nor sufficient for Self-realization as a measure of one's progress=
 is unsound. 
=C2=A0 
Given that spiritual progress is internal, how can we=
 judge it and compare people then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a=
 sarvaantaryaami - a perfected being who has access to each being's interna=
l state - can do that.

Rajarshi, you are a=
ssuming that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scal=
e. You are concluding that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; Abhedananda, Vivek=
ananda etc are lower than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and hence Vimalanan=
da is superior to Abhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. 
=C2=A0 
Is P=
aramahamsa Nithyananda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa=
 because he is known so? See, how people are famously known may or may not =
reflect their spiritual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you=
 cannot see it. 
=C2=A0 
We do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really =
is. He may not be just a paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scale, but be a siddh=
a or a natha or even a rishi. He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself =
said and some religious experts of that time declared based on various sign=
s. If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda e=
tc can definitely be rishis or naths in Vimalananda's scale. If your argume=
nt is that they cannot be because they did not demonstrate siddhis compatib=
le with that status, that is a non-point as I explained above. The disagree=
ment between then boils down a difference in the relevance and importance o=
f externally demonstrated siddhis.

=C2=A0 
Why thi=
s is relevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to hav=
e misconceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing =
miracles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. 
=C2=A0 
Vasishtha =
is not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught Lord=
 Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will=
 balance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis=
 are neither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don't be distra=
cted by them or be infatuated with them. 
=C2=A0 
The goal of sadhana is th=
at your notions of "this is I and these are mine" get subtler and subtler a=
nd hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and weaker. Others ma=
y or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you know your prog=
ress and weaknesses the best. THAT is the crux and siddhis have no relevanc=
e or meaning. Any fascination for them will set you back in your sadhana.

 Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. Therefore, very technically, Swami Viveka=

 that the play can go on (not my words, Vimalananda's words). They are Nity=
