In the Yajnavalkya Smriti it is said: =E2=80=9COf all works, like sacrifice=
s, rituals, control of senses, harmlessness, charity or study of the Vedas,=
 this one thing is the highest duty: that one should seek the Self through =
Yoga. A Brahmana should not marry, he should observe brahmacharya, and, kee=
ping his power of purity, should directly take sannyasa after brahmacharya.=
 Seeing that samsara is essenceless, he should seek to get the nectar of im=
mortality.=E2=80=9D

The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad says: =E2=80=9CDesiring f=
or the state of the Self, one should renounce. Established in Brahman, one =
attains immortality.=E2=80=9D

Yajnavalkya said to Kahola: =E2=80=9CHe who =
passes beyond hunger and thirst, beyond sorrow and delusion, beyond old age=
 and death=E2=80"Brahmanas who wish to attain that Self, overcome the desir=
e for sons, desire for wealth, desire for the world, and live the life of m=
endicants.=E2=80=9D
