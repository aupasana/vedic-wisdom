Namaste all, 

Is there Any particular mantras to balance Ayurvedic doshas.=
 

Some site mentions as follows, I am not sure thats why asking.

=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

If you are a Vata, your mant=
ra is Ram (pronounced "Rahm"). Its purpose is to help boost your immune sys=
tem and alleviate fear and anxiety.

If you are a Pitta, your mantra is Shr=
im (pronounced "Shreem"). Its purpose is to promote general health and harm=
ony.

If you are a Kapha, your mantra is Hum (pronounced "Hoom"). Its purpo=
se is clearing and stimulating.
