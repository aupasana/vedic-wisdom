For a long time, I wanted to teach homam locally and was thinking of going =
to a local temple and teaching homam. On a second thought, I thought, inste=
ad of we seeking out people interested in learning, letting them seek us ma=
y be more beneficial.

I have created a table in this group where people wh=
o are willing to spend time to teach homam in their respective locations.

=
I have entered myself for Chennai, India. Likewise, others can enter the de=
tails and Narasimha can perhaps add this contact list on his Homam page.
