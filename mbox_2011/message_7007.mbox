For a beginner in the spiritual path, a Guru is necessary. To light a candl=
e, you need a burning candle. Even an illumined soul alone can enlighten an=
other soul.

Some do meditation for some years independently. Later on, the=
y actually feel the necessity of a Guru. They come across some obstacles in=
 the way. They are unable to know how to obviate these impediments or stumb=
ling blocks. Then they begin to search for a Master.

Only the man who has =
already been to Badrinath will be able to tell you the road. In the case of=
 the spiritual path, it is still more difficult to find your way. The mind =
will mislead you very often. The Guru will be able to remove pitfalls and o=
bstacles, and lead you along the right path. He will tell you: "This road l=
eads you to Moksha (liberation); this one leads to bondage". Without this g=
uidance, you might want to go to Badrinath, but find yourself in Delhi!

Th=
e scriptures are like a forest. There are ambiguous passages. There are pas=
sages which are apparently contradictory. There are passages which have eso=
teric meanings, diverse significance, and hidden explanations. There are cr=
oss-references. You are in need of a Guru or Preceptor who will explain to =
you the right meaning, who will remove doubts and ambiguities, who will pla=
ce before you the essence of the teachings.
