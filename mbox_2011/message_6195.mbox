We cannot add happiness to this world; similarly, we cannot add pain to it =
either. The sum total of the energies of pleasure and pain displayed here o=
n earth will be the same through out. We just push it from this side to the=
 other side, and from that side to this, but it will remain the same, becau=
se to remain so is its very nature. This ebb and flow, this rising and fall=
ing, is in the world?s very nature; it would be as logical to hold otherwis=
e as to say that we may have life without death.
