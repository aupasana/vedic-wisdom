Let me respond to how HareKrsnas do.

Ekadasi is a complete fasting day, no=
 water too.

If one cannot stay away from water, take water.

If one cannot=
 stay away from food, eat non-grains; SrilaPrabhupada mentions it as milk, =
fruits and nuts.

For people who cannot fast completely on an ekadasi, the =
complete no-water fasting is done on Nirjala ekadasi.

The fast breaking is=
 done at the sunrise of the next day (dwAdasi or trayodasi) based on how ti=
this overlap.

Ekadasi is meant to be a very spiritual day and that should =
take precedence over what is eaten and what is not. 

Once Srila BhaktiSidd=
hanta Saraswati saw his disciples sleeping in the noon as they felt weak as=
 they were fasting. He asked them to take khichdi and do Krsna kirtan :-)
