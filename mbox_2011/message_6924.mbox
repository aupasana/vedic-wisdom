Alone and unbefriended, the sannyasin should roam about for working out the=
 emancipation of his self. Houseless, bereft of the sacred fire, desireless=
, indifferent and speechless, he should maintain perfect equanimity. Life a=
nd death he must not court; like a servant waiting for the receipt of his s=
alary he must patiently wait for the time of emancipation.

Always contempl=
ating on Brahman, non-attached to anything of the world, and desiring nothi=
ng both here and hereafter, he should, in the company of his Self alone, ro=
am about in the world, for the bliss of emancipation. He should court peace=
 and live in peace, for peace is bliss, and peace is his ideal.

Vessels ma=
de of gourds, wood, earth or bamboo, should be used by the fourth order of =
ascetics . After the hearths of the householders have ceased to emit smoke,=
 after pestles and mortars have been laid aside for the day, after the hear=
th-fires have been extinguished, after the householders have all taken thei=
r meals, and plates with leavings have been cast away, then should an ascet=
ic (sannyasin) stroll out for alms, each day in the afternoon.
