R Bhai, namaste

Some flyash is usually generated when burning the material=
. As pointed out,
using the right amount of ghee helps to minimize it. You =
can also keep the
homa kundam near a window so that the flyash goes that wa=
y. Do you have a
garage? If yes, you can do the homam there.

If this is yo=
ur first homam, then why don't you start with a MahaGanapati
homam before g=
raduating to a Sani homam?

best regards
Hari

      <div>I have done Sani homam for the=
