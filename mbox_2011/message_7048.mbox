Namaste Narasimhaji,

Thank you so much for your lucid explanations of thes=
e key points, which are
important though subtle. This is in perfect consona=
nce with what I have
learned from my guru and various acharyas from whom I =
have been privileged
to learn. For moksha, even samadhi is not required, le=
t alone any siddhis.

Warm regards,
Aditi
