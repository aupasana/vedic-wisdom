Namaskar PVR ji and other Learned Members,
I am interested in learning the =
process/Ritual/Mantra's etc. for Pinda dana to Pitrus. Can some of you help=
 me in locating books/links etc. 

If in a family no yearly Pinda has been =
done ever, doing Tarpana alone will suffice or Pinda Daana is must? 

Regar=
ds,
Aashish
