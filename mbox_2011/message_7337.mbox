Namaste,

i wish all of u a very auspicious Navaratri and my pranams to my =
elders here.

i plan to do my first chandi homa on astami tithi of Durga Pu=
ja.I have materials enuff to sustain the fire for 2-3hours but not more.
Al=
so i am not proficient with the entire Chandi Saptashati.i have learnt to r=
ecite the kavacha,argala,keelaka and Devi stutis
in chapters 1,5 and 11,Dur=
ga Saptashloki,Devi suktam and Durga Suktam.

i have a few questions:

1.Is=
 it ok to offer the parts of Saptashati i am proficient with  ???
The homam=
 manual says that swaha is supposed to be added to argala,keelaka and the s=
hlokas of the chapters but not in case 
of Devi Suktam and Devi Kavacha.Sho=
uld a swaha be appended to the lines of Durga Suktam as well or not ??
what=
 about Devi Atharvasheersham ???

2.After the prana pratishtha of Ma Chandi=
 and offerings to parivara devatas,is it compulsory to do the 
shap vimocha=
n mantras nyasas and Navarna Mantra japa ?.I ask this because i cant offer =
the entire chandi saptashati shlokas to agni.

3.In the Gita press edition =
of Chandi,in the end 32 names of Ma Durga are given,is it ok to offer the i=
ndividual names of 
Devi to fire like ::"Durga Durgatishamani Durgapadviniv=
arini" be offered as
Om Durgayei namah swaha
Om Durgatishaminyei namah swah=
a
Om Durgapadvinivarinyei namah swaha

etc.??

4.While doing the homa,is it=
 ok to just chant the Durga-Ashottarashatanama without making offerings? 

=
4.The Durga Saptashloki in the beginning has a samkalpam.i plan to offer it=
 11 times.Shud i change the  "Durgaprityartham saptashloki-durga PATHE vini=
yoga"
to "Durgaprityartham saptashloki-durga HOMEY viniyoga" ???

5.Is it o=
k to offer the mahaganapati mool mantra
 "om shreem hreem kleem gloum gam g=
anapataye varvaradasarvajanam me vashamanaya swaha" in the count mentioned =
4/8/12 when the
step of quick homam for mahaganapati comes up ??


Eagerly =
waiting for help. :)

Thanking You All,
Parijat Dutta
