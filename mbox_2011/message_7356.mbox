 --The Mountain Path, July 1982

I had the great privilege of being born in=
 a family which was deeply devoted
to Bhagavan Ramana.My grandparents, Sri =
M. Ramu Setty and Smt.Muniammal,
would take me for Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s d=
arshan.

Thus I started visiting the Maharshi right from my childhood. Bein=
g a native
of Tiruvannamaiai,it was my great good fortune that I was able t=
o have
Bhagavan=E2=80=99s darshan till His Mahasamadhi in 1950.

When Bhaga=
van was staying at Virupaksha Cave, devotees would come to town
singing Aks=
haramanamalai. We would eagerly wait for their arrival to offer
them cooked=
 food. Only after such offering would we eat. This continued
without a day=
=E2=80=99s break till Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mother started cooking at Skandash=
ram.
Our house was open to devotees of Bhagavan at all times.

Even while B=
hagavan was at Virupaksha Cave, occasionally we used to go there
and offer =
biksha. On one such occasion the leaf-plates we had brought were
just enoug=
h for the devotees present and there was none for me. Being young,
I starte=
d crying. Bhagavan called me and coming to know the reason, consoled
me by =
providing me with a leaf. Bhagavan understood a child=E2=80=99s feelings, a=
nd
He has been gracious to me throughout my life!

It was Bhagavan who intr=
oduced me into religious texts. Once Bhagavan wrote
the first verse of Daks=
hinamurti Stotra on a slip of paper and told me to
learn it by heart and re=
peat it on my next visit.Thus I learnt the
Dakshinamurti Stotra. I would of=
ten forget the first word of a verse and
Bhagavan would help me. Then writi=
ng down the first word of each verse of
Dakshinamurti Stotra, Bhagavan gave=
 me the slip of paper to help remember
the sequence.

On the first of each =
Tamil month I would go round the Hill along with my
mother, and on the way =
we would walk into the Ashram to pay homage to
Bhagavan who would receive u=
s with a smile and sometimes ask us to take
breakfast. Once, when as usual =
two iddlies were served on my plate, I asked
for one more.

Bhagavan turned=
 to me and said that I could have one more after eating the
two. When I had=
 finished eating them, Bhagavan asked whether I would like to
have more, an=
d I replied No. Bhagavan, said with a smile: Why did you ask
for more even =
before starting to eat? Thus Bhagavan taught the lesson that
one should not=
 be greedy.

When my mother passed away, I went to the Ashram to convey the=
 news to
Bhagavan. Bhagavan graciously looked at me and relieved me of my i=
ntense
grief.Bhagavan smilingly told me that my mother was as old as his st=
ay at
Arunachala. With folded hands I prayed to Bhagavan to protect our fam=
ily,
and He graciously nodded His head by way of approval.

Bhagavan was no=
t merely a spiritual Master of the highest order, but our
mother, our fathe=
r and our all!
