Vashat, Vaushat etc are like swaha, swadha =
etc- used at different times. Do not 
look for meaning in these individual =
words or phrases. 


I have explained what the intention is. None of this i=
s asking for power. Indeed 
there is no power in the universe which is outs=
ide oneself- again this is a 
simplification.

Dont get lost in the forest =
of intellectual understanding. 
Practice.....intellectual understanding by =
itself is useless( just as knowing 
how an internal combustion engine works=
 does not make one the owner of a car).

These words may not be packaged as=
 well as they can be- its a bit late and the 
flowery speech part has gone =
to sleep :-)
