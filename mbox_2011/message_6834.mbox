Dear Chaitanya,

You first learn basic arithmetic ... then you reach a poin=
t where you
are fit to study algebra, calculus or geometry. Similarly, you =
first
need to pick up basic Sanskrit skills, then you can put them to use i=
n
the manner of your choosing. Narasimha once wrote "Whether the final
dest=
ination is Delhi or Agra or Benares, one at Kanya Kumari will have
to first=
 start walking towards north".

In my opinion, start with one of the organi=
zations that teaches
conversational sanskrit (eg. Samskrita Bharati). They =
take a nice
staged approach ... most importantly, they have made it fun. I
=
personally know many people who studied using this method ... with the
aid =
of readily available sanskrit commentaries, they are easily able to read
gi=
ta, kalidasa and even some veda mantras. Many of these students are
now stu=
dying for their MA Sanskrit degree.

Basic sanskrit skills are relatively e=
asy ... you can make significant
progress in the beginning with minimal eff=
ort. If you are in the US or
India, definitely attend one of Samskrita Bhar=
ati's residential camps
(they have classes at all levels, including classes=
 for beginners).
You'll get to meet many people who are the product of this=
 system.
You'll believe it when you hear it and start speaking it :-)

[ If=
 you are in the US, there are three more Samskrita Bharati
residential camp=
s taking place in 2011. (i) Seattle at the end of
July, (ii) Michigan at th=
e beginning of August and (iii) New Jersey in
the beginning of September. S=

sasneham,
