Namaste,

Pingala nadi (solar channel) is the channel of the hot fire of 
discrimination. Ida nadi (lunar channel) is the channel of the soothing 
comfort of feeling. The mantra you do and the praanaayaama you do may 
have a small impact on which channel tends to open more, but the primary 
influence will be your basic attitude and aptitude. Ida nadi is more 
likely to open in a humble, emotional and relaxed person. Pingala nadi 
is more likely to open in a logical, analytical and intelligent person. 
Thus, targeting a nadi with praanaayaama and mantra does not add much 
value.

Gayatri mantra tends to open up Pingala more. Shiva mantras (e.g. 
Panchakshari) tend to open Ida more. However, it also depends on how you 
visualize your god. For example, does Shiva stand for a relaxed mahayogi 
in bliss to you or the fiery Rudra of destruction?

*        *        *

Moreover, the goal is not to make shakti flow through Ida or Pingala 
anyway. The goal is that shakti flows through Sushumna nadi in the 
middle. All the higher worlds and deities in them lie within Sushumna 
nadi. Depending on the nature of mantra and your nature, Ida or Pingala 
may open more and some vaayu may be flowing through it. But, when 
Kundalini gets awakened oneday, Sushumna may also open and Kundalini may 
shoot up through Sushumna.

Many people referring to Kundalini in higher chakras/nadis are actually 
talking about the flow of vaayus there. Most people talking about 
Kundalini have not experienced Kundalini itself in higher chakras.

Kundalini shakti is one's self-awareness. Shakti meeting Shiva is a 
metaphor for individual self-awareness (shakti) merging in cosmic self 
(Shiva). A vaishnava may also view it as a Gopi meeting Krishna.

*        *        *

Shakti will not rise unless one's awareness of physical body disappears. 
The instruction of some teachers to focus on a particular chakra or a 
particular body part to force Kundalini to rise is not wise. As long as 
you think "I am the body. Inside this body, there is a chakra or a body 
part. I will focus on that part inside this body", your self-awareness 
is unlikely to rise above the physical body. In other words, your 
Kundalini is stuck in the mooladhara chakra corresponding to the 
physical realm.

Wanting Kundalini to rise to X or Y chakra is unproductive. It never 
happens that way. Whenever I had expected or anticipated something, 
nothing happened. Things happened spontaneously only when my mind was 
nearly empty and the focus on mantra/god became so intense that it 
filled my mind. In fact, when I first experienced a Kundalini rise, I 
did not even know much about Kundalini and chakras and considered all 
those concepts as dirty Tantrik ideas that I wanted to do have nothing 
to do with. Only after experiencing did I understand what it was 
intellectually. Thus, intellectual analysis of Kundalini and chakras and 
trying to manipulate them is unnecessary and, in fact, 
counter-productive. If you want Kundalini to rise, do not even think in 
terms of Kundalini and chakras.

*        *        *

Kundalini rises when and only when your self-awareness rises above the 
physical body. The key is to forget that you are the body. The key is to 
NOT think that you are (or you are not) the body. The key is to forget 
about the body completely. The key is to immerse the mind so deeply in 
the mantra/deity that you forget everything else.

And then patience. By being in a hurry that your Kundalini should rise, 
you will only ensure that Kundalini remains in Mooladhara forever. As I 
said, stop thinking in terms of shakti and chakras, if shakti were to 
really rise.

Best regards,
Narasimha
