Namaste Jitender,

If pieces fall out of Kunda, put it back in Kundam. If L=
amp (Deepam flame) goes off, Light it again. If Fire goes off in the midst =
of Homam, reignite it back with a prayer of forgiveness. All theses things =
are ok. no need to worry in my opinion.

One useful information about Dry c=
oconut peices. Once can keep cocnut pieces such that Dark part remains abov=
e (I mean the skin remains upside) and do not keep one above the other like=
 stacking them. adjust them in such a way that there is some hollow space. =
This will help in burning properly and you may not need to turn them and ad=
just them frquently. only 2 to 3 times in entire Homam.

Best Regards,

Utp=
al
