Namaste,

Just finished a pleasant Maha Ganapati Homam. Since it is relevan=
t to the topic, wish to add my 2 cent...

"Sopari" (Betel Nut) is one good =
item to offer as a Purnaahuti. Especially for those, who are doing homam in=
 close apartment with dry coconut pieces. Somebody suggested me to offer it=
 in Homam long back and since then I usually offer it every time along with=
 a Dry Coconut Half. I did not realize initially the purport of the suggest=
ion but after more than a year of offering, i understood the meaning. Sopar=
i is an extremely hard substance-Very difficult to break. Symbolical of our=
 false Ego and Pride. our patterns & Habits. However one caution! If one st=
arts offering it as purnaahuti then one may need to be ready to face situat=
ions where in Ego is hurt, Insults are mounted, feathers are ruffled. One m=
ay be tested badly so that ultimately pride for anything is crushed.

Regar=
ds,

Utpal
