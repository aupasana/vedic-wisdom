If we take above mentioned ending =
parts of the Stuti from Devas (DS 5th Ch), it interestingly throws light on=
 some truths at various levels.

1)	We bow to the Goddess who pervades the =
whole creation as the form of Mother
Then Deva say:
2)	We bow to the goddes=
s who pervades the whole creation as power of illusion born out of ignoranc=
e (Bhraanti).
Lastly they say:
3)	We bow to the goddess who pervades the wh=
ole creation as the formless intelligence.

The above 3 verses makes very l=
ast part of the prayer of Devas (5th chapter) and they remind me a signific=
ant incident in Thakur's life. He was trying hard to break in to the suprem=
e realm of Nirvikalpa Samadhi uder guidance of his Guru Totapuri but every =
time he attempted to enter THAT, a well adored form of Mother Kali came in =
between and he could not succeed much to the irritation of the Naagaa Sadhu=
. Finally Ramakrishna resolved and with Sharp sword of Discrimination & wis=
dom cut through the form of Mother Kali and entered in to the zone of Nirvi=
kalpa i.e. merged in the formless Brahman.

To my mind, Durga saptashati in=
dicates the different layers of the spiritual truths in a simple way. Hold =
on to a Form of Deity and the deity will over show that everything in creat=
ion is Maya including the form of the deity and lastly one will realize the=
 Brahman wich pervades everything or realization of nothing except 1.
