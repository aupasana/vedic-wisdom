Dear Rajarshi,

I am aware that you are using full green coconut as Purnahu=
ti.

What i wish to know from you is that do you feel that green coconut ca=
n be tried in the Homam done with Dry coconuts?

I am thinking for some tim=
es to at least try out once with My 10 inch Homam Container. I know it will=
 not be a practical idea though.

Any time do you faced situation where in =
you needed to burn the same green coconut in the next day homam?

Best Rega=
rds,

Utpal
