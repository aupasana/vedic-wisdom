I have a routine that includes my one hour yoga session, following which I =
shower and pray. Even if I am up at 5:30 it is 7am before I can shower.

Ot=
her family members also want to attend the homam, and so by the time they j=
oin, it is nearly 7:30am. Is it bad to delay the start of the homam procedu=
re?

Some learned people, please share your opinion.
Thanks in advance
