Subject: Introducing a PhD student of Durga Saptashati / Chandi
X-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=360119564; y=sV7dVsjG79b-oPdR0u9x219bdAbrmFkEuiRQxMAnSZkeMSH6iGrguJvAoWA

Dear all, Namaste,

This would be very very interesting to our group here.

Charu Sharma is a student of Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya, Haridwar. 
She has done a PhD from the same institute in "Different dimensions of 
Yoga in Shri Durgasaptasati- An Analytical Study". She has based her 
whole research on Chandi or Durga Saptashati.

She is also very interested in Yagya/Homam and use of Gayatri Mantra in 
Yagya.

Her research thesis has six chapters:

Introduction on Shakti Puja, Gyanayoga
Bhaktiyoga
Kundaliniyoga/Tantrayoga
Mantrayoga
Scientific part
In last conclusion

Now this work had published in a book

I think she would and the group would tremendously benefit from the 
interactions we have with the very learned members here.

She is about to open up a yahoo account to join this group and is eager 
to share and discuss about her work. Till she does join this group, 
people can contact her directly on the gmail address above.

Thanks,

Chaitanya
