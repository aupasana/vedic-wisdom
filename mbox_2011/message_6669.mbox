Namaste,
=C2=A0
I am sorry for this=C2=A0posting as this forum is no=
t for health problems but on a quick note diet seems to be the culprit for =
OCD. First cut down on all caffeinated products tea coffee chocolates etc i=
ncluding meat onions and garlic. They all are stimulants and trigger brain =
activity. I know someone who ate Ashwagandha for restless mind....that calm=
ed his mind immediately. Do some exercise also. 
=C2=A0
Good luck,
Priya
