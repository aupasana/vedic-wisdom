much about burning of the fire while you are meditating if you have offered=
 Purnahuthi and have completed the homam..
you meditate without any break a=
nd do not bother about the fire..before starting your meditation, make sure=
 you have put enough ghee and a decent fire going..so that all the material=
s will be burnt.even if they are not burnt completely and the fire is put o=
ff..try and do your next homam as quickly as possible and burn all the rema=
ins..
