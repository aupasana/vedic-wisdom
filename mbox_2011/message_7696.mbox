Dear Sirs,

Q1: If I'd like to put a kalasam for the homam, is there any ad=
ditional procedure required in addition to the ones given in Narasimha sir'=
s manual? How do we invoke the presence of the deity, for eg. Mahaganapathi=
 in the Kalasam?

Q2: The Ganapati moola mantra ie. Om Shrim Hrim ... Svaha=
, ends with the word "svaha". When doing offerings in fire we chant Svaha w=
ith double intonation at the end of all the mantras. However, in the case o=
f this mantra, the manual and also the audio sample makes an exception and =
the mantra is just chanted without the double intonation "svaha" at the end=
 of it. Is this intentional? I heard the chant online during my search wher=
e that person chants the mantra with additional "svaha" at the end of the m=
antra. Kindly advise which is correct and to be followed when doing the hom=
am referring to the manual?


Regards,
Anoop.
