 373 One self-shining consciousness, independent of all else, which is the
=
real Self, is alone real. There is no other consciousness. Therefore, this
=
soul is not consciousness.

374 But the soul is taken as being conscious, d=
ue to the admixture of the
consciousness of the real Self. Therefore Vedant=
ins call this unreal soul
=E2=80=98the illusory consciousness=E2=80=99.

37=
5 Just as someone, coming in uninvited at a marriage, claiming to be a
comr=
ade of the bridegroom, obtains an honourable reception from the bride=E2=80=
=99s
family, so this soul is accepted at its face value by the ignorant.

3=
76 The pretend bridegroom=E2=80=99s comrade runs away of his own accord as =
soon as
an enquiry is started by the bride=E2=80=99s party, questioning =E2=
=80=98Who is he? Whence
did he come?=E2=80=99 In the same way, this soul fl=
ees of his own accord when an
enquiry is made as to who he is, or whence he=
 has come.

377 This soul has really no form of its own. It is like a ghost=
 haunting a
house, this body. Therefore, [our] Guru says that it [the soul]=
 is just a
ghost appointed to guard the body.

378 Bhagavan, our Guru, make=
s clear the unreality of this soul, saying that
when the supreme state is w=
on by the quest [of the Self], there is no form
of this soul found survivin=
g.

379 The first thought of the mind is this ego-sense. From it arise all =
other
thoughts. Hence this soul is itself mind, the subtle body, the world,=

worldly life, and bondage =E2=80=93 nothing else.

380 Both bondage and th=
e bound one are only this soul. There is no other who
can be said to be bou=
nd. The real Self is ever-free, and the sole reality.
How can it be said th=
at he became bound?

381 As soon as this one named =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is b=
orn, there is born also along with it
the whole world. When it becomes late=
nt, the world also vanishes. Hence the
world is said to be its form.

382 T=
hough this great being, the real Self, is dearest to all and of great
splen=
dour, it does not shine unmistakably, for its light appears to be
stolen by=
 this evil one who has the form of the ego.

383 Though unreal, this one na=
med jiva [individual self] covers up the truth
of the Self. So, the Self, b=
eing wrongly conceived through a variety of
false imaginations, is as good =
as lost for the ignorant man.

384 The mass of clouds, generated by the lig=
ht of the sun, conceals the form
of the sun. In the same way, this jiva, bo=
rn as it is by the light of
consciousness of the Self, conceals the Self.

=
This explains why the real Self remains unknown.

385 Revelation accuses hi=
m, who by his ego-sense has stolen the real Self,
and who suffers for that =
sin, saying: =E2=80=98What sin is there that has not been
committed by that=
 thief of the Self?=E2=80=99

386 The Master says =E2=80=98original sin=E2=
=80=99, affirmed to be the cause of death by the
Christians, is not an act =
done by the first man, but only the sense =E2=80=98I am
the body=E2=80=99.
=

387 This sin is said to pertain to man, but men are not men in deep sleep.=

The sense of being a man is due to the identification of oneself with the
=
body. Consequently, the original sin is only this identification of oneself=

as the body.

388 All loss, all vice, and all suffering are only due to th=
e sense of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.
All gain, all virtue and all happiness come=
 from the extinction of the ego.

389 To the ignorant one the Self is lost =
on account of his ego sense.
Therefore, even if he gains all things, he is =
still poor. On the other hand
the sage, who has gained his Self by the exti=
nction of the ego, sees nothing
else to be gained.

Now the question whethe=
r there are many selves is considered.

390 Those who think that the body i=
s real and consequently come to believe
that the soul itself is the real Se=
lf, affirm the plurality of selves,
misconceiving the meaning of the texts =
of the Vedanta.

391 Deluded men who have not heard the truth of the suprem=
e state argue in
vain, saying that if there is only one Self, then there is=
 a dilemma: either
by the deliverance of one all will be delivered, or none=
 will attain
deliverance.

392 There is no objection to jivas being conceiv=
ed as many, but the view of
the plurality of the real Self is unacceptable.=
 The jivas are many and
unreal, but the Self is real, auspicious and only o=
ne.

Some of those that affirm the manyness of the Self also say that the s=
elves
(jivas) are fractions of the Supreme Being, the Self of all. This is =
next
dealt with.

393 There are no real fragments of the one supreme consci=
ousness. The
fragments appear only because of ignorance. To the sage in the=
 supreme
state, that consciousness shines as one whole, not divided into pa=
rts.

The experience of the sage is conclusive on all points. Here is given=
 an
utterance of Bhagavan on this point.

394 Consciousness is one, omnipre=
sent and equal. Its unequal distribution is
only an illusion. And because s=
pace is unreal, its equal distribution is
also unreal.

=E2=80=98One consci=
ousness, equally distributed everywhere; you through illusion
give it unequ=
al distribution; no distribution, no everywhere=E2=80=9D. These were
the wo=
rds uttered by Bhagavan to an earnest American sadhaka, Mr Hague.

It shoul=
d be remembered that the supreme reality which is the Self has three
unique=
 names, namely sat, chit and ananda, and is referred to by one, or
two, or =
all the three names together. These names, it is explained by
Bhagavan, mus=
t be understood as denying their opposites, and not giving a
positive descr=
iption of the indescribable. Thus, sat means not asat
(non-being); chit mea=
ns not achit (unconsciousness); and ananda means not
unhappiness.

395 It h=
as been clearly taught by the Master that the supreme consciousness
remains=
 whole, not divided into parts. Let disciples of non-sages be
deluded. How =
can there be delusion for us on this point?

396 Since it is settled that t=
he one named jiva does not exist, how can we
think of its bondage or delive=
rance? There is neither bondage nor
deliverance for the real Self, who rema=
ins unswervingly whole and solitary.

This point will be dealt with later.
=

397 The soul comes to be taken as real by the failure to discriminate
righ=
tly. This occurs when there is false identification between the body,
which=
 is limited in space and time, and the Self, which is only
consciousness, u=
nlimited by space and time.

398 First one assumes that one particular body=
 is =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. Then one assumes that
the body is real. Once this =
happens, the ignorant man sees other bodies as
being real, and sees differe=
nt jivas in them.

399 The one real Self, being really undivided, is taken =
as being divided
into parts in many bodies, which are all unreal. The ignor=
ant one looks upon
that whole, formless Self as having form and therefore a=
lso as being many.

400 As a seer of a cinema-show, seeing a new picture ev=
ery moment, thinks
them all to be one, so the ignorant man seeing a new bod=
y every moment,
thinks that all of them are one and the same.

In a cinema-=
show there is a long roll of small pictures that pass
successively at a rap=
id rate between the light inside and the magnifying
lens, about thirty-two =
pictures being thus projected on the screen
successively each second. But t=
he seer thinks he is seeing one single
picture all the time, but one that i=
s slowly changing. The world picture is
also made up of a successive stream=
 of separate pictures on the retina
inside the eye; but people think it is =
all one continuous spectacle.

401 All the time, at every moment, his mind =
is imagining a new soul in a new
body. Hence, the sages say that this soul =
is both momentary and unreal.

402 The man who has not experienced his own =
real Self, thinking =E2=80=98I am this
body=E2=80=99, sees himself as =E2=
=80=98I=E2=80=99, the first person of grammar. He sees another
person whom =
he calls =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99, and refers to third persons as =E2=80=98he=
=E2=80=99.

Thus the one real Self becomes =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in one body,=
 =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99 in another body and
=E2=80=98he=E2=80=99 in a third =
body. It follows that these distinctions arise from the
primary ignorance.
=

403 These three distinct persons are not real. They are seen on account of=

the false notion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. When the ego-soul is los=
t as a result of
the quest of the real Self, only that Self, consciousness =
alone, will shine.

404 To one who thinks himself to be a jiva or a body, a=
 plurality of jivas
will appear. But to the sage who is freed from this ign=
orance, no jiva will
appear.
This is next illustrated by the simile of the =
cinema show.

405 On the lighted screen there pass women and men in great n=
umber, who are
only pictures. So too on the screen of consciousness, which =
is the real
Self, there pass a great many souls, who are only mental projec=
tions.

406 The lighted screen is similar to the Self, and the pictures pro=
jected
onto it are like the jivas. The appearance of a plurality of jivas d=
oes not
affect the final truth of experience, the oneness of the Self.

407=
 A person believes in the plurality of jivas by believing that the jiva
is =
the real Self. He does not know the experience of the real Self because
he =
has been misled by his belief in multiplicity.

Another simile is next empl=
oyed to clarify this truth, the plurality of
reflections of a single object=
.

408 In the waters of separate vessels there appear many different images=
 of
the one moon. Similarly, in the minds that inhabit bodies there appear =
many
jivas, which are only reflected images of the one real Self.

409 As t=
he real moon is only one, so the real Self is only one. As there are
many r=
eflections of the moon, so there are seen a great many jivas.

Now the ridd=
le of deliverance is solved.

410 When one reflected image of the moon is l=
ost, the other images go on
appearing as before. Similarly, when one pseudo=
-consciousness dies, the
others continue to appear as before, even though t=
hey are unreal.

411 Whoever obtains awareness of the real Self, for him th=
is worldly life
comes to an end. The others continue to wander here as befo=
re, remaining
without awareness of the real Self.

412 This illustration ha=
s been vouchsafed by sages to men of immature minds,
who have false knowled=
ge. But this discussion can have no meaning at all for
those who realise th=
e unreality of the individual soul.

413 In dreams a multitude of jivas cre=
ated by mental delusion appear. In
just the same way, a multitude of these =
jivas appear in the waking state.

 the moon, so there are seen a great many jivas.<br><br>Now the riddle of d=
eliverance is solved.<br><br>410 When one reflected image of the moon is lo=
st, the other images go on appearing as before. Similarly, when one pseudo-=
consciousness dies, the others continue to appear as before, even though th=
ey are unreal.<br>

<br>411 Whoever obtains awareness of the real Self, for=
 him this worldly life comes to an end. The others continue to wander here =
as before, remaining without awareness of the real Self.<br><br>412 This il=
lustration has been vouchsafed by sages to men of immature minds, who have =
false knowledge. But this discussion can have no meaning at all for those w=
ho realise the unreality of the individual soul.<br>

<br>413 In dreams a m=
ultitude of jivas created by mental delusion appear. In just the same way, =
a multitude of these jivas appear in the waking state.<br><br><span style=
