The Vedic scriptures are a vast collection of hundreds of sacred Sanskrit=

y. The exact nature, contents and purpose of these ancient scriptures, howe=
ver, remain unnecessarily shrouded in esoteric mystery for all too many spi=

nature of these powerful texts, uncovers the wisdom =
contained in them, and reveals aspects of Vedic spirituality that have been=
 unknown to almost all followers and teachers of Sanatana Dharma until now.=
 If you can understand the scriptures of Sanatana Dharma, you then possess =
the very foundation of spiritual realization.<br>
