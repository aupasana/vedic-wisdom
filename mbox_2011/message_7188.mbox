Dear learned members,
  Temples here in USA are usually closed between 12 P=
M - 4 PM over weekdays. Is there a true religious reasoning behind it or ju=
st a commercial one (resting time for pujari's and cleanup)? 
 Is it okay t=
o do homam during this time? Or a more general question would be that is th=
ere a day/time when homam should be avoided (for a better time)? If this wa=
s answered previously , i apologize for reasking!

 Thank you and god bless=
 you all!

Regards
Kshroum
