 103 Bhagavan, our Guru, has said: =E2=80=98The world laughs at the ignoran=
t man,
saying, =E2=80=9CHow can you know me properly unless you know yourse=
lf correctly?=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

By this it is meant that the disciple must=
 be humble, knowing the
limitations of his own intelligence. Without this h=
umility he cannot be a
true disciple.

The next verse is an introduction to=
 the detailed exposition by Bhagavan of
the truth concerning the world.

10=
4 Bhagavan, our Guru, being a sage, expounds the unreality of the world by
=
showing that the perception of the world takes place in ignorance.
Therefor=
e, the objector=E2=80=99s argument =E2=80=93 that the world is real because=
 he sees
it =E2=80=93 does not avail to prove his contention.

The ignorant=
 man=E2=80=99s vision of the world is vitiated by the fact of his
ignorance=
 of his own real Self. This point has been repeatedly pointed out
by Bhagav=
an. To know the world aright, one must first know oneself aright.

The vers=
es that follow show how the seeing of the world is affected and
falsified b=
y the primary ignorance.

105 Every creature first identifies his own Self =
with the body, and thereby
concludes that the body is real. Then it comes t=
o believe that all forms
that are seen are also real.

Whatever is seen is =
a form. The initial question therefore is whether forms
are real. Everyone =
who sees comes to the conclusion that all forms are real.
But the first ste=
p in the process of coming to this conclusion is the
mistaken impression th=
at the body is the Self.

True knowledge begins with the understanding that=
 the body is not the Self.
In truth, the Self is formless, so whatever is s=
een is for that very reason
not the Self. Though the Self is indubitably re=
al, that reality is instead
ascribed to the body. So, a part of the world i=
s mistakenly concluded to be
real. This and the succeeding verses are a com=
mentary on the fourth verse of
Ulladu Narpadu.

106 Therefore all forms are=
 unreal. To the sage they are not real. What
really exists is formless. In =
right awareness nothing has form.This is
further explained as follows:

107=
 By a single act of vision the ignorant man sees both himself and the
world=
 as forms. Since this seeing is illusory, there is no evidence to prove
tha=
t the world is real.

108 One=E2=80=99s own body and the world are one [ind=
ivisible] spectacle; either
they are both seen together, or they are both n=
ot seen. Does anyone see this
world without at the same time seeing the bod=
y, which is the form ascribed
to the Self?

This fact, that neither the bod=
y, nor the world, is seen apart from the
other, is something we have never =
noticed before. We come to know of it for
the first time only when the fact=
 is pointed out by Bhagavan. Since the Self
is really formless, the whole s=
pectacle is suspect, since it is indivisible.

It may be objected that we s=
ee the dream world without a body. The answer to
this follows.

109 If it i=
s said that we see the dream world without bodies, [the response
is] that t=
here is a body [for the soul] in all the three states. The soul is
never bo=
diless.
Here it is the soul that is spoken of, not the Self. The two are no=
t the
same in Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teachings, as will be seen in due course. =
This and the
succeeding verses give the meaning of the fifth verse of Ullad=
u Narpadu.

110 Every creature has three bodies, a gross one, a subtle one =
and a causal
one: the mind is the subtle body, and ignorance itself is call=
ed the causal
body.

111 The three bodies mentioned here are also enumerate=
d as the five sheaths.
The middle three sheaths are the [same as the] subtl=
e body, and the last
sheath is stated to be the causal body.

The gross phy=
sical body is identical with the first of the five sheaths,
called the food=
-sheath (annamaya kosa) because it is the product of food.
This, being obvi=
ous, is not stated in the verse.

112 As long as the three bodies remain un=
dissolved by the light of right
awareness, the soul will be embodied. [Only=
] in the supreme state, wherein
all the three are together lost, will there=
 be bodilessness.

113 The mind, by its own force of ignorance, itself crea=
tes another body,
and also another [dream] world. The sleeper who sees this=
 dream world along
with this dream body is not disembodied.

Thus the objec=
tion is overcome.

114 Everyone sees both his own body and the world throug=
h the eye, which is
a part of that very body. How can this seeing be admiss=
ible as evidence in
this enquiry about the reality of the world?

Since the=
 body is a part of the world, its reality is also in question. It
cannot be=
 assumed without proof. But it is so assumed when the eye is
appealed to as=
 a witness to the truth of the world. The question of the
reality of forms =
is now further pursued.

115 As is the eye, so is the spectacle, since the =
nature of the spectacle
depends on that of the seeing eye. If that eye is a=
 form, so will be the
spectacle. But if the eye is the formless [Self], the=
re will be no seeing of
forms at all.

This is a law of nature that Bhagava=
n reveals for the first time. Seeing
with the eye of flesh, which is a form=
, one sees forms. Seeing with the eye
of right awareness as the Self, forms=
 are not seen. So says Bhagavan. This
proves that forms are unreal, at leas=
t for the purpose of this philosophy.

The subject is further elucidated.

=
116 In the state of ignorance both the world and the Self are seen as forms=
.
[But] on the extinction of ignorance both are [found to be] formless,
bec=
ause in the supreme state the infinite Self is the eye.

In the true state,=
 which is the supreme state, the Self alone is. It is
described as infinite=
, and therefore formless. There are no objects to be
seen, nor is there any=
 real seeing. Hence, forms are unreal. If they were
real, they would surviv=
e in that state.

117 By the vision of right awareness, the world, along wi=
th the soul, merges
into the formless, real Self. The sages call that the v=
ision of right
awareness, wherein there is neither seer nor spectacle.

118=
 In that natural state [of the Self] there survives only the Self, which
is=
 consciousness, worldless, alone, and without the six modes of change,
such=
 as birth, and so on. Hence, it alone is real in its own right.

The world =
is not real in its own right; it has only a borrowed reality, as
will becom=
e clear later on.

119 That Supreme Being, the Self, which is perfect as th=
e sole reality, is
styled the infinite eye. However, because for that Self =
in its true state
there are no objects to be seen, it is not [really] an ey=
e.

120 The term =E2=80=98eye=E2=80=99 has been used in this context by the=
 most holy one
[Bhagavan] only to ward off the misconception that it is non=
-consciousness,
[inert]. Thus, the most holy one has conveyed the meaning t=
hat the Self is
consciousness and the sole reality.

121 It is only by conc=
eiving the formless Self as a form that one sees this
world as consisting o=
f forms. All this is really an ignorant superimposition
on the formless, in=
finite reality, the Self.

122 It is only to him that sees himself as havin=
g a form that the names and
forms appear as real. They have been fabricated=
 by ignorance and
superimposed on the nameless, formless Self, which is con=
sciousness.

123 Thus it has been made plain by the Master that the seeing =
of the world
is an effect of the primary ignorance. Thus, the claim that th=
e world is
real has been refuted by him. Also, it has been shown by him tha=
t the
aloneness of the real Self in the true state is real.

124 Our Master=
 confirms this teaching first by showing that the world is
mental [insepara=
ble from the mind], then by proving the unreality of the
mind and the ego, =
and finally by teaching that even the primary ignorance is
non-existent.

T=
he next verse shows that the world does not exist apart from the mind, and
=
is therefore mental.

125 The world is a totality of the five kinds of sens=
ations, namely sounds
and the rest, and nothing else. All these are only me=
ntal impressions.
Hence, the world is nothing but the mind.

126 If the wor=
ld were other than the mind, why does it not appear in deep
sleep? Therein =
is the real Self, which is consciousness, and by whose
consciousness-light =
the mind is mind!

The second half of the verse is an answer to the content=
ion, which may be
raised by the other side, that the non-seeing of the worl=
d in deep sleep is
no argument, because it is due to the absence of the min=
d and the senses of
perception in that state. The mind is not conscious by =
its own nature; its
consciousness is derived from association with the real=
 Self. Since that
Self survives in deep sleep, the objection is invalid. Th=
is reason finds a
place in Sri Sankaracharya=E2=80=99s Viveka Chudamani: =
=E2=80=98If the world is real, why
then, let it be seen in deep sleep! Sinc=
e it is not at all seen in it, it is
therefore unreal, like a dream.=E2=80=
=99

127 Only when their minds are functioning does the world appear to men=
.
Therefore, the world in the waking state is mental, as it is in dream.Thi=
s
parallel between the waking and the dream states is elaborated in the nex=
t
verse.

128 Just like the waking world, the dream world seems real during=
 the dream.
Also, just like the waking world, the dream world, in its own t=
ime, is
serviceable [for the purposes of life].

The conclusion is stated i=
n the following verse.

129 Just as the dream world is not other than the m=
ind of the dreamer, so
the world of things, seen in waking, is not other th=
an the mind of the seer.

Objections to this conclusion are then noticed.

=
130 Fearing that if it is concluded that the world is mental, then its
unre=
ality will be an inescapable conclusion, ignorant [sectarians] seek to
prov=
e in a variety of ways that the world exists outside [as an independent
rea=
lity].

That these disputants have no locus standi in this discussion is fi=
rst
shown.

131 The truth that the world is unreal is taught by the sages o=
nly to him
who aspires to attain the highest state by the quest of the Self=
. It is not
addressed to others, and hence the contentions of these objecti=
ons are
wholly in vain.

The uniqueness of Vedanta is that no one is coerce=
d by threats of hell or
otherwise to accept its highly elusive teachings. I=
t is given out only to
those whose minds are ripe and have become receptive=
 to these metaphysical
truths. Indeed, Vedanta advises ordinary people not =
to dabble in vedantic
studies. Vedanta makes a distinction between those wh=
o are qualified to
receive its advaitic teaching and those who are not qual=
ified. This is
called the adhikara vada.

The difficulty in accepting the v=
edantic standpoint is pointed out next.

addressed to others, and hence the contentions of these objections are whol=
ly in vain.<br>

<br>The uniqueness of Vedanta is that no one is coerced by=
 threats of hell or otherwise to accept its highly elusive teachings. It is=
 given out only to those whose minds are ripe and have become receptive to =
these metaphysical truths. Indeed, Vedanta advises ordinary people not to d=
abble in vedantic studies. Vedanta makes a distinction between those who ar=
e qualified to receive its advaitic teaching and those who are not qualifie=
d. This is called the adhikara vada.<br>

<br>The difficulty in accepting t=
he vedantic standpoint is pointed out next.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weig=
