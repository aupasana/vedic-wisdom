Respected Sir,

Sometime back i started reading yoga Vashishtha. As i read =
further i am getting confused. Maybe i am misunderstanding something. For e=
xample

1) If this whole world originates from man's imaginations. why all =
people are imagining the same thing?

2) If all other people and things are=
 just product of my imagination why do they behave or why do things occur i=
n a way i had never imagined? why do things occur in a way i had never know=
n ?

3) How does karma fruit theory fits in? if all the world is just my ma=
nah sankalpa how do i commit karma against any soul? How can i have rinanub=
andha against my own imagination?

Respected Sir,  there is some esoteric m=
eaning in the stories. i am currently  reading rain leela and raja vidurath=
 story.  please explain or  give some indication about esoteric meaning of =
the story. In book itself it is written that all stories have hidden meanin=
g which are needed to be understood. i wasn't able to grasp the meaning. pl=
ease help.
I shall be very thankful to you.

Regards
Atul
