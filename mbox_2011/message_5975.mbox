Namaste Narasimha Rao garu,

I really like the step by step procedure for d=
ifferent homams, which are helping many people to do the homams with right =
procedure and also chanting mantras properly.

May I request you to create =
a manual for Satyanarayana Vratam  and also audio for that. 


Thank you,
R=
