Namaste Narasimhagaru
This may sound like kindergarten stuff- but pl at you=
r leisure can you tell us HOW and WHY tarpana evolved ? Is it mainly a way =
of expressing GRATITUDE and SEEKING PARDON .. a la kara charana kritham kaa=
yajam karmajam vaa...,
or
is it to help the pitrus in some manner for suste=
nance,( like I have heard one year here is one day there and so during shra=
rdh they get their meal and during the monthly amaavasya its like them gett=
ing water a few times thru the 'day' ) Is that so ?
Or
does it help in them=
 moving to sadgathi ? 

Is it okay to seek their blesings and help to resol=
ve any current problems we may be going thru ?
Or is that not a good idea ?=

Wish there was some good book on WHO ALL WE LIVE WITH, IN VARIOUS PLANES/P=
LACES EVEN AS WE GO THRU OUR EARTHLY SOJOURN..
thanking you,
regards

Dear Rama,

=C2=A0

do tarpanam to anyone, I have no issues


Great, because this is true. The =
last tarpana that is offered is some variant of=C2=A0"aa-brahma-stamba-pary=
antam jagat tRpyatu". i.e. May the whole world be pleased. There are plenty=
 of quotes from standard dharma shastras which support this. In fact, this =
is the standard "super-duper-short-tarpana" method !

We are born into this=
 world with debts ... including pitR Rna which strongly influences us. You =
should share your wealth with everyone, but it does make sense to start off=
 repaying the debts that you owe. Most of us are spiritually bankrupt and t=
hese debt vAsanAs strongly bind us to this world.=C2=A0


> that is when we=
 look for other learned's inputs or shastra's inputs.


There are too many =
inputs which say contradictory things. We have to to make some limited use =
of our intellect as long as we are in this world of duality. Understanding =
shastra is not easy. At some point, intellect gives way to anubhava, but un=
til then, we have no other choice.


> On the root of the tree example, I w=
as going with this


The example is fine, but it is important to realize th=
at, like all examples, it has limits. Krishna is karma-phala-dAtA, and we h=
ave to experience what we, through previous actions, have begged him to let=
 us experience.=C2=A0When we are ready to wholeheartedly accept Krishna wit=
h unflinching bhakti, we are made. The reality is that we don't possess suc=
h bhakti, and we are strongly=C2=A0influenced by those around us ... partic=
ularly those whom we have RnAnubandha with ... like our forefathers. You ca=
n change a lot of things, but changing your DNA is hard.=C2=A0Thus, for the=
 99.99% of us with less than perfect bhakti, rituals like pitR karma are us=
eful.

When you do pitR karma, if you choose to identify strongly with the =
pitRs, you will go to pitR loka. Similarly with other beings like yakshas, =
gandharvas etc. But, the point of tarpana is exactly the opposite. Rather t=
han identifying with the pitRs, we are trying to detach ourselves from them=
 and their influences. This will do nothing but help us to cultivate true b=
hakti and reach our final goal sooner.

It is important to understand the i=
ntent of the ritual and perform it accordingly.

sasneham,
