Respected Doctor Saa'b,

I was pleasently surprised to see you message. I t=
hought the same way few months back and immediately implemented the idea :-=
)

1) I give 12 Aahutis to Rishi Parashara after regular Mantra aahutis for=
 Ganesh are completed.
"Rishi Paaraasharaaya Swahaa"

(May be learned peopl=
e can suggest some better Mantra)

2) For Navagraha, I think of them mental=
ly along with Mother, Earth, Ganesha, Ishta Devata, Gotra Rishi, Guru, Pare=
nts and so on, and seek their permission at the begining of Homam.

you may=
 think of reciting following Mantra once at the begining which is for all t=
he Navagraha and it also includes Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva

"Brahma Murari =
Stripuraantakaari Bhanu Shashi bhumisuto budhscha,
GrushchShukrascha Shani =
Rahu ketave, Kurvanti Mangal MamSuprabhaatam"

Best Regards,

Utpal
