Dear Chandra Prakash,

> So who is a Hindu?

Hindu is the one whose heart i=
s naturally expansive and accommodative.
Hinduism (actually modern word coi=
ned for Vedic culture) has integrated many diversified schools of thought..=
.be it Dwait, Adwait, Vishishtadwait. Its a Sangam of Many Rivers. The peop=
le of the culture are so accommodative that Parasis stayed for centuries ke=
eping their identity and religious faith intact without facing any conversi=
on threats or any sort of pressure for *conversion*.

Hindu is the one who =
*never thinks* even once to convert religious faith of the people who are b=
elievers in other faiths. On the contrary, Hindu encourages the people from=
 other faiths to be in their own and love god rather then getting in to bus=
iness of conversion. Hindu does not form organised missions, use power of M=
oney or Sword for conversions.
Hindu does not hesitate, if asked, to go to =
church and bow to Jesus because he believes deep within that Jesus is a Sai=
nt, a true man of God. If a Muslim friend makes a request to a Hindu that T=
his is My Allah in this mosque. Would you come with me in mosque and bow do=
wn to show your respect and love? Then Hindu would certainly do that becaus=
e Hindu heart naturally believes in the famous message of Veda - "Ekam Saty=
a Vipra Bahudha vadanti". Although he would not have read even one line of =
Veda ever, this timeless message of Veda is ingrained in every pore of his/=
her being!

Hindu does not need any strict Ritualistic initiation to become=
 Hindu. A Hindu believes in Sarve Bhavantu SukinaH. Hindu is a born Hindu! =
Hindu is the one who hardly feels pressure from society to go to temples or=
 pray God at specific schedules. Hindu has freedom to decide His/her ways t=
o pray God. There is no pressure from Hinduism. Hindu has true liberty and =
that is why Hindu can say that I do not believe in God and still leave happ=
ily and respectfully in Hindu Society.
Above all Hindu is symbolical of all=
 expansive heart!

Oops! I just became emotional and unburden probably a Hi=
ndu heart :)

Sorry for not able to answer your actual query and digressed =
to something else.

Best Regards,

Utpal
