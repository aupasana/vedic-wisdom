All,

If we take a Soumya (according to us) Devata like Sri Lalita Tripura
=
Sundari, how do we correlate to the following verses from Lalitha
Sahasrana=
am:

" Pancha Pretasanasina, Panch Brahmaswarupini" The one who sits on 4
c=
orpses etc

and "Aparna Chandika Chanda Mundasura Nishudini"

In my little =
sadhana I have done with Maha Vidyas, I found that we are
actually praying =
the spectrum and not the Specific Frequency Band.

Soumya and Ugra are Guna=
s of human mind and are used by Mother like a toy
when she wants and throws=
 it away and she is beyond Gunas.

The dream you had could be your minds pr=
ojection too or it could be your
psyche which is getting adjusted to her ma=
ntra and best way is to approach
MOTHER with Utmost Love and Respect. As yo=
u repeat her mantra your mind and
body will get adjusted to it. Please deve=
lop a personal relationship with
Maa and assume her in your heart with phys=
ical form and see the magic.

 I utterly fail to explain her POWER. She is =
indeed very powerful and the
results are immediate and your enlightenment i=
s HER AIM too:-)

thanks
Srikanth

I am=

<br>
Just for the record, I do not advise against Mahavidya=
 worship at all. <br>
All I say is that recommending a particular Mahavidya=
 based on horoscope <br>
is dicey and I am almost sure the standard princip=
les are incorrect. <br>
Also, I suggest that Mahavidyas are much higher tha=
n what people have <br>
made them out to be. They bestow different aspects =
of Supreme Knowledge. <br>
Worshipping them for winning a court case or get=
ting a job (which many <br>
people try to do today) is like trying to use a=
 missile to crush an ant.<br>
<br>
Regarding your dream, it may be genuine =
or merely a projection of your <br>
mind. Remember that mind is very powerf=
ul and projects various conscious <br>
and sub-conscious conditioning as it=
s experiences, especially in a <br>
dream.<br>
<br>
If you feel that the dr=
eam is a genuine experience of the devata, then <br>
keep doing the mantra =
and see what happens.<br>
<br>
If you had the same experience with another =
mahavidya, it is possible <br>
that your mind is just projecting. If your m=
ind has affinity to a soumya <br>
devata with certain nature, it may imagin=
e whichever devata you worship <br>
to have that nature!<br>
<br>
If your m=
ind is imagining an Ugra devata as a benign smiling form, <br>
perhaps you =
should stick to a Soumya Devata. If the devata really gives <br>
you a dars=
han in a fierce form, is your mind capable of handling it? If <br>
your min=
d can visualize and perceive an Ugra Devata in a truly fierce <br>
form and=
 yet feel deep love and surrender for her, then only you are <br>
suitable =
for such a sadhana.<br>
<br>
Good luck in your sadhana!<br>
