 567 In those who are ignorant,the real Self appears to have become
circums=
cribed and made finite by the sheaths.The real Self, infinite like
the sky =
and completely free from all limiting factors, is the state in which
none o=
f the sheaths remain.

It is the sheaths that create the false sense of fin=
iteness for the soul.

The Buddhist teaching of nirvana is next compared wi=
th this state.

568 Guru [Ramana] has said that the state of nirvana that w=
as taught by
Buddha to be the state in which samsara and suffering are ende=
d is the same
as remaining in the supreme state, having discarded all the s=
heaths.

So the Buddhist goal is the same as the state of deliverance taugh=
t in the
Vedantas.

It is next shown that by the experience of the true nat=
ure of the Self,
doubts become impossible.

569 In that state doubts do not=
 arise since the sage is ever firm in his
awareness of the true Self. There=
 he remains without affirmations and
vacillations, immersed in the depths o=
f peace, the mind having become
extinct.

It is next shown that in that sta=
te death is transcended.

570 Becoming aware of the real Self, which has ne=
ither beginning nor end,
the sage transcends death. Surely no one in the wo=
rld transcends death
without experiencing the truth of the Self as deathles=
s.

571 That exalted one who has attained, by enquiring =E2=80=98Whence am =
I?=E2=80=99, birth in
his own source, the supreme one =E2=80=93 only he can=
 be said to be truly born. He
has been born once and for all time, and is e=
ternally new. He is the Lord of
the Munis [a title reserved for God].

572 =
He that is established in his own natural state, in perfect identity
with B=
rahman, is free from disease and beyond time and space. This is the
supreme=
 state that has been taught to us by the great Guru.

The body itself is di=
sease, says Bhagavan. So true health is to be aware
that the body is not th=
e Self. Bodily disease does not detract from the
perfectly healthy state of=
 the sage, as we all know.

The truth about birth and death is next discuss=
ed.

573 For the ignorant one in the world, birth is for dying and his deat=
h is
for being reborn again. Consequently, the most holy one [Sri Ramana] h=
as
told us that this birth and this death are unreal.

The kosas, usually t=
ranslated as =E2=80=98sheaths=E2=80=99, are the five forms through which
th=
e ego functions, and by doing so, cover the Self.

Each cancels the other a=
nd so samsara is without end.

574 Real death is death of the ego. Real bir=
th is to dwell in one=E2=80=99s natural
state. In that state, in which pair=
s of opposites have no existence, birth
and death have never become one.

A=
nother aspect of the supreme state is next discussed.

575 How can the sage=
, who is forever established in the state of
non-duality, become aware of d=
ifferences? The world that appears to the
ignorant as riddled with differen=
ces is to the sage only the
undifferentiated Self.

576 Some speak of the s=
age as having two attributes: =E2=80=98equal vision=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98n=
ot
seeing differences=E2=80=99. This amounts to saying that he is free from=
 the state
in which differences are seen. In the state in which one knows t=
hat the Self
alone exists, nothing is seen.

577 In all persons the sage se=
es only that real Self who is eternally aware
of the truth. He does not see=
 anyone as separate from himself, nor does he
look upon anyone as ignorant.=
 In his sight all are sages.

This was exactly what Bhagavan was heard to s=
ay. This brings out the
uniqueness of the sage. He does not look down upon =
anyone or anything as
inferior to himself.

Now the question of the actions=
 of sages is taken up.

578 The sage in his worldly activities may appear t=
o be aware of worldly
differences, but he is really no more aware of them t=
han a sleepwalker who
moves about, performing actions.

This point will bec=
ome clear later on while dealing with the distinction
between the yogic (ke=
vala) samadhi and the natural (sahaja) samadhi of the
sage.

The crucial te=
st of the sage, by which he is distinguished from the
ignorant, is next giv=
en.

579 The difference between a sage and an ignorant one can be plainly s=
een in
respect to censure and praise. The sage does not know the difference=
 between
the two since, for him, this pair of opposites, like all others, i=
s unreal.

580-1 There are those who have not attained the permanent abode =
of the
natural state of the Self by following the quest for the truth. Thes=
e
people, who have not freed themselves from the feeling that identifies th=
e
body with the Self, are still subject to the delusion that jivas are
diff=
erent from one another. Though these people may have understood well the
su=
btle meanings of Vedanta, even if they may have renounced the whole world
a=
s mere trash, they inevitably become a slave to the harlot named =E2=80=98p=
raise=E2=80=99.

This refers to an incident in the life of Sri Sadasiva Bra=
hmendra, who for
long lived in the woods, practising sadhana. Once a co-pup=
il of his met him
in a forest and began praising him for a long time. At la=
st Sadasiva became
so elated by it that he exhibited horripilation. Noticin=
g this, the other
questioned Sadasiva how such an exalted person could be s=
o affected.
Sadasiva replied by a verse in Sanskrit to the effect that even=
 such a one,
if he had not reached the experience of the real Self, cannot =
help feeling
pleasure from praise. This verse has been translated by Bhagav=
an and placed
in the Supplement (Anubandham) of Ulladu Narpadu. That the sa=
ge is not so
affected is shown next.

582 The sage, who does not know anyon=
e as other than himself, and hence
never swerves from his own true state, i=
s unaffected by censure, or praise,
because for him censure or praise appea=
r to be made by himself.

This is the uniqueness of egolessness. The sage i=
s really bodiless. Those
that see his body judge him as if he were like the=
m.

583 Though he appears as embodied, he is really bodiless, being egoless=
. His
subtle body does not survive and go forth somewhere when the gross bo=
dy
falls, but undergoes disintegration here.

Adherents of sects, whose doc=
trines are different, have raised controversy,
stating that the soul remain=
s an individual after enlightenment, being
endowed with a sort of body.

On=
 this point there are two views: one that the liberated soul has a body
alw=
ays, and another that he has no body, but can assume a body when he
pleases=
. Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching is that all forms are unreal, and hence neith=
er
of these two is acceptable. This is dealt with below.

584 Some believer=
s in the reality of the world say that the sage has a body.
Others say that=
 the sage, being bodiless, can assume a body if he so
pleases.

585 By the =
dawn of right awareness of the real Self, the ego, the root cause
of the ap=
pearance of forms, has been lost. Therefore for the sage, all forms
are unr=
eal, and hence this talk of forms is foolishness.

Bhagavan has made it cle=
ar, by adopting the simile of the river mingling
with the ocean, that the s=
oul as such does not survive the dawn of right
awareness. The soul has been=
 declared to be a false appearance due to
confusion of the body with the Se=
lf, which cannot survive the extinction of
ignorance, its parent.

586 Sinc=
e it is not proper to say that this [world] existed before
[enlightenment],=
 but was lost afterwards, and since [even in ignorance] no
one has a form f=
rom the point of view of the reality, how can the sage have
a form?

Forms =
belong to duality, but duality, it has been declared, is never real.
Non-du=
ality is true always, being unaffected by time.

587 In the case of the sag=
e who is established in his own natural state,
free of all the three bodies=
, how can a desire arise to have a body? This
talk of forms is in vain, bei=
ng merely a concession to the unenlightened.

Even in the Upanishads there =
are passages suggesting that in salvation there
are forms, but they are int=
erpreted as a means of enabling unripe souls to
take to sadhana for salvati=
on. The real teaching of the Upanishads appears
in texts such as the follow=
ing.

588 As a river reaching the ocean loses its river-form and becomes
in=
distinguishable from it, so too the sage, losing his form as a soul,
become=
s non-different from that Supreme Being, to whom all else is inferior.

589=
 Thus revelation says that the sage in that supreme state becomes one
with =
the Supreme Being. Even when alive, the liberated one is bodiless
because h=
e does not think of himself as having a body.

Bhagavan defines liberation =
as follows.

590 Bhagavan our Guru says that liberation is just the extinct=
ion of the
ego, who becomes a disputant concerning the form of the sage. So=
, this
dispute about forms is meaningless.

It is to be noted that those wh=
o raise this controversy, do so without
losing their ego-sense. Can they ra=
ise this question after getting rid of
their ego?

591 Therefore, on the fa=
ll of the body his subtle form does not go forth, as
in the case of the ign=
orant; it goes back and merges into its cause, and
nothing survives for goi=
ng forth.

The cause of the subtle body is the unquintuplicated five bhutas=
 (materials
of creation).

There is an incidental misconception which is ne=
xt dispelled.

592 The popular notion that there are many sages is also not=
 true. All
differences belong to the world. In the worldless state they do =
not exist.

The controversy about the plurality of selves, which has been d=
iscussed and
settled before, is relevant here also.

593 He who says, =E2=
=80=98I have today seen this sage; I shall see others also,=E2=80=99
does n=
ot know the true nature of sages, which is
reality-consciousness-bliss. Thi=
s is what Bhagavan has told us on this
point.

594 For him who knows not th=
e sage who is within himself there appear many
sages. For him who knows tha=
t one, which is his own Self, this plurality [of
sages] is non-existent.

T=
he absurdity of these questions is thus pointed out by Bhagavan. Questions
=
about the egoless state cannot be decided by the ego-ridden ones.

The foll=
owing is the corollary from the above discussion.
