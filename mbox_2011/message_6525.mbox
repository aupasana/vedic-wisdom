  Q.  Maharaj,I am practising Japam and meditation, but I have not yet acqu=
ired any taste for these. Somehow or other I am struggling on.What must I d=
o? 

THE SWAMI-    Is it possible to have that taste in the beginning? No, =
struggle hard to attain it.Concentrate all your energies on its     achieve=
ment, and never for a moment pay heed to other matters. Apply yourself whol=
e-heartedly to it and to it alone.Onward,Onward.Never be  satisfied with yo=
ur present state of mind.Try to create within yourself a burning dissatisfa=
ction.Say to yourself "What progress am I making?
Not a bit" Sri Ramakrishn=
a used to say  to the Divine Mother-"Mother, another day is gone and I have=
 not seen Thee!"
