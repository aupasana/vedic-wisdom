<div>
<div>Namaste Sir,<br><br>In the old days also, there was varna =
system but it was different. People belonged to different varnas based on t=
heir aptitude and served different purposes in society. It wasn't a rig=
id system, but a flexible and mobile system based on aptitude rather than b=
irth. Of course, because a child may get exposed to what father does and ma=
y have a good chance of developing aptitude for such work, one would by def=
ault get father's varna at birth. But, as one grows up and one's va=
sanas (conditioning from past lives) develop, one may develop a different a=
ptitude and may end up with a varna different from father's.<br>
<br>Fo=
r example, Vishwamitra was born as a kshatriya, but became a braahmana and =
became a brahmarshi later. Valmiki was born as a shoodra and lived by hunti=
ng birds. He became a braahmana and became a maharshi later.<br><br>
No mat=
ter where one is born and how one was brought up, anyone who is interested =
in knowledge and
 liberation and not interested in money or power over othe=
rs, IS a braahmana. Even if one is born in an orthodox brahmin family, if o=
ne is deeply interested in money or power and authority over others, one is=
 NOT a braahmana. In any case, one varna is not superior and another varna =
is not inferior. People of different varnas serve different purposes. It is=
 as simple as that. What we see today - bias, mistrust, fights and killings=
 in the name of caste - are an unfortunate consequence of deepening Kali.<b=
r>
<br>What I am saying is not accepted in mainstream society today because=
 we are deeply into Kali yuga. But, when the Mother decides, social notions=
 can change quickly. In fact, we are going through a phase of huge global t=
ransformation. Political, economoic, social and religious structures of the=
 world will be redefined during the coming decades and will remain valid fo=
r many centuries. <br>
<br>BTW, when the divine Mother appeared before my g=
uru in March
 2006 and gave a command to spread a simple homam ritual in th=
e world for the coming times, her clear directive was to not differentiate =
based on caste, creed, class and race. We encourage anybody who desires to =
worship any god in fire for spiritual progress to perform homam on a regula=
r basis using the homam manuals at the homam website (see below).<br>
<br>&=
gt; Also if a person born in low cast is that mean he will receive less gra=
ce of<br>> GOD & a pesron who belongs to high cast has abundance of =
it. <br><br>Rather than caste, environment in which one grows up does have =
a role (and caste does sometimes influence the family environment in India)=
. One born in a family (brahmana or otherwise) that worships god everyday i=
s exposed to that notion. One brought up in a family that cares a little ab=
out god or morality and pursues money or power or comforts ruthlessly is ex=
posed that notion. So the religious/spiritual aspects of the environment in=
 which
 one grows up do play a role. However, if one has strong vasanas, th=
ey will eventually take hold. One will meet people who make those vasanas f=
lourish and those vasanas take control.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Narasimha<b=
