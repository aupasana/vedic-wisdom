Hi,

You may consider doing Shani Homam every day. If not daily, as sri Man=
ish ji had stated on Twitter, consider doing it for atleast 11=C2=A0Saturda=
ys=C2=A0after sunset (to have some relief) with black/brown sesame seeds.

=
You can find the manual from sri PVR's website @=C2=A0http://www.vedicastro=
loger.org/homam/sani.htm

Thanks

KK

      <di=
v>Namaste,<br>
<br>
Someone asked me how to explain a kid why there are man=
y gods in <br>
Hinduism while some religions have a single god. I will shar=
e some <br>
thoughts.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
When one is thi=
rsty, one can drink water (H2O) to get some energy. From <br>
the same wate=
r, we can also make different mineral waters, vitamin <br>
waters, flavored=
 waters, soft drinks of various kinds etc and drink them <br>
instead of wa=
ter.<br>
<br>
Hindu scriptures say that there is only god (Brahman or Aatma=
n or Self), <br>
but that god manifests as different devatas (deities) with=
 various <br>
natures, qualities and energies.<br>
<br>
The one god - Brahm=
an or Allah or Holy Spirit - has no qualities (like <br>
form, color, shape=
, nature etc) and is beyond description and the source <br>
of all deities.=
 Similarly, plain water - which is the source of all <br>
other drinks - ha=
s no taste or smell or flavor. Deities arising from <br>
that one god have =
various qualities (gentle, fierce etc). Similarly, <br>
many kinds of flavo=
red water and soft drinks have different taste, smell <br>
and flavor. Just=
 as one can drink whatever drink one likes, based on <br>
one's taste, to q=
uench thirst, similarly one can worship whatever deity <br>
one likes, base=
d on one's taste, to quench the inner thirst of one's <br>
soul and give it=
 energy to do its work.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
Just as Abrah=
am said no to the worship of idols and forms and installed <br>
the notion =
of one god, one can ban flavored drinks and say that only <br>
plain water =
can be drunk. That is not wrong, but most people find water <br>
too plain =
and prefer different drinks. Similarly, most people cannot <br>
relate to O=
NE formless (i.e. beyond forms) god and using specific forms <br>
based on =
one's mental state helps improve devotion.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>=

<br>
Just as different people may call water with different names (water, =
<br>
paani, jalam, tanni, neellu, acqua, wasser etc), similarly different <=
br>
people may call the one god as Brahman or Parabrahma or Aatman or Buddh=
a <br>
or Self or Allah or Ahora Mazda or Holy Spirit or whatever. There's =
<br>
nothing in a name. Fighting that Allah is superior or Brahman, is akin=
 <br>
to fighting that paani is superior to jalam!<br>
<br>
When you have w=
ater or a drink, the key is to drink it and get energy. <br>
If one stores =
it, flaunts it and looks at now and then, it won't quench <br>
thirst. Simi=
larly, keeping a god's idol or picture or a scripture or <br>
reading it no=
w, it won't quench the inner thirst. One needs to think of <br>
god in mind=
, contemplate on the nature of god and get some of that <br>
nature within =
oneself through resonance. That gives energy and <br>
transforms one.<br>

<br>
People have the notion that th=
ere are different gods who created <br>
different people. But the fact is t=
hat one god created this whole <br>
universe and god is beyond forms, beyon=
