The householder is the centre of life and society. It is a worship for him =
to acquire and spend wealth nobly, for the householder who struggles to bec=
ome rich by good means and for good purposes is doing practically the same =
thing for the attainment of salvation as the anchorite does in his cell whe=
n he is praying, for in them we see only the different aspects of the same =
virtue of self-surrender and self-sacrifice prompted by the feeling of devo=
tion to God and to all that is His.
