Namaste sharma Ji,

[
because it is written as sarma in English some tend t=
o pronounce that as sarma instead of sharma.... (exact confusion as of siva=
 and shiva).
]

Yes! That sums up probably the root cause of confusion and =
incorrect pronunciation by some people. Englisss is a funny language :)

Yo=
ur email was very nicely compiled one. Thank you for the same.

It is bette=
r to *write* as "shiva" so to avoid any chances of mispronunciation due to =
inadequacy of English language, however whether write as "shiva" or "Siva",=
 but uchhara should be "Talavyaa".

best regards,

Utpal
