      Namaste friend=
s,



There was a long friendly ;-) exchange between Rajarshi and me on Fri=
day 

(July 29) on twitter on measuring spiritual caliber. This came from t=
he 

context of Rajarshi's comments on the "maturity" & "errors" of 

Ramak=
rishna's disciples (regarding their attitude towards Tantra). He 

compared=
 them with Vimalananda and said their spiritual caliber was of 

the scale =
of 2, while Vimalananda's was 2 power 16. He also talked about 

the hierar=
chy of spiritual caliber mentioned by V. I want to share 2 

cents of musin=
gs on that.



-------------------------------

Measuring Spiritual Caliber=




Rajarshi, here are a few comments on your statements a couple of days 
=

back on Twitter comparing spiritual caliber. We can't even compare 

flowe=
rs like hibiscus, rose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say 

which is a=
 better flower. They have different properties like color, 

size, shape, n=
umber of petals, type/intensity of smell etc. Relative 

values depend on t=
he purpose and they cannot be quantified universally. 

How can any sane pe=
rson then say that spiritual caliber of different 

people can be compared =
and quanitified? The field of duality has 

infinite variety and the [self-=
]control of a yogi has infinite aspects 

to it. You cannot quantify the sp=
iritual caliber of a person as one 

number and compare them.



Before one=
 even attempts to understand Vimalananda's order (Paramahamsa 

< Siddha < =
Natha < Rishi), please note that different hierarchies exist 

in scripture=
s for deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities 

where Vishnu is =
supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where 

Shiva is supreme. Som=
e consider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is 

supreme. And so on. Non=
e of them is absolute. All of them are relative 

and for specific purposes=
, i.e. from a specific perspective. There are 

people who take them as abs=
olute and argue that so and so thing taught 

by Vishnu is superior to so a=
nd so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we 

know that none of the hierarchie=
s is absolute.



One who has the nerve to think that one can compare the w=
isdom of 

Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of Ramak=
rishna 

Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion of Shird=
i Sai, 

spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri Mahashaya=
, 

detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of Eknath 

M=
aharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc, 

is =
a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific 

limited p=
erspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in 

another Jna=
neshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so 

on. You cann=
ot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. 

You should just=
 appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any 

of them that you =
like the most.



Vimalananda's list may be correct from specific perspecti=
ve. More 

importantly, his words should make one realize that there is alw=
ays 

scope for further self-control (and the resulting mastery over the fi=
eld 

of duality) while one is still embodied. One should never rest and 

=
aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel and starting to 

j=
udge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making statements like 

"Vi=
malananda is heavier than all RK's discples put togtr" and thinking 

that =
something is absolute truth because Vimalananda is assumed to have 

said t=
hat (vs someone "lower than him") is unwise.



Even if Vimalananda's hiera=
rchy is absolute and universal, don't assume 

that you can judge the statu=
re of each yogi accurately. Because 

Ramakrishna was popularly known as a =
Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as 

per Vimalananda's classification or a=
 siddha or a natha or even a rishi? 

Or may be a deity? My friend, don't a=
ssume you know for sure!!! Based on 

the details we know, can we be absolu=
tely sure of even Vimalananda's 

stature based on his own classification?
=



You said "Approximating 2 equal to each disciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16=
 

=3D say Vimalananda. Basic?" You probably made this statement based on 
=

what you read and heard of Vimalananda. For the sake of argument, it is 

=
not even 100% clear whether he was a real person or an imagined 

character=
. Svoboda intentionally (and very wisely!) left the latter 

option open in=
 the preface of his Aghora book!



If we MUST compare spiritual calibers, =
one possibility is to use a 

simpler definition of how close one is to lib=
eration as a measure of 

one's "spiritual caliber", Ramakrishna's disciple=
s fare quite well. RK 

told Abhedananda that it was going to be his last b=
irth. Others would be 

back, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he s=
aid there would be 

one more birth and he would be free forever after that=
. Vimalananda, on 

the other hand, had atleast one more birth clearly as h=
e said a body was 

waiting for him. That way, forget about "RK's discples =
put togtr", just 

Abhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda!



Again, =
please note that this is just one definition. One can have many 

definitio=
ns. The key is not to jump to unwise conclusions on any 

hierarchies and s=
ay that "X is weightier than Y and so what he said must 

be more correct".=




People with lopsided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledg=
e 

to be absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people =


are doing the same now with "modern scriptures" such as the Aghora 

book=
s. Don't fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or as 

absolute.=
 Written words are always relative and never absolute. 

Discriminate relat=
ive knowledge using intellect at first and hopefully 

using experencial re=
alization later on.



More importantly, while we are still searching for "=
maturity", we should 

not commit the "error" of making negative judgmental=
 comments of greats 

who did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lo=
t more than us.
