Chimeny-less fireplaces won't help, because the main problem is the soot /
=
smoke created by the homa and you need the chimney to draw that away. You
h=
ave gas and electric fireplaces galore in the West, but the reason they
don=
't need a chimney is because no smoke / soot is emitted--as soon as you
do =
homa on them, though, smoke and soot will be emitted so you're back to
squa=
re 1. The best solution, I think is to have a traditional fireplace as
you =
mention--if I could do that in my home, I definitely would!

<p>Namaskaram Girish Ji,<br><br>Good to know that you repain=

questions:<br>

<br>1) YES. It is portable. Every day I adjust it near my w=
indow and after finishing homam, i take it back little inside so that windo=
w can be closed. I am able to adjust it myself alone in just a few *seconds=
*.<br><br>2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galvanized Iron) of 22 Gauge. This w=
as manufactured by a Local EPC contracting company dealing in AC Duct insta=
llation. A Technical Supervisor of that company is my close family friend. =
He did this for me. I suggest checking with any Restaurants. They all are h=
aving such arrangements and they would be able to help you to contact such =
manufacturers.<br>

<br>3) YES, because it is a Metal (GI Sheet) it gets qu=
ite heated up. One can not touch during Homam. However, it also cools down =
quickly. Within half an hour after Homam is finished, temperature of the ch=
imney comes down to room temperature. <br>

<br>4) It has a Metallic FAN at=
 the end. I was starting that FAN only when Fire goes of and lot of Smoke i=
s generated. Reasons are as follows:<br>i)The fan is powerful and makes a l=
ot of noise which disturbs concentration.<br>

ii) In the beginning, when F=
ire is very small, the powerful exhaust by the fan, disturbed the flames an=
d sometimes extinguished it.<br>1ii) When Fire is there in the Homam, one n=
eed not worry about smoke handling. the reason is that the smoke naturally =
travels upward and it is automatically guided to the exit of the chimney. O=
nce the fire becomes strong, it generates vacuum around Homam kundam area a=
nd starts pulling outside air. For instance, smoke from incense stick (Agar=
batti), though outside of chimney and quite far away, actually gets diverte=
d into the Chimney via square opening at the bottom. Hence during homam, FA=
N is not required.<br>

<br>iv) Now very important thing. I used fan for ma=
ny months (only at the end of Homas). One day my fear proved right. Due to =
heat of chimney, the cable of the Fan got burnt and there was a short-circu=
it. mccb tripped. Since then I am not using the Fan. You may have to go for=
 Heat resistant cable for the FAN if you wish to use it but i am fine witho=
ut using the fan in my chimney.<br>

Actually without Fan, The whole arrang=
ement will become much Lighter and much easier to handle. Please also do no=
t forget to make a support. You can see that in pictures which I have loade=
d. Support is a separate part<br>

<br>(Please check the Picture of Fan whi=
ch i have added in the Photo section)<br><br>If you have further queries, p=
lease do not hesitate to ask.<br><br>Best Regards,<br><br>Utpal </p>
