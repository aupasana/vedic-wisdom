Hi Narasimha Rao<BR><BR>1) I do not understand sanskrit, so it is sufficien=
t that i read the slokas in english. Is the meaning of the sanskrit sloka m=

he inability to fully understand it fully posts a challenge. Please let me =
know your opinion.<BR><BR><BR>2) Do you have a general structure for Homama=

to take care of all aspects of one's life. Though different forms work diff=
erently in the short run (though they lead to the same thing in the long ru=

ly as anybody on earth today. I can declare confidently that astrology is n=
