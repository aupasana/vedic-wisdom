 He by whom inner distraction is seen may put an end to it, but the noble
o=
ne is not distracted. When there is nothing to achieve what is he to do?
18=
.17

The wise man, unlike the worldly man, does not see inner stillness,
di=
straction, or fault in himself, even when living like a worldly man. 18.18
=

Nothing is done by him who is free from being and non-being, who is
conten=
ted, desireless, and wise, even if in the world's eyes he does act.
18.19

=
The wise man who just goes on doing what presents itself for him to do,
enc=
ounters no difficulty in either activity or inactivity. 18.20

He who is de=
sireless, self-reliant, independent, and free of bonds functions
like a dea=
d leaf blown about by the wind of causality. 18.21

There is neither joy no=
r sorrow for one who has transcended samsara. With a
peaceful mind he lives=
 as if without a body. 18.22

He whose joy is in himself, and who is peacef=
ul and pure within has no
desire for renunciation or sense of loss in anyth=
ing. 18.23

For the man with a naturally empty mind, doing just as he pleas=
es, there is
no such thing as pride or false humility, as there is for the =
naturalman.
18.24

"This action was done by the body but not by me." The pu=
re-natured person
thinking like this,is not acting even when acting. 18.25
=

He who acts without being able to say why, but is not thereby a fool, he i=
s
one liberated while still alive, happy and blessed. He is happy even in
s=
amsara. 18.26

He who has had enough of endless considerations and has atta=
ined peace, does
not think, know, hear, or see. 18.27

He who is beyond men=
tal stillness and distraction does not desire either
liberation or its oppo=
site. Recognising that things are just constructions
of the imagination, th=
at great soul lives as God here and now. 18.28

He who feels responsibility=
 within, acts even when doing nothing, but there
is no sense of done or und=
one for the wise man who is free from the sense of
responsibility. 18.29

T=
he mind of the liberated man is not upset or pleased. It shines unmoving,
d=
esireless, and free from doubt. 18.30

He whose mind does not set out to me=
ditate or act, still meditates and acts
but without an object. 18.31

A stu=
pid man is bewildered when he hears the ultimate truth, while even a
clever=
 man is humbled by it just like the fool. 18.32

The ignorant make a great =
effort to practise one-pointedness and the
stopping of thought, while the w=
ise see nothing to be done and remain in
themselves like those asleep. 18.3=
3

The stupid man does not attain cessation whether he acts or abandons act=
ion,
while the wise man finds peace within simply by knowing the truth. 8.3=
4

People cannot come to know themselves by practices -- pure awareness, cl=
ear,
complete, beyond multiplicity, and faultless though they are. 8.35

Th=
e stupid man does not achieve liberation even through regular practice,
but=
 the fortunate remains free and actionless simply by understanding. 18.36

=
The stupid does not attain Godhead because he wants it, while the wise man
=
enjoys the Supreme Godhead without even wanting it. 18.37

Even when living=
 without any support and eager for achievement, the stupid
are still nouris=
hing samsara, while the wise have cut at the very root of
its unhappiness. =
18.38

The stupid man does not find peace because he desires it, while the =
wise man
discriminating the truth is always peaceful minded. 18.39

How can=
 there be self-knowledge for him whose knowledge depends on what he
sees? T=
he wise do not see this and that, but see themselves as infinite.
18.40

Ho=
w can there be cessation of thought for the misguided who is striving for
i=
t. Yet it is there always naturally for the wise man delighting in himself.=

18.41

Some think that something exists, and others that nothing does. Rar=
e is the
man who does not think either, and is thereby free from distractio=
n. 18.42

Those of weak intelligence think of themselves as pure nonduality=
, but
because of their delusion do not really know this, and so remain unfu=
lfilled
all their lives. 18.43

The mind of the man seeking liberation can =
find no resting place within, but
the mind of the liberated man is always f=
ree from desire by the very fact of
being without a resting place. 18.44

S=
eeing the tigers of the senses, the frightened refuge-seekers at once enter=

the cave in search of cessation of thought and one-pointedness. 18.45

See=
ing the desireless lion, the elephants of the senses silently run away,
or,=
 if that is impossible, serve him like courtiers. 18.46

The man who is fre=
e from doubts and whose mind is free does not bother about
means of liberat=
ion. Whether seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, or tasting,
he lives at ea=
se. 18.47

He whose mind is pure and undistracted from just hearing of the =
Truth does
not see anything to do or anything to avoid or even a cause for
=
indifference. 18.48

The upright person does whatever presents itself to be=
 done, good or bad,
for his actions are like those of a child. 18.49

By in=
ner freedom one attains happiness, by inner freedom one reaches the
Supreme=
, by inner freedom one comes to absence of thought, by inner freedom
to the=
 Ultimate State. 18.50

When one sees oneself as neither the doer nor the r=
eaper of the
consequences, then all mind waves come to an end. 18.51

The s=
pontaneous unassuming behaviour of the wise is noteworthy, but not the
deli=
berate purposeful stillness of the fool. 18.52

The wise who are rid of ima=
gination, unbound and with unfettered awareness,
may enjoy themselves in th=
e midst of many goods, or alternatively go off to
mountain caves. 18.53

Th=
ere is no attachment in the heart of a wise man whether he sees or pays
hom=
age to a learned brahmin, a celestial being, a holy place, a woman, a
king =
or a friend. 18.54

A yogi is not in the least put out even when humiliated=
 by the ridicule of
servants, sons, wives, grandchildren, or other relative=
s. 18.55

Even when pleased he is not pleased, not suffering even when in p=
ain. Only
those like him can know the wonderful state of such a man. 18.56
=

It is the feeling that there is something that needs to be achieved which =
is
samsara. The wise who are of the form of emptiness, formless, unchanging=
,
and spotless see nothing of the sort. 18.57

Even when doing nothing the =
fool is agitated by restlessness, while a
skillful man remains undisturbed =
even when doing what there is to do. 18.58

Happy he stands, happy he sits,=
 happy sleeps, and happy he comes and goes.
Happy he speaks and happy he ea=
ts. This is the life of a man at peace. 18.59

He who of his very nature fe=
els no unhappiness in his daily life like
worldly people, remains undisturb=
ed like a great lake, cleared of
defilement. 18.60

Even abstention from ac=
tion has the effect of action in a fool, while even
the action of the wise =
man brings the fruits of inaction. 18.61

A fool often shows aversion towar=
ds his belongings, but for him whose
attachment to the body has dropped awa=
y, there is neither attachment nor
aversion. 18.62

The mind of the fool is=
 always caught in thinking or not thinking, but the
wise man's is of the na=
ture of no thought because he thinks what is
appropriate. 18.63

For the se=
er who behaves like a child, without desire in all actions,there
is no atta=
chment for such a pure one even in the work he does. 18.64

Blessed is he w=
ho knows himself and is the same in all states, with a mind
free from cravi=
ng whether he is seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, or
tasting. 18.65

The=
re is no one subject to samsara, no sense of individuality, no goal or
mean=
s to the goal in the eyes of the wise man who is always free from
imaginati=
on and unchanging like space. 18.66

Glorious is he who has abandoned all g=
oals and is the incarnation of the
satisfaction, which is his very nature, =
and whose inner focus on the
Unconditioned is quite spontaneous. 18.67

In =
brief, the great-souled man who has come to know the Truth is without
desir=
e for either pleasure or liberation, and is always and everywhere free
from=
 attachment. 18.68
