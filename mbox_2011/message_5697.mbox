 28th July, 1948

It seems that Mr. Minna Nuruddin, a competent Sanskrit sc=
holar and Tamil
poet had written and published a translation in Tamil verse=
 on Sankara=E2=80=99s
=E2=80=9CAtmabodha=E2=80=9D. He presented a copy of i=
t to Bhagavan while on a visit to the
Ashram.

Bhagavan glanced at them and=
 sent them to the library. We could however see
from his face that somethin=
g was wrong. He sent to the library for Sankara=E2=80=99s
=E2=80=9CAtmabodh=
a=E2=80=9D in Nagari script and every now and then was looking into it.
Aft=
er doing so for two
days, he took a pencil and paper and began writing some=
thing of his own
accord.

We were wondering what he was writing.On the 16th=
 instant he translated the
first two slokas into Tamil verse in venba metre=
 and showed them to us. All
of us said it would be good if all the other sl=
okas also got translated. In
spite of saying, =E2=80=9CWhy? Why?=E2=80=9D h=
e wrote some more during the next two days and
said, =E2=80=9CThough I have=
 been disinclined and have been putting off writing
them, they come to me f=
rom time to time, one after another and stand in
front of me.

What am I to=
 do?=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9CIf you write down whatever comes to you, the=

whole thing may be over in a month=E2=80=99s time. That will be good.=E2=
=80=9D =E2=80=9CSeveral
people have written it,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan.

=
=E2=80=9CWhy should I do it?=E2=80=9D

I said, =E2=80=9CWill any of them be=
 like Bhagavan=E2=80=99s writings?=E2=80=9D

By the 19th, he wrote some mor=
e and said, =E2=80=9CThese appear to be suitable for
children only, but I a=
m unable to resist the urge to write.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CAre we not all you=
r children?=E2=80=9D I said.

The 20th instant was Vyasa Purnima (full moon=
, Guru Purnima day). By then
thirteen verses were completed.

Addressing Ve=
nkataratnam, Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CThis won=E2=80=99t leave us now. Stitc=
h
them into a book,=E2=80=9D and so saying he wrote a verse by way of intro=
duction.

=E2=80=9CAnmavin bodhamarul ashanam sankaran...=E2=80=9D It means=
:

Could Sankara, who wrote the =E2=80=9CAtmabodha=E2=80=9D, be other than =
the Atma? Who else
could it be than Himself that was in my heart and made m=
e write this in
Tamil?

By the 27th instant all the sixty-eight stanzas got=
 translated into verse
and on concluding the work Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CT=
hese stanzas were written in
Malayalam Script in that small notebook which,=
 as I said, was our first
possession forty years ago, but somehow it never =
occurred to me then to
translate them.=E2=80=9D

A devotee said, =E2=80=9CF=
or everything the right time must come.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan with a smile sai=
d, =E2=80=9CYes, that is so. If I write one thing now
another presents itse=
lf. How is it I feel I have read this before? Is it
possible that someone h=
as already written this?=E2=80=9D

Muruganar: =E2=80=9CNo one has written i=
t in venba metre. What surprise is there if
one verse after another occurs =
to Bhagavan? It is said that in every kalpa*
the Vedas appeared as though t=
hey were standing before Brahma. This also is
like that.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan=
: =E2=80=9CYes. It is said that the Vedas are anadi (without a beginning).
=
That is true.=E2=80=9D
