 414 There is not even one flawless proof on the side of those that assert
=
the plurality of souls. [But] there is a twofold proof for the unity of the=

real Self, namely the experience of the sage and the argument that he has
=
given.

415 Our Guru Sri Ramana says that because the Self shines in the sa=
me way as
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, in all bodies he is one, and only one.

Now =
a warning is given for the benefit of immature aspirants against a
misuse o=
f the theoretical knowledge herein so far given. This is taken from
Bhagava=
n Sri Sankaracharya=E2=80=99s Tattvopadesa, in which it is the last verse.
=

416 One should meditate upon the truth of non-duality with effort, but
sho=
uld not apply this truth in his [worldly] activities. [Also] one may
think =
of non-duality in respect of all the three worlds, but should not
imagine s=
uch [non-difference] with the Guru.

The reason is that theoretical knowled=
ge of the truth of non-duality does
not avail to destroy the primary ignora=
nce, so as to raise one to the
egoless state, wherein wrong action would be=
 impossible. So, till that state
is won, the ego would be in command of act=
ions, and this warning is
therefore necessary.

Next the question is raised=
 and dealt with as to how the physical body and
the world as a whole appear=
 to the sage.

417 How can the world appear to the sage in the same way as =
it does to the
ignorant? The Guru tells us in what way the world appears to=
 the sage.

The next verse gives the answer briefly, but also clearly.

418=
 The world, which to the ignorant appears as comprising the trinity of
God,=
 the jivas and the insentient objects, appears as the Self to the sage
due =
to the liquidation of the superimposed false appearance of the world.

This=
 is explained in detail as follows.

419 The sage who has attained his natu=
ral state, which is the supreme state,
remains in his natural freedom. He i=
s free from delusion and sees nothing
other than the Self. How then can he =
see anything unreal?

420 Therefore the sage, established as he is in his n=
atural state, the
supreme state, would say that the body, appearing as =E2=
=80=98his=E2=80=99 body to others,
and the world are real.

But there is a =
world of difference in the meaning [of what he says] because
the superimpos=
ition does not appear [as real] to the sage.

Now it may be questioned whet=
her the sage also, like us, does not need the
discrimination between the re=
al and the unreal. The answer is given below.

421 The outlook of discrimin=
ation is enjoined [only] on the aspirant for
deliverance, not on him who ha=
s won deliverance. A confused outlook is
possible for the former, not for t=
he latter.

The views that the two have of the body is next explained and d=
istinguished.

422 The ignorant one, because of his confounding of the body=
 with the Self,
thinks of himself as =E2=80=98with form=E2=80=99 and co-ext=
ensive with that body. The sage
is aware of the Self as infinite, formless =
being; this is the distinction in
the meaning of what is said by these two.=


423 What is seen as =E2=80=98the body=E2=80=99 by the ignorant appears to=
 the sage only as
the Self. He refers to it as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, ignorin=
g the body-form through his right
awareness.

Next it is explained that the=
 outlook of the sage towards the world is
different from that of the ignora=
nt one.

424 Also, when the two say that the world is real, there is a diff=
erence in
the meaning, though the words are the same. For the ignorant one,=
 the
reality is veiled by differences, while to the sage, it appears as it =
really
is.

425 Unaware of the substratum of the world-appearance, seeing [=
only] the
superimposed multitude of [inert] objects, and believing that thi=
s world of
objects is real in its own right, the ignorant one says, =E2=80=
=98The world is
real=E2=80=99.

426 [On the other hand] for the sage there =
shines only the substratum, which
is the pure reality, nameless and formles=
s. For him the superimposition does
not appear as real. [That being the cas=
e], how can he say that the world is
unreal?

The contrast here is between =
the substratum and the superimposed appearance.
The ignorant one is unaware=
 that there is a substratum. The sage is unaware
of the superimposed appear=
ance.

427 This world which, to the one whose eye is blinded by unawareness=
 of his
own real Self, conceals the Supreme Being, is, by [the power of] th=
at same
Supreme Being, concealed to the one whose eye is purified by the ri=
ght
awareness of that Self.

This is the meaning conveyed by the opening ve=
rse of the Isa Upanishad.
Supposing that the sage does see the world of nam=
es and form. It is
explained that the sage=E2=80=99s view is unclouded by i=
gnorance.

428 Just as one who has become wise to the truth of the mirage m=
ay again see
the mirage without being deluded, so too the sage, seeing this=
 world, does
not think of it as real, as does the ignorant one.

Thus there=
 is no comparison at all between the ignorant man and the sage.
This is sho=
wn next.

429 This world is not real in the sense in which it is believed t=
o be real
by the ignorant man. Ignorant ones do not understand the sense in=
 which the
world is seen [as real] by the sage.

430 That which appears to =
the ignorant ones as diversified by a great many
differences, as =E2=80=98f=
orms=E2=80=99 and as =E2=80=98other than the Self=E2=80=99, is, to the sage=
, only
the Self, undifferentiated and formless.

It is then explained that =
the teaching about the world is two-fold, as
unreal from one viewpoint and =
real from another viewpoint.

431 It is not taught that the world is comple=
tely unreal. It is not [unreal]
like the horn of man or a horse. If it were=
 wholly unreal, it would not
appear at all. But it does appear because of i=
ts confusion with its
substratum, the reality.

The two kinds of unrealitie=
s are further explained, for the sake of
distinction.

432 The unreality th=
at has no substratum, such as the son of a barren woman
and the like, does =
not appear at all. But the unreality which appears on a
substratum, like th=
e snake seen in a rope, appears as real.

The presence or absence of a subs=
tratum makes all the difference. No one is
misled into thinking that a barr=
en woman=E2=80=99s son has any existence, because he
does not appear at all=
. On the other hand, the snake not only appears, but
it is believed to be r=
eal because it has a substratum for its appearance. It
appears and is for s=
ome time at least believed to be real. This distinction
is very important f=
or understanding the truth of the world, which is further
elucidated in the=
 succeeding verses, in which Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching is given.

433 Bot=
h reality and unreality have to be stated in respect of the world,
and here=
in there is not the least contradiction. It is real because of the
reality =
of the substratum, and it is unreal, because of the superimposition
of name=
s and forms.

All the same, it must not be said that the world exists, as e=
xplained below:

434 Reality [of a soul] is conceded for the world, but it =
would not be
correct to say that it exists. =E2=80=98Reality=E2=80=99 and =
=E2=80=98existence=E2=80=99 are quite distinct.
That alone is said to be re=
al which is real in its own right.

Thus in the language of the Vedanta the=
 term =E2=80=98reality=E2=80=99 applies strictly only
to that which is real=
 in its own right, not to what has a borrowed reality,
as explained in the =
next two verses.

435 They say the world is pragmatically real, that what i=
s seen in dream is
apparently real, and that the one without a second, name=
ly Brahman, is the
supreme reality. These grades of reality are pointless.
=

These three degrees of reality are spoken of in order to enable weak minds=

to receive the teaching in stages. But ultimately there is only one realit=
y.

436 Reality is always of one kind; there are no varieties or degrees of=

reality. Hence, what is seen in dreams and what is seen in waking are both=

equally unreal.

The necessity for accepting this teaching is explained ne=
xt.

437 The truth of the unreality of the world has here been taught to on=
e who
earnestly wants to attain the supreme state by pursuing the quest of =
the
real Self. How can one who believes the world to be real ever become ri=
ghtly
aware of the supreme reality, the Self?

438 When the sun of right aw=
areness dawns, what happens is only the
cessation of the unreal appearing a=
s real.The real Self is the sun of pure,
infinite consciousness. How can ig=
norance exist in its presence?

439 If it is thought that ignorance exists,=
 then there is present for the
aspirant the question, =E2=80=98To whom is t=
he ignorance?=E2=80=99 If by that question the
truth of the Self is sought,=
 then the ignorant one and the ignorance both
become extinct.

440 Ignoranc=
e is accepted in the teaching only as pertaining to the
individual jiva, wh=
o is just a figment of the imagination. It is not
accepted as affecting the=
 real Self, because it is ever enlightened by its
own nature, transcending =
all the three states of life in the world.

441 Just as the rope is never r=
elated in any way to the unreal snake seen in
it, so the real Self is never=
 related in space, time, or causality with the
world of variety, which is u=
nreal.

442 The saying that the Supreme Being is the cause of the world is =
incorrect
from the standpoint of the truth. The true cause of the world is =
maya, the
power of the Supreme Being.

443 In the sacred lore forms of the =
Brahman are mentioned, one the seedless,
and the other with seed. The seedl=
ess one is the transcendental Supreme
Being; the one with seed is God havin=
g the might of maya.

Which of these two is the real one? The answer is as =
follows:

444 The one Self, who is motionless by nature, appears to dance b=
ecause of
his own power. But when that power merges into the motionless ess=
ence, there
will shine the one motionless Self as the sole reality.

So, th=
e cause of variety is the power called maya. What about this maya?

445 May=
a is stated to be the cause to those who ask what is the cause of the
world=
, which really is unreal. From the standpoint of reality, both of
these, ma=
ya and its effect, are equally unreal.

446 The following sorts of question=
s are pointlessly asked =E2=80=98What is maya?
What is ignorance? By whom a=
nd how was the world originally created? How did
the individual soul come i=
nto being?=E2=80=99

These questions have no basis and need no answer. The =
final answer to all
such questions is the awareness of the real Self in the=
 egoless state. In
that state these and other questions will not arise, bec=
ause the questioner,
the ego-mind, will not survive in that state.

aya and its effect, are equally unreal.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:b=
old">446 The following sorts of questions are pointlessly asked =E2=80=98Wh=
at is maya? What is ignorance? By whom and how was the world originally cre=
ated? How did the individual soul come into being?=E2=80=99<br>

<br>These =
questions have no basis and need no answer. The final answer to all such qu=
estions is the awareness of the real Self in the egoless state. In that sta=
te these and other questions will not arise, because the questioner, the eg=
o-mind, will not survive in that state.</span><br>
