Respected Mr. PVR Narasimha Rao,

May I request YOUR view on the subject. G=
iven you are very well read on both Dwaita and Adwaitya philosophy, what is=
 your take on the subject. 

Can a human soul reincarnate in a non-human bo=
dy? And if so what is the rationale?

PS: I am aware of the reasoning in mo=
st vedic literature - e.g.
a) To reap the fruits of past karmas
b) The last=
 thought carries the soul in the new body etc.

The question, however, is t=
hat the Human mind & body is fully capable of experiencing all sufferings (=
as I am sure most would agree). Besides, vedic literature also gives elabor=
ate description of the different types of HELLS - where a paap-Atma suffers=
. What then necessitates a birth in a non-human form.

Is it possible that =
the vedic references of non-human births were just meant to be deterrents f=
or those who are intellectually less elevated?
 
Value your opinion. Others=
 are welcome to share their views.
Thank you for your time & attention.

Re=
gards,
Mahesh
