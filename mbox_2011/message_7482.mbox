Namaste Friends,

As current discussions are going on, I am inspired to wri=
te few personal experiences related to Chandi-path/ Durga-Saptashati. Pleas=
e forgive me/ignore me for I do not have ability to write systematically an=
d i write things from my own experiences.

***
If one wishes to know the be=
nefits of Chandi path, one can simply go though 11th chapter later part and=
 12th chapter where in Mother herself describes those.
***
I started Chandi=
 path in Jan 2008 (As per tradition) unplanned-with my own intuition and wi=
thout any initiation (I even did not know that Initiation is required for C=
P). I went ahead to complete 108 consecutive days of recitation.
After that=
, within few months a Guru came in my life and also Agni Sadhana. Since the=
n Chandi-path (whether In terms of Simple recitation or Chandi Havan) is pa=
rt of my daily life. 
A couple of years back, My Guru told me that 13 chapt=
ers are the most important part and it is ok to recite 13 chapters and skip=
 other limbs. So I started reciting 13 chapters only-daily. It was taking 1=
 hour 20 minutes earlier which has come down to 50 minutes and loud recitat=
ion has changed to mental recitation.
***
Though I was reciting CP daily si=
nce a long time, nobody from my near ones was interested in that. I never f=
orced or even insisted anybody to do that. I knew the hard fact that spendi=
ng 2/3 hours of time daily is almost not possible for people.
As it happene=
d one day in Jan 2010, I forced my sister to recite CP over a phone convers=
ation. I say I forced her because I told her that If she loves me sincerely=
, She must start Chandi Path recitation and to make her start that I sudden=
ly got one idea. I asked her to recite Kavach and one chapter in Rotation d=
aily. Kavach+1st ch, Kavach+2nd ch=85.Kavach+13 ch. Kavach+1st Ch and so on=
=85.She accepted the idea and started. Thank you so much to MAA that she st=
arted. Violation of traditional way never crossed my mind and never bothere=
d me. Maa is very kind. Very compassionate. She did not let down me. My Sis=
ter, just after few weeks of recitation started getting strange happy world=
ly results (Sattwik though) and she got a miraculous relief from a issue wh=
ich was troubling her for many years. That Initial encouragement was enough=
 to cement her faith and since then she is doing recitation on daily basis =
(same way).
After that trigger, one by one many people started CP same way.=
 My wife, Brother, his wife, few distant relatives, few close friends and f=
ew colleagues. More than Dozen people are now reciting it daily.

Many of t=
he above mentioned people who started CP actually got some instant surprisi=
ng material results which cemented their faith which was very strong factor=
 that is keeping them reciting it daily. 
For Instance, One lady whose daug=
hter was not having child even after 5 years of marriage, called my wife on=
e day and asked her to check with me her daughter's chart for the progeny. =
Instead of seeing the chart, I asked my wife to convey that let her start r=
eading CP daily (Kavch+1 ch). It so happened that she said started CP on 1s=
t day of chaitri Navaratri and on the same day she got good news from her d=
aughter.
Another lady, suffering from sever problems in marriage is now get=
ting very encouraging results regarding her marital life. Even I feel that =
it is a kind of miracle because it was a hopeless situation for her.
***
I =
am not saying here that all the apparent good things will happen if one sta=
rts reciting CP. I also do not wish to discount importance of traditional m=
ethod of reciting CP. I myself started that way and did it for almost coupl=
e of years. However I definitely wish to stress a point that Mother is very=
-very kind. Especially in times we live in, she would not look for perfect =
ritualistic method for Chandi recitation even though people recite in hope =
of some material (reasonable) benefits.
In fact, I have gone through major =
material and spiritual problems since I started Chandi Path and Havan. Howe=
ver for me, I most of the times never thought for benefits and keep going w=
ith CP as I think I have started loving her. I started CP because I wanted =
to progress spiritually.

 It is my strong faith (developed due to my exper=
iences as well as some sound logic) that in Kaliyuga, recitation of CP with=
 some level of devotion is enough and more important than traditional techn=
icalities such as particular Method, specific range of voice, speed,Initiat=
ion etc=85

So friends, it is important to start Loving mother. If you are =
bogged down by idea of complete Chandi path daily then start with 1 ch or 2=
 ch or 3 ch + Kavach daily or which ever way suitable to you. As Vimalanand=
a, a great devotee of Mother, used to fondly say=85carve your own niche! 
O=
nce you start it, Maa will take care and provide further guidance as when r=
equired. Leave it to her. Eventually start ignoring results and keep doing =
whatever may be the results. My concluding comments are that Chandi Path is=
 "Sab dukho ki ek dawaa" =96 It's a sure shot Rama-bana.
  
While at the mo=
ment when Shani dewa is on the verge of entering Tula Rashi (Uchha Rashi-Uc=
hha Navamansha as per SSS), I pray to Maa Chandi to drive many more closer =
to her by easiest & one of her most effective instrument called Chandi-Path=
.
