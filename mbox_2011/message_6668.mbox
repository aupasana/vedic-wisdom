 Translated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai
=

49. The eagle rushes only to its nest hoping to find rest there. Similarly=

the Jiva eager only to experience the bliss of Brahman rushes to sleep.

5=
5. Just as what happens outside in the street may be called external and
wh=
at is done inside the house internal, so the experiences of the waking
stat=
e may be called external and the dreams produced inside the mind and the
ne=
rvous system may be called internal.

56. The Shruti says: =E2=80=98In slee=
p even a father is no father=E2=80=99. Then in the
absence of all worldly i=
deas the Jivahood is lost and a state of pure
consciousness prevails.

58. =
A text of the Atharva Veda says: =E2=80=98In the state of deep sleep, when =
all
the objects of experience have been absorbed and only darkness (Tamas)
=
prevails, the Jiva
enjoys bliss=E2=80=99.

59. A man from deep sleep rememb=
ers his happiness and ignorance and says: =E2=80=98I
was sleeping happily; =
I knew nothing then=E2=80=99.

60. Recollection presupposes experience. So =
in sleep there was experience.
The bliss
experienced in dreamless sleep is =
revealed by consciousness itself which
also reveals
the undifferentiated ig=
norance (Ajnana) covering bliss in that state.

69. The self (Chidabhasa) i=
n the waking and dream states, is connected or
associated with various shea=
ths such as Vijnanamaya and appears as many
(i.e.,
plays various roles). In=
 the deep sleep state, however, they get merged and
become
latent like a do=
ugh of many (powdered) wheat-grains.

72. In the enjoyment of the bliss of =
Brahman in deep sleep, the
consciousness
reflected in ignorance is the mean=
s. Prompted by its Karma, good or bad, the
Jiva
gives up the enjoyment of b=
liss and goes out to the waking state.

74. For a short time after the waki=
ng up the impression of the bliss of
Brahman enjoyed during sleep continues=
. For he remains for some time calm
and happy,without taking any interest i=
n the enjoyment of external objects.

75. Then, impelled by his past action=
s ready to bear fruits, he begins to
think of duties and their implementati=
on entailing sufferings of many kinds
and gradually forgets the bliss of Br=
ahman experienced (a few minutes
before).

77. (Objection): Well, if a mere=
 state of quietude were enjoyment of the
bliss of
Brahman then the lazy and=
 the worldly would achieve the end of their life.
What then
is the use of t=
he teacher and the scriptures ?

78. (Reply): Your contention would be corr=
ect, if he realised that the bliss
that he
experienced was the bliss of Bra=
hman. But who can know Brahman that is so
immensely profound without the he=
lp of the teacher and the scripture ?

79. (Objection): I know what Brahman=
 is from what you yourself have said.
Why then am I without the bliss of re=
alisation ? (Reply): Listen to the
story of a man who like yourself imagine=
d that he was wise.

80. This man, hearing that a large reward was offered =
to anyone who knew the
four
Vedas, said, =E2=80=98I know from you that ther=
e are four Vedas. So give me the
reward=E2=80=99.

81. (Objection): He knew=
 the number, not the text, of the Vedas fully.
(Reply): You
too have not kn=
own Brahman fully.

82. (Objection): Brahman is by nature indivisible and i=
s bliss absolute,
untouched by
Maya and its effects. How can you speak of t=
he knowledge of Brahman as
complete
or incomplete ?

83. (Reply): Do you si=
mply say the word =E2=80=98Brahman=E2=80=99 or do you see its meaning
? If
=
you know only the word, it remains for you to acquire knowledge of its
mean=
ing.

92. In the waking state the Jiva gets identified with the body, as fi=
re with
a red-hot ball of iron. As a result of this he comes to feel with c=
ertainty:
=E2=80=98I am a man=E2=80=99.

116. =E2=80=98Mind has been descri=
bed as of two types, pure and impure. The impure
is that which is tainted b=
y desires, the pure is that which is free from
desires=E2=80=99.

117. =E2=
=80=98The mind alone is the cause of bondage and release. Attachment to
obj=
ects leads to bondage and freedom from attachment to them leads to
release=
=E2=80=99.

125. A man carrying a burden on his head feels relief when he r=
emoves the
load;similarly a man freed from worldly entanglements feels he i=
s in rest.

132. The knower of truth, experiencing the bliss of Brahman in =
the waking
state experiences it also in the dreaming state, because it is t=
he
impressions received in the waking state that give rise to dreams.

XII.=
 THE BLISS OF THE SELF

5. Yajnavalkya instructed this by pointing out to h=
is beloved wife,
Maitreyi, that =E2=80=98a wife does not love her husband f=
or his sake=E2=80=99.

6. The husband, wife or son, riches or animals, Brah=
manahood or
Kshatriyahood, the
different worlds, the gods, the Vedas, the e=
lements and all other objects
are dear to
one for the sake of one=E2=80=99s=
 own Self.

7. A wife shows affection to her husband when she desires his c=
ompany; the
husband too reciprocates but not when he is engaged in worship =
or afflicted
with
illness, hunger and so forth.

8. Her love is not for her=
 husband=E2=80=99s sake but for her own. Similarly the
husband=E2=80=99s
lo=
ve also is for his own satisfaction and not for hers.
