> Can somebody please tell me what is the difference between sleep and
meditation.

This is my current humble opinion on this topic: sleep is a state in which
our Consciousness recedes back to such an extent that we lose most of our
contact with the senses and also most of our control over the body. It is a
state in which the senses and body are still active, but our Consciousness
has taken some off time.
In contrast meditation, our Consciousness rises up with so much power that
the senses are pushed back. In a good meditative state, the senses have been
cajoled into not disturbing the Consciousness with their load, the body has
fixed itself in a stable state, and with them both gone backstage,
Consciousness shines as it is with all its brilliance.

> Sometimes while meditating i forget everything and then few seconds later
realise that i am here for meditation. Is it sleep or meditation?

"i forget everything" can mean different things, and it's in general
difficult to express meditative experiences in words. But the above should
give you a clue: if you forget everything and just go blank, and then feel
like you've come back after lost time, it's probably just sleep. On the
other hand, if you forget everything material or concerning your body/mind,
and experience your consciousness fully, if you feel very potent energy in
the experience, then it was meditation.

Hope that helps. Please point out any mistakes, I'm only a humble seeker and
make lots of them.

Regards,
Sundar
