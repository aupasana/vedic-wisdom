How would you describe Valmiki? He is widely conside=

though no vedic mantra is attributed to him.

aadhi during war, while brahmin sages needed seclusion for samaadhi. During=
 Rajayoga , King was Lord Vishnu. Lord Rama was always in such a state, the=
 last divine king. Arjuna was not a king, he was granted Rajayoga to fulfil=
 some specific purpose of God. Hence, he was a temporary Rajayogi or a Raja=
rshis. Today we find rajayogis in every street, who fear tapasyaa, hate yam=
a-niyama, and preach samaadhi to their likes. Shri Mad-Bhaagavata says in i=

yoga which Sage Patanjali named not rajayoga but Fourth Yoga, it is for utt=
