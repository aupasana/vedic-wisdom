The animal has its happiness in the senses, the man in his intellect, and t=
he god in spiritual contemplation. It is only to the soul that has attained=
 to this contemplative state that the world really becomes beautiful. To hi=
m who desires nothing, and does not mix himself up with them, the manifold =
changes of nature are one panorama of beauty and sublimity.
