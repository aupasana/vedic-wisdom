Sri Narasimha Garu,

Can i infer that no matter what the basic nature of th=
e diety is say ugra or satvick, my attitude/visualization of the diety is i=
mportant? I understand that say for Rama, i can see him as a Warrior or a K=
ingly person etc..So for a same Rama Mantra say just 'Sri Rama'..my visuali=
zation of his form gives the affect correspondingly..

Thanks
KK
