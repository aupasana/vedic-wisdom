Realization is the right word here; else, we tend to take what all was spok=
en literally without knowing the time, place and circumstances when those w=
ords were spoken.
In one of the brahmacharya classes, SrilaPrabhupad mentio=
ns that "one has to avoid women the way one avoids politicians". Afte some =
years, those comments were taken out of context and some people went on to =
say that SP was a male chauvinist :-)
Like SriVidyaPrakasanandagiri Swamiji=
 of SukaBrahmasramam in SriKalahasti mentioned, Janaka maharaj, who is not =
a sanyasi literally, must have been an extremely great realized soul and he=
nce a great renunciate, else which all great names were mentioned the Gita =
apart from King Janaka? Why would Lord Vishnu's consort prefer to be his da=
ughter ?

Prasad
