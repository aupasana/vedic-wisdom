Namaste,

> Planetary kavachas are not prescribed by Parasara as a remedy.T=
he BPHS 
> book i have gives specific remedial measures for each planetary =

> malevolence

Various kavachas have been mentioned in puranas compiled by=
 Pararsara's 
son Vyasa. BPHS as available to us today gives homas based on=
 Veda 
mantras, which is very good too.

*        *        *

> This is all=
 subjective talk.Can you define  "purity" or "required 
> purity"?Without d=
efining that ,marketing self Homams is a futile 
> exercise.

First, we are=
 not "marketing" anything. Everything needed is available 
freely on the in=
ternet and one doesn't even need to register with us to 
download the mater=
ials. They can anonymously download and try out. I 
find out that someone i=
s doing it, only if they voluntarily send me a 
mail to tell me so or to as=
k a question!

Second, the "futile exercise" has already enabled atleast 20=
00 people to 
do homam by themselves and so many people emailed me saying t=
hey've been 
doing homam for a few months and see a lot of positive change =
in 
thmselves.

Third, whatever sadhana one does, homam or japam or service=
 to people or 
whatever, internal purity is what enables it to work.

*    =
    *        *

Now, regarding the definition of "purity", well, it can be =
defined in 
many ways. You said: "one should remember bhagavad gita - Do yo=
ur duty 
without expecting anything in return". In other words, based on wh=
at one 
sees as one's dharma, one should perform actions firmly (as though =
one 
is passionate about a particular end result), and yet absolutely 
prep=
ared to face any end result in the end (i.e. if the end result is 
differen=
t from the goal, one doesn't become sad and thinks of what to do 
NOW). Suc=
h a person is most effective and untouched by karma.

I can define purity a=
s the level at which the above principle guides 
one's instincts, thoughts,=
 words and actions. Not just making lofty 
statements to impress others, bu=
t having enough self-control internally 
to always focus on the current act=
ion, do the best possible action and 
be unaffected by the result in the en=
d. How well one can follow that 
principle is a measure of how pure one is.=
 Other people may not be able 
to see how pure one is, but one's own consci=
ence does.

*        *        *

The catch is that the purer one is, one kn=
ows one's dharma (duty) 
clearer. Each person's dharma is different, based =
on one's debts from 
previous lives and one's skills. Nature expects differ=
ent things from 
different people. Knowing one's dharma is not easy. An imp=
ure and highly 
conditioned consciousness sees its dharma through the color=
ed glass of 
that conditioning and sees it incorrectly. Nevertheless, if on=
e keeps 
performing best actions with nishkama (i.e. prepared for any end 
=
result), eventually one's conditioning drops, one becomes purer, one's 
con=
science speaks louder and louder and one knows one dharma clearer and 
clea=
rer.

Conditioning or vasana is what makes you like and dislike things, wan=
t 
and avoid things/people etc. It is what makes it difficult to accept all=
 
end results of actions equally. It is what makes it difficult to engage 
=
in some actions.

As one does sadhana, one does not make much progress for =
a while. Once 
one crosses a threshhold, one falls into the groove and star=
ts making 
progress. One's dharma starts to become clearer and one's condit=
ioning 
starts to drop.

Best regards,
Narasimha
