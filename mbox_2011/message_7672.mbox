Dear Srikanth,
=C2=A0
Sometime back this question was asked by a friend of =
mine. 
=C2=A0
<<" Pancha Pretasanasina, Panch Brahmaswarupini" The one who =
sits on 4 corpses etc

and "Aparna Chandika Chanda Mundasura Nishudini">>
=
=C2=A0
Traditionally, so I am told, this verse is ment to understand that S=
he sits on a throne held by five corpses. These five corpses are of=C2=A0Br=
ahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Mahadeva and Sadashiva. Simply put, She is representat=
ive energy of everything. Personally, I don't like this explanation. To me =
the five pretas are the five koshas surrounding the human organism. She con=
trols all of them.
=C2=A0
Now if we take this line=C2=A0literally, She sits=
 on an asana of five pretas - spirits of a kind. You must have read the bio=
graphies of many siddhas who worshipped Lalita Tripursundari. How many have=
 you found who has had a vision of Her in this form, sitting on corpses? Th=
e Lalita Sahashranama is a complete text of ALL possible attirbutes of Lali=
ta Tripursundari. Of these, what percentage of names do you find which can =
be described as ugra?
=C2=A0
Consider this example. If you ask 100 people w=
ho is Sachin Tendulkar, all will reply that he is a great cricketer. But is=
n't Tendulkar also a father, brother, son, husband, a responsible citizen o=
f India, a consumer at the local grocery store, and for all you know maybe =
even a reasonable bathroom singer? These are all his identities too. But wh=
y don't we refer to them when we speak of Tendulkar? Because his central de=
fining identity for us is his cricket.
=C2=A0
Same way, each deity eventual=
ly is everything. But each has its own "defining identity" which has its ow=
n set of attributes. Of all the people worshipping Lalita Tripursundari at =
this very moment, probably a 2 percent or less=C2=A0will realize Her in thi=
s lifetime. Of these, 99.9999999999999999999 percent will realize Her ONLY =
in Her=C2=A0chief identity as Lalita. How many will, or have till date, act=
ually realized that form of Lalita Tripursundari sitting on a pretasana? An=
d why is this form=C2=A0so remote and so uncommon for most standard worship=
pers of Lalita Tripursundari? These are questions to ponder!
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=
I've very little knowledge of worship of Sri Lalita Tripursundari, either t=
heoritical or from the point of practical worship,=C2=A0but if there is bea=
uty in this world, it is Her.=C2=A0Like a five course gourmet=C2=A0meal, li=
ke a sublime poetry, like=C2=A0an efforlessly brilliant music, like a dazzl=
ing play of lights, like a classic Tendulkar shot,.... all these combined t=
ogether and much much=C2=A0more ...you feel and wish that it never comes to=
 an end. It is difficult to describe the feeling that She evokes, but it's =
like a flood of pure, distilled essence of=C2=A0beauty and you feel like th=
ere is nothing more to be done, no goal to reach, no path to walk, no battl=
es to fight -=C2=A0simply bask in the depth of the moment because therein l=
ies fullfilment and a whole new world! She banishes the very roots of the s=
ense of strife and ugliness from your system... the knowledge that She exis=
ts is enough to incapacitate you from asking anything more. She is THE grea=
test=C2=A0poetry of all
 possible Universes of all possible cycles of creat=
ion.

=C2=A0 
All,

If we take a Soumya=
 (according to us) Devata like Sri Lalita Tripura Sundari, how do we correl=
ate to the following verses from Lalitha Sahasranaam:

" Pancha Pretasanasi=
na, Panch Brahmaswarupini" The one who sits on 4 corpses etc

and "Aparna C=
handika Chanda Mundasura Nishudini"

In my little sadhana I have done with =
Maha Vidyas, I found that we are actually praying the spectrum and not the =
Specific Frequency Band.

Soumya and Ugra are Gunas of human mind and are u=
sed by Mother like a toy when she wants and throws it away and she is beyon=
d Gunas. 

The dream you had could be your minds projection too or it could=
 be your psyche which is getting adjusted to her mantra and best way is to =
approach MOTHER with Utmost Love and Respect. As you repeat her mantra your=
 mind and body will get adjusted to it. Please develop a personal relations=
hip with Maa and assume her in your heart with physical form and see the ma=
gic.

=C2=A0I utterly fail to explain her POWER. She is indeed very powerfu=
l and the results are immediate and your enlightenment is HER AIM too:-)

t=
hanks
