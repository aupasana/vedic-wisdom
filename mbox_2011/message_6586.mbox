Namaste,

Thanks for sharing these posts, they have certainly benefited e=
veryone. As you 
mention you are a staunch believer in the  sannayasa path,=
 could you please 
share what your concept of  the sannyasa path is?  The p=
osts form Swami 
Sivananda are great but the fragmented nature of the posts=
 only provide a 
glimpse of his vision of sannaysa. 


While he stressed Gy=
ana yoga, he actually gave equal emphasis on other paths...

http://www.dls=
hq.org/religions/siva_religion.htm

For e.g. he states about the Divine Lif=
e Society, " It explains how although the 
central basis is Jnana Yoga, Ved=
anta, it is necessary for   one to practise 
Karma Yoga for purification of=
 mind and heart; Hatha Yoga to keep up good   
health and strength and puri=
fy the Prana and steady the mind; Raja Yoga to 
destroy the   Sankalpas and=
 induce concentration in meditation; and Jnana Yoga 
to remove the veil of =
  ignorance and ultimately rest in one's own Satchidananda 
Svarupa. "

On =
his views on sannyasa and sannyasin's, he stressed more on the inner 
trans=
formation than mere outer change in garb...

http://www.yogamag.net/archive=
s/1992/cmay92/sssviews.shtml

" Sannyas is real internal transformation. It=
 is not mere taking geru cloth          
from somebody.' It is not shaving =
the head, wearing orange-coloured robes          
and bearing a kamandalu. =
The mere taking of sannyas is no sannyas; there          
must be complete =
transformation of mind. "

In fact, the very motto of the DLS is, "Serve, L=
ove, Mediate, Realize", not 
renunciate!

sincerely,
Chandraprakash
