Respected Fellow members,

Before I proceed on this, let me put the disclai=
mer first. I have no ill intent 
against the holistic science and rather ha=
ve great regards towards the "actual 
true science". This thought provoking=
 ("atleast per myself") mail is on the 
current state of astrology and is n=
ot intended to hurt anyone.

And before I proceed further, I would love to =
rewrite a few well known facts as 
under: -

- Best of astrologers have a s=
uccess rate of less than 75% over their life time.
- These days, a lot (if =
not most) of "practicing" astrologers have not even 
learnt astrology from =
authentic sources.
- There is lot of money laundering going on in the name =
of astrological 
remedies.
- All good astrologers believe that there are de=
finitely some missing parts of 
actual science and current knowledge is inc=
omplete if not corrupt.
- And there are several examples where, very "respe=
cted and learned" astrologers 
of the day themselves have failed marriage"s=
", or problem with progenies or so 
on.
- If SSS Vs Drik debate is won by S=
SS, that would pose serious questions on most 
of the predictions made in l=
ast so many years.


- Unfortunately despite all this, predictions are give=
n day-in and day-out by 
"astrologers" of the day.

With this background, I=
 would like to begin my article. The sole idea is that if 
we known from we=
ll within that the science we are practicing can be incorrect, 
incomplete =
or corrupt and our accuracy is not better than 50% (average of most 
astrol=
ogers and not the best ones) which is as good as simple probability; then 
=
are we really doing the right thing. Few may argue that they do it for free=
 and 
treat it as social service while for those who are charging will come=
 up with 
great success stories of their own. I dont want to get into any d=
ebate but just 
want people to be honest to themselves and ask themselves. =


I dont want to sound offensive but just want to bring in the realization.=
 A lot 
of people approach astrologers in very rough times of their lives. =
And with 
current state of astrology the prediction they get are somewhat e=
xpected. The 
astrologer would "somehow" explain the current conditions eve=
n if one is running 
the best dasha of his life (per astrologer's own knowl=
edge) and would even 
suggest a remedy too. And after the remedy is done, t=
he help seeker is being 
cheated of his faith as well as money. 

A lot of =
people in India get married based on chart matching. And a thousand 
astrol=
ogers are available in every city for a task. And still a lot of marriages =

fail badly. And then, "they" say that was destiny. I know of a friend who =

visited several astrologers for matching his chart with her fiancee. And 
=
everyone was so convinced of a great alliance. And one year later, divorce =
was 
being discussed seriously. So, he approached more astrologers and all =
of them 
found something or other wrong with the charts and said this was d=
ue. He asked 
them very honestly a very simple question, had I not told you=
 of the latest 
developments, had you still figured out those problems. And=
 the honest ones did 
really admit the truth.

All I want to bring out is t=
hat firstly the knowledge is definitely not complete 
as of today and secon=
dly that the "majority" that is practicing it today doesnt 
have the requir=
ed qualities (ability, sincerity, "purity" etc) to do it. Please 
see for y=
ourselves that actually how much good have you done to other's lives by 
yo=
ur holy practice. A tough question to answer is, "Does astrology of today d=
oes 
any good to anyone"? And ofcourse I mean the querist and not the astro=
loger who 
is making a lot of money out of it. Even teaching astrology has =
become such a 
prosperous business. Rather astrology is also catching up as=
 a fashion these 
days.

The actual intent is not to criticize the astrolog=
y or demoralize the truthful 
souls practicing it with uttermost sincerity.=
 The intent is to provoke a few 
people (or a lot) to realize the danger th=
ey possess to society with their 
"impure" knowledge. My humble request to =
those, who agree with me, stop 
practicing it unless you are sure of it. On=
e may keep researching but predicting 
is a serious business IMHO.

Regards=
,
