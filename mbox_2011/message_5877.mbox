 T.P.Ramachandra Iyer was a native of Tiruvannamalai. His interest in
relig=
ion and philosophy led him to Sri Ramana in the 1920s. As a lawyer in
Madra=
s, he handled much of the Ashram=E2=80=99s legal work. He also served as an=

interpreter and as an attendant in the Maharshi=E2=80=99s hall.

The follo=
wing article was published in the July 1966 issue of The Mountain
Path.

Sr=
i T. P. Ramachandra Iyer whose native home is Tiruvannamalai itself, has
be=
en an earnest devotee of Sri Bhagavan from very early times. He hails from
=
an ancient orthodox Brahmin family who for generations were well known in
T=
iruvannamalai for their traditional learning, discipline and piety.

Endear=
ingly known and called merely as =E2=80=98TPR=E2=80=99 by Sri Bhagavan and =
others, he
has lived as one of Sri Bhagavan's =E2=80=98family=E2=80=99 here=
 for decades.

Sri Bhagavan has narrated an incident of 1896, the year of h=
is arrival in
Tiruvannamalai, when he was staying in the precincts of Sri A=
runachala
Temple.TPR's grandfather, an elderly and pious person who used to=
 visit him
daily, one day, out of affection and regard, conducted him to hi=
s house and
gave a ceremonial meal in the householder's manner. This was th=
e only house
which Sri Bhagavan entered to take biksha in the usual way aft=
er he had left
his Madurai home. This information was given in full detail =
by Sri Maharshi
himself.

The present Ashram, almost from its inception has=
 grown and developed to his
knowledge and he has been actively associated w=
ith every branch of its
growth, while maintaining close contact with Sri Bh=
agavan and depending on
him for guidance. Few
have had this privilege of mo=
ving with Sri Bhagavan for so many years with
the ease and freedom of a dev=
oted son to an affectionate parent.

This gave him ample opportunities of r=
eceiving instruction, and guidance
directly or indirectly from Sri Bhagavan=
. In later years, it also led to his
being helpful in interpreting Sri Bhag=
avan's utterances to some of the
western devotees and those who did not kno=
w Tamil.

TPR was also instrumental in seeing through the press a few editi=
ons of Sri
Bhagavan's early works, particularly the 3rd edition of =E2=80=
=98Sri Ramana Nool
Tkirattu=E2=80=99 (=E2=80=98The Collected Works of Sri M=
aharshi=E2=80=99 in Tamil).

When Sri Bhagavan's fatal physical affliction =
appeared for the first
time,ending in an operation, and then recurred, TPR =
made up his mind and
wound up his practice and
interests in Madras.

Therea=
fter he was fortunate enough to join the small band of attendants who
looke=
d after Sri Bhagavan's personal comforts and needs. During the whole
two ye=
ars the illness lasted, he stayed permanently with him and the
opportunitie=
s of service he had are treasured by him. He was helpfully
assisting the do=
ctors in attendance during the anxious months preceding the
14th April 1950=
 by his instructive guidance and meticulous attention to
prescribed routine=
s.

(Sri T.P.Ramachandra Iyer attained the lotus feet of Sri Bhagavan on Au=
gust
26th, 1976 in Bangalore.)
