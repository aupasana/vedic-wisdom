Principles of Daily Spiritual Practice

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya


=
"The Sanskrit term 'sadhana' means a systematic and disciplined path of spi=
ritual practice under the guidance of a qualified Acharya (Spiritual Teache=
r). When a person feels called to devote themselves more fully to a systema=
tic spiritual discipline to achieve self-realization and God-realization, t=
hey then begin to follow a sadhana practice. Merely having a curious intere=
st in spiritual topics has no meaning unless one is also engaging in a dedi=
cated
spiritual practice designed to bring spiritual realization to life. S=
adhana, thus, represents the very beginning of meaningful spiritual pursuit=
.

The following is a collection of practical, scripturally-based, guidelin=
es from the teachings of Sanatana Dharma that will help us to more fully de=
velop our innate spiritual potential. Sadhana, or spiritual practice, must =
be performed regularly with sincerity, humility, openness, and determinatio=
n. Just as we all perform our daily routines of eating, sleeping, and bathi=
ng without fail, similarly we should practice our daily spiritual sadhana w=
ithout fail to refine ourselves and to advance in spiritual life. We should=
 monitor our progress every day by asking ourselves if today we have improv=
ed ourselves and come closer to God.

By following a daily spiritual practi=
ce under the guidance of Sri Guru, we can continuously deepen our experienc=
e and realization of the Divine...."
