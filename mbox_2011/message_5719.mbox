As soon as selfish desires arise, as soon as some selfish pursuit is follow=
ed, immediately the whole man, the real man, is gone: he is like a brute, h=
e is a slave, he forgets his fellow men. No more does he say, 'You first an=
d I afterwards', but it is 'I first and let every one else look out for him=
self'.
