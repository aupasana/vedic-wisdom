Great going Rama, keep it up!!=C2=A0
=C2=A0
But I think you should opt for =
jaggery instead of white sugar. White sugar is passed through bone masses o=
f animals. Everywhere in puja stores they sell white sugar crystals which I=
 think=C2=A0is inappropriate for naivedyam. Also for prasadam, sweets shoul=
d be made of jaggery rather than white sugar.
