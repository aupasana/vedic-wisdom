You did n't ask me, still I will respond :-) In fact, I read this group at =
times, and sometimes I felt like responding. Today, I am not in a great moo=
d and let me show my disagreement :-)

 Come out of Soumya, rudra (ugra) de=
vata, etc. your personal devata is your personal. You can get angry with hi=
m, love him, think he has not done enough for you, and still love him. 
I a=
m surprised these lessons have come from someone who questioned his (once) =
guru, why one cannot use rudraksha to pray Lord Vishnu and use tulasi beads=
 to pray Lord Siva and bhakti can go beyond those !

All these dust will se=
ttle / ugra devata will punish but give faster results are just unacceptabl=
e, I wish there is proof for those, unless we say pudding here :-)

Let's s=
ay, you have to move back to India, would you consider it as "my homam has =
worked and I have been punished so that I can prosper spiritually" or if yo=
u get to stay back in US would you say "my homam has worked and my devata h=
as granted me my wishes" ! The answer you do not know. None of us even unde=
rstand what is right and what is wrong for us or for the world. You live wi=
th what you think is right for you. 

Take it Steve Jobs way. Give your bes=
t shot and if you lose, you can learn from the lessons :-)  He came to Indi=
a, stayed in Sh Neem Karoli Baba's (I guess I got the name right) ashram an=
d went back with thoughts that Einstein and Faraday have done more for huma=
ns ! He went to do what he likes and is convinced with. The point is, what =
do you like ? If you love to do homam, just keep doing it and see what chan=
ge it brings *in you*, not what changes it brings *to you*. 

People like m=
e who questioned a lot took years just to understand Srila Prabhupada's wor=
ds. While someone like Sh Jananivasa Prabhu and Sh Bhakti Raghava Maharaj h=
ad faith in Lordships of Sh RadhaKrsna and SP and dedicated their lives to =
Krsna bhakti. I was fortunate to meet the former, while I was unfortunate n=
ot to have been initiated by the latter, you will find both of them Sh Mani=
sh Pandit's video on Lord Krsna. They are in the video for a reason for sur=
e, they are exalted devotees. The difference between me and the exalted dev=
otees of Iskcon is, they are truly surrendered to Lord and I am waiting for=
 the Lord to surrender to me and help me when needed ! Someday, when I lear=
n, I will crib less :-)

One more example here, if it interests you. When I=
 went to Iskcon Santa clara, the temple was small. If I were maintaining th=
at temple, the first thing I would have mentioned is I have been doing so m=
uch to build a bigger temple, but *one day there will be a bigger temple, L=
ord willing*. This is what Vaisesika Prabhu who heads the temple mentioned =
"We are all fortunate that their holy Lordships agreed to stay with us for =
the last 7 years in this garage, let us do our best to give them a better p=
lace". Enough said. 

Do not get into what deities would do, they know what=
 to do. Whether they throw the rotten fruits first or not is not known to u=
s. While spreading of homam is totally amazing and appreciated, the stuff l=
ike soumya devatas are slow and ugra devatas are fast is labeling them with=
out knowing them completely. At Iskcon, Lord Radha Krsna and Sh Narasimhade=
v are prayed on the same altar.

Finally, it is not that you will get spiri=
tual, the kundalini will touch sahasrara and you are happily out ! Srila Pr=
abhupada once told Harikesa maharaj "Go to Russia and start preaching and s=
pread HareKrsna mahamantra". Harikesa maharaj mentioned "They eat meat and =
do other sinful activities, what will happen to my Krsna consciousness". SP=
 said "To hell with your Krsna consciousness, there are fallen souls who ne=
ed delivery". Nicely put :-)

Summing it up, I complain to Lordships if thi=
ngs donot go well, still I chant everyday as I love them. Exalted devotees =
of Iskcon will not do it that way and may not crib like me, but the point i=
s they are the Lords.

Anyways, I put this quickly, hope it makes sense.
