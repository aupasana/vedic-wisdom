When women are equipped with the four means of salvation, they are also qui=
te eligible for sannyasa. They are as efficient as men in the field of spir=
ituality.

When one is born with sannyasa samskaras no force on the earth c=
an prevent him or her from taking sannyasa. Even if you keep a hundred guar=
ds to prevent them from leaving the house they cannot check them. The fathe=
r of the great Buddha guarded him in all possible ways, but his horse scale=
d the heights of the compound and took him to the forest. It is only the ef=
feminate, impotent, timid men (who are only moustached ladies), with no goo=
d samskaras, and no spiritual asset, who are spiritual bankrupts, that will=
 cling to things mundane and die like worms. They will speak against sannya=
sa. He who has understood the glory and freedom of sannyasa, a real child o=
f Sri Shankara, Sri Dattatreya, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanatkumara=
, cannot remain even for a day in the pravritti-marga.
