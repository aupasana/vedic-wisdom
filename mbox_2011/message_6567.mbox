When you sit in meditation, first think of a blissful Divine form. This
wil=
l have a soothing effect on  your nerves and mind. Otherwise 
meditation wi=
ll  become dry and tedious. Think of the  form of  your
Ishtam(Ideal)  as  =
smiling and full of bliss.
While  away  your time  no longer. Now the sense=
s are  strong and must
be kept  under control. This is  no doubt a troubles=
ome task. But
practise  Sadhana continuously for seven or eight years, then=
 you will
enjoy the fruits of  your practices, the peace and bliss thereof.=

Many  women devotees  have attained spiritual illumination. Should you
not=
 also  strive  for it? But women have  greater faith than men.
That is  why=
 they succeed in a comparatively short time.
Believe  me, the Lord is alway=
s with you. If  you practise a little,  He
will extend His helping hand to =
 you. It  is  He who is protecting
us  all from miseries  and  troubles. Ho=
w unbounded  is His grace! How
can I describe it to you?
