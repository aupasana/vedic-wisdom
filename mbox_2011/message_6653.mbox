Ajit, 

Many thanks to you and Utpal, to you too! 

I was able to successfu=
lly integrate my Sandhyavandanam today with Homam in the method you suggest=
ed. I really liked the feeling after. It seems a natural flow, purification=
s rituals (first part of Sandhyavandanam), actual homam and after poornahut=
i, doing the second part of Sandhyavandanam (meditation) following by Suryo=
pasthana, digdevata namaskarams, salutations to all forms of God, pravara a=
nd following by Shanti Mantras of Homam! Now I plan to do this everyday, Go=
d permitting! 

Nagraj
