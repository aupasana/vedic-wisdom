Namaste Narasimha,
Pranaam.
Thank you for your kind sharing of thoughts on =
this topic. I seek your
clarification on this point:
> (1) The rahasyas of =
Chandipath describes the Sarvasya Aadyaa (the >
Original Root of All) form =
of Mahalakshmi and also the 3 derived forms >
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and =
Mahasaraswati (the two Mahalakshmi forms >
are different!). It does not spe=
cifically describe the form of "Chandi".
If this does not specifically desc=
ribe the form of Chandi, why then, in
the Chandi Homam manual - the section=
 on Pranaa Pratishthaapanaa of
Chandi, you had included the verses from the=
 rahasyas of Chandipath?
Is there any other significance that I am missing =
in my understanding?
Thank you.
Warmest regards..
