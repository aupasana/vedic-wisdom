Let every father take the example of Uddalaka! Let every mother take the ex=
ample of Madalasa! Let every wife take the example of Chudala! Let every hu=
sband take the example of Yajnavalkya! Let all children, the sons and daugh=
ters, take the example of the four Kumaras! Then only life is said to be pe=
rfectly lived.
Never think that you are spoiling a person by teaching him s=
annyasa or Vedanta. It is the only lifegiving teaching. All other teachings=
 are mere play of words. Never think you are unfit for self-realization, th=
at you are unfit for sannyasa or Vedanta. This cowardly nature will not lea=
ve you if you do not exert to know the truth as it really is. Better aim at=
 a lion and miss it, than hunt a jackal and catch it. Better aim at sannyas=
a and Vedanta and fail in its practice than live a worldly life and succeed=
 in it. Remember, O remember that you are born for this Supreme End, not fo=
r anything else!
May you all empty yourselves of the ego through sannyasa a=
nd may you all fill yourselves with the truth of Vedanta!
