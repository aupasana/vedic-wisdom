Namaste all, 

Which are the tantra schools existing today in terms of form=
al gurus, diksha.

i am aware of only following two.
1. Sri vidya 
Devipura=
m and Rajarajeshwari peetham

2. International Nath order
http://www.nathor=
der.org/wiki/International_Nath_Order

These two are supposedly the Siva an=
d Shakti schools focussing at the root chakra. 

Is there any Mishra or Sam=
ya tantra schools as mentioned in 
http://www.swamij.com/tantra.htm#kaula

regards
priyank
