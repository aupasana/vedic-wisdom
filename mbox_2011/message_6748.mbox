My friend, you have some weird notions. Agni =
permeates the 14 worlds and 

is responsible for their smooth running. He c=
an take your offering 

anywhere and not just to "heaven". In homam/yajna, =
we make offerings to 

various beings living in various worlds. For example=
, in jayadi homam 

done at the end of various homas, we make offerings to =
pitris, parvatas, 

bhutas, samudras, yakshas etc.



Secondly, to one who =
sees Shiva as the supreme being, Shiva does not 

"live in" one place, but =
he is the underlying reality of everything.



Though Shiva is depicted as =
living in smashana (cemetary) with spirits, 

it has esoteric significance.=
 I elaborated this in a Sanskrit shloka I

Parasara mentioned making=

problems!!



Vishnu Dharmot=

In any homam, the final offerings made=
 are those to Vishnu and Rudra, 

irrespective of what homam it is. What Da=
ksha did was to break the rules 

by doing a "Nirishwara yajna". He was try=

that offerings should not be made to Shiva=

If you think it is "absolu=

Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Vishnu=
, Shiva, Krishna, Chandi etc. Pick somebody 

else. Or don't do homam at al=

BTW, I personally know people doing homam to Shiva and =
making brisk 

spiritual progress.



If you really want to "insult and rej=

off picking someone killing and raping i=

and religion. Or people 

engaging in so many worse evils on earth today. W=

Just for the rec=

voluntarily (and mentall=

performing homam, I do not mind=
 it. However, my main role is not to be a 

guru, but to show people their =
guru. Let me elaborate.

physical form even after you and I leave - Agni (Fire), th=

preceptor, guru, priest and purohit of Veda! Invite Agni into =
your life 

as your guru and purohit and spend some sacred time with him ev=

with reverence. He will transform you from the core and show the c=

direction. I am not a guru, but I can show you a guru who can chan=

for better.



And, BTW, I do not sell ANYTHING. So don't worry ab=
out "falling prey to

Period. No strings attached.
