The Jabalasruti says: =E2=80=9CThe wanderer, with renunciation, with colore=
d cloth, clean-shaven, desiring nothing, the pure, the faultless, the holy,=
 the beggar, becomes one with Brahman.=E2=80=9D

The Mundaka Upanishad says=
: =E2=80=9CThey who practice tapas with faith in the forest, the peaceful m=
en of wisdom, who live on bhiksha, who are above passion, depart through th=
e passage of the sun to where that immortal Purusha, the Imperishable One, =
abides. Having scrutinized the worlds that are attained through action, a B=
rahmana should arrive at dispassion and indifference. For the sake of this =
knowledge, let him go, fuel in hand, to a spiritual teacher who is learned =
in the srutis and established in Brahman. Those who have ascertained the me=
aning of the Vedanta knowledge, the earnest seekers after truth, with natur=
es purified through sannyasa yoga, they all, in the region of Brahman at th=
e end of time, are liberated beyond death.=E2=80=9D
