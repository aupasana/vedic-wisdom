Never mind. I gave more thought to it in the night and I understood what yo=
u meant.

Let's say one facet is the roopam of Lord Vishnu, once I move bey=
ond the facet, I will realize him beyond his roopam as "the Vishnu"(meaning=
 of which is all pervading). Same with Narayana (Parama purusha), SadaShiva=
 (not sure what sadashiva means?), Devi (all pervading energy), RadhaKrsna =
(the all attractive with pleasure potency) etc. These are all the attribute=
s of the One, the Supreme; the subset of which I get to experience with my =
conditioned existence in deity form and that is the facet. Once the facet o=
r that attribute is totally assimilated / understood deeply, one moves beyo=
nd it to understand the powerset, ie. all the attributes. Not sure if that =
is merging stage or awareness stage !

Hope my understanding is correct.

e, here is another facet I learnt. Lord Krsna has 64 qualities while Lord N=
arayana has 60 qualities only. Brahman is the effulgence of LordKrsna and t=
he ones who follow advaita get into a situation of no birth, no death and m=
erge in the brahma jyothi. This is under the rulership of Lord SadaShiva (t=
he supreme to all Sivas). The devotees of Lord Krsna (let us take it as dva=
ita) can have an eternal relationship with Lord serving them (Lord is never=
 alone, his hladini shakti as Radharani is always with him) either as a cow=
 or lotus plant or kadamba tree.

the facets of diamond are fine. But why do we need to attribute one facet's=
 relation with the other. So, either the relations are just an allegory or =
they are real. If they are real, then the relations have to respected as is=
. It also can mean, the supreme who has expanded himself or created the res=
t of the facets. If it is the latter, there is only one supreme and the nex=
t question is, who is that original ?
