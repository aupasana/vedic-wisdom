The Vedic scriptures are a vast =

purpose of these ancient scriptures, however, remain unnecessarily shrouded=
 in esoteric mystery for all too many spiritual seekers. In this incredible=

nature of th=

cts of Vedic spirituality that have been unknown to almost all followers an=
d teachers of Sanatana Dharma until now. If you can understand the scriptur=
es of Sanatana Dharma, you then possess the very foundation of spiritual re=
alization.<br>
