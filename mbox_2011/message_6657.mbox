Namaste,
=C2=A0
Apologies but I disagree with the option mentioned..... dis=
pose ashes in the garbage. 
Narsimha ji had mentioned throwing ash in the o=
cean as the best solution. Alternatively one should think of ideas like try=
 to mix some water in the ash and put it on plants, distribute it to friend=
s or apply it in your body. The ashes have lot of shakti and completely dis=
respectful to throw it in garbage. 
=C2=A0
Thanks and regards,
Priya

Thanks a lot for your patience and responses =

I browse this group occasionally and I missed to ask these questions o=

But again, thanks for all your answers.
