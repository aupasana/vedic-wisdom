Namaste all,

I've been doing extensive japa for Rahu lately and my experie=
nce has been that while I am reciting so much negative emotion comes up.  M=
y mind will be replaying bad experiences, bad decisions, things I feel guil=
ty about etc. all while I am on my asana, doing the japa.  Perhaps it is a =
"cleansing" of sorts as these are things I need to let go of? I don't exact=
ly feel at peace by the time I am finished.

Anyone care to comment on my e=
xperience?

Thanks!

Raj
