Sapthasathi parayanam is not a pill.  What you are reading is enough.  Try=
 reading it by understanding its meaning.    The vibrations will strengthen=
 you to handle your problems.  Rahu is bestowing what is owed to you as par=
t of your karma.  He is never the problem.  Prayers and meditations help in=
 strengthening the Atma balaa to handle what comes before us.  As one spiri=
tually progresses, one stops noticing positives and negatives and develop a=
n equanimity of mind and serenity that even helps others struggling around =
us to handle their issues.

Your problems will not seem has problems shortl=
y.  May Goddess be with you.
