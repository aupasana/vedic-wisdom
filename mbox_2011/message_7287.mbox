Translation -They who are true, eathing the oblation, drinking =
the
oblation, having the same car(ratha) with Indra and the Gods,with those=

thousand God-praising remote fore fathers who sit in heavens, come near
to=
 us O, agni.
Interpretation - Continuing with previous rik, agni is being i=
nvoked
here along with pitru devataas. earlier rik's invoked pitru devataas=
 who
are somyaasaH, the rik one before this invoked gharmasat pitru devataa=
s,
this rik is now invoking the other types of pitru devataas thus
completi=
ng all the types of pitru devataa invokation's namely -    pitru
devataas w=
ho eat the offered oblations - named haviradaH=3Dtechnically
hav(oblation)+=
ir+adaH(eat) =3D the ones who eat the sacrificial
oblations/offerings. havy=
abhokta?, this name is found in many other
places referring to pitru devata=
as - ex. RV 10.154.1, devatas -
RV.7.11.5, RV.5.1.11, gandharvaas- AV 4.37.=
8,9    pitru devataas who
drink the offered oblations - named haviShpaaH=3D=
technically 
hav(oblation)+iH+paa(drink) =3D the ones who drink the sacrifi=
cial
offerings. havyapaata?        pitru devataas who are liberated and are=

gharmasad (technically seated near fire, gharma=3Dfire/heat/sun, possibly
=
hindi garam is derived from this) residing in heaven share the same
ratha's=
 (chariots) of Indra and other Gods, our fathers who are
paraH[high, remote=
, possible epithet to heavens] and puurvaH[ancient]
along with them (paraiH=
=3Dwith remote, puurvaiH=3Dwith ancient forefathers),
agni is asked to come=
 to the place of oblation to accept the kavyam and
pass that to the pitru d=
evataas.
    paraaH and puurvaaH seems to be the same most often - the foll=
owing
two examples will throw some light and differentiate them -    RV 4.2=
.16
- yathaa naH pitaraH paraasaH shreShTaa - like our fathers who are
fart=
her than/beyond(paraa) excellent - compared by position    RV 5.3.8
-  tvaa=
m asyaa vyuShi deva puurve duutaM kR^iNvaanaa ayajanta havyaiH  -
At this d=
awn's flushing, O agni - our ancient fathers(puurve) served you
with offeri=
ngs, making you as their sacrificial bearer - compared by
time frame       =
pitru devataas are also termed here as
deva-vandaH[god-praising], they are =
addressed as God praising since in
the last rik agni is said to be stoma-ta=
ShTaaso arkaiH
(taShTaasaH[fahioned] by stoma[praise], and the praises are =
in the form
of arkaiH[hymns/songs]), so we are offering agni to come here a=
long with
pitru devataas who are kavyaH (accompanying priests, from last ri=
k i.e
10.015.09) and who are deva-vandaH (who know how to praise Gods) and
=
make the sacrifice complete.
