Dear Chandra prakash,

> > "Any intelligent, rational man is an atheist. Un=
til, of course he >>is initiated into religion."

Pure rational intelligenc=
e will be thoroughly logical and would want evidences (which can be perceiv=
ed by physical senses) for anything and everything. Same goes for existence=
 of God/Nature/Self/etc...so the by product is lack of belief in the core e=
ssence and purpose of religion i.e. Spirit.
He/she will naturally lack fait=
h (Shradhdhaa). Whenever, in life, due to bitter experiences and/or past Sa=
mskaaraas, Logic takes backseat and Faith is born, the person is initiated =
in to religion. It is actually Initiation in to internal religion which may=
 or may not reflect externally. However, it is my opinion that, it is bette=
r to depend upon Logical mind while inquiring for truth until faith is born=
  established and even after that in the journey.
I think, Dr. Atual's view=
 point matches the above. And you already know all these!

Personally, I am=
 tired of logic as my profession is the area of PLCs (i.e. Programmable *Lo=
gic* Controllers :) and writing Process *logic* for long. Logic is boring!
=

Logic-less (with faith) regards,

Utpal
