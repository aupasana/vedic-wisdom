Nagraj Ji 

Just chipping in before Narasimha Ji gets an chance to respond.=


1.The story given by Chaganti Koteswara rao garu is correct and the proof=
 of this occurs in the Uttarakhandam in the passage when Valmiki encounters=
 Sita devi .He does declare himself to be the son of Prachetana. Also this =
is present in some of the puranas as well.

However I fully agree with Nara=
simha Ji and many other great saints have tread the same path.Some of the o=
ther powerful examples to prove caste is not by birth alone. 

1.Vidura bor=
n to a maid was one of the dearest devotee's to Lord Krishna and is conside=
red a great Brahmana even though by birth he is not...

2.Saint Thiruvalluv=
ar of Southern India ..who is one of the greatest shiva bhaktas was born an=
 weaver.

3.Sant Ravidas born in a chamar caste of northern India who is hi=
ghly venerated in the bhakti movement.

4.Sant Choka Mela of Maharastha who=
se abhangs on Lord Vithala are sung to this day in Maharasthra.

5.Chandrag=
upta Maurya born to a Kshatriya father but mother belonging to the Muria tr=
ibe..

6.The ancestors of Shivaji themselves were cowherds by profession bu=
t later on took the title of kings and What a king Shivaji was....He succes=
sfully countered the onslaught of Islam and saved the entire southern India=
.


There was significant caste mobility in the original Hinduisum of rig v=
edic times.

Adi Shankara's Manisha panchakam episode in Kasi is even more =
famous.

I beleive Swami Vivekananda was entirely correct in claiming the p=
resent day is an distorted mangled version of the lofty version present in =
the rig vedic times where only aptitude and mental inclination defined one'=
s caste and significant mobility was present.

We would be better off disma=
ntling this system and encouraging sincere sadhakas from all groups to just=
 spend their time worshipping the divine in fire .

ur point that castes are portable and not determined by birth is a very val=

ribal by birth but he is Son of Prachetana, a brahmin of Bharadwajasa Gotra=

a great sage is a different story but I believed that he=C2=A0was not a sud=
ra by birth, based on his lectures.

, according to him! It is quite possible that even in olden days, different=

ge fire. I was sitting in front of the fire. A person with a powerful perso=
na, whom I had never seen before, sat in front of me. He was teaching me so=
me yoga involving fire and what yoga means etc. He taught several things in=
 Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed into Manish. Then shakti came down, naad sto=
pped, "dream" ended, and I was aware of my body lying on bed. The face of t=
he person I saw was vivid in my mind. I did not know who it was. I mentione=
d this dream to Manish a week or two later. He said he did not know who it =
was, but asked me a week later to check out the photo of a specific yogi. W=
hen I did a search on the internet, I found a photo (apparently the only ph=
oto

eam, except that the person in my dream seemed like a slightly younger vers=
ion of that photo. This was a famous yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar B=
abaji. As I had never seen his photo before that or read much about that li=
neage or their teachings, his coming in my dream was strange. Also, teachin=

tart then and I was not thinking of fire or fire ritual at all.
