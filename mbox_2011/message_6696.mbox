=C2=A0 
Hello AS,=C2=A0

Just say Viswanath, No need of Respected or Sir.=


So from the below mail. What I understood is that!! Every time, when you =
are done with a task, you want to go to temple. So after going to temple. W=
hat you do there ? What kind of prayer you do ? what do you like about temp=
le ? I may not be able to help you medically here. I can only suggest you t=
o come out of the certain thoughts and look the temple or GOD.

After compl=
eting a task if you want to go to temple and surrender your success or fail=
ure to GOD. That is the best thing that you are following. =C2=A0

Instead =
of going to temple for every simple task. try to extend you time period and=
 set a specific time to go to temple every day. Say for example If you have=
 a habit of going to Gym every morning. your brain is trained to go to gym =
every morning. once you go there you will never think of that again in you =
day.=C2=A0

Try to train your brain in a way that, for all the tasks that I=
 do today, I will go to temple in the evening or in the morning, a specific=
 time.=C2=A0

And when ever you get a thought of going to temple. Think tha=
t you are going in the evening any way.

And one more thing, think =C2=A0th=
is way when you are brain is telling you to go to temple every time. There =
is some thing that you have to do to temples. Some thing Good. And Good is =
always reminding you that.

If you are=C2=A0financially good, try to donate=
 money or =C2=A0try to do some kind of help at the temple like cleaning or =
helping priest to get some stuff.=C2=A0

Don't think God is making you to h=
ate him. Actually he want you do something good to temples which you took i=
t in a different way.=C2=A0

Hope this helps you. I apologize, if I miss un=
derstood you.=C2=A0

Thanks
Viswanath

=C2=A0 

Respected (=
Viswanath) Sir
Thank you very much for your reply. But I want to tell you t=
hat I hate God because one part of my brain always tells me from behind to =
go to a certain temple on accomplishing some task.And then I counter that t=
hought saying that I will not go to temple even if my work gets done. This =
way whole of my energy is exhausted in getting these obsessive thoughts and=
 countering them. I hate god because he forces me to do so.I was a very rel=
igious girl even since by childhood.
But now I cant see him.
Thanks
