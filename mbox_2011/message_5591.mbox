Dear Ivan
=C2=A0
If you have access to any Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, the=
n you can get MANTRAPUSPAM book as well as Audio from there, which has most=
 of the Stotras & suktas which you may be interested in.

Hari Om Tat Sat

Most humble pranams =
to all devotees of the Lord that are reading this post. I am currently stud=
ying vedic chanting and I have found some Audios and Lyrics of some of them=
, but then sometimes I have found only Lyrics or only Audio for some of the=
 Vedic Hymns.

I was wondering if any of you could share some audios and/or=
 lyrics of Vedic Hymns such as "sarasvati suktam, ganesha suktam, maha nara=
yana upanishad, maha mantra pushpam, laghunyasah..." Im particullary intere=
sted in lyrics in devanagari so I can verify the pronunciation of every let=
ter.

Thanks in advance,
Ivan
