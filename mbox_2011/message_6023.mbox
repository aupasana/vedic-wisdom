Namaste,

I have a idea which will eliminate soot completely.

1. Take a al=
uminium round lamp shade (ones which are used in high celling bulb in indus=
trial areas)

2. Attach a simple dust pipe (vaccum clear have this pipe)

3=
. Attach inline exhaust fan (this i think costs atleast 75$, let me know if=
 anyone finds it cheaper online)(they are used in ventilation systems)

4. =
Some "inline exhaust fan" comes with filter also , other wise you can give =
a joint in the dust pipe and put a small air filter sheet.

5. simple hang =
the aluminium shade on top of havan kund when you are doing havan and it wi=
ll suck the soot completely, you can change the filter when it gets dirty.
=

6. Since all these accessories are round, any body can simply buy and fix =
it end to end.

i will check out the details for these accessories in home =
depot/lowes/online/other stores and let you know the exact details and size=
s


regards
akshaya
