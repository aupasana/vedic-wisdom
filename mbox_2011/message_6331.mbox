      Namast=
e,



Now there is fire ritual manual for those who are not that grounded i=
n 

Hinduism and Hindu philosophy, but are open to trying the fire ritual. =


It is a simplified procedure. It includes offerings to Vedic deities 

su=
ch as Prajapati, Indra, Soma etc, but explains it in a way that 

open-mind=
ed non-Hindus can rationalize and relate internally. It allows 

non-Hindus=
 to incorporate their faith and sacred chants of their faith 

into a fire =
ritual procedure that is essentially taken from Hinduism. 

Please go to:

=


http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/fire



Please feel free to send suggestio=
ns and comments to me at 

pvr108@.... This is the first attempt and =
can evolve over time. 

The goal is to enable as many people as possible to=
 approach the divine 

via the sacred medium of fire.



*        *        =

A few months back, Manish sat next to an American lady in a flight. Hi=
s 

intuition told him to tell her a few things. He told her a few things 
=

that would happen in the next few months. He told her she MUST do a fire 
=

ritual regularly to overcome some serious problems in her life. He also 

=
gave her his email address. She told me later that she thought he was 

"in=
sane" to talk to a stranger like that. Later, when some specific 

things h=
appened as told by Manish, some to the day, she developed trust 

in Manish=
 (Manish told me he was just acting on his intuition withought 

knowing wh=
y). She emailed him and later talked to him. Manish 

re-iterated to her th=
at she MUST do fire ritual to overcome current and 

future problems and he=
 put her in touch with me.



I gave her the Mahaganapati homam manual, but=
 it was Greek and Latin to 

her. She is a practicing Christian and does no=
t know much about 

Hinduism. She was totally lost in in the manual and cou=
ld not put it to 

use, though she really wanted to do a fire ritual. I spe=
nt an hour on 

phone with her and explained a simple procedure that she co=
uld relate 

to, remember and do. She did homam a few times and found it to=
 have a 

soothing and calming influence, though she was very nervous, afra=
id and 

tense when she started out. Another friend of her, also a practici=
ng 

Christian with open-mindedness to other practices, was also interested=
 

in trying fire ritual and asked for info. This made me think of writing =


a manual suitable for a group currenly left out.



*        *        *

=


Coincidentally, Manish, I and a few other friends had a discussion a 

mo=
nth back about non-Hindus performing fire ritual. Though some sincere 

and=
 learned friends had reservations, I opined: "If one cannot relate to 

a S=
anskrita mantra and can relate to a Latin or Greek or Arabic chant, I 

see=
 no problem in offering that to god. I do not really think Agni will 

say =
"I do not know that god and cannot carry the offering to that god". 

I do =
not see gods as Hindu gods and non-Hindu gods and see all of them 

as pers=
onifications of various natures and qualities inherent to us. I 

reckon th=
at Agni is capable of translating. Thus, I am not averse to 

enabling non-=
Hindus to do a fire ritual by essentially retaining the 

basic homam struc=
ture, but replacing the main mantra of pradhaana homam 

section with a non=
-Sanskrit sacred chant."



I had copied Sri Robert Svoboda (author of Agho=
ra series on Vimalananda) 

on that discussion. He put his view on record i=
n a private email: "Just 

for the record, my view is very similar to yours=
 =E2=80=93 the important thing 

is to create a relationship with fire, and=
 via the fire, with Brahman, 

Nirguna or Saguna =E2=80=93 Saguna being muc=
h easier. There are many devatas in 

the world, and I too do not really th=
ink Agni will say "I do not know 

that god and cannot carry the offering t=
o that god". I too do not see 

gods as Hindu gods and non-Hindu gods; if A=
gni can be purohit for one, 

he can be purohit for any."



*        *    =

If you know of some people who are not well-versed in Hinduism but=
 are 

open-minded to try new spiritual practices, please feel free to poin=
t 

them to this document.

Narasimha
