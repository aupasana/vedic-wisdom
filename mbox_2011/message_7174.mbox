Happy Vinayaka Chaturthi to all, 

Dear PVRji, 

I have a couple of questio=
ns. 

1. I had been doing daily Ganapathi homam for the last couple of mont=
hs and I feel a lot connected to God this way. For the Ganesha Chaturthi th=
at is day after tomorrow, is it enough if just do the Ganesha Homam with Sh=
odasa upacharas and recite the story later, instead of the traditional "Vin=
ayaka Vratham" or should I also do that in addition to the homam?

2. Is it=
 okay to reuse the left over ghee for the next day homam? Because I am doin=
g daily homam, there is some ghee remaining everyday which I ask my wife to=
 use for the regular consumption with food. But she keeps complaining that =
it smelling like smoke, which I suspect is happening because we take shruk =
and shruvam so close to fire and dip in the ghee again multiple times. So, =
how about re-using the remaining ghee with some fresh ghee mixed together f=
or the next day homam?

Nagraj
