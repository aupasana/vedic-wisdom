Dear learned group members:

Sorry for some wrong spellings. I meant to wri=
te:

How to stop the ego from taking over? I am often unable to feel bad ab=
out mistakes made in the past, or anger when I think that some injustice wa=
s done to me. How do I "surrender" these emotions? If I can surrender them,=
 perhaps I will not feel so bad or hold grudges.

Thanks
Ranga
