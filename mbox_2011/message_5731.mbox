Already Swami Viveakanda has declared
Prophet mohamed has started preaching=
 before realisiation
as a result he has poisoned a big community of people
=
Only bold Hindu in the world Swami Vivekananda has openly spoken
he has sta=
yed at lot of muslims house when hindus did not provide him 
hospitality
pr=
opet himself says he flew on a donkey over six levels and he could not go t=

seventh level and see god

Indeed this is a unique case. My view is that pe=
ople are people. They could be 
good or bad, based on their own conditionin=
g from various lives and samskaras. 
But islam as a religion spreads venom,=
 in general. I have read Quran and able to 
say this some amount of convict=
ion. It is, as someone rightly said, a terror 
manual. Nothing less. As Utp=
al rightly says, he is a vedic muslim, not a real 
muslim.
