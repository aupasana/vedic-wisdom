Still personally I am a=
 staunch believer in the sannyasa path and cannot come in terms to his rece=

Anyway its my personal opinion.
Thought of not mentioning thi=
s on post but something was just poking me from inside.Maybe its my ego i d=
ont know.
I dont want to debate just mentioned my opinion.

Thanks all
