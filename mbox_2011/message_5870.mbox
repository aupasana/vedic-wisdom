Dear Utpal and Dr Bhatla,

Thank you for sharing your "emotional" and "inno=
vative" view of Hindu and 
Hinduism (Santana Dharma)! Yes, my original ques=
tion, based on Swamiji's 
interview, still remains....hopefully it will get=
 answered some day!

Anyway, I did find a couple of good links on this topi=
c and thought I would 
share it with the group...while both of them talk ab=
out Hindu(ism), they both 
look at it from different perspectives....but bo=
th of them are enlightening and 
both websites have plenty of other article=
s/e-books to keep you engaged for a 
while :-)

http://www.esamskriti.com/e=
ssay-chapters/Who-is-a-Hindu-1.aspx

http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics=
/

In fact, the above website has an entire book on "What is Hinduism?" (Ca=
veat 
Lector: I haven't read the book!)

Dear Chandra Prakash,

> So who is a Hindu?

Hindu is=
 the one whose heart is naturally expansive and accommodative.
Hinduism (ac=
tually modern word coined for Vedic culture) has integrated many 
diversifi=
ed schools of thought...be it Dwait, Adwait, Vishishtadwait. Its a 
Sangam =
of Many Rivers. The people of the culture are so accommodative that 
Parasi=
s stayed for centuries keeping their identity and religious faith intact 
w=
ithout facing any conversion threats or any sort of pressure for *conversio=
n*.

Hindu is the one who *never thinks* even once to convert religious fai=
th of the 
people who are believers in other faiths. On the contrary, Hindu=
 encourages the 
people from other faiths to be in their own and love god r=
ather then getting in 
to business of conversion. Hindu does not form organ=
ised missions, use power of 
Money or Sword for conversions.
Hindu does not=
 hesitate, if asked, to go to church and bow to Jesus because he 
believes =
deep within that Jesus is a Saint, a true man of God. If a Muslim 
friend m=
akes a request to a Hindu that This is My Allah in this mosque. Would 
you =
come with me in mosque and bow down to show your respect and love? Then 
Hi=
ndu would certainly do that because Hindu heart naturally believes in the 
=
famous message of Veda - "Ekam Satya Vipra Bahudha vadanti". Although he wo=
uld 
not have read even one line of Veda ever, this timeless message of Ved=
a is 
ingrained in every pore of his/her being!

Hindu does not need any st=
rict Ritualistic initiation to become Hindu. A Hindu 
believes in Sarve Bha=
vantu SukinaH. Hindu is a born Hindu! Hindu is the one who 
hardly feels pr=
essure from society to go to temples or pray God at specific 
schedules. Hi=
ndu has freedom to decide His/her ways to pray God. There is no 
pressure f=
rom Hinduism. Hindu has true liberty and that is why Hindu can say 
that I =
do not believe in God and still leave happily and respectfully in Hindu 
So=
ciety.
Above all Hindu is symbolical of all expansive heart!

Oops! I just =
became emotional and unburden probably a Hindu heart :)

Sorry for not able=
 to answer your actual query and digressed to something else.

Best Regards=
,

Utpal
