Pronunciation of Mant=
ras - Swami Krishnananda
Visitor: Is it a sin if a mantra is mispronounced =
due to ignorance or
physical defect?

Swamiji: Some people become fanatics =
and think only their mantra  works,
and only if pronounced  correctly. A de=
votee in Tamil Nadu used  to
recite Namah Chivaya (instead of  Namah Sivaya=
) with such faith that  he
was able to walk on water while reciting  Nama C=
hivaya. One day a 
grammarian taught the devotee to pronounce the mantra  c=
orrectly as 
Namah Sivaya. But with the correct pronunciation, the devotee =
 could no 
longer walk on water. He fell into the water because he was  
co=
ncentrating on the pronunciation of the mantra and had lost faith in
his Gu=
ru who gave the mantra.


There was a sweeper woman who approached her empl=
oyer,  a proud
Namboodiri Brahmin of Kerala, for a mantra  she could recite=
. He was
angry that she should ask for a mantra, as she  was of  a low cast=
e. But
she persisted. The Namboodiri yelled at her  contemptuously  "Go and=

recite Tapala Curry", meaning frog curry. The  woman took it in 
good fait=
h and went on repeating the phrase with such  devotion that she
became  enl=
ightened. People asked her who her Guru  was, and when she
told them they  =
went and praised his disciple's  saintliness and how
good a Guru he must be=
. But  the Namboodiri had  forgotten all about the
low caste woman. Now he =
remembered  the incident  and felt sorry for
himself; for he was still in s=
amsara while she had become enlightened 
with the 'frog curry' mantra! All =
 these parables emphasise the
importance of the attitude or bhava in mantra=
 japa. The  attitude is
much more important than the mere sound of the word=
.
