Namaste, Nyasa is the act of placing =
the said syllable on that part of your 
body. In the process of doing the n=
yasa, one is converting ones human body to 
become fit to receive the mantr=
a(actually, the Devatha). In addition, one 
receives protection while doing=
 japa.

In each one of these, the hand needs to be placed with the appropri=
ate mudra on 
the place( Hridaya, Shiraha, Shika, Kavacha mudra and the net=
ra followed by the 
astra mudra and the circular movement.

The nyasa needs=
 to be done at least once before the japa/homa etc. The nyasa 
usually come=
s along with rishi nyasa, kara nyasa and other nyasas which would 
depend o=
n the mantra and parampara..

Normally the order is :

1. Samkalpa
2. Rishi=
 etc recital
3. Rishi nyasa( Rishi Chandas Devatha etc)
4. Kara nyasa
5. An=
ga nyasa
etc...

Hope this helps.
