Namaste to the learned people!

Many years ago I received a panchaloha set =
of 9 plantes. It is a 2 inch square, all the planets joined together.

I he=
ard recently that graha's are not to be kept in the altar or at home. 

Is =
this true? I do pray to some of the planets on a daily basis as a part of m=
y morning prayers but not to all planets.

Is it better to remove the 9-pla=
net set from the altar?

Thanks for your help
R
