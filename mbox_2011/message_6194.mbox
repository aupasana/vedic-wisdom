I realize that if the visarga is padaantha but in the middle of a sentence,=
 it has to follow sandhi rules.

So may be the q is about vaakyaanta pronou=
nciation only.  It seems to me that event at vaakyaanta, it should be a hal=
f-sound, otherwise a full 'ha' would be written.

Is this correct?  Any qua=
lifications / exceptions to the above?
