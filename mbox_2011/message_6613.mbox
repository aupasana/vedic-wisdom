Also, I bought a metal homa kund (not copper, probably iron), 6x6 inches in=
 the interior and probably a sq.ft exterior. I am thinking now it is too bi=
g if I want to start daily homams. The small copper ones I have seen at the=
 shop do not have stands and they are like 2x2 inch interior or max of 3x3i=
nches. What is the ideal size for a daily homam kumd? If I cannot use brick=
s, can I just place the copper kund on a wooden plank or newspaper piece ! =

Also, do we need to wash and clean the homa kund, the wooden ladle and the=
 whole prayer area daily ? 

regards
rAma
