Namaste Priya ji,

Shri Atul's message is very wise. I suggest some what si=
milar line of thinking.

It is quite possible that you are living out, in d=
reams, Unpleasant effects of some bad past Karmas. It actually may be bette=
r as its happening in the dream and hopefully not in actual life.

I too ha=
ve had gone through similar situation some time back. What i did was not to=
 discuss with anybody and just forgot those dreams. Fortunately it was quit=
e easy for me to forget those bad dreams i had. Best would be to pray and p=
ut your case in front of Homa Agni and the invoked deity. Dreams ki hi aahu=
ti de do! Bhsma ho jayenge!

Best Regards,

Utpal
