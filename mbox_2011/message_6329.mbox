Namaste, 

Just wanted to share wonderful Narayaneeyam i came across few we=
eks back.

If your isht devata is Vishnu/ Krishna/ Narayan. then it will be=
 a very beautiful practice to read english meaning of 1 chapter (10 shlokas=
/5min) daily of narayaneeyam. This helps me daily to fill my mind with glor=
ies and story of Narayan. I read the english meaning before puja and it foc=
uses my heart and soul. 

It has 100 chapters, each of which is 10shlokas w=
hcih is summary of 1 chapter of Bhagawat puran. if you read 1/2 story daily=
, it will give new material daily for 100/50 days. Atleast my mind gets fil=
led with joy daily to know new story about narayan daily and my daily puja =
gets new motivation.

You can read more on wikipedia or google it.
