Namaste,
 
Not only rajarshi, but I say that it is very difficult to be a r=
ishi also in this age. People now-a-days have an extremely toned down under=
standing of what it means to be a rishi!
 
At World Association of Vedic St=
udies (WAVES) 2010 conference at Port of Spain, where I taught homam as a s=
piritual sadhana, there were atleast 3 people who were called by others or =
by themselves as "rishis". People think rishi just means a brilliant person=
 or a nice person or a spiritual person. To be a rishi requires much much m=
uch more.
 
Rish means to flow smoothly and quickly. Rishi is one who swift=
ly flows with the divine will. Let me elaborate what that means spiritually=
.
 
Most beings with an individualized consciousness (like human beings, de=
mons or even deities) are weighed down by the conditioning and will of indi=
vidual egosense (I-ness) and cannot flow smoothly and quickly with divine w=
ill due to the weight of the conditioning. Just as a very light leaf flows =
in air more freely while a heavier rock falls due to its gravity, similarly=
 one with lighter conditioning flows more freely with divine will, while on=
e with denser conditioning is pulled by the gravity of that conditioning an=
d cannot flow freely with the divine will.
 
The director of a drama may gi=
ve important roles to an actor without ego and strong views, who is in sync=
 with the director and who will simply read one's lines (even very complex =
ones or ones that make no sense initially) without complaining, as opposed =
to someone who has a problem with one's lines and with what others say to/a=
bout him in the drama and keeps complaining and tries to change the script.=
 Similarly, the Supreme Power that runs this universe gives important roles=
 to beings who overcame individual egosense, have no individual agendas and=
 conditioning, completely in sync with the Supreme Power and flow with divi=
ne will.
 
One pulled by the gravity of dense conditioning can get some thi=
ngs done. In comparison, one pulled by the gravity of *light* conditioning =
can get *big* things done in this universe. One with *extremely light* cond=
itioning is almost free and can get *really huge* things done in this unive=
rse. One with *zero* (or almost zero) conditioning can get *anything* (or a=
lmost anything) done in this universe.
 
Various categories of rishis are i=
n that last zone of zero or near-zero conditioning! They have overcome thei=
r conditioning completely and have no desires, no agendas, no likes and no =
dislikes. They may behave like they have desires, agendas, dislikes, anger =
etc, but that is just like a drama actor reading out the lines as asked by =
the director. As one's conditioning drops off, individual I-ness and indivi=
dual will wither away and one is in communion with the divine always. One h=
as no will and no desires and one flows with the divine and can do ANY acti=
on willed by the divine. One becomes an instrument to implement divine will=
 in the world. Such a being is infinitely powerful and can really do anythi=
ng. Nature uses such beings for very very important work. Rishi means such =
a free-flowing and non-resistant entity.
 
Even yogis who have directly exp=
erienced oneness with the divine at times can be deluded by the polarities =
of the field of duality from time to time ("GYaaninaamapi chetaaMsi devI bh=
agavatI hi saa balaadaakR^iShya mohaaya mahaamaayaa prayachchhati" - Saptas=
hati). As long as one remains in an individual body (physical or ethereal),=
 *some* conditioning will normally remain. Removing the conditioning comple=
tely and being in oneness with the Supreme at all times, is a herculean tas=
k and perhaps not possible in today's times. Just as only one who has climb=
ed the first 7,000 miles of a mountain knows how difficult it is to climb t=
he next 100 miles, similarly a sadhaka who overcame a lot of one's conditio=
ning alone will know how difficult it is to overcome the last bit of condit=
ioning.
 
Rishi is a very serious and sacred word describing really evolved=
 beings. It is almost impossible for one to become a rishi in this age. Eve=
n those saints in the last century or two whom their followers called rishi=
s are most probably not rishis. Even if amsha of a rishi comes down to eart=
h in these times, such an amsha may do some great deeds without reaching th=
e level of a rishi again and then merge back (like a thread spawned from a =
main process in a computer program).
 
It is good to take rishis as our rol=
e models and follow them, but let us understand what a rishi means and why =
they are kept on such a high pedestal in tradition. There is no need to low=
er that pedestal to allow more people to get onto it.
 
Best regards,
Naras=
imha

 a Rajarshis. Today we find rajayogis in every street, who fear tapasyaa, h=
