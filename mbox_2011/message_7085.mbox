Namaste,

You are a catalyst of change, that is all. The catalyst itself do=
es not
change but the environment around it changes. When "I" give a correc=
t
prediction, it is not "I" but God speaking through this medium. That is a=
ll.

Swami Ramakrishna used to say that Brahman is the real Guru.

best reg=
ards
"I"
Hari where the "I" comes last.
