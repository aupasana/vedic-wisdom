Dolly Ji

I am equally an neophyte in the field and I am sure you will rece=
ive inputs from the other experienced Sadhakas in the group.

Just want to =
share my inputs on two questions below


"(6)what is the "Exact Procedure" =
and mantras for the praan pratishtha of
mahamrityunjay yantra or shiva idol=
? what are the dos and donts of it?"

I truly do not beleive there are many=
 who can do prana pratistha to an idol in these times.Those who can do so o=
nly acquire the ability after intense sadhana for many years and might be h=
ard to locate. All other procedures are just in name and placebo's.

Rather=
 than worry about Prana Prathisthapana of the Idol...I would suggest comple=
te surrender and forming an personal relationship with the Idol.By  which I=
 mean if you are able to visualize the idol or the particular form of god d=
own to the minutest details when you meditate it might help you immensely i=
n transforming your mind.

(7) are the yantras available in the market good=
 enough or should one make one's
own yantra? if yes, then please guide with=
 regard to shree, gayatri and
mahamrityunjay yantras?


The best yantra one=
 can make is transforming one's own body. This piece of mechanism is simply=
 amazing and was created with extreme care by the creator. Simply sitting a=
t one place and meditating with one particular mantra everyday at the same =
time as Narasimha Ji has mentioned will help one immensely.

Again it is ju=
st my personal opinion, none of the stuff advertised on TV works.

If you a=
re seriously interested ,there is an temple in Andhra Pradesh ( Devipuram )=
 who build limited Sri Meru's ( 3D form of Sri Chakra) using precise instru=
ments in limited quantities. They are also energized by an living master Am=
ritananda Natha .They only charge a nominal fee , do not advertise much and=
 do not scare people with million rules. There are a few rules of cleanline=
ss and if possible chanting one's favourite mantra. They do not claim this =
Yantra will bestow material prosperity, it is only for spiritual upliftment=
.

If interested please go through this link.

 http://www.devipuram.com/in=
dex.php?option=3Dcom_content&view=3Darticle&id=3D78&Itemid=3D164

If you ar=
e apprehensive and want to experiment..there is a nice powerpoint on the sa=
me site with explanation to draw an 2D Sri chakra everyday.I beleive that p=
ractise also purifies one immensely.

I apologize beforehand if my views of=
fend any of the group members.

Vemparla Ram Kishore
