To all the renowed scholars here, 
=A0
=A0
I am really trying to understan=
d sabarmalaya's tragic incident ever since it had happened. Infact, every y=
ear such accidents are happening in sabarimalaya. May i know the rationale =
behing such accidents? Why is not lord Ayyappa stopping such mishaps?
=A0
I=
s there any reason behing his blind and mute speculation?
=A0
With all resp=
ects to Ayyappa...
=A0
Thanks
