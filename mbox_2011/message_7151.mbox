Namaste

Also Vimalananda mentions this in the Aghora series as well that w=
hen people want to withdraw their karmic bank balance ,they end up in the U=
sa which is an bhoga bhoomi. 

India on the other hand is the testing land =
where people undergo hardships to finish their share of karma and sadhanas =
done their frucitfy soon .The reason being the land has been graced with th=
e vibrations of so many elevated beings both in the south and the north.

G=
ravity has an huge impact on the human body and also on the conscrecation p=
rocess of temples in Tantra shastra. All the ailments in the body occur whe=
n one is not comfortable in one's posture or is effectively working against=
 gravity. It is the love of mother earth that hugs its children to its boso=
m. The same love manifests as the tendency to accumulate things or possesiv=
eness and the clinging to life ( fear of death) in the first chakra .

All =
sadhanas have to pass through with the permission of Ganapati who lords the=
 first chakra and hence the effect of gravity on one's sadhana.

 that India (and some parts of SE Asia) is the "Karma Bhoomi", and America =
is considered a "Bhoga Bhoomi", and as such even nithya karmas like Oupaasa=
nam performed in the USA are not valid.  Since Oupaasanam is the basis for =
many of the sroutha and smatth karmas, those karmas, inlcuding Deva yajnas =
and pitru yajnas, are not valid outside of India.  Is this true?
