The Difference Between Devotion and Emotion

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Achar=
ya

"The central message of the Bhagavad Gita, the most important scripture=
 in all of Sanatana Dharma, is that bhakti, or devotion to the Absolute, co=
nstitutes the most effective and highly recommended path in all of the Yoga=
 tradition. It is truly unfortunate, however, that despite the almost unive=
rsally held importance of bhakti in the history of Yoga, there seems to hav=
e always been a good deal of misunderstanding on the part of many about wha=
t the terms 'bhakti' and 'Bhakti Yoga' actually mean. I've read even many s=
upposedly knowledgeable authors mistakenly write that bhakti is to be seen =
as the 'Yoga of emotion', or that it somehow precludes any involvement with=
 jnana (knowledge, or intellectualism), philosophy, or serious Yogic sadhan=
a (practice). In actuality, nothing could be further from the truth...."
