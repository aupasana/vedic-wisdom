Dear all, 

I did 3 homam yest with vishnu sahastranaam and have few doubts=
.

1. I give 108 aahuties with Vishnu sahatranaam, in my daily puja i used =
to read narayan kavachh so how do i add in my homam - should i give ahuti a=
fter each line or simply read as a prayer and give a final aahuti.

2. Whil=
e giving aahuties i mainly give til ahutii, but for fire management issue 
=
can i offer ghee/coconut pieces as ahuti in between or simply just like tha=
t with swaha

3. After poorahuti and one drop of ghee to fire, can we add m=
ore ghee later if there is smoke.

regards
Akshaya
