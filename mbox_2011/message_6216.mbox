 512 Bhagavan Vasishta has said: =E2=80=98If one separates the body [from o=
neself]
and remains at rest in one=E2=80=99s own Self, which is consciousne=
ss, then one=E2=80=99s
ego-sense perishes.=E2=80=99 That is, he attains the=
 egoless state.

What happens when the quest is thus persisted in long enou=
gh?

513 The mind, seeking the Self, gets captured by some mysterious inner=
 power
and dives into the Heart. There the mind, being consumed by the
cons=
ciousness-light of the Self, ceases to exist, along with the ego.

What is =
this power?

514 That power is indeed the grace of God, who is the real Sel=
f in the
Heart. It is of the nature of right awareness. By yielding up ones=
elf to it,
the aspirant becomes blessed.

515 In that great burning state, =
the sky of pure consciousness, the
ever-real and auspicious real Self dance=
s in the form of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. In the
fire of t=
his right awareness, which is the sole reality, the universe, along
with th=
e ego, is destroyed.

This fire consumes the whole of creation with its roo=
t, the ego, leaving not
even ashes. The real Self is said to be dancing, to=
 indicate the bliss of
that state.

So, there is no dance in the literal se=
nse.

516 However, since that same sky of consciousness is his real nature,=
 how
can he, being formless, dance there? This metaphor shows that his form=
 is
bliss, and that the dance is motionless.

517 In that state there is no=
 maya, no avidya [ignorance], no space, no
time, and no individual called t=
he soul. There, only the real Self, having
the form of pure consciousness, =
exists, and nothing else.

This state of aloneness is called kaivalya.

May=
a and avidya are mutually dependent. Neither can exist without the other.
S=
o both are lost in this conflagration. This has been definitely stated in
o=
ne of the hymns to Sri Arunachala by Bhagavan.

518 In that transcendental =
state the power of God, named maya, whose
expanded form is the whole world,=
 is wholly lost in that motionless supreme
one, along with the whole of her=
 creation.

For him that dwells eternally in that supreme state, there is n=
either maya
nor avidya, nor the world.

519 Therefore, in that supreme stat=
e of peace there shines, unhindered, the
true form of the real Self. The on=
e that survives in that state, abiding as
his own real Self, is designated =
by the sages as the free one.

Bondage being due to the false identificatio=
n of the body as the Self, it is
lost when the ego-sense is lost. There is =
no more any false identification.

The mind is lost. But at the same time t=
he pair of pleasure and pain is also
lost. This is illustrated as follows:
=

520 Just as a woman, suffering intolerably in her father-in-law=E2=80=99s =
house,
obtains peace in her mother=E2=80=99s house, so the mind, harried by=
 samsaric
suffering, wins peace by returning to its source, the real Self.
=

What about the unfree souls in the world? Does the free one see them, and =
is
he anxious for them?

521 As a man awakening from a dream no longer sees=
 any of the dream persons,
so the one who has awakened from the sleep of ig=
norance, and who is
therefore alone as the sole reality, does not see anyon=
e as other than his
own real Self.

In all persons alike, the real Self is =
unaffected. Ignorance and bondage are
not for him, but for the mind or the =
ego, the imaginary individual soul, who
never had any real existence.

522 =
How can that state, the natural state of peace, become knowable by the
inte=
llect =E2=80=93 that state of him who dwells engrossed in the bliss of that=

Self, having no knowledge of others as different from himself?

Just as th=
at state is unthinkable by the intellect, so too is the one who
has won tha=
t state and dwells eternally there.

523 How can any man understand, by the=
 unaided power of his own intellect,
one who is mind-free, bodiless and wor=
ldless?

The one who is established in that state of deliverance is called =
a sage, or
=E2=80=98Prabuddha=E2=80=99 or Buddha. He cannot be known becaus=
e he has none of the
attributes of an individual.

He is one with the etern=
al subject, the supreme reality, and so cannot be
made an object for anyone=
 to know.

524 Because that one has no particular marks or features, the mi=
nd cannot
think of it, nor words describe it. The words of the Vedanta teac=
h its real
nature only by negating everything as =E2=80=98not That=E2=80=99=
.

The Vedantas never try to give a positive description. Even those senten=
ces
that seem to give such a description are interpreted as distinguishing =
it
from things that can be visualised or thought of.

That unthinkable one =
is for that reason infinite, unlimited.

525 Whatever is describable in wor=
ds or thinkable by the mind is, for that
reason alone, finite. Because the =
real Self is beyond the reach of the mind
and the intellect, those who are =
established in the Self call it =E2=80=98the
infinite=E2=80=99.

Only the i=
nfinite is blissful, not the finite, says the Chandogya Upanishad.

526 Wha=
tever is said concerning the supreme reality by the sages or by
Vedanta has=
 for its purpose only the removal of the mistaken notions of the
disciple.
=
No positive statements can be made. The ultimate teaching is by silence.

5=
27 Just as Sita indicated Rama by negating all the other princes, so the
Ve=
dantas indicate the truth of the Self by negating all else [that could be
m=
istakenly believed to be the Self].

528 Since the Self, shining alone as t=
he sole existing reality, can neither
be known nor taught, the teachings of=
 the Guru do nothing for the aspirant
except free him of his ignorance.

Ig=
norance causes him to identify something as the Self, which is not That.

S=
ince the Self shines by its own consciousness-light, there is no need to do=

anything more. In the egoless state, the real Self cannot be mistaken,
bec=
ause there it survives alone.

The darkness (ignorance) that conceals the S=
elf is just the visible and
tangible world seen by the outward-going mind, =
as is shown next.

529 Since the Self, consciousness itself, is concealed b=
y the darkness,
which consists of worldly knowledge, the teachings of the G=
uru bless the
aspirant by removing that ignorant knowledge.

530 To create =
an empty space in a room one only has to remove the
encumbering, unwanted l=
umber. In the same way, to realise the Self nothing
more is needed than the=
 removal of false knowledge.

Nothing more need be done when the false noti=
on of a serpent is removed. The
real rope reveals itself. So too, when the =
veiling, false knowledge is
removed, the Self shines by its own light of co=
nsciousness.

Another simile, given by Bhagavan, is given here.

531 How ca=
n the Self be something to be obtained? From the point of view of
truth, it=
 was never lost.The gaining of the Self that is spoken of is only
the death=
 of the ego, the appearance of which makes the Self as good as
lost.

It is=
 also said by Bhagavan that the truth is rightly taught only by
silence. Th=
is is explained next.

532 Speech is fourfold, as transcendent, seeing, med=
ium and articulate
speech.That transcendent speech is only silence. And tha=
t silence is itself
the true nature of the supreme reality.

533 The articu=
late form of speech was born of the medium speech; its mother
is the seeing=
 speech; that its mother is the transcendent speech, is well
known. That sa=
me supreme speech is silence, the form of the supreme
consciousness.

So, t=
he grossest form of speech, being the great-grand daughter of the
silence, =
cannot reach the real Self.

Again, how does speech arise? There is abstrac=
t knowledge, whence arises the
ego, which in turn gives rise to thought, an=
d thought to the spoken word. So
the word is the great grandson of the orig=
inal source. If the word can
produce effect, judge for yourself how much mo=
re powerful must be the
preaching through silence!

534 True speech is only=
 the silence of the sage, who is the eternal dweller
in the transcendental =
state. How can gross speech, born of the belief in
differences, speak of th=
e supreme one, in which differences are lost?

535 Therefore the most ancie=
nt Guru [Dakshinamurti] taught the truth of the
Self by silence. And by ach=
ieving silence of speech and mind, those ancient
disciples became aware of =
that truth.

Here the reference is to the incarnation of God as Dakshinamur=
ti, the God of
right awareness, dwelling in that state of awareness. The di=
sciples, Sanaka,
Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanatkumara attained the supreme s=
tate by being
silent, just like their Guru.

536 Well-qualified disciples b=
ecame themselves sages through the silent
teaching of their Guru. Teaching =
by words does not work in imparting true
knowledge of the real Self.

The g=
reatness of the Guru=E2=80=99s silence is next indicated.
