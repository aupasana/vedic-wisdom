Namaste:

Thank you for all the valuable suggestions. I completely agree wi=
th PVRji
to take it slowly. For my first fasting, I just did one day water =
fasting
and suffered a mild fever and a severe headache the next day. I did=
 some
research and then realized that fasting makes body to flush the toxin=
s and
it enters the blood stream. So its better to eat fruits/vegetables du=
ring
fasting. From health point of view following document is a great resou=
rce
on how to fast.
