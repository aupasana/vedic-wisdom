Translation - Pitru devataas who have been consumed by fire, may come
her=
e and sit on the seats,eat the oblations presented on the sacred
grass(dhar=
bha), and then bestow upon us wealth accompanied entirely by
strong sons.##=

Interpretation -  we see here one more form of pitru devataas -
agniShvaat=
taaH, technically agnisvaattah means who have been consumed by
agni (agnina=
a aasvaaditaa)          agni=3Dfire, svattaa=3Dfrom root svaad
meaning "to =
taste", (remembering aasvaad of hindi)            there is
also a classific=
ation on pitru devataas as follows -          Satapatha
Brahmana classifies=
 them as the below S.Br - 2.6.1.4 to 2.6.1.7
    *               somavantaH=
 - to whom puroDaasha (rice cake) is
offered
    *        barhisadaH - to w=
hom grains(barley) are offered
    *               agniShvaattaaH - to whom=
 beverage is offered -
beverage prepared by parched grains(barley) in milk
=
          Manu (3.198) gives another classification which is dependent
upon=
 type/caste and rishi of pitru devataas
    *        saadhyaa-s (saadhyaas =
are celestial beings occuring in
classifications higher than devas some tim=
es, they could also mean
siddhas), pitru devataas originated from this clas=
s of beings are known
as somasad and are presided by viraj rishi.
    *    =
    deva-s =3D pitru devataas originated from devas are termed
agnisvaattaa=
, and are blessed by maarichi rishi
    *        daitya/daanava/yaksha/gand=
harva-s =3D are termed barhishad's
and are blessed by atri
    *        vip=
ra/brahmins =3D are termed somapa and are blessed by kavi
rishi
    *      =
  kshatriya =3D are termed havirbhuj and are blessed by  angiras
rishi
    =
*        vaisya =3D are termed aajyapa and are blessed by pulastya
rishi
  =
  *        suudra =3D are termed sukaalin and are blessed by vaShiShTha
ris=
hi

          We cannot verify/apply any logic on the above classification =
of
Manu hence no point in debating on castes and classification of pitru
de=
vataas by Manu but would like to say that agniShvaattaaH are a type of
pitr=
u devataas belonging to higher realms.   We are invoking various
types of p=
itru devataas like somyaasaH , havishpaaH, haviradaH , 
gharmasadaH,  somav=
antaH, barhisadaH, agniShvaattaaH, somasad, somapaaH,
aajyapa, sukaalin etc=
... and are offering seats and requesting them to
be seated by saying "sada=
H sadaH sadata".
   Pitru devataas are also being addressed as su-praNiitay=
a[the good
guiders], guiders for the sacrificial rites and to guide us on t=
he path
of dharma.    Pitru devataas are offered to eat[atta] the
oblations=
[haviiMShi] which are presented[prayataani] to them on the
sacrificial gras=
s[dharbha] layer named barhi, prayataani can mean
oblations presented or ob=
lations placed according to all the rules as
scriptures specify.  In return=
 we ask pitru devataas to give
us[dadhaatana] wealth[rayiM] and strong sons=
[sarva-viiraM], again we
need to concord this with earlier riks to get the =
inner meaning, rik
10.015.04 we have asked for "grant peace and tranquility=
 that is sinless
upon us [naH shaM yoH arapaH dadhaata]", rik 10.015.07 we =
have asked for
"grant wealth on the worshipping man[rayim dhatta daashuShe =
martyaaya]"
and in the second part of 10.015.07 we have asked for the grant=
 of the
wealth which is a share of pitru devataas pitaraH tasya vasvaH. ple=
ase
note that pitru devataas have no materialistic property to share with u=
s
instead we have been asking all the way along for dhaarmika rayiM,
wealth=
 of dharma, wealth of auspicious properies (see Rig Vedic hymn on
Pitru dev=
atas - 7). apart from spiritual wealth pitru devataas are
requested for pro=
jeny who are all strong, free from disease etc... this
is in connection to =
uurjam for projeny (rik 10.015.07) and the rik
10.015.03 for projeny[avatsi=
 napaatam], projeny and spiritual wealth to
continue the sacrifices.
   Dis=
covered today that we can find this rik and some more riks of
10.015 in Tai=
ttiriya Samhita(Krishna Yajur Veda) 2.6.12.
