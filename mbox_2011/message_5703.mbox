 The insentient engine of a railway train cannot move without a qualified
d=
river. Even so this insentient body-engine cannot move without an
intellige=
nt driver, who is God or Ishvar.From the existence of the body you
can infe=
r the existence of the hidden driver of the body-engine.

There is display =
of intelligence in every inch of creation. Who pumps blood
into the arterie=
s? Who converts food into chyle and red-coloured blood? Who
effects the per=
istalsis in the bowels and stomach and controls the process
of assimilation=
 and elimination. Who shuts the eye lids to prevent dust from
falling into =
the delicate eyes? Who gave intelligence to the cells and
glands to secrete=
 milk, bile, saliva, gastric juice, etc., from the blood?
Who gave intellig=
ence and power to the spermatozoa to move, unite with the
ovum in the womb =
and develop into a foetus? Wherefrom does this minutest,
subtlest substance=
, Jiva, as minute as the tiniest grain of sand, derive the
capacity to assu=
me gradually the features, complexion and shape of its
parents? What is the=
 power which sustains it and helps its growth in the
mother=E2=80=99s womb?=
 Who arranges for milk in the mother=E2=80=99s breast before the child
is b=
orn ?

How wonderful is the human machine? How harmoniously all the organs =
work in
unison in
the economy of nature? In Gita this body is known as nava=
dvara-puri or
nine-gate city. In summer the skin works energetically to thr=
ow off all
impurities of the blood and to relieve the kidneys which had ove=
r-worked in
winter. The endocrine, pituitary, pineal, adrenal glands work i=
n perfect
harmony in manufacturing the internal secretions, and the hormone=
s to help
the metabolic process of the body, growth and structure.

It is a=
 great marvel to see the working of the nervous system under the
control of=
 brain and the movement of the impulses through the spinal cord.
There is a=
 magnificent, electric battery inside with switchboard and wires.
The opera=
tor is Antaryamin (inner ruler, or God) who controls and supervises
everyth=
ing. He is Upadrashta (supervisor), Anumanta (permitter) and Maheswar
(the =
great Lord). Look at the heart and lungs which work under the direct
contro=
l of the brain. How wonderful are these three vital organs the tripods
of l=
ife? Can an eminent scientist manufacture any of these organs, tissues,
fib=
res, tendons or cells in his laboratory with his intellects?

How harmoniou=
sly the different systems such as the digestive system,
circulatory system,=
nervous system, integumentary system, work without any
rest! How beautifull=
y the different centres in the brain such as the
vision-centre, authority-c=
entre, centre of smell, etc., do their functions.
One is struck with awe an=
d wonder when he begins to think seriously of the
structure and working of =
this delicate human machinery.

To think that this most wonderful mechanism=
 is the result and product of a
fortuitous
combination of matter or atoms i=
s simply absurd and ridiculous indeed! It
has been, doubtless,moulded and f=
ashioned by some architect, who is
infinitely more skilful, intelligent and=
 powerful than the ordinary
architects who build palaces and bungalows. Tha=
t architect is God or Ishvar
or Creator. Call him by any name. It does not =
matter much.
