One can chant various prayers and mantras to Bhairava. Kaala Bhairavaashtak=
am composed by Aadi Shankara at Kashi is particularly beautiful. A few mant=
ras are contained in the Kaala Bhairava Homam manual (see homam site below)=

e best way to worship a deity, however, is to imbibe the qualities represen=
ted by that deity. All the 14 worlds and their inhabitants, including deiti=
es, live in one's body in microcosmic form (and, microcosm is identical to =
the macrocosm). Each deity is a personification of some qualities inside us=
. Different qualities endow us with different kinds of shakti (capability t=
o get certain things done). If we increase certain qualities and build cert=
ain shakti, we are effectively making the corresponding deity manifest in u=
s. THAT is the best way to worship any deity!

 to one naturally. One should not do something (or keep from doing somethin=
