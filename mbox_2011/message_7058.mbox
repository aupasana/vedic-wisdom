Hello - I am looking to buy a copper havan kund at bangalore and do not see=
m to get the size of my choice. In fact, the priests I talk to tell me homa=
m is done in loha kund, showing some gate or barricade to the temple, etc. =
While I am not sure who is right, I decided to buy a copper havan kund and =
will be glad to know if there are any online sites that can sell havan kund=
 of as big size as I expect to buy as the present loha kund I use is big in=
 size.

Typically what is the size to buy if one has to do a big homam ? Al=
so, when I see the specifications on the sites, I guess they mention the ou=
ter square, and I am looking at at least 6 inches X 6 inches bottom, that m=
ay mean 10 x 10 probably ! 

regards
rAma
