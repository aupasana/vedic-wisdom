All great ones had their teachers. All the sages, saints, prophets, world- =
teachers, incarnations, great men, have had their own Gurus, however great =
they might have been. Svetaketu learnt the nature of Truth from Uddalaka, M=
aitreyi from Yajnavalkya, Bhrigu from Varuna, Narada from Sanatkumara, Nach=
iketas from Yama, Indra from Prajapati; and several others humbly went to w=
ise ones, observed strict Brahmacharya, practised rigorous discipline, and =
learnt Brahma-vidya (the science of God) from them.

Lord Krishna sat at th=
e feet of His Guru Sandeepani. Lord Rama had Guru Vasishtha who gave Him Up=
adesha (spiritual advice). Lord Jesus sought John to be baptised by him on =
the banks of the river Jordan. Even Devas (celestial beings) have Brihaspat=
i as their Guru. Even the greatest among the divine beings sat at the feet =
of Guru Dakshinamurti.

A neophyte must have a personal Guru first. He cann=
ot have God as Guru to begin with. He must have a pure mind. He must have e=
thical perfection. He, must be intensely virtuous. He must be above body-co=
nsciousness. Then alone can he have God as Guru.
