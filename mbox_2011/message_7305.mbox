Dear Rama,

> If by the same logic, any one can do tarpanam to anyone, I have no issues


Great, because this is true. The last tarpana that is offered is some
variant of "aa-brahma-stamba-paryantam jagat tRpyatu". i.e. May the whole
world be pleased. There are plenty of quotes from standard dharma shastras
which support this. In fact, this is the standard
"super-duper-short-tarpana" method !

We are born into this world with debts ... including pitR Rna which strongly
influences us. You should share your wealth with everyone, but it does make
sense to start off repaying the debts that you owe. Most of us are
spiritually bankrupt and these debt vAsanAs strongly bind us to this world.


> that is when we look for other learned's inputs or shastra's inputs.


There are too many inputs which say contradictory things. We have to to make
some limited use of our intellect as long as we are in this world of
duality. Understanding shastra is not easy. At some point, intellect gives
way to anubhava, but until then, we have no other choice.


> On the root of the tree example, I was going with this


The example is fine, but it is important to realize that, like all examples,
it has limits. Krishna is karma-phala-dAtA, and we have to experience what
we, through previous actions, have begged him to let us experience. When we
are ready to wholeheartedly accept Krishna with unflinching bhakti, we are
made. The reality is that we don't possess such bhakti, and we are
strongly influenced by those around us ... particularly those whom we have
RnAnubandha with ... like our forefathers. You can change a lot of things,
but changing your DNA is hard. Thus, for the 99.99% of us with less than
perfect bhakti, rituals like pitR karma are useful.

When you do pitR karma, if you choose to identify strongly with the pitRs,
you will go to pitR loka. Similarly with other beings like yakshas,
gandharvas etc. But, the point of tarpana is exactly the opposite. Rather
than identifying with the pitRs, we are trying to detach ourselves from them
and their influences. This will do nothing but help us to cultivate true
bhakti and reach our final goal sooner.

It is important to understand the intent of the ritual and perform it
accordingly.

sasneham,

   ajit
