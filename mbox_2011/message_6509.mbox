Narasimha Garu,

Most people are "Informed"=
 and thus know these truths. The Major or rather THE MOST important thing i=
s to know about "Raama->baana" (sure shot remedies) for these Ashta Pasha o=
r Shadripu.

All these obstacles can be very subtle and many a times an asp=
irant would not even notice their existence in his/her mind and when he/she=
 will notice that, it is even a bigger task to get rid of them.
***
When on=
e does good to other(s), THE MOST difficult thing is to be free from "THE e=
xpectations" of "FAME or RESPECT or BOTH". that the other(s) would at least=
 talk good about the person and respect him/her. To remove such expectation=
s also from one's mind is HIMALAYAN TASK. Hindi proverb which says "Neki ka=
r or Dariya me Daal" is though very simple but very very very true and very=
 very very difficult to achieve.

The above example is not disconnected one=
. It actually is the fitting example of subtle pride. The lurking Tiger.
 
=
So coming back to my point, i would again say that what requires is the "Ra=
ama Baana". And we or at least I have put my full faith (i do not know if m=
y full faith is full enough) in Homam/Havan and i hope, deeply deeply hope =
that HOMAM/HAVAN is the Raam-baana of current age.


Yours sincerely,

Utpa=
