Subject: More questions on daily Homam
X-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=137531079; y=ILY-dRrhw2hFtGM9i4NHg6RWLpN7pMiRvdioaNGa4P3tUbuyHJ4QsnGQ5zU-

For many years now I have been offering daily prayers immediately after sho=
wer. 

Is homam to be performed before or after the daily prayer?

I do the=
 homam right in the living room. After the homam, is it alright to remove t=
he homa kundam, the offerings and darbha around it, the lamp etc? 

May one=
 yoga perform homam in the evening (around sunset), instead of doing it in =
the morning?

I found that in addition to dry coconut pieces, dried coconut=
 powder (which is more widely available in all supermarkets) also helps kee=
p the fire going.

TIA
