Sri Narasimha Garu,
=A0
I was remembering that the manifested world is beli=
eved to be sourced from energy and particularly the sound energy. A thought=
 crossed my mind..not sure how correct it is..as there are multitudes of so=
unds and may be each of our forms are based on such different sounds..hence=
 will it be possible somehow for us to identify such sound form ( amantra o=
r a beeja etc) and meditate on that to be united back with the nature? Any =
comments!!
=A0
Thanks
KK
