Now i know the logic of adding Om in any Mantra. yo=
u dispelled some darkness and some more is required.

Now knowing Shri Gaur=
av's observation which is mentioned below, I have one question:

>without O=
m I get some sensations on top of the head as if something >is pushing it a=
nd that feeling even remains after finishing the >?>meditation. But the sam=
e doesn't happen with om added to it.

Is it possible that adition of Om ca=
n delay the realisation of Mantra?

Best Regards,

Utpal
PS: Thank you Gaur=
av Ji to bring up theses queries

 Om is the nirguna beeja. It represents ParaBrahma. Other beejas like those=
 in navarna mantra are saguna beejas and they represent combinations of spe=
cific qualities. Adding Om at the beginning of a mantra is like thinking of=
 ParaBrahma and then thinking of a specific deity or form in relation to Pa=
raBrahma. In tradition, Om is invariably added at the beginning of every ma=
ntra, if it is not already there.

 Thinking of ParaBrahma will keep the notion that "all is Brahman", which i=
s the corner stone of Self-knowledge, as a part of one's sadhana.
