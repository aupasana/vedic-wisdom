Namaste all gurujanas

Since childhood i am wandering to have answer=
s to my question, they seems to be foolish to scholars like you but as lay =
man I am carrying it with me.
=A0
Our society is discriminated in to variou=
s cast, does our veda support this cast system?
=A0If we consider that dosh=
as/papam=A0is associated=A0if we make such =A0discrimination then why it is=
 not taken in to account.
=A0
Since thousand's of years=A0 people are treat=
ed badly=A0even animals=A0were treated well. Today also more or less situat=
ion is same and it is worst in rural india.
=A0
We know that there is no bi=
ological difference between high cast person & low cast person then why the=
re is so much hate present.
=A0
Also if a person born in low cast is that m=
ean he will receive less grace of GOD & a pesron who belongs to high cast h=
as abundance of it.=A0
