To chain themselves with the bondage of samsara is not the birthright of th=
e mothers and sisters of the world. To get stuck up in family, children and=
 relatives is not the ideal of courageous and discriminative women. Every m=
other of the world should realize her responsibility to awaken herself and =
her children, her family, her husband, to the true light and splendor of sp=
iritual life. What a glorious mother was Madalasa! Did she ask her children=
 to study up to the post-graduate examination and then seek for some employ=
ment? Suddhosi Buddhosi, Niranjanosi, Samsara-Maya-Parivarjitosi=E2=80"=E2=
=80=9CYou are pure, you are consciousness, you are taintless, you are devoi=
d of the maya of samsara.=E2=80=9D Such was the advaitic instruction which =
Madalasa gave to her children when she rocked them in the cradle. How many =
mothers of the present-day world have got the fortune to teach their childr=
en such a profound knowledge? On the other hand, the present day mothers wo=
uld try to crush the spiritual tendency of their children even if it is fou=
nd in them in a microscopic state! What a sad and pitiable condition of the=
se ignorant mothers! Wake up, O mothers, sisters! Wake up from your deep sl=
eep! Recognize your responsibility! Spiritualize yourselves! Spiritualize y=
our children! Spiritualize even your husbands, for you are the makers of th=
e family! Remember how Chudala illumined her husband. You are the makers of=
 the nations! You are the builders of the world! Therefore spiritualize you=
rselves! Assert in yourselves the spirit of Sulabha, Maitreyi, Gargi, Gauri=
-Puri-Devi! Do not be cowardly! Come out of your fleshy homes, the homes of=
 delusion, the homes of vanity!
