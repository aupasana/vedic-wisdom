Hari Om Shri Narasimha ji and others,

I finally did my first homam in the =
fire pit I purified and painted to match the 3 gunas. It was fine but I wil=
l need practice to keep the fire going as the wind made it go out twice and=
 I didn't bring all the materials I had planned to, so I didn't have extra =
camphor. However it was a great experience and I felt very energized after =
and got a lot of work done which I had been putting off.
I included parts o=
f the manual for before and after and used the way I have seen in our commu=
nity while growing up.
I didn't do a panchopachar puja as I did a more gene=
ral havan with mantras to many devtas as the main part. I know for the spec=
ialized homam, different deity mantras may not be recommended due to their =
different energies but I am hoping to do a general version on most Sundays =
now.

However, for Narasimha Chaturdashi I would like to know how we should=
 do prana pratishta and anganyas, karanyas, etc? I know the beej mantra is =
kshraum but I am not sure if we can use that in all of anganyas and karanya=
s ?
We should observe this vrat on Sunday in the West, correct? and would t=
he best time for homam be in the twilight when Lord Narasingha appeared?
