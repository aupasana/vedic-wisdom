Dear All,

It is a good idea. I have also wanted to teach homam but thought=
 it is
better to wait for the 'adesha' from God, if at all as Swami Ramakri=
shna
used to advise.

best regards
Hari

Hi Vijay,<br>
<br>
Good thought,Though the Manuals,Video and Audio t=
utorials by PVR are more than enough for the seekers to learn homam. Someti=
mes,a physical presence in guiding/teaching would help.<br>
<br>
One more a=
