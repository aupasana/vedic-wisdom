Respected PVR garu,

I do Ganpati,surya and vishnu homam with lord Vishnu b=
eing mine main diety daily. Based on this kindly guide me with the followin=
g questions. 

1) After pranaprathishta of Lord Surya do I need to chant th=
e following:

=E4v=E4hito bhava........sannidhi=E0 kuru| as after invoking =
Lord ganapati we don't say the above verses hence the confusion.

2) Also w=
e chant "om gam ganapataye namah svahaa" 4 times. At the end of chanting th=
e manual does not mention "om gam ganapataye namah vaushat". so again the c=
onfusion should I put vaushat after chanting AH three times at the end. 


=
2)While invoking Surya deva do I need to do Parivaara Devata Aahutis (offer=
ings to associates).

3) While reading aditya Hrudayam should I put swahaa =
after Ithi Aditya Hrudyam mantrasya. 

4) My mother has a tamil book where =
aditya hrudyam has 34 verses. I have one with 31 only. How many verses does=
 AH consist of?

I humbly request your help once again.

Thanks and regards=
,
Priya
