Hi Amit,

Would love to see Shri Narasimha's response on this, but l=

=C2=A0
Lord Shiva may appear contradictory, bu=

Respected Narasimha=
ji & Members,
=C2=A0To clarify in the beginning with deep respect to all : =
I have no intention of fuelling the current discussion on Bhagwaan Shiva.
M=
y request is to invite your views and others about the apparent contradicti=
ons in the portrayal of Bhagwaan Shiva :
=C2=A0
For example - he is conside=
red Smashhanwasi=C2=A0 or Kailaaspati (desolate and uninviting places) yet =
is the shelter of one of the most beautiful celestial object visible from e=
arth=C2=A0(Moon) and one of the most purifying waterbody for Hindus (Bhaagi=
rathi-Gangaa).
Without elaborating such contradictions -jsut wish to state =
that he is=C2=A0'Ajanmaa' yet=C2=A0a symbol of fertility and parallelly pic=
tured as the most ascetic of ascetics=C2=A0!!! He is also worshipped as 
Na=
traaj- the patron of Performing arts and is also an object of worship for s=
eekers of Sciences.
I refer here the book : Tao of Physics by renowned part=
icle physicist Fritjof Kapra.
=C2=A0
My request to learned members is to el=
aborate on the mixing of Dravidian and Aryan Symbolism in Bhagwaan Shiva's =
portrayal in traditional mindset.
I have read long time back that when Arya=
n's came to Bhaarat(India) they had altered this chracterization of Bhagwaa=
n Shiva to erase the Dravid culture and worship practices but could not suc=
ceed completely in changing the Snake worship and Shiva Puja traditions.
Wh=
at I had read years back may also be a biased version-hence this request.
=
=C2=A0
Apologies for any transgressions in writing this lines -as this may =
be result of my own ignorance and I bow to all seekers.

Namaskkaram,=

Namaste,

>>=C2=A0 Maa lakshmi a=
nd lord Vishnu are considered as rajasik deity. Lord 
>> Brahma and maa Sar=
asvati are considered as Sattavik.

Vishnu is pure sattwa. Creator Brahma O=
TOH is not saattwik as you say, 
but raajasik. Creation or any expansive pr=
ocess is raajasik, whereas 
sustaining an equilibrium in a stable manner is=
 sattwa. Vishnu's 1000 
names includes "sattwavaan" and "saattwikaH".

Sapt=
ashati rahasya also describes how the original energy of the cosmos 
(Aadya=
a Mahalakshmi) divided herself into 3 portions - Mahalakshmi, 
Mahasaraswat=
i and MahaKali with sattwa, rajas and tamas.

>> As Brahma is considered as=
 aim of sattvik methodologies

Brahman or Aatman or Self considered the ult=
imate aim is Nirguna, i.e. 
beyond gunas. That's different from Creator Bra=
hma.

>> These ten mahavidiyas along with their consorts such as Shiva, 
>>=
 Bhairava, Mahakala
>> are considered as the chief deity in various left ha=
nded literature.

Not all mahavidyas are worshipped in the left handed way.=
 For example, 
Kamala (MahaLakshmi), Lalita Tripurasundari and Bhuvaneswari=
 ARE 
worshipped using right handed tantra. Even Kali has forms (e.g. 
Bhad=
rakali) worshipped using right-handed tantra, though there exist 
forms wor=
shipped using left-handed tantra.

*=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=
=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *

Finally, one should realize that deities are made of v=
ery light/thin 
conditioning, compared to us. The tamas in a human being is=
 far 
different from that as it applies to a deity. Ruthlessly killing a 
p=
erson is different from ruthlessly killing a weakness such as lust or 
ange=
r. Even if borth require the same guna, the nature of the guna is 
differen=
t in both.

This is what I mentioned as the 3x3 matrix of gunas mentioned b=
y 
Vasishtha in Yoga Vaasishtham to describe the difference between various=
 
deities, human beings and demons!

Anybody who thinks that Kaali or Taara=
a or Chhinnamastaa or Shiva or 
Durga or Rudra are taamasik like "demons" i=
s in terrible 
misunderstanding.

Best regards,
Narasimha

<DIV> To clarify in the beginning wit=

<DIV>My request is to invite your views and ot=

</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>For example - he is considered Smashhanwasi&n=

one of the most beautiful celestial object visible from earth (Moon) a=
nd one of the most purifying waterbody for Hindus (Bhaagirathi-Gangaa).</DI=

<DIV>Without elaborating such contradictions -jsut wish to state that he=
 is 'Ajanmaa' yet a symbol of fertility and parallelly pictured a=
s the most ascetic of ascetics !!! He is also worshipped as </DIV>
<DI=
V>Natraaj- the patron of Performing arts and is also an object of worship f=
or seekers of Sciences.</DIV>
<DIV>I refer here the book : Tao of Physics b=
y renowned particle physicist Fritjof Kapra.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>M=
y request to learned members is to elaborate on the mixing of Dravidian and=
 Aryan Symbolism in Bhagwaan Shiva's portrayal in traditional mindset.</DIV=
>
<DIV>I have read long time back that when Aryan's came to Bhaarat(India) =
they had altered this chracterization of Bhagwaan Shiva to erase the Dravid=
 culture and worship practices but could not succeed completely in changing=
 the Snake worship and Shiva Puja traditions.</DIV>
<DIV>What I had read ye=
