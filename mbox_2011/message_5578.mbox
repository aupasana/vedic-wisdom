Namaste Sir,
=

In the old days also, there was varna system but it was different. People =
belonged to different varnas based on their aptitude and served different p=
urposes in society. It wasn't a rigid system, but a flexible and mobile sys=
tem based on aptitude rather than birth. Of course, because a child may get=
 exposed to what father does and may have a good chance of developing aptit=
ude for such work, one would by default get father's varna at birth. But, a=
s one grows up and one's vasanas (conditioning from past lives) develop, on=
e may develop a different aptitude and may end up with a varna different fr=
om father's.

For example, Vishwamitra was born as a kshatriya, but became =
a braahmana and became a brahmarshi later. Valmiki was born as a shoodra an=
d lived by hunting birds. He became a braahmana and became a maharshi later=
.

No matter where one is born and how one was brought up, anyone who is in=
terested in knowledge and liberation and not interested in money or power o=
ver others, IS a braahmana. Even if one is born in an orthodox brahmin fami=
ly, if one is deeply interested in money or power and authority over others=
, one is NOT a braahmana. In any case, one varna is not superior and anothe=
r varna is not inferior. People of different varnas serve different purpose=
s. It is as simple as that. What we see today - bias, mistrust, fights and =
killings in the name of caste - are an unfortunate consequence of deepening=
 Kali.

What I am saying is not accepted in mainstream society today becaus=
e we are deeply into Kali yuga. But, when the Mother decides, social notion=
s can change quickly. In fact, we are going through a phase of huge global =
transformation. Political, economoic, social and religious structures of th=
e world will be redefined during the coming decades and will remain valid f=
or many centuries. 

BTW, when the divine Mother appeared before my guru in=
 March 2006 and gave a command to spread a simple homam ritual in the world=
 for the coming times, her clear directive was to not differentiate based o=
n caste, creed, class and race. We encourage anybody who desires to worship=
 any god in fire for spiritual progress to perform homam on a regular basis=
 using the homam manuals at the homam website (see below).

> Also if a per=
son born in low cast is that mean he will receive less grace of
> GOD & a p=
esron who belongs to high cast has abundance of it. 

Rather than caste, en=
vironment in which one grows up does have a role (and caste does sometimes =
influence the family environment in India). One born in a family (brahmana =
or otherwise) that worships god everyday is exposed to that notion. One bro=
ught up in a family that cares a little about god or morality and pursues m=
oney or power or comforts ruthlessly is exposed that notion. So the religio=
us/spiritual aspects of the environment in which one grows up do play a rol=
e. However, if one has strong vasanas, they will eventually take hold. One =
will meet people who make those vasanas flourish and those vasanas take con=
trol.

Best regards,
Narasimha
