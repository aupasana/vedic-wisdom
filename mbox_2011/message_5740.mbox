Sama Darshana: The Nature of True Equality in Sanatana Dharma

By Sri Dharm=
a Pravartaka Acharya


"We are all different from one another. Thus, we are=
 all in so many ways unequal in our appearance, our abilities, our preferen=
ces, and our desires.

Rather than attempting to lie to ourselves and artif=
icially fly in the face of clearly discernible empirical facts, Sanatana Dh=
arma encourages all human beings to respect each other, honor our differenc=
es, and work together in compassion, dignity and harmony, despite our unden=
iable recognition of all our many differences. Sanatana Dharma (the Eternal=
 Natural Way), thus gives us the empowerment to live in accordance with the=
 natural order of the universe in a manner that is beneficial to all.

For =
Dharma, the realm of true equality lies not on the physical, mental, intell=
ectual, or egoic planes, but in the realm of spirit. Having God as our sole=
 source, sustainer, and ultimate destiny, we all share in the same spiritua=
l parent. From a spiritual perspective, then, in the deepest essence of who=
 we are as pure spiritual beings (atman), we are all equally the children o=
f God...."
