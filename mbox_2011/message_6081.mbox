Hello all,

>From the same link mentioned by dinesh in previous post, one ex=
cellent reminder by Narasimha

--------------------------
Irresepctive of t=
he exact procedure you used, the keys to success are (a) the strength of be=
lief that Parasara is there in fire and 
(b) respect and surrender for him.=
 

Use whatever procedure maximizes those aspects in you.
-----------------=

regards
Akshaya
