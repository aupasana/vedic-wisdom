Namaste..

Ganapati - it's from pati (as in lord, e.g. patidev etc.) - so i=
t is certainly the soft ta.. (first letter in second ta varg).

There are 3=
 sa-s.  One is soft(sa), the second is medium, last is hard (sh).  In Andhr=
a Pradesh, we are taught to pronounce each distinctly differently, which I =
think is the correct way - otherwise, why would there be three different le=
tters?.  S(?)ree should have the medium sound, i.e. not as soft as sa, not =
as hard as sh, but in between. If you try carefully, you can get it.

In th=
e North, I often hear the hard one used for the medium, which probably need=
s to be corrected.

just my 2 cents..

Rao

not put the vowel endings, esp. when the words end with "a". And South Indi=

the listener to know for sure whether you said "yaat" or "yaak" or "yaan". =
It is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The "t" a=

tough to hear clearly.

Probably, some big teacher started pronouncing "yaat" as "yaatu" so that "t=
" gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his stude=
nts would not get confused when learning. Probably the students thought the=
 mantra was "yaatu" (instead of "yaat") and got used to that mis-pronunciat=
ion. Probably, that became a standard practice after a couple of centuries.=

There can be words that end in "n" or "k" etc also. There also, people norm=
ally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhan=
das and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.
