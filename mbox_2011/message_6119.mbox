Namaste

Vimalananda talks about Intoxicants in detail in both book 1 and b=
ook 2 but warns very clearly this is not something that one without an phys=
ical guru should ever try. Alocohol is triple cursed ( Curses from Brihaspa=
ti, Shukracharya and Lord Krishna ) and so do rest of the intoxicants carry=
 powerful curses.

In the battle between the intoxicant and you only one ca=
n win. If it wins it will start to consume you and if you can win ...please=
 note the word if , you can harness the power of the intoxicant to break th=
rough some of the logical shackles of the brain.

Recently some studies wer=
e by neurologists and they have found controlled application of intoxicants=
 like marijuana to help alzheimer's patients ( search in nytimes ) and othe=
r people with broken neurological systems.

Anywaz long story short.Please =
steer widely clear of intoxicants. It is simply not worth the risk . 

:) I=
t is just like Shava sadhana,undoubtedly a very powerful technique but with=
out the right guidance of the guru one will scare himself to death when the=
 spirits play mischeif with the corpse and one will die of sheer nervous br=
eakdown and since the  moment of leaving the body is of sheer importance ..=
.one will end up as an spirit rather than having achieved the great fruit o=
f the sadhana.

It would be much better to stick to the path of surrender t=
o the deity and doing daily homa.
