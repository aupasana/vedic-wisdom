Hi, 
=C2=A0
Knowing the philosphy of Shri PVR Narasimha Rao, I guess that h=
is response would be as follows: 
=C2=A0
If you are doing a real homa in th=
e right sense, planetary positions should not matter, as long as your inten=
tion is only for spiritual evolvement and not any material benefits. If tha=
t is not the case, anything is possible depending on the background and the=
 baggage thus follows. 
=C2=A0

Dear Narasimha,

Is there any relati=
onship between performing homam and panchangam? Specifically, are there any=
 days that should be avoided?

Recently I came across this information:

-Q=
uote:

"It is advisable to do Homam(Havan) when the fire is on earth and in=
 the Homahuti when Guru, Shukra or Budha receives aahuti. 

Many astrologer=
s requested to include homahuti into panchangam. This is based on the dista=
nce between the sun's nakshatra and the moon's nakshatra. It is auspicious =
to do shanti karma/ shraut karma when the fire location is on earth and the=
 ahuti goes to Budha -- showers intelligence., =C2=A0Venus --> all material=
 wishes fulfilled, worldly wealth property. Jupiter -> fulfillment of desir=
es. moon->crops will be inundated, Sun->destruction of auspicious effects, =
Mars->fear of fire, Saturn->destruction of wealth, Rahu/ketu-> loss of ever=
y kind, famine, health troubles. 

However, please remember for performing =
devi yaaga different chakra is used. "

-Unquote

***

All these are beyond=
 the comprehension of someone illiterate in astrology and the effects of pl=
anets. What strikes as a "warning" though is the statement that during cert=
ain planetary positions there could be adverse results if performing homam.=


If one is performing a Ganapati or Chandi homam (at a beginner level) wit=
h the sankalpa of simply attaining spiritual development and liberation in =
mind, would this "warning" be of any relevance?

Thank you.

Warmest regard=
s..
