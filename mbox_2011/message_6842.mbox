 Chaitanya,

There are quite a few options these days. Here are few to cons=
ider :

+ Distance Learning and Classroom courses: Samskrita
Bharati<http:/=
/www.samskritabharatiusa.org/index.php> has
both options. Interested people=
 can measure progress by taking their exams.

+ Self-study: http://www.arsh=
avidya.org/Introduction-Sanskrit.html (
beginners) ;
++ http://acharya.iitm=
.ac.in/sanskrit/lessons.php ( More resources at this
site
http://sanskritdo=
cuments.org/learning_tools/learning_tools.html#SECTION0000200
 )

+ Interac=
tive Courses: Sri Satish Karandikar from Arsha Vidya
Gurukulam<http://avg-s=
anskrit.org/about/> conducts
webinar classes on Wednesday and Thursday ( ad=
vanced level)

Thanks to service of all the people involved in creating con=
tent for above
resources.

-Kishore
