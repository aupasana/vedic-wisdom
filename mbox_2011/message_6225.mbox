Hello Jitender,

I think sleep is a process happening more in body than in =
mind while meditation is a process happening more in mind than in body

And=
 i believe that both of these can occur together also. If you find that you=
r mind is more 'inline' then you most probably had a good spell of meditati=
on with or without sleep. 

Please forgive my mistakes

regards
