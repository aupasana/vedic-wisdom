Hello Biswajit...

I understand that 'sarpaghandha vati' is very useful for=
 redirecting the heat that develops in the head from excess desire. This of=
 course would aid in mental concentration in addition to reducing blood pre=
ssure. If you are in india these are easily available. Try it and experienc=
e the wisdom of ayurveda. 

Warm regards

Ajaya
