Respected (Viswanath) Sir
Thank you very much for your reply. But I want t=
o tell you that I hate God because one part of my brain always tells me fro=
m behind to go to a certain temple on accomplishing some task.And then I co=
unter that thought saying that I will not go to temple even if my work gets=
 done. This way whole of my energy is exhausted in getting these obsessive =
thoughts and countering them. I hate god because he forces me to do so.I wa=
s a very religious girl even since by childhood.
But now I cant see him.
Th=
anks
