Namaste All, 
=A0
Your help in understanding this verse is greatly apprecia=
ted. 
=A0
ajo pi sann avyayatma bhtanam isvaro pi san
prakrtim svam adhisth=
aya sambhavamy atma-mayaya
=A0
Translation: Although being birthless, imper=
ishable and immmutable, The Lord of all living entities; being so situated =
I appear in this world in my original transcedental "FORM" by my internal p=
otency
=A0
This verse is very confusing to me because my understanding is a=
s follows:
a) It is due to the sound, the form and name are created and tha=
t's why it is said that world is with names and forms
=A0
How to reconcile =
this verse with vedas and upanishadic scriptures that talk about nirakara b=
rahman? Why is bhagavan talking about form here? 
=A0
=A0
Thanks & Regards,=
