Namaste Chandra Prakash,

Thank you!

How true:
[
Yoga and bhog. It is not=
 in the physical body; it is not in the place
where you are staying; nor in=
 the clothes you are wearing. It is in the
mental attitude. Coated, booted,=
 suited with beedi in hand, you can
still be a yogi. A man who has got jata=
dhari - which is only vibhuti all
over and nothing but a lengot - can be th=
e greatest of bhogis. Isn't it?
It's not the physical appearance; it's the =
mental attitude.
]

Warm Regards,

Utpal
