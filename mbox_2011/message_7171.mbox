Cont....

Hiramalini ji,
I forgot to mention.After I do the daily tarp=
anam, I offer it's merit[i.e the benefit/fruit of doing tarpanam] to Lord N=
arayana as He is the "Pitru Adipadhi" in the form of Surya Deva [I understa=
nd it to mean that Narayana is "in-charge" of the pitru loka].....When I st=
arted doing daily tarpanam in March 2011, spiritually-speaking, I was a beg=
inner [still am]....So, I would offer it's merit to Lord Narayana and in th=
e end would say [still do] "Om Tat Sat Brahmaarpanamastu i.e I offer it all=
 to BRAHMAN"......It's been in the last few weeks that I've understood the =
"true meaning" and for-the-lack-of-a-better-word, the 'spiritual strength' =
of saying "Om Tat Sat Brahmaarpanamastu".....

All actions, no matter how s=
mall it maybe or even if not done per 100% vedic standards,still get 100% o=
f the result if it is all offered to BRAHMAN. 

You may wonder, if I offer =
all the merits of doing daily tharpanam to BRAHMAN, what merit do "I" have =
left?? The answer to this question,my dear, is best left to experience it y=
ourself. Why? Because words can't describe it......

Atleast, this has been=
 my insight & experience. Maybe Narasimhaji can better explain it.

Om Tat =
Sat Brahmaarpanamastu
