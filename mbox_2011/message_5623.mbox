 There are two states of mind:

(1) Illumination and (2) Consideration.

Th=
e first of them is association of the mind with external objects and the
se=
cond is deliberation(Careful consideration) on the object seen.

Illuminati=
on is unqualified by the limitations of objects: deliberation is
qualified =
by the limitations pertaining to the objects seen, and it is the
forerunner=
 of
their clear definition.

[Note: The mind first notes a thing in its ext=
ended vision. The impression
is received only after noting the thing in its=
 non-extensive nature, and
becomes deeper
on musing over the first impressi=
on.]

There is no distinction noted in the preliminary stage of simple
illu=
mination. The thing itself is not yet defined, so illumination is said
to b=
e unqualified.

The thing becomes defined later on and is said to be such a=
nd such, and so
and so. That is the perception of the thing after deliberat=
ion.

Deliberation is again of two kinds: the one is the actual experience =
and is
said to be fresh, whereas the other is cogitation over the former an=
d is
called memory.The mind always functions in these two ways.

Dreamless =
slumber is characterised by the illumination of sleep alone, and
the experi=
ence continues unbroken for a time, whereas the wakeful state is
characteri=
sed by deliberation repeatedly broken up by thoughts and therefore
it is sa=
id not to be ignorance.

Sleep is a state of nescience, though it consists =
of illumination alone, yet
it is said to be ignorance for the same reason a=
s a light though luminous is
said to be
insentient.

[Note: Pure intelligen=
ce is made up of luminosity,but is not insentient like
a flame. It is gleam=
ing with consciousness, thus differing from the flame.
For intellect
is evi=
dence as thinking principle. Therefore it is called Absolute
Consciousness,=
 active principle, vibratory movement, all-embracing Self, or
God. Because =
of these
potentialities it creates the universe.

Sri Sankara has said in S=
oundarya Lahari: Siva owes his prowess to Sakti; He
cannot even stir in Her=
 absence.Siva should not therefore be considered to
be a mere inexpressible=
 entity depending for His movements upon Maya (like a
man on his car).

Sri=
 Sankara continues: Siva is yoked by Thee, Oh Sakti, to His true being.
The=
refore
a blessed few worship Thee as the endless series of waves of bliss, =
as the
underlying basis of all that is, as the Supreme Force, maintaining t=
he
universe, and as the Consort of Transcendence.Thus the identity of Siva =
and
Sakti with each other or with Transcendence is evident.

Their true sig=
nificance lies in the fact that the universe exists, but not
separately fro=
m the primal Reality =E2=80=94 God.Wisdom lies in realising everything
as S=
iva and not in treating it as void.

The truth is that there is one Reality=
 which is consciousness in the
abstract and also transcendental, irradiatin=
g the whole universe in all its
diversity from its own being, by virtue of =
its self-sufficiency, which we
call Maya or Sakti or Energy. Ignorance lies=
 in the feeling of
differentiation of the creatures from the Creator. The i=
ndividuals are only
details in the same Reality.

In sleep, the insentient =
phase of stupor overpowers the sentient phase of
deliberation. But the fact=
or of illumination is ever present and that alone
cannot become apparent to=
 men, in the absence of deliberation.
Therefore,sleep is said to be the sta=
te of ignorance, as distinguished from
wakefulness which is conceded to be =
knowledge.]

This conclusion is admitted by the wise also. Sleep is the fir=
st born from
Transcendence (vide Ch. XIV, sloka 59),and also called the unm=
anifest, the
exterior, or the great void.

The state prevailing in sleep is=
 the feeling =E2=80=98There is naught=E2=80=99. This also
prevails in wakef=
ulness,although things are visible. But this ignorance is
shattered by the =
repeated upspringing of thoughts. The wise say that the
mind is submerged i=
n sleep because it is illumining the unmanifest
condition. The submersion o=
f mind is not, however, peculiar to sleep for it
happens also at the instan=
t of cognition of things.

All these three states, namely, samadhi, sleep a=
nd the instant of cognition
of objects, are characterised by absence of per=
turbation.

Their difference lies in the later recapitulation of the respec=
tive states
which illumine different perceptions.

Absolute Reality is mani=
fest in samadhi; a void or unmanifest condition
distinguishes sleep and div=
ersity is the characteristic of cognition in
wakefulness.

The illuminant i=
s however the same all through and is always unblemished.
Therefore it is s=
aid to be Abstract Intelligence.

Samadhi and sleep are obvious because the=
ir experience remains unbroken for
some appreciable period and can be recap=
itulated after waking up.

That of cognition remains unrecognised because o=
f its fleeting nature. But
samadhi and sleep cannot be recognised when they=
 are only fleeting.

The wakeful state is iridescent with fleeting samadhi =
and sleep. Men when
they are awake can detect fleeting sleep because they a=
re already conversant
with its nature.

But fleeting samadhi goes undetecte=
d because people are not so conversant
with it. O Brahmin! Fleeting samadhi=
 is indeed being experienced by all,
even in their busy moments; but it pas=
ses unnoticed by them, for want of
acquaintance with it.Every instant free =
from thoughts and musings in the
wakeful state is the condition of samadhi.=


Samadhi is simply absence of thoughts. Such a state prevails in sleep and=
 at
odd moments of wakefulness.

Yet, it is not called samadhi proper, beca=
use all the proclivities of the
mind are still there latent, ready to manif=
est the next instant.

The infinitesimal moment of seeing an object is not =
tainted by deliberation
on its qualities and is exactly like samadhi.

The =
unmanifest state, the first-born of abstract Intelligence revealing
=E2=80=
=98There is not anything=E2=80=99, is the state of abstraction full of ligh=
t; it is,
however, called sleep because it is the insentient phase of consc=
iousness.
Nothing is revealed because there is nothing to be revealed. Slee=
p is
therefore the manifestation of the insentient state.

But in samadhi, =
Brahman, the Supreme Consciousness,is continuously glowing.
She is the engu=
lfer of time and space, the destroyer of void, and the pure
being (Jehovah =
=E2=80=93 I am). How can She be the ignorance of sleep?

Therefore sleep is=
 not the end-all and the be-all.Thus did Janaka teach
Ashtavakra.
