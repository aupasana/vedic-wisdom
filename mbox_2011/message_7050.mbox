Namaste,

Some thoughts on Siddhas.

<<It is not like "you get so & so sidd=
hi when you reach so & so level".>>
=C2=A0
Before we go further, let us def=
ine what is=C2=A0"siddhi" and what is a=C2=A0"siddha". 
Siddhi means accomp=
lishment. That is why we used terms like mantra-siddhi 
(realizing a mantra=
), or some other apparently miraculous/supernatural 
ability.=C2=A0And the =
word siddha is=C2=A0often used=C2=A0to describe someone who has some such 
=
ability.
=C2=A0
This definition of a Siddha is incorrect. It is a corruptio=
n which has entered 
our thought-process over centuries, just like every ot=
her spiritual person who 
uses an epithet Rishi is not really a Rishi.
=C2=
=A0
So who is a Siddha really? One who has acquired some miraculous ability=
? Nope. 
Technically a Siddha is one who has taken his awareness (Kundalini=
) to the 
Sahashrar Chakra, thus experiencing Nirvikalpa, and THEN bringing=
 the awareness 
back to the lower chakras. In this process, he often acquir=
es *degrees of 
mastery* over the five elements of the chakras. That is a t=
rue Siddha.=C2=A0Aghora 
part 2 very clearly defines, (same is also hinted =
at in some other books too), 
this in much details. There is absolutely no =
scope of ambiguity here, unless one 
refuses to accept the book as valid (f=
ine by me).=C2=A0Like it says, what is the 
difference between a gyani and =
a vigyani? A gyani experiences the state of 
Nirvikalpa and realizes "All i=
s Brahman". But it is one thing to realize "all is 
brahman", it is another=
 thing to acquire some of the shaktis of Brahman. 

=C2=A0
For example, con=
sider a glass of water and an ocean. Both of them have the same 
chemical c=
ompostion (H2O). Realizing this is realizing "all is Brahman". But an 
ocea=
n can sustain and create a Tsunami, a glass of water cannot, even if it 
wa=
nts to. Of course it=C2=A0may often never have a desire to do so in the fir=
st 
place!=C2=A0However that is the difference, technically, between a gyan=
i and a 
vi-gyani. And the whole process of a Siddha and higher starts ONLY=
=C2=A0AFTER someone 
is able to bring the Kundalini back from Sahashra chak=
ra to the lower chakras 
again. Needless to say, for most of us ordinary pe=
ople, even getting a Kundalini 
to awaken is a big deal, taking it to Shaha=
shrar is already too hi fi and may 
take lifetimes, bringing is back is imp=
ossible/unthinkable totally.
=C2=A0
What happens when a person becomes a Si=
ddha by the parameter described above? It 
is impossible to imagine. He/she=
 operates from a plane of reference so different 
that ordinary folks just =
cannot fathom. Infact, most of us can't even fathom 
what samadhi feels lik=
e until experienced, what to speak of siddha-hood.

=C2=A0
A Trilanga Swami did tri-khanda yogas, c=

siddhi (miraculous ability=
) or a sadhana? To us average folks, anything out of 
the ordinary seems mi=
raculous. The internet itself would appear 
supernatural/miraculous a few c=
enturies ago! 

=C2=A0
Therefore, one who reaches a state of Siddha-hood, w=
ill automatically produce 
external effects which appear miraculous to ordi=
nary people. Not like he/she 
is=C2=A0specifically trying for it, but it is=

=C2=A0 
Namaste,
=C2=A0
An interesting point =
came up in a private exchange with a couple of folks and I 
will write it d=
own for the benefit of others.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
It is not like =
"you get so & so siddhi when you reach so & so level".
=C2=A0
Siddhis come =
because one DESIRED them in this or a PREVIOUS life. When one has 
made eno=
ugh progress, Nature grants one's desires (or the ability to fulfil a 
grou=
p of desires) and sees if that tempts one and one stops or one can progress=
 
further.
=C2=A0
So what siddhis one gets or does not get, is a function o=
f (1) one's spiritual 
progress now AND (2) all of one's desires until now =
(in this life AND previous 
lives). At the same level of progress, two peop=
le may fare differently in terms 
of what they get, based on what kind of w=
ishes they entertained in the past.
=C2=A0
So siddhis cannot be used to mea=
sure one's progress. You cannot use reverse of 
f(x, y) to gauge x, without=
 knowing y.

=C2=A0 
What I said is not a "blanket statement", but an exp=
licit teaching of Vasishtha 
to Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is also absolu=
tely consistent with Upanishadic 
learning. 

=C2=A0 
You talk about taking=
 the words of a great instead of speculating. In fact, did 
Vimalananda *ex=
plicitly* write that Ramakrishna is only a "Paramahamsa" and not 
a siddha =
or a natha or a rishi, that Vivekananda is not a rishi or natha or 
siddha =
or paramahamsa, and so on? In my case, my statement above is explicitly 
an=
d unambiguously stated by Vasishtha. By answering Vivekananda's question "w=
ill 
siddhis help me in god realization" in the negative, Ramakrishna also =
affirmed 
this teaching of Vasishtha. Krishna also essentially refers to th=
e same thing in 
Bhagavad Gita when he talks about seeking small things fro=
m demigods vs seeking 
"me" (Self). Vaishtha's words, however, are the clea=
rest and most unambiguous. 

=C2=A0 
Yoga Vaasishtham was taught by Vasisht=
ha to Lord Rama in the presence of 
Vishwamitra and other great sages and r=
ecorded by Valmiki. It is the highest 
watermark of spiritual knowledge. 

=
=C2=A0 
Aghora series is nice, but can give wrong notions to some who may t=
end to be 
fascinated by external miracles. I have no doubt that Vimalanand=
a had no 
confusions himself, but some people reading those books can form =
misconceptions 
(though it is still ok if that makes them do sadhana. The o=
nly problem is if 
they start doing the bad karma of making negative judgme=
nts on greats thinking 
they are blindly following Vimalananda). It is a go=
od idea to balance the 
perspective with some Vedantic understanding such a=
s Yoga Vasishtham or Bhagavad 
Gita.

=C2=
=A0 
Yes, some external siddhis are possible only at a very rarefied level =
of 
realization. But some with the same or higher level of realization may =
not 
possess the same external siddhi. Thus external miracles cannot be use=
d as 
measures of one's level. 

=C2=A0 
This is like the analogy I gave of=
 collecting fruits from the trees on the side 
of the road to the hilltop. =
Some keep tavelling on the road and accept only 
those fruits that land in =
their lap by themselves. Some get distracted from the 
journey and pursue t=
he fruits actively. Collecting fruits is neither necessary 
nor sufficient =
for reaching the top. Though having a fruit that is available 
only at a ve=
ry high altitude shows that one has reached great altitude, it 
cannot be u=
sed as a measure of one's progress, for someone may have climbed 
greater h=
eights without collecting that (or any) fruit. 

=C2=A0 
External and inter=
nal do NOT have a one-to-one correspondence. Just as you 
cannot tell what =
is inside a house by looking at it from outside, so cannot you 
tell one's =
state of mind from looking at one. One's spiritual maturity and 
attainment=
 is in one's state of mind.

=C2=A0 
When you said a while ba=

himself, I agreed. Th=

spiritual figure". =
The issue is passing off what I see as needless, unjustified

judgments, driven by misconceptions and a fascination for the

Dear Narasimha,

Hopefully, this will be my last mai=

=C2=A0

=C2=A0 
No. Hence I tend to =

the spiritual=

baseless. =


=C2=A0 
The example you mentioned of Sri Ramakrishna's description of the=
 egg breaking 
and the bird flying back to the mother, before hitting the g=
round is brilliant. 
I too was thinking of the exact same example. Good you=
 mentioned. And as I see 
it, this is similar to the analysis I was mention=
ing about "amsas" - projections 
of Higher Divine beings. Fits the bill per=
fectly! Yes that is why they were 
Nitya Siddhas. 

=C2=A0 
I see Siddhis i=
n other beings as a thermometer. It can be used to make some 
assessments. =
You too mentioned the same in one of your mails. I respect all 
self-realiz=
ed beings, but based on mental tendencies I am drawn more towards 
some tha=
n others. Just like any other person, including you. 

=C2=A0 
<<You, on th=

you i=

=C2=A0 
I cannot, have not=
 and will not comment on Ramakrishna. He was, as per his words 
an Avatar t=
oo. 

=C2=A0 
Otherwise, as per Vimalananada's, the hirerchy is well define=
d. But what is also 
important is to remember great beings send their amsa =
for specific works, which 
is far more important. So one not needing to ach=
ieve a certain state, may not do 
so. 

=C2=A0 
To get a better understandi=
ng, why don't we get some inputs from someone who 
maybe more spiritually q=
ualified to pass a judgement on these things, whether a 
Paramahamsa is sam=
e as a Siddha or a Nath or a Muni or a Rishi instead of 
speculation? Your =
word vs my word will not settle this. 

=C2=A0 
<< 
And you believe that yo=
u are a good yogi>> 
=C2=A0 
You assume much. Mind reading, Sir, is not eve=
ryone's forte -:). I mentioned in 
the mail I used words of spiritual peopl=

does not want to understand will definitely never grasp a nuance! =
Conditionings 
of knowledge/percieved understanding of a situation etc infl=

process. Mark the word *our*. 

=C2=A0 
If a loved and=
 revered spiritual figure is percieved to be questioned, naturally 
a react=

=C2=A0 
<<Siddhis are not a measure =
of one's spiritual progress and neither necessary 
nor sufficient for liber=

=C2=A0 
They maybe, or they may-not be. Such blanket statements =
are incorrect and gloss 
over nuances and create a totally wrong picture. I=

which you yourself made in an earlier mail.=
 The external is connected to the 
internal. Some siddhis are not possible =
unless one attains a very rarified level 
of realization. And they manifest=
 externally. 

=C2=A0 
Just in case someone got the impression that I do no=

or his brother disciples, it is totally wrong. =
I respect and revere them highly. 
And Swami Vivekananda was a unique perso=

his greatness. 

=C2=A0 
However, I=

Fatness is external and judgable. Internal things (e.g. A is happier than=
 B) 
cannot be judged the same way. Same with spiritual attainment 
(siddhi=

And you believe that you are a good yogi who has mastered the subtle d=

Your whole premise is based on mixing up term=

factors to judge one's spiritual=
 caliber. 

=C2=A0 
My two main messages: 
=C2=A0 
(1) One need not pursue =
siddhis. Siddhis are not a measure of one's spiritual 
progress and neither=
 necessary nor sufficient for liberation. 

(2) It is unwise to pass judgme=
nts on yogis like Vivekananda. Ramakrishna never 
tolerated anyone speaking=
 anything slightly critical of Vivekananda as he 
regarded Vivekananda as N=
arayana himself. Why not give him the benefit of doubt 
and direct your cri=
tical faculty and discrimination at somebody/something else? 
Not because i=
t is offensive, but because you cannot be sure!

Simple! Ramakrishna says Vivekananda was a part of a Rishi who came=
 down. An 
amsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but sufficient part of the Ris=
hi's 
consciousness that comes down for a secific purpose and once the purp=
ose is 
served, goes back to the source. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. T=
herefore, 
very technically, Swami Vivekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi, a p=
rojection of a 
Rishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Siddhas, Na=
ths, Munis etc are 
projection Rishis one way or the other. Each is kept is=
 ingorance of their real 
being (Rishi) such that the play can go on (not m=
y words, Vimalananda's words). 
They are Nitya-siddha because even if they =
take birth over and over, being parts 
of extremely higher beings, these em=
anations/projections/amsas will surely 
eventually go back to the source wh=
en the work is done. 

=C2=A0 
However, in their forms as specific individu=

amsa attain the specific stages which =
makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will 
determine if they are to be called so.=
 They may not need to do so since they are 
here for a purpose. But, the on=

There is a book of conversations between Totapuri and a certa=

exists in Puri. In that conversation, Totapuri also=
 mentions a similar ideas of 
what is a siddha and higher. And how only a S=

Vigyani. He further mentions that Swami Vive=
kananda did not (need) to go to the 
stage of a Siddha. His work was specif=
ic, he did the work and went off. He did 
not need to and therefore did not=
 become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. 

=C2=A0 
Added to this the fa=

an Abhedananda. You may not want to judge them., thats your point =

Abhedananda on this matter rather than speculation. Both Viveka=

Abhedananda used to say Ramakrishna is their Guru and spirituall=
y far higher 
than they were. 

=C2=A0 
4) Whether Ramakrishna was a paramh=

merely your speculation. Vimala=

I would rather rely on t=

=C2=A0 
5) In this age everyone likes to take a tit=

Namaste friends, 
=C2=A0 
This is a small writeup on "siddhis" vis-=
a-vis spiritual progress, in reaction 
to further exchanges on Twitter. Thi=
s is a delicate area where many have 
misconceptions and I will try to addr=
ess them.

=C2=A0 
Maharshi Vasishtha's teaching =
to Lord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The 
goal of existence and sadha=
na is self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither 
specifically sought nor =
specifically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature 
gives one some siddhi=
(s), one should accept them with neither excitement nor 
disappointment. Bu=
t one should NOT run after them, for they are neither 
necessary nor suffic=
ient for self-realization and liberation. 

=C2=A0 
Vivekananda used the sa=
me principle when Ramakirishna proposed to give his 
siddhis to Vivekananda=
. He asked whether the siddhis will enable him to realize 
god. Ramakrishna=
 said no. Vivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, 
when Rama=
krishna gave them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda's two 
action=
s demonstrate Vasishtha's instructions well. 

=C2=A0

Let us use the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one's spir=
itual 
sadhana. Reaching the top is liberation. Different people climb the =
hill from 
different sides and using different paths. There may be trees wi=
th nice fruits 
on the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special abili=
ties. 

=C2=A0 
If one gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and colle=
cting fruits, one's 
journey gets delayed and one may not reach the top. Th=
at is why Vasishtha says a 
seeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. 

=
=C2=A0 
But if some fruits fall in one's lap by themselves, one can keep th=
em. 
Similarly, siddhis that come to one by themselves can be accepted by a=
 seeker of 
Self. 

=C2=A0 
Now an important distinction: 
=C2=A0 
There ar=
e some trees that are found at lower altitudes also, but some really 
speci=
al trees are found at very high altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, it=
 
shows that one has climbed great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do not =
mean 
much, but some siddhis are very special and only really elevated sadh=
akas can 
obtain them (whether by trying or without trying). If a sadhakas =
demonstrates 
such a siddhi, you can see that one progressed a lot. However=
, the key is that 
one who climbed the same or more distance may not have t=
hat or any other fruit.

Unlike in the ex=
ample of climbing hill, which is an external activity, spiritual 
progress =
in real life is *internal*. There is NO way for anyone to know for sure 
ho=
w much progress one has made, how much self-control one has internally and =

what exactly goes on in one's mind. We may try to judge it from external f=
actors 
such as actions, words etc, but it is not necessarily accurate. 

=
=C2=A0 
Here, some people swayed by siddhis may be tempted to use one's sid=
dhis to judge 
how high one climbed. But that is faulty. One person who rea=
ched the absolute 
top may not have any fruits, while one person who still =
has ways to climb may 
have gotten some really nice fruit. Using externasll=
y demonstrable siddhis that 
are neither necessary nor sufficient for Self-=
realization as a measure of one's 
progress is unsound. 

=C2=A0 
Given tha=
t spiritual progress is internal, how can we judge it and compare

n that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and 
hence Vimalananda is superior to Abhed=
ananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2.

Is Paramahamsa Nithyananda=
, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa 
because he is known =
so? See, how people are famously known may or may not 
reflect their spirit=
ual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you 
cannot see it. 

=
=C2=A0 
We do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really is. He may not be=
 just a 
paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scale, but be a siddha or a natha or =
even a rishi. 
He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself said and some r=
eligious experts of 
that time declared based on various signs. If Ramakris=
hna Paramahamsa is Vishnu 
himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda etc can defini=
tely be rishis or naths in 
Vimalananda's scale. If your argument is that t=
hey cannot be because they did 
not demonstrate siddhis compatible with tha=
t status, that is a non-point as I 
explained above. The disagreement betwe=
en then boils down a difference in the 
relevance and importance of externa=
lly demonstrated siddhis.

=C2=A0 
Why this is r=
elevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to 
have mis=
conceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing 
mira=
cles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. 

=C2=A0 
Vasishtha is =
not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught 
Lord R=
ama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will 
=
balance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis =
are 
neither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don't be distra=
cted by 
them or be infatuated with them. 

=C2=A0 
The goal of sadhana is =
that your notions of "this is I and these are mine" get 
subtler and subtle=
r and hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and 
weaker. Other=
s may or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you 
know your=
 progress and weaknesses the best. THAT is the crux and siddhis have no 
re=
levance or meaning. Any fascination for them will set you back in your 
sad=
hana.

<DIV>Some=
 thoughts on Siddhas.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>

<DIV align=3Dleft><FON=
T size=3D2 face=3DVerdana>Before we go further, let us define what is =
"siddhi" and what is a "siddha". Siddhi means accomplishment. That is =
why we used terms like mantra-siddhi (realizing a mantra), or some other ap=
parently miraculous/supernatural ability. And the word siddha is =
often used to describe someone who has some such ability.</FONT></DIV>=

<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV a=
lign=3Dleft><FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana>This definition of a Siddha is in=
correct. It is a corruption which has entered our thought-process over cent=
uries, just like every other spiritual person who uses an epithet Rishi is =
not really a Rishi.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT size=3D2 face=3DVe=
rdana></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana>S=
o who is a Siddha really? One who has acquired some miraculous ability? Nop=
e. Technically a Siddha is one who has taken his awareness (Kundalini) to t=
he Sahashrar Chakra, thus experiencing Nirvikalpa, and THEN bringing the aw=
areness back to the lower chakras. In this process, he often acquires *degr=
ees of mastery* over the five elements of the chakras. That is a true Siddh=
a. Aghora part 2 very clearly defines, (same is also hinted at in some=
 other books too), this in much details. There is absolutely no scope of am=
biguity here, unless one refuses to accept the book as valid (fine by me).&=
nbsp;Like it says, what is the difference between a gyani and a vigyani? A =
gyani experiences the state of Nirvikalpa and realizes "All is Brahman". Bu=
t it is one thing to realize "all is brahman", it is another thing to acqui=
re some of the shaktis of Brahman. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT si=
ze=3D2 face=3DVerdana></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT size=3D2 =
face=3DVerdana>F</FONT><FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana>or example, consider a=
 glass of water and an ocean. Both of them have the same chemical compostio=
n (H2O). Realizing this is realizing "all is Brahman". But an ocean can sus=
tain and create a Tsunami, a glass of water cannot, even if it wants to. Of=
 course it may often never have a desire to do so in the first place!&=
nbsp;However that is the difference, technically, between a gyani and a vi-=
gyani. And the whole process of a Siddha and higher starts ONLY AFTER =
someone is able to bring the Kundalini back from Sahashra chakra to the low=
er chakras again. Needless to say, for most of us ordinary people, even get=
ting a Kundalini to awaken is a big deal, taking it to Shahashrar is alread=
y too hi fi and may take lifetimes, bringing is back is impossible/unthinka=
ble totally.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana><=
/FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana>What hap=
pens when a person becomes a Siddha by the parameter described above? It is=
 impossible to imagine. He/she operates from a plane of reference so differ=
ent that ordinary folks just cannot fathom. Infact, most of us can't even f=
athom what samadhi feels like until experienced, what to speak of siddha-ho=
od. </FONT></DIV>

rdana>A Trilanga Swami did tri-khanda yogas, cuts his limbs, puts them =
;into fire and eventually the limbs regenerate. Even Sai Baba did a similar=
 thing. Is this a siddhi (miraculous ability) or a sadhana? To us average f=
olks, anything out of the ordinary seems miraculous. The internet itself wo=

<DIV align=

 Siddha-hood, will automatically produce external effects which appear mira=
