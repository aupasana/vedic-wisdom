Namaste all 

I got a old post omewhere else on net by Narasimha on his rea=
lisation of essence of Navrana mantra and how its just another aspect of ga=
yatri. 

I think its really profound and copying his post.

I dont think th=
is post of his is in the vedic wisdom book.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D


Namaste friends,

I want to share my 2 cents on this topic base=
d on what I realized from my
personal experience. More learned ones can ign=
ore my 2 cents.

* * *

Though I offer this navarna mantra in fire before a=
nd after saptashati everyday
as a part of my daily Chandi homam, I did not =
have an attachment to this mantra
and did not appreciate what it represente=
d. I could appreciate the outward and
inward meanings of the stories of sap=
tashati, but I was clueless on the navarna
mantra and was offering it in fi=
re merely ritually. In contrast, I was (and am)
quite attached to [Savitru]=
 Gayatri mantra, meditated with it a lot more, had
many experiences with it=
 and had a much better understanding of it. Even when
meditating at the end=
 of Chandi homam as the poornaahuti burnt, I always used
Gayatri mantra rat=
her than navarna mantra.

When I was at the Dakshineshwar temple in 2008 su=
mmer with my spiritual guru,
somehow I felt a strong urge to meditate with =
the navarna mantra and did so. The
Mother was kind and I could experience s=
ome things and some things became clear
about that mantra.

I realized thro=
ugh experience that navarna mantra is not that different from
Savitru Gayat=
ri mantra! It is actually a slightly different expression of the
same reali=
ty, even though this may sound strange to some.

* * *

Those who do homam =
know the following mantras from the uttaraangam: " OM bhUH
svaahaa - agnaya=
 idam na mama, OM bhuvH svaahaa - vaayava idam na mama, OM suvaH
svaahaa - =
sUryaayedam na mama " . Note that the planes of consciousness
represented b=
y bhUH, bhuvaH and suvaH (physical, mental and spiritual planes or,
using a=
lternate terminology, gross, subtle and causal realms) are associated
with =
Fire (Agni), Wind (Vaayu) and Sun (Surya) gods. After all, it is Fire who
t=
ransforms and transmutes things and enables physical matter to come from
aa=
kaasa (space); it is Wind that causes motion and thoughts in the mind; and,=
 it
is Sun who fills the entire universe and each being in it with the esse=
nce that
soul is.

In Chandipath (i.e. saptashati), we have 3 charitras for=
 which Mahakali,
Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati are the devatas. The beejas =
associated with the 3
charitras are Aim, Hreem and Kleem respectively. And,=
 Agni, Vaayu and Surya are
mentioned as the tattwa (essence) of the three c=
haritras respectively!

In other words, the 3 beejas aim, hreem and kleem t=
hat start the navarna mantra
are associated with Agni, Vaayu and Surya, who=
 also represents the realms of
bhUh, bhuvaH and suvaH. Basically, " aim hre=
em kleem " in navarna mantra similar
to " om bhurbhuvassuvah " that is usua=
lly appended to the Gayatri mantra.

The word " vid " that is part of " vic=
hche " (vid + cha + ee) is an expression of
" dhiyo yo nah prachodayat " . =
The word " ee " that is part of " vichche " is an
expression of " bhargo de=
vasya dheemahi " .

* * *

The difference between navarna mantra and Gayatr=
i mantra is in one way like the
difference between Bhagavad Gita and Avadho=
ota Gita or Ashtavakra Gita.

Avadhoota Gita by Dattatreya and Ashtavakra G=
ita by Ashtavakra (taught to king
Janaka) are fantastic vedantic texts that=
 throw light on the state of a
liberated being. Bhagavad Gita taught by Sri=
 Krishna also does the same thing.
However, the difference is that Bhagavad=
 Gita shows practical paths that one can
follow in order to be liberated. O=
f course, if you can imbibe the thinking
described in Avadhoota Gita or Ash=
tavakra Gita also, you can become liberated.
But, it is not easy for most p=
eople to imbibe that thinking just like that.
Bhagavad Gita shows a more pr=
actical and realistic path.

Similarly, Gayatri mantra refers to the resple=
ndent spiritual essence of the
entire universe (gross, subtle and causal) a=
nd asks us to know it and be
established in it. Navarna mantra is also refe=
rring to resplendent spiritual
essence of the entire universe (gross, subtl=
e and causal) and asking us to know
it and be established in its resplenden=
ce. But, in addition, it is giving us a
realistic path (chaamundaayai) to a=
chieving such a state of sat-chid-aananda
from the deeply dual state that w=
e are in. Except for that additional
recognition of deep duality and showin=
g a path towards realization, it basically
expresses the same realization c=
aptured in the Gayatri mantra.

* * *

To answer the specific question on w=
hich deity this navarna mantra is for, my
answer is that it is for the root=
 energy (aadyaa shakti) of this universe, that
makes every being - includin=
g Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - be, have desires,
think, know, act etc. This r=
oot energy is essentially the Shakti of the Supreme
Cosmic Being (Parama Pu=
rusha). In saptashati rahasya, She is described thus:

sarvasyaadyaa mahaal=
akShmIstriguNaa parameshvarI
lakShyaalakShya svarUpaa saa vyaapya kR^itsnam=
 vyavasthitaa
maatulungam gadaam kheTam paanapaatram cha bibhratI
naagaM li=
MgaM cha yonim cha bibhratI nR^ipamUrdhani
tapta kaaMchana varNaabhaa tapta=
 kaaMchana bhUShaNaa
shUnyam tadakhilam svena pUrayaamaasa tejasaa

This de=
scribes that Mahalakshmi of 3 gunas was the first of all beings and
supreme=
 of all beings. She filled the entire universe with Her shakti. The
rahasya=
 further describes that She divided Herself into 3 deities - Mahaakaali,
Ma=
haalakshmi and Mahaasaraswati - symbolizing the 3 gunas. They then created
=
Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and their consorts.

Of course, one can question whet=
her this aadyaa shakti is the first of all
beings as the verse above says o=
r whether it should be Parama Purusha that is
the first of all beings. The =
answer is that they are not actually two different
beings, even though we t=
end to look at them that way. It is the Aadyaa shakti
that makes Parama Pur=
usha (or Aadya purusha) be, think, desire, know and act.
Without Aadyaa sha=
kti, Aadya purusha has no thoughts, no desires, no knowledge
and no action,=
 i.e. he is non-different from unmanifested Brahman. His very
self-awarenes=
s is through Aadyaa shakti, just as my self-awareness is through my
Kundali=
ni.

Thus, Aadyaa shakti and Parama purusha are not really two different be=
ings, but
two different aspects of one being. Narayana and Narayani are one=
.

* * *

One word on intellectual analysis of mantras:

One can get only a=
 very limited understanding of mantras by analyzing them and
understanding =
them intellectually. One can realize and understand the nature of
a mantra =
through an internal experience of the mantra. One should focus the mind
so =
completely on the mantra that one's mind is eventually withdrawn from
every=
thing else, including one's body and sense inputs, and reverberates with
th=
e mantra with absolutely no other thoughts running in the mind. When the
ma=
ntra *fills* one's mind like this, one experiences and understands the mant=
ra.

If you want to experience a mantra, try to focus your mind on the mant=
ra and
forget everything else. Even several notions you may have in your mi=
nd about the
mantra and its deity may become blockages. Just forget everyth=
ing and focus the
mind on mantra alone.

If you spend your time contemplati=
ng your own actions and motivations behind
them and try to root out ego whe=
never it raises its head in your mind, it will
be helpful. I do not mean pr=
ide by ego here and mean self-identification with a
body and a name. As lon=
g as such an identification is strong, it prevents one
from being able to f=
ocus fully on a mantra. A person with no or very subtle ego
is far more lik=
ely to be able to achieve what I mentioned above, than a person
with a dens=
e ego.

When contemplation and attitude correction go in parallel to medita=
tion, the two
activities enhance the effectiveness of the other and eventua=
lly one breaks
through and succeeds in lowering ego and starts to experienc=
e subtler and higher
things. When mind is so pre-occupied with body, name e=
tc, it cannot experience
subtler things that well.

* * *

> So you will fi=
nd the more samhara rupas, that is tamasik,
> raudra forms of Kali, Chamund=
a, Shivaduti under the essence
> of Mahasaraswati, whereas the Mahakali rup=
a is beautiful;
> like Dakshina Kali.

:-) Beauty is in the eye of the beho=
lder. To a devotee of Smashaana Kaali, She
may be the most beautiful.

Best=
 regards,
Narasimha
