Namaste,

When Purusha sookta says that Brahmana is from the mouth of Purusha (supreme cosmic being), kshatriya is from the arms etc, it is not wrong. Please note two things here:
 
(1) Varna as I said before is not to be decided solely based on birth. It is based on one's skills, aptitude and work. Family and environment in which one grows up influences one's value system, skills and aptitude, but does not necessarily determine it. You cannot apply today's rigid caste system where shudras and even chandalas call themselves as braahmanas and kshatriyas to the Purusha sookta hymn.
 
(2) It is not that mouth and arms are auspicious parts and feet are inauspicious. Each part simply plays a different role. Mouth cannot support your weight and make you walk and foot cannot speak.
 
Similarly, braahmanas or those who pursue knowledge and wisdom share their wisdom with others and guide others and that is why they are compared to the mouth of god, which speaks. Kshatriyas use their power and protect others and that is why they are compared to the arms of god. Shudras do all the necessary hard work to keep the society running and that is why they are compared to feet. Nobody is more important or less important.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
