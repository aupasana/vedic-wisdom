Namaste all, 

Just today I came across Sri Rama Hrudhayam (The heart of Lo=
rd Rama) it has been translated by P.R.Ramachander at 
http://www.hindupedi=
a.com/en/Sri_Rama_Hrudayam


* * *


This great philosophical prayer occurs=
 in Adhyathma Ramayana. During discussions Goddess Parvathi , asks shiva, w=
hy Rama cries like an ordinary mortal when Sita is lost? If he is an ordina=
ry man , why should we pray to him at all. Then Shiva narrates to her the i=
nnermost thoughts of Lord Rama which he told his friend devotee Lord Hanuma=
n. The devanagari text is available in http://adhyatmaramayan.googlepages.c=
om/sriramahridayam)

* * *

Lord Shiva said:- 

Then Rama himself addressin=
g Hanuman who was near him told, 
Hear about the truth about Athma, Anathma=
 and Paramthma. 

The great ones see the sky in three different ways, 
The =
great sky as reflected in great body of water, 
Then as the limit that sepa=
rates and also as shadow. 

The first is the hidden power of the brain, 
Th=
en that power which is complete, 
And then the splendour idolized within us=
, 
Are the three types of Athma told by me. 


Whatever the hidden brain do=
es, Due to ignorance is ascribed to illusion , To the Paramathma* which is =
, Without feelings and is only a witness, Similarly some fools ascribe, The=
 activities of Jeevathma** to it. 
*That soul which is everywhere and never=
 dies 
** The body of the being which vanishes with death 

Shadow is not r=
eal but ignorance , And the feeling that it is true, Which appears to us is=
 due to ignorance, Like the Brahmam is the undivided truth, And the thought=
 of it being divided is ignorance. 

Words like "You are it", seeks to brin=
g unity between, 
The undivided entirety and shadowy concept of division. 
=


Due to the great saying when knowledge of unity of thought*, 
Arises , wi=
th it is destroyed thought of self as well as pride, 
*That Jeevathma and P=
aramathma are one. 

When my devotee understands this great truth,  He beco=
mes one with me but for those who do not have devotion,  And have fallen in=
 the deep pits of science,  Even in one hundred births will not get salvati=
on. 

This secret of the heart of my soul, Which has been told to you, Oh H=
anuman, Would give kingship better than that of Indra, And should not be to=
ld to those who are, Adamant and refuse too be my devotees.


regards
priya=
