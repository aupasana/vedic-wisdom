I have heard about "chimney less" Fire places. Actually they work on Gas an=
d are 
available only in West. I did make couple of enquiries online but it=
 seems these 
fireplaces cannot handle logs or Wood for burning. Does any o=
ne know of Chimney 
less fireplaces which can support burning logs or wood?=
 I think that would be 
ideal since it will solve the problem of emission a=
s well as keeping every thing 
contained inside the puja room. Alternativel=
y I am also thinking of having a 
traditional fire place built in my puja r=
oom with the chimney and exhaust. If 
anyone has any experience in these ma=
tters please share.

Regards,
Girish Sundaram

Good to know that you repainted your room twice. Even if you leave your roo=
m with "Black Shades" would be fine and actually more beautiful :)<br>***<b=
r>Answers to your questions:<br>

<br>1) YES. It is portable. Every day I a=
djust it near my window and after finishing homam, i take it back little in=
side so that window can be closed. I am able to adjust it myself alone in j=
ust a few *seconds*.<br><br>2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galvanized Iron) o=
f 22 Gauge. This was manufactured by a Local EPC contracting company dealin=
g in AC Duct installation. A Technical Supervisor of that company is my clo=
se family friend. He did this for me. I suggest checking with any Restauran=
ts. They all are having such arrangements and they would be able to help yo=
u to contact such manufacturers.<br>

<br>3) YES, because it is a Metal (GI=
 Sheet) it gets quite heated up. One can not touch during Homam. However, i=
t also cools down quickly. Within half an hour after Homam is finished, tem=
perature of the chimney comes down to room temperature. <br>

<br>4) It has=
 a Metallic FAN at the end. I was starting that FAN only when Fire goes of =
and lot of Smoke is generated. Reasons are as follows:<br>i)The fan is powe=
rful and makes a lot of noise which disturbs concentration.<br>

ii) In the=
 beginning, when Fire is very small, the powerful exhaust by the fan, distu=
rbed the flames and sometimes extinguished it.<br>1ii) When Fire is there i=
n the Homam, one need not worry about smoke handling. the reason is that th=
e smoke naturally travels upward and it is automatically guided to the exit=
 of the chimney. Once the fire becomes strong, it generates vacuum around H=
omam kundam area and starts pulling outside air. For instance, smoke from i=
ncense stick (Agarbatti), though outside of chimney and quite far away, act=
ually gets diverted into the Chimney via square opening at the bottom. Henc=
e during homam, FAN is not required.<br>

<br>iv) Now very important thing.=
 I used fan for many months (only at the end of Homas). One day my fear pro=
ved right. Due to heat of chimney, the cable of the Fan got burnt and there=
 was a short-circuit. mccb tripped. Since then I am not using the Fan. You =
may have to go for Heat resistant cable for the FAN if you wish to use it b=
ut i am fine without using the fan in my chimney.<br>

Actually without Fan=
, The whole arrangement will become much Lighter and much easier to handle.=
 Please also do not forget to make a support. You can see that in pictures =

 Is it a portable chimney?<br>> 2) Can you share the specs like the mate=

 the end of the Chimney to push out the Smoke?<br>
