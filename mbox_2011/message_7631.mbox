=C2=A0Namaste,

No, initially at least it does not matter too much as lon=
g as it done with a sense of devotion and surrender. Secondly, there are ma=
ny states of fire. Fire is a source of energy. Doing a homa is like doing a=
 satsanga with a very very powerful saint who charges you with energy. When=
 we think that the fire is dying, and find reddish cinders burning, that to=
o is a state of fire. The state where it can provide the least amount of sh=
akti because it is in sleep.

To be able to make sure that the fire does no=
t die down, one must be able to build a solid connection between internal a=
nd external fire. This cannot happen in one or even a few years, or maybe e=
ven one lifetime, if at all it happens.. 

Once when Sai Baba was sitting b=
eside his dhuni, teh fire suddenly started leaping upto the celing. Sai bab=
a took his stick, struck a pillar nearby and the asked the fire to calm dow=
n and fire became normal. THAT is what it means to have real connection wit=
h fire. In that state, every action of the external fire has a perfect corr=
espondence with the mind of the person=C2=A0which the person will understan=
d. And that is teh ideal state when a continuous dhuni can be maintained. B=
efore that state is achieved,=C2=A0a dhuni is a futile exercise which won't=
 survive. I know of at least one person who used to maintrain a fire for mo=
nths and years continuously, but his connection with fire was so strong tha=
t even if he was a million miles away he would know perfectly what state th=
e fire was in, whether it needed fuel or not. 

So for most of us, who are =
only beginners, relighting=C2=A0a fire and doing it with devotion is a simp=
le, practical and effective mechanism if and when needed.

-Regards

aha Ganapati Homam Questions

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

Om Ganeshai Namah!!

Since =
Navaratri, for last three months, I have been doing Maha Ganapati Homam onc=
e a month. Now, from yesterday with Lunar Eclipse, my intention is to do th=
e Homam weekly basis each weekend.

I would also like to increase the count=
s of Moola Mantra and Vedic Mantra, but I have following questions:

1) How=
 do we keep count of the number of Mantra chanted?
2) Homam Manual the sugg=
ested count is 4/8/12/21/28/108/1008, for progressing the count, there is b=
ig gap between 28 and 1008, is this intentional or any other suggestion?

A=
s I am doing Homam in terrace, for fire in Kunda, I have only trouble in th=
e start but once fire is big enough no problem, but the lamp get put off, q=
uite frequently, yesterday, I put the lamp inside one Steel vessel, is ther=
e any better way ?

Thanks and regards.
Mihir
