Hi,
 Focus is the result of meditation. If you keep on thinking about god o=
r 
anything, there is no possibility of getting deep into meditation. One n=
eed to 
think of god /or any mantra just to break a chain of connected thou=
ghts. 
If the body was not rested enough consciously (Pl. do not confuse wi=
th sleep 
which is involuntary), you may tend to sleep for the first few da=
ys. Once the 
body is rested enough consciously, you'll go deep into medita=
tion. I do not know 
whether it is sleep or deep meditation from your mail.=
 Just keep doing 
regularly, you'll know for yourself as the time progresse=
s. 
However, if Narasimha ji speaks, it would be more authentic. Best wishe=
s,
Acharyulu

Hi,
 
 During meditation one needs to think/focus on god and c=
oncentrate on him 
constantly. If you fall asleep means you are losing your=
 focus. Also a tired 
mind and body can't focus well and tends to fall asle=
ep.  I might be wrong but 
this is how I meditate. 

 
Regards,
 
Priya
