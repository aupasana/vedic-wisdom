 As the Ankola seed is attracted to its stem,the iron to the magnet, the
wi=
fe to her lord, the creeper to its tree, the river to the ocean, so the
sou=
l attracted stands ever at the feet of the Lord. This attraction is
termed =
devotion, Bhakti.
=E2=80=94 Sivanandalahari, verse 61

Kavyakantha: Will Ma=
harshi please enlighten us on the subject of Devotion
(Bhakti)?

Maharshi: =
To everyone the dearest object is himself. He loves himself
always, and wit=
h the greatest love possible. Such an unbroken current of
love, frequently =
compared in sacred books to a flowing stream of oil, is
styled devotion, if=
 it is directed towards God.

=E2=80=9CBhakti is the unshakeable attachment=
 to the Supreme God.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 Shandilya
Bhakti Sutras, verse 2

O=
rdinarily people regard God as existing outside of themselves and as having=

a personality like their own. The Jnani (enlightened sage) however regards=

the personal God (also) as none other than himself; and Self-love, in this=

case, is or becomes the love of God (personal).

In his case, devotion is =
defined as Self-realisation. Others, who treat the
personal God as somethin=
g outside themselves develop deep devotion to such a
God and finally sink t=
heir personality in Him.

The love-smitten chord of Self, trembles and pass=
es in music out of sight. In
fact, worship, nay, all intense concentrated t=
hought or feeling, is the
merging of the mind in the object worshipped or c=
oncentrated on. Intense
faith in the personal God, however, carries the dev=
otee easily and naturally
to faith in and devotion to the impersonal Absolu=
te (Swarupa Brahman).

Mostly, the beginnings of devotion to (personal) God=
 are traceable to a
desire to avoid sorrows and attain happiness. So, with =
great keenness and
zest people approach their God, investing Him with name =
and form, and attain
the objects they desire. Even after such attainment, t=
he habit of devotion
continues and the mind trained to worship God with for=
m and name develops
the power to dwell on the Formless and Nameless.

The e=
vanescent objects achieved by the first flow of devotion to a personal
God =
do not fully satisfy the aspiring soul who thirsts after enduring
happiness=
. With this ever new impetus to seek something more than relative
happiness=
, the progressing soul ultimately drops name and form as its object
of cont=
emplation and thus attempts to conceive of or realise the Absolute
(Brahman=
). Thus devotion to a personal God gets transformed or ripened
gradually in=
to devotion to the Impersonal, which is the same as Vichara
(enquiry) and R=
ealisation.

Investigation into the Self is nothing other than devotion.
=
=E2=80=94 Vivekachudamani, verse 32

Devotion may at the outset be by fits =
and starts. That need not depress the
aspirant, for it will develop and bec=
ome steadier and flow finally in an
unbroken current. When devotion (person=
al) is ripe, a moment's instruction
(Sravana) suffices for the next step in=
 Jnana. Faith helps in the
development of one's intuition and the attainmen=
t of complete illumination =E2=80=93
Cosmic Consciousness.

Thus, the weak =
aspirant's first efforts at devotion, through name and form
at broken inter=
vals, and for attaining finite or lower ends, ultimately
carry him beyond a=
ll name and form, into an unbroken current of love to the
Absolute. This is=
 Salvation (Mukti).
