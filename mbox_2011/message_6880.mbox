 not worthy of being worshipped by intelligent beings like ourselves. It ca=
n neither hear our prayers nor respond to them. I cannot believe that our a=
ncestors were so ignorant as to address their prayers to a mere burning mas=
s of matter</p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>I quite agree with you=
. They could never have been so foolish.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What then did =
they see in the Sun to justify their prayers being addressed to it?</p><p><=
/p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>You said just now that addressing of prayers=
 to inert matter cannot be justified by reason.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>Yes.=
</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>What then must be the nature of the =
entity to which a prayer is addressed?</p><p></p><p></p><p>The primary cond=
ition is that it must not be mere inert matter, but must be endowed with in=
telligence.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>And the second conditi=
on?</p><p></p><p></p><p>That it must be able to hear our prayers and be pow=
erful enough to answer them.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Quite so=
. If our ancients were not fools and yet addressed their prayers to the Sun=
, their conception of the Sun must have been quite different from that of m=
ere inert matter, in a state of high combustion.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>Yes=
, they must have also postulated of it intelligence, the capacity to hear u=
s and the ability to help us.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>The =
9;us' including not only all those who are now living to raise their ha=
nds in prayer to the Sun, but also the generations, past and future, infini=
te in number though they may be?</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></=
p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>The entity that is worshipped as the Sun is t=
herefore one whose intelligence or ability knows no limitation of space or =
time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It must be so.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=
=A0</i>You have now got your answer to the question as to who is worshipped=
 in the sandhya? It is an intelligent Being, omniscient and omnipotent in t=
he matter of hearing and responding to its votaries.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p=
>Your Holiness then means that it is a deva who has his habitation in the s=
olar orb?</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Quite so. He has not only h=
is habitation there, but the solar orb itself is his physical body.</p>


<=
p></p><p></p><p>Your Holiness means that the deva enlivens the solar orb, j=
ust as we do our physical bodies?</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Jus=
t so.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If then he is embodied just like us, how does he =
happen to have such high intelligence or power as to merit our obeisance?</=
p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>He attained that status by virtue o=
f the appropriate karma and upasana done by him in a previous life.</p><p><=
/p><p></p><p>Does Your Holiness mean that he was at one time just like ours=
elves and that he attained that status by his endeavour?</p>


<p></p><p></=
p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Yes.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Then he is no more than a j=
iva, which I aIso am. Why should a Jiva make prostration before another Jiv=
a, howsoever superior?</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Why should you=
r son or pupil respect you and why should you show respect to your superior=
 officers? Are not both of you jivas?</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>No doubt we ar=
e. But we respect our superiors as it is in their power to help us or injur=
e us, if they so desire.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>That is a ve=
ry low kind of respect. Anyhow, taking even that kind of respect, we must r=
espect Surya devata if it is in his power to help us or injure us, if he so=
 desires.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=
=A0</i>Being a jiva as much as your superior officers, he will help you if =
you appeal to him for help or injure you if you ignore or despise him. In y=
our own interest then, you are bound to worship him and secure his goodwill=
.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>But 1 need not court the favour nor fear the displ=
easure of my superior officer, if I carry out the duties of my office faith=
fully.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Quite so.</p><p></p><p></p><p>=
If I preserve that attitude, there is no reason why I should propitiate my =
superior officer</p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Certainly not.</p=
><p></p><p></p><p>Similarly, if l carry out strictly the duties enjoined on=
 me by the sastras, I need not propitiate any other jiva, be he the highest=
 devil.</p><p></p><p>


</p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Quite so.</p><p></p><p></p=
><p>Then, should I not give up the worship of Surya devata?</p><p></p><p></=
p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Certainly you may, unless of course such a worship i=
s part of the duties enjoined on you by the Sastras.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p=
>How can that be?</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>It is true that an =
honest and strict officer in performing the duties of his office need not m=
ind the pleasure or the displeasure of his immediate superior. But the mere=
 fact that he thinks it necessary or obligatory to perform those duties pro=
perly, shows that he has as the ultimate end the pleasure, or avoidance of =
the displeasure of a still higher officer who is superior to him as well as=
 to his immediate superior. Even if he has no personal acquaintance with th=
at higher officer, he always has in the background of his mind an undefined=
 power, call it the King or the Government, when he performs the duties of =
his office. And that power has the ability to benefit him by a recognition =
of his services or to punish him by taking note of his delinquencies. Furth=
er, that power rules both him and his immediate superior officer. If theref=
ore that power requires him to behave in a particular manner towards his su=
perior officer, he cannot afford to disobey that injunction, for if he diso=
beys, not only does he incur the displeasure of that officer but also of th=
e higher power.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>That is so.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>A=
charya:=A0</i>Similarly, if a power which rules both you as well as Surya d=
evata requires you to conduct yourself in a particular manner towards that =
deva, you cannot afford to neglect that injunction, but must conform to it =
or take the risk of incurring the displeasure of that deva as also of the h=
igher power.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>It is no doubt so. But in that case, in=
 prostrating myself before Surya devata, I shall be really worshipping the =
higher power even when my worship may seem addressed to the Surya.</p><p></=
p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>What of that?</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>If I am =
able to conceive of such a higher power who rules even the Surya, that powe=
r is really the worshipped entity although to all appearances the worship i=
s addressed to the Surya only.</p><p></p><p></p>


<p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Qui=
te so.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But Your Holiness said that it, was Surya devata=
 who was worshipped?</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Yes. It is corre=
ct so far as persons who are not able to conceive of a higher power are con=
cerned. To those however who can conceive of that power, He is the real upa=
sya. That power is called Hiranyagarbha. He enlivens and ensouls not only t=
he Surya, but all devils. He enlivens and inhabits not only the solar orb b=
ut all things. He is the cosmic personality who is the soul of all things.<=
/p>


<p></p><p></p><p>I suppose just as we have the sense of I 'in our=
 physical bodies, so does that cosmic personality has the sense of "I&=
quot; in the entire cosmos.</p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>He has.</p><p></p><p></=
p><p>


If so, the difference between Him and me lies not in the presence o=
r the absence of the sense of 'I' but only in the degree, the range=
 or the magnitude of that sense. Mine is restricted, His is extended.</p><p=
></p>


<p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>It is so.</p><p></p><p></p><p>if it is =
the sense of "I" that is responsible for the concept of a Jiva, h=
e must be as much a jiva as myself</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Qu=
ite so. In fact He is called the First Born.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>Then, e=
ven if this higher power happens to belong to the category of Jivas, just l=
ike myself, the same objection which I mentioned against the worship of Sur=
ya devata holds good in his case also.</p><p></p>


<p></p><p><i>Acharya:=
=A0</i>What then would you like to worship?</p><p></p><p></p><p>A transcend=
ent power which is not a jiva.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Have i=
t then that it is such a transcendent power that is worshipped in the sandh=
ya. We give Him the name of lswara, the Lord, or the antaryami, the inner r=
uler.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>But I have heard it mentioned that the terms L=
ord' and Ruler' are only relative terms which are used in regard to=
 Him when we want to describe Him in relation to the universe, which is =
9;lorded over 'or 'ruled' by Him.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Ach=
arya:=A0</i>Yes, it is so.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It cannot be that we can hav=
e no conception of him apart from his relationship of some sort to the univ=
erse. His relationship to the universe can at best be only an extraneous ci=
rcumstance. In His essence, He must have an independent existence quite unr=
elated to anything else.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>You are r=
ight. We call that unrelated essential existence Brahman.</p><p></p><p></p>=
<p>If it is so, that must be the real object of worship rather than the rel=
ative aspect called lshwara.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>It is=
 even as you say. It is really the unqualified Brahman that is worshipped i=
n the sandhya.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I cannot really understand Your Holiness=
. You first said that it was the solar orb that was the objector worship, b=
ut when I pointed out that it was only inert matter, you said that it was S=
urya devata that was the object of worship; when again I pointed out that h=
e was only a limited jiva like myself, you said it was Hiranyagarbha, the c=
osmic soul, that was the object of worship: when once again I pointed out t=
hat he was after all a jiva, however cosmic his sense of 'I' may be=
, you said that lswara the Lord and Ruler of the universe was really the ob=
ject of worship; and lastly when I said that even he is but a relative aspe=
ct of Brahman, you said that the object of worship was Brahman itself</p>

=

<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>I did say so.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But I=
 fail to see how all these statements can be reconciled.</p><p></p><p></p><=
p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Where is the difficulty?</p><p></p><p></p><p>The object=
 in a particular worship can be only one. How can it be the solar orb or th=
e deva enlivening it or Hiranyagarbha or Iswara or Brahman at the same time=
?</p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>I never said that it was the sol=
ar orb or the devil and so on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Does Your Holiness mean =
to say then that the object of worship is the solar orb and the devil and H=
iranyagarbha and Iswara and Brahman all put together?</p>


<p></p><p></p><=
p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Nor did I say anything of that sort.</p><p></p><p></p><=
p>How then am I to understand Your Holiness' statements?</p><p></p><p><=
/p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>When did I tell you that the upasya was Surya?</p>
=


<p></p><p></p><p>When I mentioned that the physical mass of burning matte=
r cannot be the object of worship.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Be=
fore you mentioned it, I said that it was even that mass that was the upasy=
a.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>I neve=
r mentioned that it was the solar body or the deva as an alternative. To on=
e who cannot conceive of an enlivening soul, the upasya is the physical mas=
s; to one, however, who declines to accept inert matter as an object of wor=
ship, I said the upasya was Surya devata. The upasya is ever one, but its e=
xact nature varies with the competence of the worshipping aspirant. The upa=
sya gets further refined when even the concept of a devil does not satisfy =
the enquiring devotee. We say then that it is Hiranyagarbha. When even such=
 a concept seems meagre or unsatisfactory, we tell the devotee that he is r=
eally worshipping the Supreme Lord himself When he begins to feel that even=
 the Lord-ness is a limitation of His essential nature, we tell him that it=
 is the infinite Brahman itself that is really worshipped. Where is the dif=
ficulty?</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>Does Your Holiness then mean that it is not=
 possible to definitely say what the object of worship in the sandhya is ex=
cept with reference to the mental equipment or intellectual advancement of =
the worshipper?</p>


<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>How can there be a=
n object of worship if we ignore the worshipper? The nature of the worshipp=
ed necessarily depends upon the nature of the worshipper.</p><p></p><p></p>=
<p>How?</p><p></p><p>


</p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Take me for example. All o=
f you show me respect. But the object of respect, though it is, roughly spe=
aking, myself, does differ with each one of you. Ordinary people respect me=
 and like to see me surrounded by glittering paraphernalia; their attention=
 and respect are claimed by those articles rather than by my personality. S=
uch people will show the same respect to others who have similar parapherna=
lia. Their homage is not therefore really paid to me but only to the paraph=
ernalia. Some others respect me for the position that I hold or for the Asr=
ama in which I am. Such people will equally respect others who are or may c=
ome to be in such a position or in such an Asrama, their homage is therefor=
e not paid to me but to my position or to the Asrama. And some others may n=
ot care what position I hold or in what Asrama I am, but give me homage whe=
rever I go and however I may be; their object of respect is my physical bod=
y. A few others will not mind if my body is dark or ugly or even diseased, =
but will nevertheless give me homage if by purity of mind and character or =
by the power of my intellect and learning or by any spiritual merit that I =
may possess I command their respect. Very few indeed will respect me for th=
e spark of divine intelligence which inheres in me, as it does in all of yo=
u.</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>Of course it is not possible to say that all the =
devotees that approach Your Holiness are of the same mental equipment.</p><=
p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Quite so. But, ordinarily all these peopl=
e, whether they really tender homage to the paraphernalia or to my status a=
nd Asrama or to my body or to my mind or to my intellect or to the divine s=
park in me, prostrate before me to show their respect. Can you tell me, apa=
rt from any reference to the several devotees, to whom or to what they pros=
trate?</p>


<p></p><p></p><p>It is no doubt very difficult to answer</p><p=
></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Similarly, with every kind of worship. Ext=
ernally viewed, there will be no appreciable difference between the one who=
 respects me for the paraphernalia and another who respects me for the divi=
ne spark in me. Externally viewed, there will similarly be no appreciable d=
ifference between the devotee who in his blind faith is content to address =
his prayers to the luminous Sun and another who turns to it as a visible sy=
mbol of the infinite Brahman. The question as to what is the upasya in the =
sandhya worship can therefore be answered only in this way.</p>


<p></p><p=
></p><p>I now understand how in the simple worship of the Sun all possible =
stages in spiritual perception have been provided for</p><p></p><p></p><p><=
i>Acharya:=A0</i>It is not only this, for you will find if you consider the=
 matter still further, that all the three ways known as karma, bhakti and G=
yana have been given places in the daily worship, but that is a different m=
atter. Simple as the sandhya worship seems to be, it is sufficient to help =
us on to the highest stages. It is as useful to the highest aspirant as it =
is to the beginner. It is a folly, therefore, to belittle its value or to n=
eglect it in practice.</p>
