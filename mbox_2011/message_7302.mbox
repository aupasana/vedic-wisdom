Dear Rama,

PM exists.
> So the tarpanam has to be done by the generation that is alive; if father,
else son.


This kind of analogy may be relevant if one is trying to exercise one's
authority and power over another. However, we are discussing tarpana
(literally "to please"). In the presence of a living father, a better
analogy is that of "going to visit a grandfather who lives elsewhere".
Certainly, the father should visit the grandfather. Does this mean that the
grandson should not visit the grandfather? And, when it comes to pleasing
the grandfather, is there a monopoly? Most grandparents get a special kind
of a pleasure from their grandkids. All analogies have their limits, but the
CEO analogy, IMO, misses the point.


> Pouring water to the roots takes care of the whole of the plant / tree.


When all other circumstances and factors are conducive to it, merely pouring
water to the roots takes care of the tree. This is not as easy as it
seems. Most trees from India will not survive the cold weather of North
America ... regardless of how much you water it. In advaita, mere gyana is
necessary ... but it takes lifetimes of strenuous karma yoga to reach this
point. Merely reciting a mantra is sufficient ... but it takes lifetimes to
develop the perfect bhakti that must accompany it.


> Looks like to each his / her own.


Those who feel strongly can certainly start with the deva and rishi tarpana
:-)

sasneham,
