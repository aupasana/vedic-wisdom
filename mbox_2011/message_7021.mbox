Namaste,=C2=A0
I am in full agreement with PVRji on this. PVRji, please con=
tinue to bring discussion from other fora into this as this gives us additi=
onal food for thought!=C2=A0
And Krishnenduji, just because a given set of =
people are in awe of some spiritual gaints, IMHO it is not right to avoid d=
iscussions on them. Through these discussion we are learning new things abo=
ut these great masters. And there is nothing to get hurt in Shri PVR's post=
. If anything, he wrote it in such a way that peoples' love and respect for=
 these great masters (Thakur and his disciples) will only increase. Really =
there is no need to complain!
