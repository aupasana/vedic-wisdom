Hi Mihir,

Happy to know that you have switched your homam schedule to e=
very week, hope you even do it regularly soon enough.

Increasing the Vedic=
 and Moola mantra chant is a good idea, Better donot think about the counts=
 or count the numbers of mantra being recited. Just stick to the time basis=
,pick any mantra and recite for  half-an hour or an hour or more than to it=
 as you wish.Forget about the counts like 28,1008 etc.

Your can avail lamp=
s in the market which will not blow off due to winds.If that is lingering y=
our mind during homam- even you can leave it as is once you started Agnipra=
tistapana.

Learned members please correct me if i am wrong.Above ideas are=
 given just to get much focus on mantra or God instead hanging around at th=
e stirring up thoughts

Thank you,
Srini.
