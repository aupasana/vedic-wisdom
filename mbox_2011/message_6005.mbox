Namaste Alok Bhai,

I used Brown til for very long time and very few times =
Black til. As you have observed, the speciality is that both types of til a=
ctually popout from Homam Kund with crackling sound. I really enjoyed that =
sound. Now i use bigger homam kund and still when i use Brown til, few pops=
 out.
I just collect them after homam and collect it in "Nirmalya bag" and =
dispose it off at proper place.

If you use White Til, then there will not =
be any popping out of the seeds. It just burns without any sound.

Best Reg=
ards,

Utpal
