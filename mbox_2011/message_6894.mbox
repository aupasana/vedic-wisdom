Namas=
te Dr Bhatla,

I do use dry coconut with murmure(puffed rice) and til(black=
 and white) and for poornahuti i use a full dry cocnut.
But since i have be=
en doing it on daily basis for a while, it has resulted in the blacekning o=
f walls.
I am afraid, i may have to stop it.
Thats why i need some suggesti=
ons.

And smoke is no problem for me,there is enough ventilation in my room=
 and i can bear it.

Thanks
Jitender
