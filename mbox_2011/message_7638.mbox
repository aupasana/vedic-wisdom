  Dear Sri Sreenivas,

  Thanks a lo=

  It gives =
me clarity from your responses on points 2 and 3. Will continue to pray to =
remove obstacles or neutralize my papam (and get spiritual punyam) so that =
I get the guidance of  "the Guru".
   

  Regarding point 1(ketu in lagna),=
 request other wise men of this noble forum to respond so that it will help=
 the person to adopt committed spiritual path to grow spiritually. It will =
also help others in his family (friends included) to come to terms with the=
 person. 

  Warm regards

  Rameshji,

  Here are my two cents, request veter=
ans to correct me.


    a.. Ketu is known to be Moksha karaka (spiritualit=
y), it is not surprising to see spirituaal tendencies in someone with Ketu =
in Lagna. 
    b.. For 2 & 3: the classical way is tadwiddhi praneepatena p=
ari prasnena sevayaa, upadekshyanti te (a) gnanam gnaninaha tatwa darsinaha=
 (Gita). It is important to choose a guru that can guide you, have faith in=
 him and serve him with dedication (following what he preaches probably may=
 be a better word), so he will guide you to gyan (Shirdi baba clarified it =
as "guru will show you what agyan is, so you will learn what is gyan"). You=
 might also like to note it may be a while until you settle for a suitable =
guru, some of my friends say "you will be called when you are ready".

 Dear Sri Narasimha Ji and other spiritually wise, 

    1. Is there any co=
rrelation between spiritual interest/growth and lagna of a person? For exam=
ple, one of my friend has Ketu in Lagna and seem to possess more spiritual =
interests than material interests (or almost nil). Can some one explain thi=
s aspect Ketu in Lagna? 

    2. How to reduce material tendencies? Are the=
re any specific disciplines perscribed for specific stars of persons?

    =
3. Alternatively, if there is no corrleation, whether regular and committed=
 spiritual practices alone sufficient? Are there any Vedic statements regar=
ding this?

    Appreciate your guidance.

    Thanks and best regards
    =
Ramesh
