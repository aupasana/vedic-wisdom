 Ashtavakra said:

Knowing yourself as truly one and indestructible, how co=
uld a wise man
possessing self-knowledge like you feel any pleasure in acqu=
iring wealth?
3.1

Truly, when one does not know oneself, one takes pleasur=
e in the objects of
mistaken perception, just as greed arises for the mista=
ken silver in one who
does not know mother of pearl for what it is. 3.2

Al=
l this wells up like waves in the sea. Recognising, "I am That," why run
ar=
ound like someone in need? 3.3

After hearing of oneself as pure consciousn=
ess and the supremely beautiful,
is one to go on lusting after sordid sexua=
l objects? 3.4

When the sage has realised that he himself is in all beings=
, and all beings
are in him, it is astonishing that the sense of individual=
ity should be able
to continue. 3.5

It is astonishing that a man who has r=
eached the supreme nondual state and
is intent on the benefits of liberatio=
n should still be subject to lust and
in bondage to sexual activity. 3.6

I=
t is astonishing that one already very debilitated, and knowing very well
t=
hat its arousal is the enemy of knowledge, should still hanker after
sensua=
lity, even when approaching his last days. 3.7

It is astonishing that one =
who is unattached to the things of this world or
the next, who discriminate=
s between the permanent and the impermanent, and
who longs for liberation, =
should still be afraid of liberation. 3.8

Whether feted or tormented, the =
wise man is always aware of his supreme
self-nature and is neither pleased =
nor disappointed. 3.9

The great-souled person sees even his own body in ac=
tion as if it were
someone else's, so how should he be disturbed by praise =
or blame? 3.10

Seeing this world as pure illusion, and devoid of any inter=
est in it, how
should the strong-minded person, feel fear, even at the appr=
oach of death?
3.11

Who can be compared to the great-souled person whose m=
ind is free from
desire even in disappointment, and who has found satisfact=
ion in
self-knowledge? 3.12

How should a strong-minded person who knows th=
at what he sees is by its very
nature nothing, consider one thing to be gra=
sped and another to be rejected?
3.13

An object of enjoyment that comes of=
 itself is neither painful nor
pleasurable for someone who has eliminated a=
ttachment, and who is free from
dualism and from desire. 3.14


Ashtavakra =
said:

The wise person of self-knowledge, playing the game of worldly enjoy=
ment,
bears no resemblance whatever to samsara's bewildered beasts of burde=
n. 4.1

Truly the yogi feels no excitement even at being established in tha=
t state
which all the Devas from Indra down yearn for disconsolately. 4.2

=
He who has known That is untouched within by good deeds or bad, just as
spa=
ce is not touched by smoke, however much it may appear to be. 4.3

Who can =
prevent the great-souled person who has known this whole world as
himself f=
rom living as he pleases? 4.4

Of all four categories of beings, from Brahm=
a down to the last clump of
grass, only the man of knowledge is capable of =
eliminating desire and
aversion. 4.5

Rare is the man who knows himself as =
the nondual Lord of the world, and he
who knows this is not afraid of anyth=
ing. 4.6


Ashtavakra said:

You are not bound by anything. What does a pur=
e person like you need to
renounce? Putting the complex organism to rest, y=
ou can find peace. 5.1

All this arises out of you, like a bubble out of th=
e sea. Knowing yourself
like this to be but one, you can find peace. 5.2

I=
n spite of being in front of your eyes, all this, being insubstantial, does=

not exist in you, spotless as you are. It is an appearance like the snake =
in
a rope, so you can find peace. 5.3

Equal in pain and in pleasure, equal=
 in hope and in disappointment, equal in
life and in death, and complete as=
 you are, you can find peace. 5.4


Ashtavakra said:

I am infinite like sp=
ace, and the natural world is like a jar. To know this
is knowledge, and th=
en there is neither renunciation, acceptance, or
cessation of it. 6.1

I am=
 like the ocean, and the multiplicity of objects is comparable to a
wave. T=
o know this is knowledge, and then there is neither renunciation,
acceptanc=
e or cessation of it. 6.2

I am like the mother of pearl, and the imagined =
world is like the silver. To
know this is knowledge, and then there is neit=
her renunciation, acceptance,
or cessation of it. 6.3

Alternatively, I am =
in all beings, and all beings are in me. To know this is
knowledge, and the=
n there is neither renunciation, acceptance, or cessation
of it. 6.4


Jana=
ka said:

In the infinite ocean of myself the world boat drifts here and th=
ere, moved
by its own inner wind. I am not put out by that. 7.1

Whether th=
e world wave of its own nature rises or disappears in the infinite
ocean of=
 myself, I neither gain nor lose anything by that. 7.2

It is in the infini=
te ocean of myself that the mind-creation called the
world takes place. I a=
m supremely peaceful and formless, and I remain as
such. 7.3

My true natur=
e is not contained in objects, nor does any object exist in it,
for it is i=
nfinite and spotless. So it is unattached, desireless and at
peace, and I r=
emain as such. 7.4

I am pure consciousness, and the world is like a magici=
an's show. How could
I imagine there is anything there to take up or reject=
? 7.5


Ashtavakra said:

Bondage is when the mind longs for something, gri=
eves about something,
rejects something, holds on to something, is pleased =
about something or
displeased about something. 8.1

Liberation is when the =
mind does not long for anything, grieve about
anything, reject anything, or=
 hold on to anything, and is not pleased about
anything or displeased about=
 anything. 8.2

Bondage is when the mind is tangled in one of the senses, a=
nd liberation is
when the mind is not tangled in any of the senses. 8.3

Wh=
en there is no "me," that is liberation, and when there is "me" there is
bo=
ndage. Consider this carefully, and neither hold on to anything nor reject
=
anything. 8.4


Ashtavakra said:

Knowing when the dualism of things done a=
nd undone has been put to rest, or
the person for whom they occur has, then=
 you can here and now go beyond
renunciation and obligations by indifferenc=
e to such things. 9.1

Rare indeed, my son, is the lucky man whose observat=
ion of the world's
behaviour has led to the extinction of his thirst for li=
ving, thirst for
pleasure, and thirst for knowledge. 9.2

All this is trans=
ient and spoiled by the three sorts of pain. Knowing it to
be insubstantial=
, ignoble, and fit only for rejection, one attains peace.
9.3

When was tha=
t age or time of life when the dualism of extremes did not exist
for men? A=
bandoning them, a person who is happy to take whatever comes
attains perfec=
tion. 9.4

Who does not end up with indifference to such things and attain =
peace when
he has seen the differences of opinions among the great sages, s=
aints, and
yogis? 9.5

Is he not a guru who, endowed with dispassion and eq=
uanimity, achieves full
knowledge of the nature of consciousness, and leads=
 others out of samsara?
9.6

If you would just see the transformations of t=
he elements as nothing more
than the elements, then you would immediately b=
e freed from all bonds and
established in your own nature. 9.7

One's desir=
es are samsara. Knowing this, abandon them. The renunciation of
them is the=
 renunciation of it. Now you can remain as you are. 9.8
