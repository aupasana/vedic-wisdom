Respected Narasimhaji

So why are you complaining to me?

I am not complain=
ing your viewpoint or opinion.I never had or find no
reason that i will hav=
e to.
What i complain is that you should have moderated the things said by
=
Rajarshi in the first mail specifically that mathematical comparison.You
to=
o knew its sensitive nature.
And if you say that it is not possible to mode=
rate such matters and you
will keep on importing  such from other foras WIT=
HOUT MODERATION pls say
it clearly.
As I have said I have no ill feelings t=
owards you nor will I have any.It
is through you that I came to know Manish=
ji.
But as i said if it is not possible for you or you dont want to moderat=
e
it is better to seperate in peace than to live in disharmony.
