Hello all, 

My sade sati is going to start in comming months, and i want t=
o do the shani mantra 


1. Many resources say that the Grah beej mantra ar=
e more suitable than Grah gayatri vedic mantra? is it so?

i could see 3 li=
nes of reasoning/guidelines on different site. 
- beej mantra are suitable =
for kali yuga.
- that pronunciation needed for vedic grah gyatri mantra is =
too precise.
- beej mantra gives result quickly but their good results deca=
y faster when you lessen the count, whereas on the other hand vedic mantra =
gives reults slowly but maintains better result in long run

Please guide

=

2. There are different version of beej mantras for shani
    a. Om sham sh=
anayisharaaye namah
Is sham a beej mantra, or is it just a normal namah man=
tra where sham got added up over time?

    b. Om pram preem proum sah shan=
aischaraya namah (19000 times in 40 days)
>From where does this 19000 times =
in 40 days requirement comes? i do understand that Sincerety(selflessness),=
 Focus, Devotion are the main thing.

    c. Om Aim Hrim Shrim Shanaiscaray=
a Namah (Acc to Shree maa at http://www.lightonvedicastrology.com/resources=
.htm)
I have no idea about this version
