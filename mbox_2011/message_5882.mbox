      Dear Sri Narasimhagaru and other learned sadhakas, 



I have =
the following questions and will be very happy if you respond at your conve=
nience. 



1. I had been doing a one lakh purascharana of Siva Pancakshari=
 mantra that will be completed the day before Maha Siva Ratri. I intend to =
do a Siva Homam and offer the Dasamsa (10,000 offerings) in the homam. What=
 material to be used for a such a large number of offerings? Usually, I cal=
l several people and divide the total number by the number of people chanti=
ng and offer the quotient number of offerings in the fire. But this being a=
 working day I don't think I will be getting any help. So, I will do the 10=
,000 swaha chantings myself and I need to be doing 10,000 offerings. What i=
s the best material to be used. Ghee, Havan Samagri or any other seeds like=
 sunflower seeds etc.? Please advise. 



2. For Siva Ratri, in our communi=
ty at the local temple some people are organizing a Siva Homam wherein they=
 are distributing Siva Lingas for sponsors ordered from some place in Delhi=
. I do not know the origin well. It could well be from internet. After that=
 homam is done and I get the Siva Lingam, can I use it in my daily pooja or=
 shall I put in the show-case! 



On the same topic, several people are af=
raid that something bad would happen if they do not do abhishekam for the l=
ingam daily, so they are refraining from sponsoring the pooja. In  the proc=
ess, the temple is suffering with not enough funds. What would be your advi=
se for such situations?



3. Next month pournima is fast approaching and i=
t is in the neighborhood of March 18th. I don't know what to do for Mantapa=
 danam yet. Could you please advise?



Nagraj
