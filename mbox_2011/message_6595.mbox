=

48. Or, if he has no worldly desires, he is born in a family of Yogis who
=
have pure
intellect due to their practice of enquiry into the nature of Bra=
hman, for
such a birth is hard to obtain.

81. A student, diligent in recit=
ing the Vedas, reads or recites them even in
his dreams through the force o=
f habit. Similarly, one who practises
meditation, continues it even in his =
dreams.

84. A woman devoted to a paramour, though engaged in household dut=
ies, will
all
the time be dwelling in mind on the pleasures with him.

85. =
While enjoying in mind the pleasure of the company of her lover, her
househ=
old
duties though not much disturbed, are managed indifferently.

86. The w=
oman with attachment to a paramour cannot fully do the work as a
woman atta=
ched to her domestic duties does, with enthusiasm.

91. If he controls and =
concentrates his mind, he is a meditator and not a
knower of
truth. To know=
 a pot the mind need not be controlled.

95. Once the nature of the Self ha=
s been conclusively determined, the knower
can
speak of it, think of it or =
meditate on it at will.

96. (Doubt): The knower too, like a meditator, for=
gets worldly affairs in
his
contemplation. (Reply): Let him forget. This fo=
rgetfulness is due to his
meditation
and not because of his knowledge of th=
e Self.

97. Meditation is left to his will, for his release has been achie=
ved
through
knowledge. From knowledge alone comes release. This the scriptu=
res announce
with
drum-beats.

98. (Doubt): If a knower does not meditate, =
he would be drawn to external
affairs.
(Reply): Let him happily engage hims=
elf in them. What is the objection for a
knower
to be so engaged ?

99. (Do=
ubt): This sort of reasoning is wrong, for there the scriptures will
be vio=
lated.

(Reply): If so, what is right reasoning please ? (Doubt): Right rea=
soning is
to follow the injunctions and prohibitions of the scriptures. (Re=
ply): But
they do not apply to the enlightened.

100. All these injunctions=
 and prohibitions are meant for those who believe
themselves to belong to a=
 certain caste or station and stage of life.

102. The clear-sighted knower=
 from whose heart all attachment has vanished
is a
liberated soul whether h=
e performs or not concentration or action.

103. He whose mind is free from=
 all desires or former impressions has
nothing to
gain from either action o=
r inaction, meditation (Samadhi) or repetitions of
holy
formulas.

104. The=
 Self is associationless and everything other than the Self is a
display of=
 the magic of Maya. When a mind has such a firm conviction,
wherefrom will =
any desire
or impression come in it ?

130. Those who give up meditation on=
 the attributeless Brahman and undertake
pilgrimages, recitations of the ho=
ly formulas and other methods, may be
compared
to =E2=80=98those who drop t=
he sweets and lick the hand=E2=80=99.

X. THE LAMP OF THE THEATRE

9. That =
consciousness which reveals at one and the same time the agent, the
action
=
and the external objects is called =E2=80=98witness=E2=80=99 in the Vedanta=
.

10. The witness, like the lamp in a dancing hall, reveals all these as =
=E2=80=98I
see=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98I hear=E2=80=99,=E2=80=98I smell=E2=80=99=
, =E2=80=98I taste=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98I touch=E2=80=99 as pieces of knowled=
ge.

11. The light in the dancing hall uniformly reveals the patron, the au=
dience
and the
dancer. Even when they are absent, the light continues to sh=
ine.

12. The witness-consciousness lights up the ego, the intellect and th=
e
sense-objects.
Even when ego etc., are absent, it remains self-luminous a=
s ever.

13. The unchangeable witness is ever present as self-luminous cons=
ciousness;
the intellect functions under its light and dances in a variety =
of ways.

14. In this illustration the patron(sponsrer) is the ego, the var=
ious
sense-objects are the audience, the intellect is the dancer, the music=
ians
playing on their instruments are the sense-organs and the light illumi=
ning
them all is the witness-consciousness.

15. As the light reveals all t=
he objects remaining in its own place, so the
witnessconsciousness,itself e=
ver motionless, illumines the objects within
and without (including the ope=
rations of the mind).

XI. THE BLISS OF YOGA

21. As the happiness derived =
from sense-objects is covered by thousands of
afflictions, it is misery onl=
y. There is therefore no happiness in the
limited.

37. Our happiness and m=
isery, however, are not to be known by inference;
both
their presence and a=
bsence are directly experienced.

39. If sleep does not produce an experien=
ce of bliss why do people make so
much efforts to procure soft beds etc., ?=


42. But the happiness experienced in deep sleep is not obtained from any
=
object. A man may go to sleep expecting to be happy, but before long he
exp=
eriences a happiness of a higher order.

45. To remove that weariness the J=
iva rushes towards his real Self and
becoming
united with it experiences th=
e bliss of Brahman in sleep.
