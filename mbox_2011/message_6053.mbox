 160 Whatever shines intermittently is insentient and therefore shines by
t=
he light of another. That [reality], by which all things insentient shine,
=
is self-shining, being consciousness by nature.

Here the light meant is no=
t that of the sun, moon, or lamps, but the light
of consciousness.

In the =
definition of reality two conditions were set out: continuous,
uninterrupte=
d shining and the capacity for being self-shining. The two are
only one, be=
ing inseparable. The first was shown to be fulfilled by the
supreme reality=
 alone. The second condition also is here shown to be
fulfilled by it alone=
. Therefore, it alone can be vedantically real. Nothing
else, neither the m=
ind, nor the world, meets this definition.

161 We know from the words of o=
ur divine Guru that that alone is real which
survives in the state of peace=
, which is the highest, and that all else is
unreal.

Thus, by the applicat=
ion of the vedantic test of reality, it has been shown
that the inseparable=
 pair, the mind and the world, is unreal, and that the
real Self, which is =
Brahman, is alone real.

Now a doubt is raised and is set at rest in the fo=
llowing verses:

162 =E2=80=98If even the mind is unreal, then it will foll=
ow that what remains is
only a void, since in deep sleep there is nothing a=
t all.=E2=80=99 Those who raise
this contention are committing the mistake =
of forgetting themselves!

163 How can this void be known at all if there i=
s no one to witness it? This
void is certainly not without a witness. Hence=
, this void is not the final
reality.

164 This doctrine of the void has th=
us been clearly refuted by the most holy
one. For us, there is not the leas=
t doubt on this point because [as
demonstrated by Bhagavan], there is the r=
eal Self, the sole survivor, in the
supreme state.

165 In the Heart of eve=
ry living creature the self-shining real Self shines
by its own light [of c=
onsciousness] as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. Hence, everyone knows himself to
be r=
eal. Who is there in the world of men who says, =E2=80=98I do not exist!=E2=
=80=99

Thus it is made clear that the Self is self-revealed. This means th=
at
knowledge of the Self is by direct experience and not by inference. But =
many
philosophers seem to be unaware of this.

166 The existence of their o=
wn Self is inferred by some from mental
functioning, by the reasoning, =E2=
=80=98I think, therefore I am=E2=80=99. These men are like
those dull-witte=
d ones who ignore the elephant when it goes past, and become
convinced afte=
rwards by looking at the footprints!

167 Indeed, everyone experiences his =
own existence during deep sleep, where
the mind is absent. Also, the sleepe=
r manifests remembrance of the happiness
[of sleep], saying, =E2=80=98I sle=
pt happily=E2=80=99.

168 How can anyone remember the happiness experienced=
 by someone else? The
happiness of sleep was surely enjoyed by oneself. Doe=
s anyone say, =E2=80=98He that
existed prior to sleep is not the same perso=
n as I am now=E2=80=99?

As Bhagavan himself has pointed out, when Johnson =
goes to sleep, Benson does
not awake, but only Johnson.

169 The mind, alon=
g with the universe, merges in it [the Self] in deep
sleep, and from there =
it rises again [along with the universe] on waking.
Hence the creed of the =
void is untrue.

170 Without a supporting substratum, how can the two, the =
universe and the
mind, appear at all? Is there anyone who sees the serpent =
without its basis,
the rope, or one who sees silver without its basis, the =
oyster shell?

171 Surely there does exist a reality-consciousness that len=
ds [an
appearance of] existence and shining to the universe [including the =
mind]?
How else can worldly people have the notion that this unreality exis=
ts and
shines?

172 Because these two shine only by the light [of the Self]=
, therefore that
one is self-shining consciousness. Apart from [that] Self =
there is nothing
else, anywhere, which is self-shining.

173 When the real =
Self shines on the dawn of right awareness, neither the
sun nor the moon no=
r the stars shine. By its light alone do these shine here
for the ignorant =
one, whose mind is turned outwards.

174 There is not the least doubt about=
 the existence of the real Self,
because that same [pure] consciousness, by=
 which the whole world shines, and
by whose light the mind becomes mind, is=
 the Self.

175 Ignorance does not obstruct the awareness of =E2=80=98I am=
=E2=80=99, but only the
awareness of the fact =E2=80=98I am awareness=E2=80=
=99. Everyone =E2=80=93 with the exception of
those deluded by the scientif=
ic creed =E2=80=93 knows of his own existence.

176 The eternal, unchanging=
 ever-shining Self persists continuously as the
real through all the varyin=
g states. Superimposed on it, the substratum, the
whole world shines.

177 =
It is by borrowing the reality of this reality, which is perfect
consciousn=
ess, that this world and the mind appear as real to all those
whose minds a=
re deluded on account of their ignorance of their own selves.

Bhagavan=E2=
=80=99s own pronouncement is next quoted.

178 Here is the utterance of the=
 most holy one: =E2=80=98Brahman, which is only one,
itself shines inside [=
in the Heart] of all creatures as the real Self, in
the form of, =E2=80=9CI=
=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D. There is no other Self.=E2=80=99

179 He al=
so said: =E2=80=98This same [truth] is the meaning of the utterance of the
=
famous, heavenly voice that told Moses, =E2=80=9CMy real nature is just the=

consciousness, =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D.=E2=80=99

180 The sages, b=
ecoming aware of that which is Brahman, shining in the
supreme state as the=
 real Self, are ever contented. It is as if they have
had all their desires=
 fulfilled simultaneously.

The perfect happiness in which the sages live i=
s inexplicable in any other
way.

181 This pure consciousness, which is the=
 real Self, appears to the one who
does not know himself as the world. This=
 misunderstanding of the true nature
of the real Self is rooted in the igno=
rance of one=E2=80=99s own Self.

182 This world, the outcome of ignorance,=
 of course conceals the truth of
that [Self]. The intellect, the senses and=
 the mind are the servants of
[that] ignorance.

183 Hence it is that the w=
orldly means of proof, namely direct perception,
tradition and inference, s=
erve only to deceive the creature. They do not at
all serve the attainment =
of right awareness.

184 Where is the wonder that the ignorant, thinking th=
e world to be real in
its own right, also become persuaded that the real Se=
lf =E2=80=93 which is ever
blissful, desireless, unrelated to anything and =
alone =E2=80=93 is in bondage to
worldliness?

185 The unreality of the wor=
ld, which has thus been expounded, is not easy
to understand by the aid of =
the one single simile. Hence, to make this
intelligible to the sadhaka, the=
 holy Guru gives three similes in
succession.

186 When it is explained tha=
t the illusory appearance of the world is like
that of the serpent in the r=
ope, a doubt occurs to the disciple, because he
thinks that the simile does=
 not apply in all cases.

187 The illusory notion of the serpent ceases whe=
n the rope is known [to be
the truth]. The world-illusion does not cease fo=
r the aspirant [when he
understands that it is unreal]. Even after the trut=
h [of the unreality of
the world] is known by the help of revelation and by=
 arguments, still the
world continues to appear [as if real].

There is an =
explanation of this apparent anomaly, which is given next.

188 The world-i=
llusion does not come to an end by theoretical knowledge, and
hence there i=
s no room for this doubt. Yet in order to remove this doubt the
Guru gives =
a second simile.

189 Even after the truth of it becomes known, there persi=
sts the vision of
water in the mirage. But even when this doubt is cleared,=
 another doubt
arises [in its place].

190 It is objected: =E2=80=98Worldly=
 objects serve some useful purposes, but the
water of the mirage does not.=
=E2=80=99 To this the reply is: =E2=80=98Things seen in a dream
are useful =
[in the dream], but all the same they are unreal.=E2=80=99

191 In the same=
 way, the objects of the world, though useful [while they
appear to exist],=
 are unreal. This state called waking is really a dream
seen by the creatur=
e who is a victim of a sleep that consists of ignorance
of the real Self.

=
192 As long as this sleep of ignorance does not cease by direct experience
=
[of the truth of the Self], this dream called waking, wherein the world
app=
ears as real, will continue.

The test of reality is again repeated in this=
 context.

193 It must be understood that reality is freedom from being con=
tradicted
and unreality is being subject to extinction. The Self alone is r=
eal because
it never ceases to be. The world is unreal because it ceases to=
 appear when
there is awareness of the Self.

The nature of the world=E2=80=
=99s unreality is next further clarified.

194 The whole universe appears a=
s a superimposition on the real Self, the
substratum, which is the reality,=
 and hence it is not like a man=E2=80=99s horn. But
it is taught that it is=
 not real in its own right.

This distinction is important. There are two k=
inds of unreality. The utterly
unreal, which is never conceivable as real, =
is one which has no substratum,
like a man=E2=80=99s or hare=E2=80=99s horn=
. The other kind is that which can and does
appear as real, like the rope-s=
nake. The world=E2=80=99s unreality is of the latter
kind. It is not real i=
n its own right, since it owes its appearance of
reality to its substratum.=
 This point will be dealt with later.

So far the question of the reality o=
f the world as a whole has been
discussed and the conclusion has been reach=
ed as stated above. Bhagavan next
deals with the same question in detail an=
d thus confirms this conclusion.

195 This whole world appears divided up i=
nto an endless variety of parts.
Our holy Guru makes it clear that all thes=
e parts also are unreal [when
taken separately].

196 It is the mind that k=
nows the difference between the individual soul and
God and all other diffe=
rences. It is the nature of the mind to perceive
differences. In the mind-f=
ree state there are no differences.

Differences are perceived in waking an=
d in dream, where the mind is present,
not in deep sleep, nor in the suprem=
e state, because there the mind is
absent, as shown already.

This appearan=
ce of differences is next traced to its root, which is stated.
