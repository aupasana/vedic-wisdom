Why can't it be a different take like this ?

If you were in someone's drea=
ms, the dreams are real. How real are the dreams? Real as long as they exis=
t; they are real, but temporary. They have their life time.

yAA dEvi sarva=
 bhUtEsu, Swapna rUpEna samsthitha.

You are the instrument for him / her t=
o start the hOma and she is the cause of the dreams. You may be a nimitta w=
ith all the humility you showed, but you are real; so is the dream.
