Namaste Akshaya,

These are entirely my views which I expressed after exper=
ience of about a year.

Yes, you are right that Sopari helps in digesting f=
ood and otherwise Auspicious. That is why we use it frequently in our ritua=
ls. But as Narasimha somewhere pointed out recently and I would extend that=
 to this particular issue, Betel Nut Gross body affects our gross bodies. W=
hat I spoke about is for the subtle effects of betel nut.
I again reiterate=
 that these are entirely my personal views based on my *Own* experience so =
one need not rely entirely on that but one can experiment and see for onese=
lf.

]

I wish to stress that doing =
Homam for God does not mean that only pleasant thing at material level/Ment=
al level will happen. There are all the chances that one may experience fru=
its of past bad Karma at the various stages of the Sadhana depending upon o=
ne's quality of stock of past Karmas and quality of mental focus. 
Unless o=
ne is faced with situations which strongly challenges ones patterns/habits,=
 some hard habits/patterns will not be broken. So God also needs to do that=
 for the Spiritual progress of an aspirant.
I agree that God will guide you=
 by providing better sense and discrimination but these qualities are dawn =
and perfectly established only after some struggles. But ultimately I found=
 Homam as a Sadhana which will take good care of the Sadhaka, at all level.=



Best Regards,
Utpal
