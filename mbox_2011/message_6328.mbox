Namaste PVR, 

I read the generic manual and i think the explanation of the=
 various deities is very very beautiful, relevant and apt. i will suggest t=
hat it should be added in our normal manuals also. I think many times even =
Hindus fail to have a sense of gods being present as an aspect in our own c=
onsciousness. Adding these lines in manuals will bring a greater sense of u=
nderstanding.


Quoting Sri Robert Svoboda - "Just for the record, my view =
is very similar to yours =E2=80" the important thing is to create a relatio=
nship with fire, and via the fire, with Brahman, Nirguna or Saguna =E2=80" =


Question
1. Is Lord Narayana shagun or nirgun. he is supposedly above the=
 3 gunas?


regards
Priyank
