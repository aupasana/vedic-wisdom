ADMISSION free GENEROUS DONATIONS WELCOME. Lunch will be served.

Dr.=
 Swamy will discuss "KRISHAN TV" and he will also discuss "Corruption - Ved=
ic Life Style is the solution. It's implementation in daily/business/politi=
cal life."

Dr. Swamy needs little introduction. He stood for Hindu causes =
and he is recently most well known for his numerous successful legal battle=
s and his well know campaign against corruption.  It is fashionable to spea=
k against corruption now but Dr. Swamy has been fighting this battle alone =
for longest period of time.


We all know how he saved Rama Sethu. Even tho=
ugh he is not a lawyer, he stood like a lion and convinced the judges on th=
e fallacies and discrimination involved in Rama Sethu destruction. It is NO=
T the efforts of any political party, 1 million rallies in Delhi or 0.1 mil=
lion verifiable signature campaigns that succeeded in blocking destruction =
of Rama Sethu, but it is Dr. Swamy's efforts.

Dr. Swamy's speech for fund =
raising to help correct the bias in Sanatana Dharma Text books is just one =
effort among the many he is dedicating for Sanatan Dharma causes, when poli=
ticians shun addressing even the most genuine of Hindu grievances, whether =
it is plight of temples, world wide terrorism, missionary conversions or ap=
peasement politics. Let us take part in this to help ourselves.

There are =
many links where you can find the wonderful speeches Dr. Swamy gave on 'Hin=
dus Under Siege' and 'Rama Sethu' based on his books by the same name.

Dr.=
 Swamy is widely regarded as an expert on the economy of China. He is also =
well versed in Mandarin Chinese and is well known for persuading Chinese pr=
emier Deng Xiaoping in 1981 to open Kailash Manasarovar in Tibet to Hindu p=
ilgrims in India.

His official web site is http://janataparty.org where yo=
u can find detailed information of the causes he has undertaken.

n Swamy is the author of numerous books and writes regularly in various jou=
rnals and newspapers. Some of his books are :-
