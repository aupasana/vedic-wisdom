Namaste, Nyasa is the act of placing the said syllable on that part of you=
r body. In the process of doing the nyasa, one is converting ones human bod=
y to become fit to receive the mantra(actually, the Devatha). In addition, =
one receives protection while doing japa.

In each one of these, the hand n=
eeds to be placed with the appropriate mudra on the place( Hridaya, Shiraha=
, Shika, Kavacha mudra and the netra followed by the astra mudra and the ci=
rcular movement.

The nyasa needs to be done at least once before the japa/=
homa etc. The nyasa usually comes along with rishi nyasa, kara nyasa and ot=
her nyasas which would depend on the mantra and parampara..

Normally the o=
rder is :

1. Samkalpa
2. Rishi etc recital
3. Rishi nyasa( Rishi Chandas D=
evatha etc)
4. Kara nyasa
5. Anga nyasa
etc...

Hope this helps.
