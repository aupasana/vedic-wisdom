 Vedanta does not want you to renounce the world. It wants you to change
yo=
ur mental attitude and give up this false, illusory `I-ness' and
`mine-ness=
'. The snake charmer removes only the two poisonous fangs of the
cobra. The=
 snake remains the same. It hisses, raises its hood and shows its
fangs. In=
 fact, it does everything as before.

The snake charmer has changed his men=
tal attitude towards the snake. He has
a feeling now that it has no poisono=
us fangs. Even so, you must remove the
two poisonous fangs of the mind, nam=
ely, `I-ness' and `mine-ness' only. Then
you can allow the mind to go where=
ver it likes. Then you will always have
the feeling of the presence of God.=


You must also renounce the attachment to renunciation, which is very
deep=
-rooted. You must renounce the idea: "I have renounced everything; I am
a g=
reat renunciate". This attachment of aspirants is a greater evil than
that =
of the householders: "I am a landlord; I am a brahmana, etc."

Not by shavi=
ng the head, not by dress, not by egoistic action is liberation
to be attai=
ned. He who possesses wisdom is a real sanyasin (monk). Wisdom is
the sign =
of a sanyasin. The wooden staff does not make a sanyasin. He is the
real sa=
nyasin of wisdom who is conscious of his absolute nature even in his
dreams=
 just as he is during the waking period. He is the greatest knower of
Brahm=
an. He is the greatest of sanyasins.

Perfect renunciation is born of discr=
imination. Dispassion should not be
mild and half-hearted. It should be a b=
urning flame of disgust for
everything that is seen and that is not seen. N=
othing but the state of final
liberation is to be the ideal for attainment.=
 There should be no desire for
wife, husband, children and worldly activity=
. The aspirant must be encircled
by the fence of dispassion on all sides.

=
Action is for the man of the world, the wisdom is for the sanyasin who has
=
risen above worldliness. Only the man of renunciation with knowledge attain=
s
Brahman, and none else. Without perfect renunciation, it is impossible to=

pursue the path of the knowledge of Brahman.
