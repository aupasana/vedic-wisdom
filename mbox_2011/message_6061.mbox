It is confusing ! if eventually all of us have to merge with the one-ness, =
why are we independent now ? 
What about Ganesha and other deities who exis=
t separately from Lord Siva ? Are they one with him or separate ? If the fo=
rmer, how are they separate now? If the latter, then they are still in dual=
ity !

Which is why, I understand only duality to follow :-)
