Cultivating Prana

=A0

Robert E. Svoboda

=A0

=A0

=A0=A0=A0
Whoever yo=
u may be, and wherever you may live, you live your life well
when you live =
it at the right rate. Plow your way through life and life will
wear you out=
; poke your way along and your life will grind to a halt. Find a
pace that =
suits you, though, and amble along it accordingly, and your world
will spon=
taneously level a path for you.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0
Life requires of each of us=
 a judicious stride, a step that causes every
particle of our being to reve=
rberate with rapport. Some of us find our stride
without much effort; a few=
 of us are even born ready to canter. But lots of us
stumble along from day=
 to day like we had two left feet, trying in vain to
intellectualize our wa=
y through life when what all that life asks of us is that
we let our prana =
do our walking forus.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0
Prana is the energy that drives life,=
 the power that animates the body,
enlivens the mind, spurs the soul. Prana=
 is life's inspiration, its foundation,
its tenacity; it is the sure hand o=
n the tiller, the wise voice of good
counsel, the urge to health and harmon=
y that craves to turn our bodies into
havens where we can take shelter from=
 the storms of the hectic modern world.
Prana is at work at every instant i=
n every cell of every living organism,
seeking ever to deliver us from dise=
ase and confirm us in health, but only in
those few people who are genetica=
lly fated to be healthy does prana
automatically regulate its momentum. The=
 rest of us must learn how to cultivate
our prana.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0
Pranayam=
a, the "control" or "regulation" of prana,
is a central principle of many o=
f the varieties of yoga that ancient India produced.
Good prana management =
is essential for those who seek to follow the path of
Ashtanga Yoga, the "e=
ight-limbed" yoga of personal development that
the ancient seer Patanjali s=
ystematized. Patanjali, who taught that "yoga
is restraint of the fluctuati=
ons of the mind" (yogas chitta vritti
nirodhah), sought to restrain those f=
luctuations by restraining the breath,
which can when performed with care c=
ultivate prana admirably. Unfortunately, ever
since Patanjali many unwary s=
tudents and teachers of yoga have equated
pranayama with prolonged, forcibl=
e holding of the breath, which can actually
ruin the body.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0
=
Wise pranayama begins with observation. When moving your body, how often
do=
 you ponder what causes your body to move? When exercising, do you exercise=

your muscles alone, or also the force that drives them? Do you limit yours=
elf
to the physical posture when you perform an asana, or do you perform it=

energetically as well? A good first step to effective prana stewardship is=
 to
alert yourself to your energy posture, your habits of holding and utili=
zing
your energy.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0
Understand your natural affinity with pra=
na and you gain insight into
which method of prana cultivation will work mo=
st efficiently and effortlessly
for you. Sound prana handling is methodical=
, and the rishis, India's seers
who spent their long lives poring over the =
many facets of the paradox that is
life, proposed an variety of methods to =
encourage prana to adopt an suitable
pace. They advised at the outset that =
we use the principles of Ayurveda, India's
life-science, to balance vata, p=
itta and kapha, the three energy strategies of
embodied beings. These Three=
 Doshas encourage ailments when they are permitted
to struggle with one ano=
ther, and work to support the organism when taught to
cooperate. When the T=
hree Doshas strive toward amity they serve to strengthen
agni, or tejas, th=
e fire of transformation that permits us to feed and nourish
ourselves. Str=
ong fire digests cleanly the prana that we consume through our
breath and t=
hrough our food, and strong agni and prana facilitate the
development of oj=
as, the pure "juice" that makes living worthwhile by
cementing together bod=
y, mind and spirit and fueling immunity from illness.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0
Stron=
g tejas and ojas in a body provide prana a good seat (asana) there.
Well-se=
ated prana provides us the visceral resolve we need to perform our every
ac=
tion precisely, rightly, with great resolve and enthusiasm. Such a body mov=
es
not from obligation but from the joy of movement that is prana's nature.=

Well-seated prana enhances immeasurably our ability to perform any yoga po=
sture
(asana). As prana becomes carefully settled through the practice of a=
sana our
bodies become fit for pranayama, which can promote control of the =
senses and
the mind. Breath, prana and mind are mutually and inherently rel=
ated; cultivate
one well and the other two will fall into line. While many =
yogis do use
breathing exercises to cultivate prana and mind, others use me=
ditation to
regulate the breath and prana. Some practice Svara Yoga, contro=
l of prana and
mind by means of song, and some align breath, prana and mind=
 by means of
undiluted devotion to Divinity.

=A0

=A0=A0=A0
Devotion may b=
e the supreme method for prana control, just as faith is
the supreme remedy=
 for disease. Strong faith can turn any placebo into an
effective medicine =
as surely as doubt can render ineffectual the most powerful
of remedies. Wh=
ile implicit devotion to Reality can compensate for
misalignments in yoga p=
ractice, no quantum of technical proficiency in asana
will suffice to restr=
ain the mind's fluctuations when that mind is plagued by
doubt. Devote your=
self to knowing and cultivating your prana, and your every
capillary will s=
oon swell with the exhilaration of genuine vitality. Learn to
pace your pra=
na, and your body and mind will automatically fall into step.
Dedicate your=
 yoga practice to facilitating and enhancing prana's glide through
your bei=
ng, and gradually your own prana will start to direct your yoga
practice. T=
reat prana with due respect, and you will find yourself squarely in
the cen=
ter of life's flow.
