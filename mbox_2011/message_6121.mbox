Respected Bhagawataas,


1) I have heard tales of few hanuman devotees turn=
ing into ape. Is it truth or fiction? Does one need to keep any caution or =
follow rules while praying Lord Hanuman. 

2) There is a priest in a temple=
 in Mumbai who claims that divine energy enters his body every evening. He =
starts dancing till blood oozes of his mouth and nose. Just like people get=
 possessed with ghosts is there something like divine energy entering a bod=
y. Is there any truth to this or just fake? 

Thanks and regards,

Priya
