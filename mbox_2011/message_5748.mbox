 Man creates trouble and misery for himself. Give up all sorts of fears.
St=
and up like a lion. Draw courage from within. There are many people who
are=
 so timid that they will not move around at night. Even when they see a
cat=
 at night, they tremble. What a shame.

They are embodiments of timidity. T=
hey are `moustache ladies'.There are some
sanyasins (monks) who repeat: "SH=
IVOHAM SHIVOHAM" ("I am Siva") - but they
tremble with fear when they are p=
ut to a little test. They perspire and
quiver when there is any impending d=
anger!

They are poor, miserable specimens. I always say that a dacoit can =
become a
good Vedantin if his energy is turned in a spiritual direction, be=
cause he
is absolutely fearless and has no deha adhyasa, (feeling "I am the=
 body");
but not a timid man.

Fearlessness is the greatest qualification f=
or a spiritual aspirant. All
fears are imaginary. They have no real basis. =
When you think seriously they
will melt away like snow before the sun. Thin=
k a tiger or a lion has come in
front of you, and you will have to face it.=
 Think that you are placed in
front of a machine gun, and that you will be =
blown up right now. Draw
courage now. Think of the verses of the second cha=
pter of the Bhagavad Gita.
They deal with the immortality of the soul. Agai=
n and again think of the
divine verses of the Avadhut Gita. You will become=
 courageous - though
perhaps not all at once. Gradually you will find that =
you are gaining
courage.

Constantly think that you are the Atman, the Self=
. You will gradually
develop great courage. Worry and fear are fearful forc=
es within us. They
poison the sources of life; they destroy all harmony, vi=
tality and
vigour. Thoughts
of cheerfulness, joy, and courage are healing a=
nd soothing. Always be
cheerful. Always laugh and smile.

Just as darkness =
cannot exist in the presence of light, so also fear cannot
exist in the pre=
sence of self-denial or self-realisation or courage. Exhibit
undaunted spir=
it, intrepidity and manliness. Make a strong resolve: "I will
die or realis=
e the Self". Give up the idea that you are the body.
Fearlessness is one im=
portant sign of a liberated being.
