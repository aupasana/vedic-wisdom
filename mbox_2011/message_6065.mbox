Namaste,

Thanks for sharing this information.

For those who may be wonder=
ing what "Audumbar" means in other regional languages 
in India....it is "u=
mber" in Marathi, "goolar" in Hindi, "paidi" in Telugu etc.

http://www.flo=
wersofindia.net/catalog/slides/Goolar.html

1) Does anyone have any recomme=
ndation about a good English Translation of Sri 
Guru Charitra? There are v=
arious translations available online e.g.

http://saidarbar.org/books/ShriG=
uruCharitra.pdf

but it would be helpful if someone could recommend a book.=


2) What are the rules for reading this book? (or for that matter any holy=
 book?) 
e.g read it completely in 7 days, no stopping in the middle of a c=
hapter etc. 
And in today's context how do you reconcile some of these inju=
nctions e.g. 
keeping the book on raised platform while reading etc.  when =
e-copies of these 
books are available and are stored and read on laptops, =
notebooks etc with 
everything else. 


I understand that the general idea =
is to read them with respect and reverence.

Thanks,
Chandraprakash

Namaste,
 
A=
udumbar represents Dattatreya and his incarnations - Sripada ShriVallabha, =
 Sri 
Narasimha Saraswati etc. Lighting a lamp under an Audumbar with devot=
ion is a 
good thing to do and if done regularly can help a person in diffe=
rent 
ways. Otherwise do a pradakshina of the tree whenever you see one. Th=
e Guru 
Charitra mentions more details about Audumbar. 

 
All trees and pl=
ants, specially certain kinds of trees, have a certain energy in 
them. An =
old tree often becomes the residence of certain ethereal 
energies/being. T=
his is more in case of Audumbar and Peepal. 

 
Astrologically Audumbar is =
representative of Venus while Peepal represents 
Jupiter. When you circle a=
n Audumbar with devotion, and do it on regular basis, 
some of the energy r=
ubs off into you and creates a harmonious effect. Venus and 
Jupiter are th=
e two representatives of Gurus. 

 
Doing a homa under an Audumbar or Peepa=
l has immediate effects, but don't try 
this untill you have done sufficien=
t number of homas inside your home. 

 
-Regards
 Rajarshi
