Jai Maa Durge.

Rajarshiji,

Again, My two cents with my own humble underst=
anding:

It is not their identity that you see, it is the identity which we=
 have
been exposed to since ages. Just an analogy, Tendulkar may actually b=
e a
great father at home but we only saw the perceivable cricketer aspect o=
f
him as it is known to your outside world which dwells on popularity or a
=
pronounced thing. Kali is dreadful Goddess to many who see her physical
asp=
ect but I did see many homes in Kolkata praying her as family Goddess.
All =
experiences are PERSONAL in nature between us and the deity and can be
abst=
ract from a different view point.

Our Subjective experience is based on de=
nsity of  Karmas and the associated
Vasanas accumulated over several births=
 coupled with your present life
(Intensity of it depends on several variabl=
es in/out of our control)
Sadhana. Mother will reveal the respective band o=
f her spectrum as you
progress further using your free will carefully is my=
 view exactly as your
physical mother knows when you feel hungry and not in=
 right frame of mind
etc etc.(Though over simplified a bit)

In general we =
all wish to pursue sadhana with a thought that she is not
very far away and=
 we indeed have a chance to reach her or abide by her.

I'm an ant at the f=
oot hills of a mountain and cannot talk about a glorious
mountain like "Sri=
 Lalitha Devi". I worship the Durga energies of her when
I go on the karmic=
 field and worship her play as Lalitha when I enjoy the
bhoga(healthy body,=
Mind,Intellect and Materials) she gave me unasked.

I would not want to arg=
ue but you will find many such ugra names in
"Gayathri Sahasranaam" too.

T=
his synergistic concept of the Divine Mother was pursued in the sacred
lite=
rature on Mother worship
across many centuries. In the Devi Mahatmya we fin=
d the Divine Mother as
the most beautiful, benevolent,and
tranquil=E2=80=94=

5=E2=80=94but at the same
time the
most terrible, whenever required. Thus, =
the Divine Mother assumes all the
characteristics at one time:the wisdom an=
d spiritual intellect of
Saraswati, the redeeming spirit of Durga, the weal=
th, splendour,and
cornucopia of Lakshmi or Sri, and the terribleface of Kal=
i or Gouri.

is dicey and I am almost sure the standard principles are incor=

have <br>made them out to be. They bestow different aspects of Supreme Know=

<br><br>If you had the same experience with another mahavidya, it is possib=

your mind can visualize and perceive =
an Ugra Devata in a truly fierce <br>form and yet feel deep love and surren=
