Namaste Narasimha,


Many thanks for making it all clear, its very fine, bu=
t extremely important. summarizing for myself
1. The difference between dig=
ging and digging for water.
2. Its a internal process/progression of person=
 thats makes him feel comfortable at a point. 
3. In any case stick to one =
main mantra/diety.

* * *

It is my good fortune to hear the brilliant insi=
ght of my chart. my sincere regards to you and narayani for this insight.

=
Ram in ascetic form during vanvas, i can relate to this feeling from inside=
. I will generate the HanumadBhava for Rama form of narayana. 

Interesting=
ly since my childhood i have seen only tuesday hanuman puja since my grandf=
ather home.

- How to address Debiliated moon in scorpio, it does affect my=
 mood a lot. also since Rahu is in my first house.


* * *

- How has been =
your experience with khadagmala strotra?
- How is Tripura sundari (tantric =
form of parvari/gouri), different if at all from her Vedic form?
- Since kh=
adagmala comes under tantra, does it mean we are praying to tamasic form of=
 devi (equivalent of chandi)?



regards
priyank
