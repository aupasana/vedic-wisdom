THE SWAMI            How are you getting on with your spiritual
practices?
=

S                                          Maharaj,I  do not find enough
t=
ime for them. There is too much  work to do.

THE SWAMI           It is a m=
istake to think that Sadhana(spiritual 
exercises) cannot be

             =
                      practised for want of time.

                        =
           The real cause is the restlessness of
the mind. Work and worship=


                                   must go hand in hand.It is very good
i=
f one can devote oneself

                                   solely to spir=
itual  practices. But 
how many can do it? Two

                           =
        types of men can sit still doing
nothing.One is the idiot, who is t=
oo

                                   dull to be active.The other is the
s=
aint who has gone beyond all

                                   activity. =
As the Gita says,"Without
performing work none can

                       =
           reach worklessness."One can attain
knowledge merely through the
=

                                   discipline of work.As we see, even
thos=
e who give up work and lead

                                   a retired l=
ife have to spend a good
deal of their time in putting up

                =
                   thatches,cooking food and doing other
things.

         =
                          Instead of working for yourself,work
for the sake=
 of the Lord.Know

                                   that all the work you=
 have to do is
Sri Ramakrishna's and Swami

                               =
   Vivekananda's.If you can work with this
idea your work will not

       =
                           bind you.On the other hand, it will
improve you =
in every way,

                                  spiritually,morally,intell=
ectually and
also physically. Offer your

                                 =
  body and soul at the feet of these
great teachers. Give yourself up

    =
                              wholly to them; be their servant and
tell the=
m,I give you my body,

                                   soul and all I ha=
ve.Do with them what
you will;I am ready to

                              =
     serve you to the best of my power.If
you can do this,the

            =
                       responsibility of your spiritual
welfare rests with =
them.You need not

                                   bother about yourself=
 any more.But you
should resign yourself in

                              =
     the right spirit.You should not do it
with a doubting heart taking the=


                                   name of God and at the same time
keepi=
ng your clothes untouched by

                                   water*.


=
*This reference is to Sri Ramakrishna's parable of  the milkmaid and the
Br=
ahmin priest. A milk-maid used to supply milk to a Brahmin priest
living on=
 the other side of a river.  Owing to the irregularities of
boat service,sh=
e could not deliver the milk punctually  every day.Once
being rebuked for h=
er delay the poor woman said,"What can I do,Sir?I
have to wait a long time =
for the boatman."The priest said,"Woman! People
cross the ocean of life by =
uttering the name of God, and canst thou not
cross this little river?"The  =
simple-hearted woman believed the
priest.And from the next day she began to=
 cross the  river uttering
God's name.One day the priest asked her why she =
was never late as
before. The woman replied,"I cross the river by uttering =
the name of the
Lord as you bade me do."The priest could not believe this, =
and wanted to
see himself how the woman crossed the river.The woman took hi=
m with her
and began to walk over the water repeating the name of the Lord.=
But
looking behind,she saw the priest following timidly,holding up his
clot=
hes."How is it,Sir,"she said,"you are uttering the name of the
Lord,but at =
the same time you are trying to keep your clothes untouched
by water?You do=
 not fully rely on the Lord."Complete resignation and
absolute faith in God=
 are at the root of all miracles.
