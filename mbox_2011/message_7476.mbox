=C2=A0Dear Rakesh,

The ChandiPath is a text which can bestow all the four =
aims of life as mentioned in scriptures - Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moskha. O=
ne who does a Chandipath thrice a day for a few years at leasts,=C2=A0 ends=
 up transforming himself completely from being an ordinary, average, limite=
d, frail human being to a 'god' of sorts. Our religion teaches the transfor=
mation of how a man becomes a god. Not G-d but god.

Strength, courage, con=
fidence, devotion, knowledge, application of special knowledge, authority (=
if one so desires it), power, wisdom, spiritual experiences, liberation, en=
lightenment etc - everything comes from this one text. It is a whole packag=
e.=C2=A0

Eventually you get what you crave for deep down. It is not too di=
fficult to master the text. Some effort, some patience and it can be done. =
Spend one hour daily practicing the text and in 3 months you can read it wh=
ole.

Best of luck.

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

PS: A small word of caution. =
Maybe not relevant right now, but if ever by Her will you become an accompl=
ished Chandi sadhaka in future then this will be of help. Don't ask for any=
thing when doing Her worship is an ideal situation. If you pray simply as y=
ou pray in any temple, then too there is not a problem. Praying with humili=
ty is never a problem. BUT if ever you try out kriyas with Chandi or do the=
 Chandipath to get xyz results in abc timeframe, (specially during complex =
forms of worship of Chandi like those involving charnel grounds), then be s=
ure that you know the precise and exact procedures. There are no half measu=
res in those. Nishkama worship in complex methods is fine, but desire for m=
aterial results without the knowledge of the procedures during complex ritu=
als in begging for trouble, whoever you might be.

 There are many more samput mantras for Chandi apart from what that documen=
t lists. Yes, the Chandi is a siddha text. Siddha in the sense of being "ac=
complished for Self realization" as well as "siddhis", depending on the inc=
