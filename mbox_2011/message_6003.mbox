For Pitri tarpan following restrictions are mentioned

There are some rest=
rictions. Tarpana with water containing sesame seeds (which is needed for p=
itris) should not be performed:
1. on a Sunday that has saptami tithi (7th =
day of the lunar fortnight),
2. on a Friday that has a nanda tithi (1st, 6t=
h and 11th tithis of the lunar fortnights),
3. on a Sunday with Moon in Bha=
rani, Krittika or Magha nakshatra, and,
4. on one's birthday.


Which are t=
he dates in 2011 that needs to be avoided for pitri tarpan (esp under point=
 3).


regards,
Akhaya
