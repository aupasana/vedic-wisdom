Namaste Akshay,

possible benefits.

I am reporducing interesting paragraph from Aghora-2 (K=
undalini). This is said by Vimalananda regrading the Samagri used for offer=
ing in Homam.

["The Choice of offerings in a Homa depends on the work, bot=
h spiritual and mundane, that you have for the fire to do. In the Homas i d=
o with my children we always offer clarified butter, barley, wheat, rice, s=
esame seeds, dry & fresh fruits, honey and sugar, combined together in a sp=
ecific proportion. All are sweet becuase we want the fire to give us mundan=
e prosperity as well as spiritual advancement"]

The above gives us a fair =
idea that generally sweet Items such as Sugar, Honey, Kishmish, fruits as w=
ell as Kurmura etc...are likely to provide good results in mundane matters.=

Narasimha Garu has earlier stated that White Til is very good for spiritua=
l progress while black til (sesame seeds) are good for good physical health=
. Kurmura are good for Financial gain..

So it is good to use mixure of all=
 these stuff if one wants to do spiritual progress along with material pros=
perity.
If one is dying to do spiritual progress, one should use White til =
alone and use Sopari, Coconut (which contains water inside).

Finally, abov=
e all, attitude of surrender is the main thing. this message is probably to=
o technical in nature. but wanted to give some ideas.

Best Reagrds,

Utpal=

Betel Nut) is one good item to offer as a Purnaahuti. Especially for those,=
 who are doing homam in close apartment with dry coconut pieces. Somebody s=
uggested me to offer it in Homam long back and since then I usually offer i=
