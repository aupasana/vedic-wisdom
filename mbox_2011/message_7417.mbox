Namaste,

I am in question whether "am i doing the right way of meditation"=
, sometimes even `am meditating aren't ?". Seems very tough for me to unlea=
rn the mind while meditating.Respected members please suggest any tips for =
efficacious way of mediation. Also wanted to understand how oneself will le=
arn that he/she is into good meditative state. 

Thank you,
Srini.
