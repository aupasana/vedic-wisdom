=A0Based on the tradition that is in vogue today, men perform all rituals a=
nd women just support them. In the old days, men performed enough spiritual=
 sadhana to uplift themselves and their wives too. A couple would operate a=
s one unit. These days, such strong bonding does not exist and men do not d=
o enough sadhana. Bottomline is that women cannot rely on men to uplift the=
m spiritually. Except in some rare cases, they are on their own. In my view=
, women are better off performing rituals like homam and tarpana by themsel=
ves. There is no injunction against it. Moreover, I believe it is more need=
ed now than ever!=C2=A0All the best!=C2=A0BTW, I am thankful for the respec=
t and trust that some people place in my views, but kindly do not address m=
e as Sir or Guru etc. Just addressing me as PVR or Narasimha is sufficient.=
