A
mother's search in post-tsunami Japan

by Miwa
Suzuki


ISHINOMAKI,
March 31, 2011 (AFP=
) - Thousands of families are missing loved ones almost
three weeks after a=
 powerful earthquake and tsunami devastated towns and lives
along Japan's n=
ortheast coast.

One of them
is the family of this AFP reporter.

This is t=
he
story of Takako Suzuki, 67, who is still searching for a sign of life fr=
om her
daughter, this reporter's sister, amid the ruins of the small fishin=
g port she
has called home all her life.

Every
evening Suzuki slips under =
the quilt of her futon shortly after sunset around
7:00 pm because there is=
 nothing to do in the pitch darkness. This district of
Ishinomaki still has=
 no electricity, tap water or gas.

"I
don't read newspapers, I don't liste=
n to the radio. They are talking about
horrible things," Suzuki, who has be=
en a widow for years, says as she
prepares to sleep on the second floor of =
her house.

"Why do
I have to know more when I've seen enough myself?"

She=
 wakes up
as the sun rises. She goes downstairs to clear rubble left by the=
 tsunami that
smashed into the ground floor on March 11 and heaped tragedy =
on this quiet town
in Miyagi prefecture.

It was a day
when in Miyagi a man=
 felt his mother's hand slip out of his tight grasp, three
children watched=
 their mother being washed away, and an elderly couple vanished
with their =
grandchild, their three bodies later found.

Suzuki
clears the debris insid=
e her house, which was hit by a wave that at this point
was two metres (six=
 feet) high, against the sound of a helicopter overhead that
is carrying aw=
ay newly retrieved bodies.

Mud covers
family photos and other keepsakes, a=
nd the smell of rotten seawater with fish
and kelp fills the air.

In the
n=
eighbourhood, overturned cars and ships lie scattered on the roads and in
o=
ther people's gardens. People walk under a car that is stuck between two
bu=
ildings like a bridge.

Suzuki's
most important mission is not to clear up =
rubble but to find her 41-year-old
daughter, who has been missing since the=
 day of the disaster.

Suzuki was
in the city of Sendai, some 60 kilometres=
 (37 miles) away from her home town,
when the 9.0-magnitude quake struck be=
neath the sea floor.

She managed
to return home on the afternoon of the fo=
llowing day, having shared a taxi from
Sendai to a place near Ishinomaki an=
d then walked through knee-deep water amid
floating bodies for seven hours.=


When she got
home, her daughter was not in the house they have shared.

"=
I
failed to die," Suzuki says as she ponders her pain.

Throwing
away her t=
atami mats, fridge, TV sets and furniture means nothing compared with
the a=
gony of searching for her daughter, she says.

Whenever she
spots earth-mov=
ing machinery clearing a mountain of rubble to the side of a
road, she trai=
ls it. "Please, please do it gently. My daughter may be in
there," she asks=
 the driver.

The body of
another, elderly woman was indeed found in the de=
bris of a nearby supermarket.

Many who are
searching for their loved ones =
have experienced the painful process of feeling
their hopes whittled down s=
lowly, day by day.

They
initially hope that the person is unhurt, then the=
y think he or she isn't home
or is at a shelter, or has been injured and ho=
spitalised.

After they
learn that the person's name is not on the lists of=
 inpatients at hospitals,
they are left with the hope the person is in a co=
ma and therefore cannot be
contacted. Finally, their wish becomes only to f=
ind the person's body.

Families
visit makeshift morgues to find the last t=
hing they want to see.

There are
lists of bodies, all numbered.

Some are
=
identified by the name on the papers they carried, others are anonymous and=

described only in sparse phrases such as "a female in her 30s. Height
abou=
t 160cm" or "about three years old".

When you
give the police the number o=
f the body you want to see, you are shown its
pictures.

If you think
it is=
 the person you are looking for, you are led into a hall where rows of
bodi=
es are laid out in plain-wood coffins or plastic bags, with the smell of
bu=
rning incense sticks in the air.

People weep
as they find a person they ha=
ve cared for dearly or shared their lives with,
now a stiff body with drenc=
hed hair, naked and in a blanket following their
autopsy.

In the
nearby to=
wn of Higashimatsushima, a young couple sits by a coffin, which seems
too b=
ig for their dead baby inside. They are in utter silence, staring vacantly
=
into space.

A line of
relatives passes another coffin, and one says to the=
 lifeless body inside:
"The way you held out is great!"

Identical
memos, h=
andwritten in large red letters, are left on two coffins lying side by
side=
.

The notes
read, "Please make sure the daughter is buried next to her mot=
her".
They are both signed by a man who has identified the corpses as those=
 of his
wife and daughter.

At a morgue
in Ishinomaki, photos of hundreds o=
f unidentified bodies are taped to big blue
tarpaulins, visible to all who =
come.

Families are
dumbstruck as they see images of faces that have turned=
 red or black. Most
bodies have their eyes closed, their mouths half open, =
and their wet hair
slicked back.

"You
were here, dad!," a middle-aged woma=
n says when she spots a man's picture,
dropping to her knees. "Welcome back=
, dad. Welcome back!", she
continues, stroking the picture.

As many of
the=
 victims are elderly, children are proving easier to find.

But pictures
of=
 some children have been flapping in the cold wind for days, raising the
wo=
rst fears about the fate of their parents.

"I was
very scared to see the b=
odies initially, but I needed to get used to it,"
Suzuki says, steeling her=
self for another grim search.

She cannot
erase from her mind the sight of =
recovered bodies she saw at the town hall near
her house, among them small =
brothers still hugging each other, and a mother
clutching her child to her =
breast in a mortal embrace.

"I was
born and grew up by the sea," says Suzu=
ki, "but I don't want to see
the ocean any more."
