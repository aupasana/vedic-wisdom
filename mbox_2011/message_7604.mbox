Numerology have been bestowed on us to resolve the problems of an individua=
l. The persons who have a lucky name number are luckier than those who are =
born on a lucky date. If the name is not appropriate, even those who are bo=
rn on a lucky date may not enjoy the benefits of the lucky birth number. Nu=
mbers and l...etters are considered to be the two eyes of human beings. The=
 way of nature is that if things are done in the right way at the right tim=
e, success will be assured.

Life has a number of problems to face. Such pr=
oblems can be resolved with the help of numerology. Numerology indicates th=
e various ways in which problems of life can be resolved. It is a science o=
f rare powers. Every letter has a sound and therefore a name emits sound vi=
brations. All the beneficiaries considered this science as an excellent too=
l for awakening the masses and lead them to success with a slight alteratio=
n in the spellings of their names.

Numerology can be used to uplift people=
 from poverty to prosperity. Highly beneficial results can be achieved by a=
 slight correction of name. Several incurable diseases can be cured through=
 the science of numerology. Change of names produce definite and speedy rec=
overy from ailments. Life will become more successful when they change thei=
r names to a lucky name. As we cannot change the date of birth , we add or =
subtract alphabets from the name to match the vibrations of birth date so t=
hat all positive things should happen in life.
.
How does numerology work? =
Basically, it analyzes and uses the combinations of the letters in your nam=
e and the date on which you were born to give clues as to your character, s=
trengths and weaknesses, natural talents, motivations and life purpose. Num=
orology help to get back on track and move in the direction you were born t=
o take. By making simple changes in your life that are more in line with yo=
ur numerology chart you may be pleasantly surpised at how everything seems =
to improve, things fall naturally into place and you find the happiness you=
 have been seeking.

Business names determine the success or failure of the=
 business, the best date to register the business and can guide when hiring=
 staff members in a business environment to ascertain what you can expect f=
rom that person, how they will work together and the results they will give=
 you.

The main idea of numerology services is that it these services help =
to influence people towards the positive and strong traits rather than nega=
tive or weak traits. Numerology deals with the calculation of the future wi=
th the help of numbers catering basically to all the individuals having a d=
esire of reaching to the peak. It also deals with realistic use of the basi=
c laws of arithmetic to the material survival of man. Fundamentally numerol=
ogy deals with the nine major planets and their planetary positions and cha=
racteristic features. When number is in harmony with the number of any othe=
r person, the client will experience a harmonious relationship with that pe=
rson.

When a person uses vehicles like car, or motorcycle with lucky numbe=
rs and lucky colours, such numbers and colours prevent possible acciedents.=
 Numerology is used to determine a person's personality, strengths and tale=
nts, obstacles to be overcome, inner needs, emotional reactions and ways of=
 dealing with others. If we use the art of numerology wisely and accordingl=
y, we can channel the powerful vibrations that are universally emitted by t=
he creation of numbers and can be put into a form to which can understand. =
Thus the numbers will guide you successfully through life.

-The top most p=
olitical leaders, who could the destiny of their nations, take advice from =
Numerologists enquire about their own destiny. It is matter of great intere=
st that during the Second World War, Hitler used to consult his Numerologis=
t on many occasions. However, when the Numerologist found that after gettin=
g repeated success in battles, Hitler has started ignoring his hints, he st=
opper serving him.. He then approached the British Prime Minister Mr. Winst=
on Churchill who consulted the Numerologist till the end of the war. It is =
said that the great Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte used to spell his name as Na=
poleone Buonapart. But on the advice of a Numerologist he omitted the lette=
rs 'E' and 'U' from his name and heightened the power of his personality, a=
nd became the Emperor.-

The name is not just a name but also a form of cos=
mic energy. It reflects the goals, talents, lessons and debts, in essence, =
the reasons for being here. Logically. When you practise your name, your na=
me vibrations are activated and reach out to the person/persons you are tal=
king to. Having a correct personal and Business name based on numerology re=
leases positive cosmic energy, thus providing you with growth and enhancing=
 success.

NUMBER 13:

The number 13 brings the test, the suffering and the=
 death. This number brings the bad luck or the misfortune.
13 may surface i=
n the life to see problems in everything.
For an examples:
In many countrie=
s, there is no gate 13 in any airport, instead there is a gate 12B. Many ho=
tels do not have room number 13. Some airplanes skip a row 13, going straig=
ht from 12 to 14. Many tall buildings have resorted to skipping the "thirte=
enth floor", either by numbering it "14" or as "12". Some streets do not co=
ntain a house number 13. In some forms of motor sport, for example Formula =
One, there is no number 13 car. Getting married on any day of the week that=
 falls under number 13 is highly discouraged. In the Egypt Tarot Cards ther=
e is a picture number 13, which symbolises `Death'.
