Namaste:

A detailed answer for your question can be found in this link:
ht=
tp://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/miscellaneous/testingsixthsense/ca=
ndle-lamp/step6.php

To summarize:

Candle Light: In the case of a candle t=
he fuel is generally paraffin wax
(which is a by-product of petroleum), whi=
ch is primarily tama-raja
predominant and hence it emits tama and raja-tama=
 frequencies. As a result,
it also attracts similar frequencies from the en=
vironment. This does not
have a beneficial effect on the immediate environm=
ent and is least conducive
to attract any divine principle.

Ghee: Clarifie=
d butter has a predominance of the sattva component in it and
hence the fla=
me generated by burning it emits sattvik frequencies. Due to
the predominan=
ce of sattva component in the flame, it attracts and emits
divine conscious=
ness and one gets the experience of purity in the
environment.

Sesame seed=
 oil: The frequencies emitted would have been a combination of
sattva and r=
aja frequencies.

Regards,
Hemanth
