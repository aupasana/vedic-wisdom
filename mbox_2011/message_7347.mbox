 Believe in the self. Draw power from within. Dive deep into the source and=

come back quite refreshed and invigorated. Have unshakable faith that
noth=
ing can ever overpower these. Chant Om Om Om when gloom tries to
overpower =
these. Rejoice in thy own self. Have contentment in thy own self.
Never see=
k happiness from outside.

A timid man is unfit for the attainment of Self-=
realisation. Have no
attachment for this mortal body of flesh and bone. Cas=
t if off like slough,
just as the snake throws away its skin. Be prepared t=
o give up the body at
any moment. Make a strong resolve: I will die or real=
ise the self.

Do not lose heart when you are in adverse circumstances. Bec=
ome a real hero
and fight your enemies within - the mind, indriyas (senses)=
, vasanas
(tendencies), samskaras (mental impressions) and trisnas (craving=
s) which
have robbed you of your atmic jewel. The spiritual battlefield dem=
ands great
valour, patience, perseverance, strength, courage and skill. Tem=
ptations
will manifest without a moment's notice - you will be bewildered. =
There may
be no time to detect them, so always be on the alert.

You came a=
lone, naked and weeping. You will go alone, naked and weeping.
Then why are=
 you proud of your false wealth and false knowledge? Become
humble, meek. Y=
ou will conquer the world with humility. Become pure in
thought, word and d=
eed. This is the secret of spiritual life.

Birth and death, bondage and fr=
eedom, pleasure and pain, gain and loss - all
are mental creations. Transce=
nd the pairs of opposites. You were never born;
you will never die. Thou ar=
t the immortal Self always. Thou art ever free in
the three periods of time=
. It is the physical body that comes and goes. The
Self is all-full, all-pe=
rvading, infinite and part-less.

Recognise that you are the living truth, =
that you are inseparable from that
one essence, the substratum of all these=
 illusory names and forms, these
false, shadowy appearances. Get firmly est=
ablished in Brahman. Now you are
invulnerable.

Rely on your own self, your=
 inner spiritual strength. Do not depend on
money, friends or anyone. Frien=
ds, when put to the test, will desert you.
Lord Buddha never even trusted h=
is own disciples. Become absolutely free.
