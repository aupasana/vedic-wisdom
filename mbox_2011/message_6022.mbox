Hello,

Any form of spiritual sadhana will bring only good results, leave a=
side all doubts and worry.

Read Ch 6 from Autobiography of a yogi - Paramh=
ansa Yogananda
http://www.ananda.org/autobiography/#chap16

I moral i learn=
t form that chapter is that wahtever issue/suffering/event is written in yo=
ur karma will futify when times comes, but depending on your sadhana or you=
r gurus grace the intensity and time period of that event will be shortened=
. 

In simple word if its written in your karma that a tiger will bite you,=
 because of your sadhana maybe a rat or ant will bite you. :)

regards
