You are not treading the path of the Vedas as Mandana, Misra did. He was an=
 ideal householder who knew the four Vedas, who was devoted to his elders, =
who walked in the footsteps of ideal grihasthas like Yajnavalkya and others=
. Even he took sannyasa!

What are you doing? In the name of duty you are l=
eading a servile life, cheating others all the twenty-four hours of the day=
. Your days are too short. You want thirty hours in a day so that you may e=
arn money by unnatural means, lead a reckless life addicted to wine, woman,=
 cinema, liquor, etc. Do you call this life? O atheist! You want to fill yo=
ur pocket and stomach and that of your relations! You want to move about in=
 cars, eat in hotels, attend cinemas and nautch-parties! Do you call this l=
ife? I call this suicide, blinded by ignorance!
