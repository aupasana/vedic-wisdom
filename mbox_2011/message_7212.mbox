Actually, take nobody's words as "final words". Only god c=

If one is experi=
encing material setbacks while doing homam, there are a few possibilities: =

=C2=A0 
(1) Very likely, one is carrying really serious karmas and was des=
tined to experience the setbacks during that period anyway. Homam (or other=
 sadhana) made it better, though one has no way of confirming it. 
=C2=A0 
=
(2) One is using some wrong materials, e.g. black pepper, mustard seeds, ch=
illies etc. It could also be correct materials, but with corrption, e.g. so=
me sesame seeds or grains with dirt in them, coconut/wood with insects in t=
hem, etc. If one is doing a sattwik homam for spiritual progress, these thi=
ngs are tolerated. But, if one is doing with some desires and expectations =
(conscious/sub-conscious), then material errors can have material consequen=
ces. This is why I keep emphasizing on devotion, surrender etc. With surren=
der and devotion, material errors lose their significance. 
=C2=A0 
(3) Dei=
ty is coming close to a person and testing the person's faith thoroughly. I=
f this is the case, there can be serious problems, but the person's life is=
 transformed after the person succeeds in keeping the faith. 
=C2=A0 
If on=
e cannot withstand the testing, one can consider a different deity. As poin=
ted out earlier and below, Ganapathi homam is one ritual that balances the =
material and spiritual needs. One makes spiritual progress without destabil=
izing the material life. For most people, Ganapathi homam is appropriate fo=
r atleast a few months in the beginning.

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Hi Priya, 

Note - giving my 2 cents since similar thing ha=
ppened to me also. I am also waiting PVRs reply. In any case take his words=
 as final words. 

Similar kind of unfortunate thing happened to me also af=
ter doing 21 vishnu sahastranaam homam. 

I strongly believe that getting i=
nspired by PVR we have in a way jump started the spiritual side by doing ho=
mams. (They are powerful) PVR had already lot of sadhana (i believe for 4-5=
yrs) before he met his guru and started with homams. 

Noone knows the exac=
t theory and i beleive that such things are not in ones chart also. Even i =
was worried like you to get my chart analysed and know the reason but 3-4 a=
strologers couldnt tell me the reason. i came to understand that chart is a=
 map not a territory. 

PVR also has mentioned that its better if people do=
 Ganapti homam for first 2-3 months. I will request PVR to add this informa=
tion in each and every manual and also to suggest some non homam sadhana of=
 ganapati so that people who are eager to start their journey can have a be=
autiful start to their sadhana. 

Priya, you can stop the homams and get co=
nfortable and confident first. Dont attach any guilt to not doing homams. N=
o god is out there to punish you, its just that karmas are extremely comple=
x. Its better to start with ganapati to remove all obstacles first. 

I can=
 strongly suggest few ganapati sadhana. 

1. Ganapati Homam 
(This is no do=
ubt very powerful and i suggest this one for everyone but for al those who =
for any reason cant do homam, please start sincerely with some non-homam sa=
dhana) 

2. Ganapati tarpan 
Use ganapati mool mantra 444 times for 40 days=
. (takes around 40min) 
ॐ श्रीं ह=
्रीं क्लीं ग=
381;लौं गं गणपतय=
;े वर वरद सर्व&=
#2332;नं मे वशमान=
51; स्वाहा॥ add "tarpayami" after=
 swaha 
http://gurujiamrita.tripod.com/mahaganapathy_tarpanam.htm

3. Varia=
tions in Ganapti tarpan 
a. Instead of turmeric mound in the sadhana listed=
 above you can keep ganapti yantra also. 
b. I simply chooze to visualise g=
anapati and either i visualise washing his feet or simple focusing on mantr=
a. 
c. As PVR has said many times before that sincerity and devotion are th=
e key and not the technicalities. 

4. I am on 30th day of this ganapti tar=
pan sadhana and i can vouch for a wonderful clarity and good results.
