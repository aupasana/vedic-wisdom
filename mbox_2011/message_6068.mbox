Hello,

It is confusing because we usually think that these two are contrad=
ictory properties of God. But I feel that these two are different and co-ex=
isting properties of God.

When we talk about a coin. we say that this is a=
 coin of such and such denomination. It has a head and tail. when we go dee=
per we get to know that coin is all made of nickel. it is insignificant to =
know whether it has head or tail. important is that it is all nickel. When =
we go further deep we realise that there is nothing but protons and electro=
ns and neutrons. And these are the same protons/electrons and neutrons whic=
h make whole universe.

When we think as head and tail, at this stage we ar=
e just introduced to a deity. We see His form keep faith on His form. When =
we go deeper we realise that This deity fills whole universe and this whole=
 universe is accomodated by the deity. This stage resembles to the stage wh=
ere we see coin as a piece of nickel. When we further go deeper, we realise=
 that the deity is nothing but manifestation of that nirvikar brahma. And t=
his Nirvikar brahma is the one who fills all the universe and all the deiti=
es are manifestation of that Nirvikar brahma alone. At this stage one under=
stand that there is no difference between these deities.

You can think of =
different deities as coins of different currencies/countries. Coin of any c=
ountry can be used to buy clothes/food etc and all of them are as valuable.=
 all of them are made of different alloys/metals. But all of them are made =
of same protons/electrons and neutrons.

These three different properties a=
re not same contradicting properties. But they are all three different prop=
erties. Same coin have head and tail. Same coin is made of nickel and same =
coin is made of neutrons etc. So these are not confusing but well explainin=
g I think.

Sorry if I confused you further. I usually do so. In short I ca=
n say that Duality and Non-duality these should not be confused as contradi=
ctory. but they are two different properties of same god.

Sorry for the mi=
stakes

Deep regards
with the grace of Lord krishna
