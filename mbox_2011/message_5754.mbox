 A boy of about 18 years of age came here on a cycle from some place. After=

sitting in the hall for a quarter of an hour, he went to Bhagavan and aske=
d,
=E2=80=9CAfter crossing Omkar, where to merge?=E2=80=9D

With a smile Bh=
agavan said, =E2=80=9COh, is that so? Wherefrom did you come now?
Where wil=
l you go? What is it you want to know? Who really are you? If you
first tel=
l me who you are, you can then question me about Omkar.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CI=
 do not
know that even,=E2=80=9D said the boy. Then Bhagavan said, =E2=80=
=9CYou know for certain
that you are existent. How are you existent? Where =
really were you before?
What exactly is your body? First find that out. Whe=
n you know all that, you
can ask me questions if you still have any doubts.=


Why should we worry where Omkar merges, and after it merges why worry
abo=
ut what comes next, when it ceases to exist? Where do you merge
ultimately?=
 How do you come back? If you first find out your state and your
movements,=
 we can think of the rest.=E2=80=9D

When Bhagavan said all this, the boy c=
ould not give any reply and so went
away after bowing before Bhagavan.What =
other brahmasthram (divine weapon) is
there against a questioner? If only t=
hat weapon is used, the questioner is
silenced.

Two or three years back, w=
hen a sannyasi boasted about having read all books
on religious matters and=
 began asking Bhagavan all sorts of questions, he
repeatedly gave the same =
answer, =E2=80=9CFind out who you are.=E2=80=9D When the sannyasi
persisted=
 in his meaningless questions and arguments, Bhagavan in a firm
tone asked =
him, =E2=80=9CYou have been asking me so many questions and entering into
s=
o many arguments. Why don=E2=80=99t you reply to my questions and then argu=
e? Who
you are? First answer my question. Then I will give you a suitable r=
eply.
Tell me first who it is that is arguing.=E2=80=9D He could not reply,=
 and so went
away.

Some time later, I developed this idea and wrote five v=
erses on =E2=80=98Divya
Asthram=E2=80=99 and showed them to Bhagavan,when h=
e said, =E2=80=9CLong ago when Nayana
(Ganapati Muni) was here, Kapali also=
 used to be here. If they wanted to ask
me anything, they would fold their =
hands first and say, =E2=80=98Swami,Swami, if you
will promise not to brand=
ish your brahmasthram,I will ask a question.=E2=80=99 If
during conversatio=
n the words =E2=80=98Who are you?=E2=80=99 escaped my lips, he used to
say,=
 =E2=80=98So you have fired your brahmasthram. What more can I say?=E2=80=
=99 They called
it brahmasthram and you are calling it =E2=80=98Divya Asthr=
am=E2=80=99.=E2=80=9D After that, I too
started using the word brahmasthram=
. Really, who is not humbled by that
asthram?
