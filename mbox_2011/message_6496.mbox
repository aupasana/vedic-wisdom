Rishi Jabali says in his Smriti: =E2=80=9CThe difference between a househol=
der Brahmana who is learned in the four Vedas, who is a performer of Soma-Y=
aga, who has performed a hundred sacrifices, and a sannyasin who has renoun=
ced, is like that between a mustard seed and a mountain or between a glow w=
orm and the sun.=E2=80=9D

The Angiras-Smriti says: =E2=80=9CSixty families=
 of the past and sixty families of the future are raised to immortality by =
one Brahmana who utters the words, =E2=80=98sannyastam maya.=E2=80=99 Sins =
acquired through family, sins acquired through karma, are all burnt up by t=
he fire of sannyasa, even as a straw is burnt by forest fire.=E2=80=9D

It =
is told in the Mahabharata: =E2=80=9CEven if a person wears merely the ochr=
e robe, he is fit to be worshipped.=E2=80=9D Such is the glory of sannyasa.=
