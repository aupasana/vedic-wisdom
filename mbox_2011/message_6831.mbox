Dear Kumar,

To perform homa to lalitaa-devii, you can use the mahalakshmii=
 manual
as a template, changing "mahA-lakShm' to "lalitaa-dev" everywhere. =
In
place of the dhyAna-shloka, use the dhyAna-shoka from the lalita
sahasra=
nama (sinduurAruNavigrahAm ...) For the pradhAna-homa, chant
each verse of =
the sahasranAma followed by an ahuti offering with
svAhA.

sasneham,

=A0 =
=A0ajit.
