Namaste,
=C2=A0
I have heard people say that India (an=
d some parts of SE Asia) is the "Karma Bhoomi", and America is considered a=
 "Bhoga Bhoomi", and as such even nithya karmas like Oupaasanam performed i=
n the USA are not valid.=C2=A0 Since Oupaasanam is the basis for many of th=
e sroutha and smatth karmas, those karmas, inlcuding Deva yajnas and pitru =
yajnas, are not valid outside of India.=C2=A0 Is this true?
=C2=A0
I am new=
 to this group and I tried my best to search for an answer to the above but=
 did not find one. There is a lot of good information in this group from ma=
ny learned and informed people. I would very much appreciate any clarificat=
on that anyone can provide.
