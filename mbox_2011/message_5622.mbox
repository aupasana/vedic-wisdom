"Does Hinduism Have a Future in America?"

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya=



One of the most important and thought-provoking articles ever written on=
 the future of Sanatana Dharma.


Excerpt:

"Like a broken record, Hindu pa=
rents, leaders, and activists bemoan the fact that we are losing our youth.=
 The solution to this very real problem is, however, deceptively simple. We=
 are losing our youth because they don't want to be like us. We have been w=
eak; we have been ashamed; we have been reactionary instead of proactive. A=
s a result, we have lost our youth's respect. 

To regain our children's re=
spect, let us become the examples of Hindu strength, Hindu courage, Hindu c=
onviction, Hindu intelligence, Hindu pride, and Hindu assertiveness that ou=
r children so yearn for us to be. Let us stand with dignity and pride, and =
not be afraid to proclaim to the world: 'I am a follower of Sanatana Dharma=
, the Eternal Natural Way, and a servant of the almighty Bhagavan (God)! Me=
in Hindu Hun!!'

And if we Hindus can learn to stand courageously in the fa=
ce of our many opponents, and serve as examples of strength to our children=
, I guarantee that our youth will follow our example =96 and more, they wil=
l far surpass it.

Long have we bemoaned the Americanization of Hindu youth=
. My prediction, however, is that in America, we will soon witness a verita=
ble army of these very same Americanized, savvy, cool, energized and very p=
ractically-minded Hindu youth coming back to Sanatana Dharma. And when they=
 do, they will be the vanguard of a new and truly American Hinduism that wi=
ll instantiate the very best of both worlds =96 bringing together the very =
best of the most ancient with the very best of the most cutting-edge.

Like=
 two wings of the same powerful eagle, Sanatana Dharma and the very best as=
pects of American culture must be coupled together in partnership if either=
 is going to have a meaningful future. If this can happen, not only will Sa=
natana Dharma have a future in America - Sanatana Dharma will be America's =
future!...."
