Dear Narasimha, pranaams

Yes, I do agree that the lives of great spiritual=
 personalities set an
example for us to follow. In that respect, your words=
 below are quite ok.

But ultimately, we must make our own path. Debating w=
hether one spiritual
personality is greater than another is like debating w=
hether one candle is
brighter than the other candle! Do we not realize ulti=
mately that all
candles burn with the same brightness regardless?

best reg=
ards
Hari
