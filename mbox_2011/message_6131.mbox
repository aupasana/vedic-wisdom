Former director of International School of Photonics, Cochin
University of Science and Technology and Emeritus scientist at Council
for Industrial and Scientific Research, V P N Nampoori is heading the
research wing of the Athirathram.

Studies will also be conducted on the implications on micro organisms
in the soil and variation in the yield from plants and animals, the
organisers said.

Physiological and psychological effects on human beings, especially
those who meditate and those who are under medication will be
assessed. Athirathrams were held at Kundoor in 1990 and
Kizhakkancherry in 2006 and more than five Somayagams were conducted
in different years at different sites.
