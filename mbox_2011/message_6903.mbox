 Ashtavakra Gita

Janaka said:

How is one to acquire knowledge? How is one=
 to attain liberation? And how is
one to reach dispassion? Tell me this, si=
r. 1.1

Ashtavakra said:

If you are seeking liberation, my son, avoid the =
objects of the senses like
poison and cultivate tolerance, sincerity, compa=
ssion, contentment, and
truthfulness as the antidote. 1.2

You do not consi=
st of any of the elements -- earth, water, fire, air, or
even ether. To be =
liberated, know yourself as consisting of consciousness,
the witness of the=
se. 1.3

If only you will remain resting in consciousness, seeing yourself =
as
distinct from the body, then even now you will become happy, peaceful an=
d
free from bonds. 1.4

You do not belong to the brahmin or any other caste=
, you are not at any
stage, nor are you anything that the eye can see. You =
are unattached and
formless, the witness of everything -- so be happy. 1.5
=

Righteousness and unrighteousness, pleasure and pain are purely of the min=
d
and are no concern of yours. You are neither the doer nor the reaper of t=
he
consequences, so you are always free. 1.6

You are the one witness of ev=
erything and are always completely free. The
cause of your bondage is that =
you see the witness as something other than
this. 1.7

Since you have been =
bitten by the black snake, the opinion about yourself
that "I am the doer,"=
 drink the antidote of faith in the fact that "I am not
the doer," and be h=
appy. 1.8

Burn down the forest of ignorance with the fire of the understan=
ding that "I
am the one pure awareness," and be happy and free from distres=
s. 1.9

That in which all this appears is imagined like the snake in a rope=
; that
joy, supreme joy, and awareness is what you are, so be happy. 1.10

=
If one thinks of oneself as free, one is free, and if one thinks of oneself=

as bound, one is bound. Here this saying is true, "Thinking makes it so."
=
1.11

Your real nature is as the one perfect, free, and actionless consciou=
sness,
the all-pervading witness -- unattached to anything, desireless and =
at
peace. It is from illusion that you seem to be involved in samsara. 1.12=


Meditate on yourself as motionless awareness, free from any dualism, givi=
ng
up the mistaken idea that you are just a derivative consciousness or
any=
thing external or internal. 1.13

You have long been trapped in the snare o=
f identification with the body.
Sever it with the knife of knowledge that "=
I am awareness," and be happy, my
son. 1.14

You are really unbound and act=
ionless, self-illuminating and spotless
already. The cause of your bondage =
is that you are still resorting to
stilling the mind. 1.15

All of this is =
really filled by you and strung out in you, for what you
consist of is pure=
 awareness -- so don't be small-minded. 1.16

You are unconditioned and cha=
ngeless, formless and immovable, unfathomable
awareness, unperturbable: so =
hold to nothing but consciousness. 1.17

Recognise that the apparent is unr=
eal, while the unmanifest is abiding.
Through this initiation into truth yo=
u will escape falling into unreality
again. 1.18

Just as a mirror exists e=
verywhere both within and apart from its reflected
images, so the Supreme L=
ord exists everywhere within and apart from this
body. 1.19

Just as one an=
d the same all-pervading space exists within and without a
jar, so the eter=
nal, everlasting God exists in the totality of things. 1.20


Janaka said:
=

Truly I am spotless and at peace, the awareness beyond natural causality.
=
All this time I have been afflicted by delusion. 2.1

As I alone give light=
 to this body, so I do to the world. As a result the
whole world is mine, o=
r alternatively nothing is. 2.2

So now that I have abandoned the body and =
everything else, by good fortune
my true self becomes apparent. 2.3

Waves,=
 foam, and bubbles do not differ from water. In the same way, all this
whic=
h has emanated from oneself is no other than oneself. 2.4

When you analyse=
 it, cloth is found to be just thread. In the same way, when
all this is an=
alysed it is found to be no other than oneself. 2.5

The sugar produced fro=
m the juice of the sugarcane is permeated throughout
with the same taste. I=
n the same way, all this, produced out of me, is
completely permeated with =
myself. 2.6

>From ignorance of oneself, the world appears, and by knowledge=
 of oneself it
appears no longer. From ignorance of the rope it appears to =
be a snake, and
by knowledge of it it does so no longer. 2.7

Shining is my=
 essential nature, and I am nothing other than that. When the
world shines =
forth, it is only me that is shining forth. 2.8

All this appears in me ima=
gined due to ignorance, just as a snake appears in
the rope, the mirage of =
water in the sunlight, and silver in mother of
pearl. 2.9

All this, which =
has originated out of me, is resolved back into me too, like
a jug back int=
o clay, a wave into water, and a bracelet into gold. 2.10

How wonderful I =
am! Glory to me, for whom there is no destruction, remaining
even beyond th=
e destruction of the world from Brahma down to the last clump
of grass. 2.1=
1

How wonderful I am! Glory to me, solitary even though with a body, neith=
er
going or coming anywhere, I who abide forever, filling all that is. 2.12=


How wonderful I am! Glory to me! There is no one so clever as me! I who h=
ave
borne all that is forever, without even touching it with my body! 2.13
=

How wonderful I am! Glory to me! I who possess nothing at all, or
alternat=
ively possess everything that speech and mind can refer to. 2.14

Knowledge=
, what is to be known, and the knower -- these three do not exist
in realit=
y. I am the spotless reality in which they appear because of
ignorance. 2.1=
5

Truly dualism is the root of suffering. There is no other remedy for it =
than
the realisation that all this that we see is unreal, and that I am the=
 one
stainless reality, consisting of consciousness. 2.16

I am pure awaren=
ess though through ignorance I have imagined myself to have
additional attr=
ibutes. By continually reflecting like this, my dwelling
place is in the Un=
imagined. 2.17

For me here is neither bondage nor liberation. The illusion=
 has lost its
basis and ceased. Truly all this exists in me, though ultimat=
ely it does not
even exist in me. 2.18

Recognising that all this and my bo=
dy too are nothing, while my true self is
nothing but pure consciousness, w=
hat is there left for the imagination to
work on now? 2.19

The body, heave=
n and hell, bondage and liberation, and fear too, all this is
pure imaginat=
ion. What is there left to do for me whose very nature is
consciousness? 2.=
20

I do not even see dualism in a crowd of people, so what do I gain if it=
 is
replaced by a desert? 2.21

I am not the body, nor is the body mine. I =
am not a living being. I am
consciousness. It was my thirst for living that=
 was my bondage. 2.22

Truly it is in the infinite ocean of myself, that, s=
timulated by the
colourful waves of the world, everything suddenly arises i=
n the wind of
consciousness. 2.23

In the infinite ocean of myself, the win=
d of thought subsides, and the world
boat of the living-being traders is wr=
ecked by lack of goods. 2.24

How wonderful it is that in the infinite ocea=
n of myself the waves of living
beings arise, collide, play, and disappear,=
 in accordance with their nature.
