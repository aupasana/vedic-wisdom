F.Y I.


a) For the one who has realized the true self o=
r ultimate ( I would say even -no 
need to realize completely, some thoroug=
h knowledge can make you understand the 
concept) - that "there is noting s=
o called impurity or amangala in world. its 
just the events or objects or =
roles created by the supreme to let the play of 
srushti to continue. And f=
or the creator of this world there is nothing that is 
separate from him. e=
verything in world resides in him and he is the shiva (the 
meaning of shiv=
a is "shubha" the elders sometimes bless as 'shivamastu' - just 
like that =
of 'shubhamastu" and the great lord is also called in his sahasranama 
as "=
shivaashrayaaya" he is the one in whom the shiva or shubha has ashraya or 
=
residence. ( i. e. by  going to his ashraya you get the shiva that is shubh=
a ). 
So there was nothing like any amangala that would have existed by his=
 presence 
in that yajna, but it was just that Daksha needed to learn some =
lesson hence 
supreme lord made him go high with his ahamkara and learn som=
e lesson out of it.

b) the so called bhuta ganas and rakshasas and devils =
also have their own role 
to play in this universe. they are also part of t=
his and not separate from it. 
more or less every being's lives are interwo=
ven with all such elements and 
energies. And biggest joke is that if ever =
we had realization of our all 
previous or future birth no doubts we would =
have also crossed by lives as bhuta 
/ ganas / devils or rakshasas... 

ii)=
 Pancha maha bhutas & ashta dikpalakas that you offer haviss are amshas ( a=
 
small portion) of him and not above or higher than him.

My friend, you have some weird notions. Agni permea=
tes the 14 worlds and 
is responsible for their smooth running. He can take=
 your offering 
anywhere and not just to "heaven". In homam/yajna, we make =
offerings to 
various beings living in various worlds. For example, in jaya=
di homam 
done at the end of various homas, we make offerings to pitris, pa=
rvatas, 
bhutas, samudras, yakshas etc.

Secondly, to one who sees Shiva as=
 the supreme being, Shiva does not 
"live in" one place, but he is the unde=
rlying reality of everything.

Though Shiva is depicted as living in smasha=
na (cemetary) with spirits, 
it has esoteric significance. I elaborated thi=
s in a Sanskrit shloka I 
composed just a few days back and you can read it=
, its meaning and 
commentary at that:

Parasara mentioned making offerings to Shiva in fire =
with "tryambakam 
yajaamahe" mantra (Mrityunjaya mantra) as a remedy to sev=
eral horoscopic 
problems!!

Vishnu Dharmottara Purana mentioned Rudra Yajn=
a. Agni Purana also 
mentioned Rudra homam. Mrityunjaya homam to Shiva with=
 Mrityunjaya 
mantra is also mentioned and popular in tradition.

In an=
y homam, the final offerings made are those to Vishnu and Rudra, 
irrespect=
ive of what homam it is. What Daksha did was to break the rules 
by doing a=
 "Nirishwara yajna". He was trying to insult Shiva and he paid 
for it. It =
is foolish to take his foolish act as an example to conclude 
that offering=
s should not be made to Shiva in fire.

If yo=
u think it is "absolute nonsense", please do not do it! Do homam to 
Ganapa=
thi, Lakshmi, Vishnu, Shiva, Krishna, Chandi etc. Pick somebody 
else. Or d=
on't do homam at all if you please.

BTW, I personally know people doing ho=
mam to Shiva and making brisk 
spiritual progress.

If you really want to "=
insult and reject" someone, you will be better 
off picking someone killing=
 and raping in the name of god or spreading 
intolerance and hatred in the =
name of god and religion. Or people 
engaging in so many worse evils on ear=
th today. Why target poor people 
worshipping Shiva in fire!

Just for the rec=
ord, I do not consider myself a guru. If someone 
voluntarily (and mentally=
) considers me a guru for the purpose of 
performing homam, I do not mind i=
t. However, my main role is not to be a 
guru, but to show people their gur=
u. Let me elaborate.

People who have access to a good external guru to giv=

spiritual progress, they may follow that guru. Otherwise=
, I am giving 
them access to a superb external guru who will remain on ear=
th in a 
physical form even after you and I leave - Agni (Fire), the origin=

preceptor, guru, priest and purohit of Veda! Invite Agni into your life=
 
as your guru and purohit and spend some sacred time with him everyday 
wi=
th reverence. He will transform you from the core and show the correct 
dir=
ection. I am not a guru, but I can show you a guru who can change you 
for =
better.

And, BTW, I do not sell ANYTHING. So don't worry about "falling pr=

marketing". Try homam if you want to and continue if you like it. 
P=
eriod. No strings attached.

In any homam, the final offerings made are those to Vi=
shnu and Rudra, <br>
irrespective of what homam it is. What Daksha did was =
to break the rules <br>
by doing a "Nirishwara yajna". He was trying to ins=
ult Shiva and he paid <br>
for it. It is foolish to take his foolish act as=
 an example to conclude <br>
that offerings should not be made to Shiva in =
fire.<br>

If you think it is "absolute nonsense", please do not do it! Do homam to=
 <br>
Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Vishnu, Shiva, Krishna, Chandi etc. Pick somebody=
 <br>
else. Or don't do homam at all if you please.<br>
<br>
BTW, I persona=
lly know people doing homam to Shiva and making brisk <br>
spiritual progre=
ss.<br>
<br>
If you really want to "insult and reject" someone, you will be=
 better <br>
off picking someone killing and raping in the name of god or s=
preading <br>
intolerance and hatred in the name of god and religion. Or pe=
ople <br>
engaging in so many worse evils on earth today. Why target poor p=
eople <br>
worshipping Shiva in fire!<br>

Just for the record, I do not consider myself a guru. If so=
meone <br>
voluntarily (and mentally) considers me a guru for the purpose o=
f <br>
performing homam, I do not mind it. However, my main role is not to =
be a <br>
guru, but to show people their guru. Let me elaborate.<br>
<br>
P=
eople who have access to a good external guru to give a push to one's <br>
=
spiritual progress, they may follow that guru. Otherwise, I am giving <br>
=
them access to a superb external guru who will remain on earth in a <br>
ph=
ysical form even after you and I leave - Agni (Fire), the original <br>
pre=
ceptor, guru, priest and purohit of Veda! Invite Agni into your life <br>
a=
s your guru and purohit and spend some sacred time with him everyday <br>
w=
ith reverence. He will transform you from the core and show the correct <br=
>
direction. I am not a guru, but I can show you a guru who can change you =
<br>
for better.<br>
<br>
And, BTW, I do not sell ANYTHING. So don't worry =
about "falling prey to <br>
marketing". Try homam if you want to and contin=
ue if you like it. <br>
Period. No strings attached.<br>
<br>
Best regards,=
