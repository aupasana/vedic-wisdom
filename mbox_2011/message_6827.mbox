Namaste,

I am not too much learned in this but putting my own opinions bas=
ed on the 
experience.

i) To decide whether its genuine Shivalingam or not=
: I would like to say that 
its not only shiva who is worshipped as lingam =
there are other dieties too which 
can be worshiped in the lingam form. In =
order to decide whether it belongs to 
any energy (or any deity) we can con=
clude it by asking to the ones who are 
spiritual to see and have their opi=
nion on it. The fool proof method would be to 
have prashanas for it (may b=
e jyotishya prashna or aroodha prashna or 
ashtamangala prashna as per stre=
ngth or belief of the people). And the further 
course will be guided in th=
e same prashna (i.e whether the temple etc should be 
built or not etc)

ii=
) about deciding if its Swayambhu Lingam :

every lingam that is found bene=
ath earth and whose origin is not known doesn't 
become swayambhu lingam. T=
he swayambhu lingams are ones which came to existence 
on its own and (i e =
which are not carved by human or any other creature). But 
still to confirm=
 whether the found one is swayambhu or not the above said 
prashnas or advi=
ce by spirituals can help.  




 Thanks & Regards,
Chetan

Dear Everyone, 
 
One of our fr=
iends, who are not really religious at all, are claiming that they 
found a=
 shiva lingam in their backyard here in michigan. I would like to ask the 
=
learned members of this forum, as to how to genuinely decide which is a rea=
l 
shivalingam versus just another stone of that shape! Does this have to b=
e given 
any significance at all? Can any such lingam found be called a Swa=
yambhu lingam 
and a temple be constructed at those places? Would any harm =
happen of nothing is 
done about it? Would like to know people's opinions o=
n this!
