It is better for you to throw off everything now itself and come off as a b=
eggar! Then alone you become the richest man! The Upanishad emphatically de=
clares: Yo vai bhuma tat sukham. =E2=80=9CYou cannot have real happiness in=
 this world!=E2=80=9D The real shanti, the peace which the mind is hankerin=
g after, is only in the Bhuma. Bhuma is unconditioned, beyond time, beyond =
space and causation. Bhuma is freedom, freedom from the trammels of flesh, =
freedom from the tricks of Maya, freedom from the plays of delusion. Bhuma =
is perfection, beyond all limitations. Bhuma is Infinite Fullness. Bhuma is=
 Brahman, the Eternal Absolute! You will have to remember all this constant=
ly. You will have to write this and read this, talk of this and preach this=
, meditate on this and live in this, understand this and realize this! =E2=
=80=9CYo vai bhuma tat sukham!=E2=80=9D
