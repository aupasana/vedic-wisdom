Dear daughter!
1. Please inform me your date of birth.

2. Dealing with peo=
ple of all  sorts, experiencing events both of happy and 
painful,testing o=
ne's patience, causing mental agony or displeasure, physical 
injury or dam=
age and disgusting some tmes to the extent of revolting, or seeking 
to end=
 life etc are all events in the arrangement, in fulfillment of our past 
go=
od deeds or misbehavior.

3.In anyone's life the Planet Jupiter gives the k=
nowledge and Mercury necessary 
thinking to decide actions, using  what is =
called the discretion.The planet 
Saturn checks our actions ad fitness and =
if we are in-disciplined and imperfect 
, Saturn accords TRAINING to us and=
 does not leave us until we become perfect 
and righteous. That is how Satu=
rn is the best serving planet in every one's 
life. When we are thus channe=
lise ourselves according to these planets, then 
VENUS gives the experience=
 of good living ad happiness.

4.When we transform and transmute positively=
 from the exposure to such 
experiences in the process of life,and listen  =
to the inner self, the Budhi 
works and tells the mind(manassu) and it is t=
he mind that carry the functioning 
of the 5 sensory organs and 5 working p=
hysical organs to work.

5.So in the course of these experiences, the meeti=
ng with rude people is a part 
and parcel.There is purpose behind involveme=
nt with such elements. We generally 
form opinion on others based on their =
actions and continue our thinking in tune 
with such opinions. Seeing the i=
ssue from our side is one aspect, where as 
seeing from the other's is anot=
her. We always try to find fault with others. So 
immediately the rash beha=
vior,rude talk, and their insulting nature are 
observed. In fact with ever=
y one we notice such negative points first and in 
preference to their posi=
tive aspects.We should try to see if we are at fault in 
such events. Makin=
g certain of our non-involvement, we should try to understand 
the circumst=
ances in which the other person is stuck.If we cannot have the 
patience to=
 stay there, we should leave the scene with out much reaction. But if 
ther=
e something concern to us also, then review ourselves and make rectificatio=
n 
of our personality, utilizing this experience.  

6.Thus we should take =
this opportunity to rectify the limitations in our 
personality. These limi=
tations are within the personality set up of every 
individual depending up=
on his/her SUN SIGN. Unless we rectify them we cannot 
listen to what is be=
ing told to us by the inner self.For such exercise SATURN 
helps us, if we =
follow certain regulations, they will soften the angles and 
projections in=
 our personality and round them off to smooth and satvic nature. 
That is h=
ow spirituality helps us to grow is inside.
7. So utilize all insults as ne=
utralizing events. Somebody insulted us to day is 
a reaction to what we di=
d similsr insult way back in past births.And as much we 
have received, is =
written of from such negative loads we brought forward and 
carrying with u=
s.
It has already become long. So I conclude now.
May God bless you.
Love a=
nd blessings from Balakrishna murthi Kaligotla
