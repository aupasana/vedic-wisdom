 Happiness is born of Peace and can reign only when there is no disturbance=
.
Disturbance is due to thoughts, which arise in the mind. When the mind is=

absent, there will be perfect Peace.

Even the present is mere imagination=
, for the sense of time is purely
mental.

"You and I are the same. What I =
have done is surely possible for all. You
are the Self now and can never be=
 anything else. Throw your worries to the
wind, turn within and find Peace.=
" ~ Sri Ramana Maharshi

The ultimate truth is so simple; it is nothing mor=
e than being in one=E2=80=99s
natural, original state.

The Self is always =
there. It is you. There is nothing but you.

Everyday life is not divorced =
from the Eternal State. So long as the daily
life is imagined to be differe=
nt from the spiritual life these difficulties
arise. If the spiritual life =
is rightly understood, the active life will be
found to be not different fr=
om it (Talk 375).

When a pot is broken, the space within it is not, and si=
milarly, when the
body dies the Self in it remains eternal.

All that is re=
quired to realize the Self is to be still.

By day I praised you, and never=
 knew it. By night I stayed with you, and
never knew it. I always thought t=
hat I was me--but no, I was you and never
knew it

The realized person weep=
s with the weeping, laughs with the laughing, plays
with the playful, sings=
 with those who sing, keeping time to the song.

By whatever path you go, y=
ou will have to lose yourself in the One.

Since the one aim is to realize =
the Self by destroying the ego, to engage
oneself in verbal wrangling about=
 the nature of the world is but vain. ~
Truth Revealed (Sadvidya)

We are a=
lways the Self. Only, we don=E2=80=99t realise it.

There are no stages in =
Realization or degrees in Liberation.

You speak as if you are here, and th=
e Self is somewhere else and you had to
go and reach it, but in fact the Se=
lf is here and now, and you are always
It.

Your business is simply to surr=
ender and leave everything to me.

Engage yourself in the living present. T=
he future will take care of itself.

The body itself is a thought. ~ Sri Ra=
mana Maharshi

You imagine it is something somewhere high in the sky, far a=
way, and has to
descend. It is really inside you, in your Heart, and the mo=
ment you effect
subsidence or merger of the mind into its Source, grace rus=
hes forth,
sprouting as from a spring within you.

Your duty is to Be, and =
not to be this or that.

Since you shine as ''I'' in the Heart, your name i=
tself is Heart. ~ Sri
Ramana Maharshi

It does not matter how many thoughts=
 arise. As each thought arises, one
should inquire with diligence, "To whom=
 has this thought arisen?"

The mind is commonly said to be strong if it ca=
n think furiously. But here
the mind is strong if it is free from thoughts.=


I would like to take a moment to thank each and everyOne of you who suppo=
rt
this page with your wonderful insights. May you rediscover your true nat=
ure
and live as That. L=E0=A5=90ve blessings from the Heart

Apart from tho=
ughts, there is no such thing as mind.

The mind cannot seek the mind.

Gra=
ce is not something to be acquired from others. If it is external, it is
us=
eless. All that is necessary is to know its existence in you.

You know tha=
t you know nothing.

Without consciousness, time and space do not exist; th=
ey appear within
Consciousness but have no reality of their own.

When will=
 the realization of the Self be gained? When the world which is
what-is-see=
n has been removed, there will be realization of the Self which
is the seer=
. ~ from Who Am I? (Nan Yar?)

Be yourself and nothing more.

You and I are=
 the same. What I have done is surely possible for all. You are
the Self no=
w and can never be anything else.Throw your worries to the wind,
turn withi=
n and find Peace.

True humanity lies not in returning violence for violenc=
e, but in
forgiveness.

"Only those who need not engage in action, are happ=
y; they are perfectly
content, and self-contained, and they experience happ=
iness which extends to
all the pores of the body." ~ Tripura Rahasya

When =
there is no "I" there is no karma.

Questioner: What is the state beyond bl=
iss? Maharshi: It is the state of
unceasing peace of mind which is found in=
 the state of absolute quiescence.

The existence of this existence-conscio=
usness can be inferred by the objects
illuminated by it. It does not become=
 the object of consciousness.

Guru is none other than the Self. If there i=
s a external guru he will only
point to the self

Q: How long does it take =
a man to be reborn after death? Is it immediately
after death or some time =
later? =E2=80=A8=E2=80=A8Maharshi: You do not know what you were
before bir=
th, yet you want to know what you will be after death. Do you know
what you=
 are now?

Existence or Consciousness is the only reality. Consciousness pl=
us waking we
call waking. Consciousness plus sleep we call sleep. Conscious=
ness plus
dream, we call dream. Consciousness is the screen on which all th=
e pictures
come and go. The screen is real, the pictures are mere shadows o=
n it.

"Only the knowledge of direct experience can be true and useful; the=
 Self is
to be realized and not to be talked about." ~ The Lamp of Non-Dual=
 Knowledge

To the ignorant and the wise alike the world exists. To the for=
mer, the
world observed alone is real. To the wise, the formless source of =
the
visible is the one world, Real and Perfect." ~ Sat-Darshana Bhashya

Yo=
u know that you are.

"The Self is one and is identical with the Lord. In o=
rder to see the Self or
to see the Lord, the ego must get consumed and lost=
, having surrendered
itself to the Supreme Being." Truth Revealed (Sadvidya=
)


The seat of Realization is within and the seeker cannot find it as an o=
bject
outside him. That seat is bliss and is the core of all beings. Hence =
it is
called the Heart.

The realized being does not see the world as diffe=
rent from himself.

Married or unmarried, a man can realise the Self, becau=
se that is here and
now. If it were not so, but attainable by some efforts =
at some other time,
and if it were new and something to be acquired, it wou=
ld not be worthy of
pursuit. Because what is not natural cannot be permanen=
t either. But what I
say is that the Self is here and now and alone.

Be wh=
at you are. That which is, is ever present. Even now you are It, and
not ap=
art from It. The expectation to see and the desire to get something
are all=
 the working of the ego. Be yourself and nothing more.

"The changeless inf=
inite Self transcends time and space, which are relative
to the body and th=
e mind." ~ Truth Revealed (Sadvidya)

All will come right in the end.

A Se=
lf-realised being cannot help benefiting the world. His very existence
is t=
he highest good.

If the mind is turned inward God manifests as inner consc=
iousness.

The Heart is not physical; it is spiritual. Hridayam =3D hrit + =
ayam - This is
the centre. It is that from which thoughts arise, on which t=
hey subsist and
where they are resolved.

Satisfaction can be only when you=
 reach the Source. Otherwise restlessness
remains.

The conception that the=
re is a goal and a path to it, is wrong. We are the
goal or peace always.

=
The thing to do is to concentrate on the seer and not on the seen, not on
t=
he objects, but on the Light which reveals them.

Grace is ever present. Al=
l that is necessary is that you surrender to It.

The body itself is a thou=
ght. Be as you really are.

Forgetfulness of your real nature is true death=
;=E2=80=A8remembrance of it is
rebirth.

When you speak of a path, where ar=
e you now?

Guru is not the physical form. So the contact will remain even =
after the
physical form of the Guru vanishes.

If the light of the sun is i=
nvisible to the owl, it is onlyquiry realize
that the mind which remains at=
 the end of the inquiry is Brahman." ~ Sri
Ramana Maharshi

There is no dif=
ference between the dream and the waking states except that
the dream is sh=
ort and the waking long. Both are the result of the mind. Our
real state, c=
alled turiya (fourth), is beyond the waking, dream and sleep
states.

Regul=
ation of life, such as getting up at a fixed hour, bathing, doing
mantra, j=
apa, observing ritual, all this is for people who do not feel drawn
to self=
-enquiry or are not capable of it. But for those who can practise
this meth=
od all rules and discipline are unnecessary.

Reality lies beyond the mind.=
 So long as the mind functions, there is
duality. Once it is transcended, R=
eality shines forth.

Birth and death pertain only to the body=E2=80=A6they=
 are superimposed on the Swe
are free.

The fact of your existence is also =
your realization.

'I exist' is the only permanent self-evident experience =
of everyone.

Eventually, all that one has learnt will have to be forgotten=
.

Doesn't one find some kind of peace while in meditation? That is a sign =
of
progress. That peace will become deeper and more prolonged with continue=
d
practice. It will also lead to the goal.

OAM NAMO BHAGAVATE SRI RAMANAYA=


"Those who follow the path of inquiry realize that the mind which remains=
 at
theby this intense activity which is called 'silence' (mauna).

There i=
s no help in changing your environment.The obstacle is the mind,
which must=
 be overcome, whether at home or in the forest. If you can do it
in the for=
est, why not in the home? Therefore, why change the environment?

Mind and =
breath have the same source. Hence breath is controlled when mind
is contro=
lled and mind when breath is controlled. Breath is the gross form
of the mi=
nd. Pranayama (breath control) is only an aid to subdue the mind
and will n=
ot serve to kill it. Like pranayama, worship of a deity, japa
(repetition) =
with a mantra, strict regulation of diet are all aids for mind
control.


T=
here is no greater mystery than this: Being Reality ourselves, we seek to
g=
ain Reality.

.lf, giving rise to the delusion that birth and death relate =
to the Self.
Discover the undying Self and be immortal and happy.

The high=
est form of grace is silence. It is also the highest=E2=80=A8spiritual
inst=
ruction. .. All other modes of instruction are derived=E2=80=A8from silence=
 and
are therefore secondary. Silence is the primary=E2=80=A8form. If the G=
uru is silent
the seeker's mind gets purified by itself. Talks with Sri Ram=
ana Maharshi,
518.

Maya (delusion or ignorance) which cannot be desYour du=
ty is to Be, and not
to be this or that.

To him who is one with the formle=
ss Self, everything is formless.

They say I am dying, but I am not going a=
way. Where could I go? I am here.

Be as you already are.

"If mind-conscio=
usness subsides into the source from which it arose, the
experience of Bein=
g, absolute perfection, will unite with you here and now."
~ Sri Ramana Mah=
arshi

Christ is the ego. The Cross is the body.When the ego is crucified, =
and it
perishes, what survives is the Absolute Being, and this glorious sur=
vival is
called Resurrection. - Talks, November 6, 1935

All spiritual teac=
hings are only meant to make us retrace our steps to our
Original Source...=
We need not acquire anything new, only give up false ideas
and useless accr=
etions...Instead of doing this, we tr2That which is, is only
Sat. That is c=
alled Brahman. The luster of Sat is chit and its nature is
ananda. These ar=
e not different from Sat. And the three together are known
as Sat-chit-anan=
da."

The mind is only a bundle of thoughts. The thoughts arise because the=
re is
the thinker. The thinker is the ego. The ego, if sought, will vanish
=
automatically. The ego and the mind are the same. The ego is the
root-thoug=
ht from which all other thoughts arise.

What exists in truth is the Self a=
lone.

Your duty is to Be, and not to be this or that.

To him who is one w=
ith the formless Self, everything is formless.

Thit must be ddying, but I =
athe truth is gained. This is clearly ridiculous.
A day will dawn when you =
will laugh at your past efforts. What you realize
on the day you laugh is a=
lso here and now.

The world is nothing more than an embodiment of the obje=
cts perceived by the
five sense-organs. Since, through these five sense-org=
ans, a single mind
perceives the world, the world is nothing but the mind. =
Apart from the mind
can there be a world? ~ Forty Verses on Reality,verse 6=


f one has form oneself, the world and God also will appear to have form, =
but
if one is formless, who is it that sees those forms, and how? Without t=
he
eye can any object be seen? The seeing Self is the Eye, and that Eye is =
y to
grasp something strange and mysterious because we believe happiness li=
es
elsewhere. This is the mistake.

Do not think too much of psychical phen=
omena and such things. Their number
is legion; and once faith in the psychi=
cal thing is established in the heart
of a seeker, such phenomena have done=
 their work. Clairvoyance,
clairaudience, and such things are not worth hav=
ing, when so much far
greater illumination and peace are possible without t=
hem than with them." ~
Sri Ramana Maharshi

There is no greater mystery tha=
n this: Being Reality ourselves, we seek to
gain Reality. We think that the=
re is something hiding Reality and that it
must be destroyed before the tru=
th is gained. This is clearly ridiculous. A
day will dawn when you will lau=
gh at your past efforts. What you realize on
the day you laugh is also here=
 and now.

The world is nothing more than an embodiment of the objects perc=
eived by the
five sense-organs. Since, through these five sense-organs, a s=
ingle mind
perceives the world, the world is nothing but the mind. Apart fr=
om the mind
can there be a world? ~ Forty Verses on Reality,verse 6

f one =
has form oneself, the world and God also will appear to have form, but
if o=
ne is formless, who is it that sees those forms, and how? Without the
eye c=
an any object be seen? The seeing Self is the Eye, and that Eye is the
Eye =
of Infinity. ~ Forty Verses on Reality,verse 4

Abide as That in which ther=
e is no beginning or end, no top or bottom or
middle, no holy place or god,=
 no gifts or pious acts, no time or space, no
objects of perception - and b=
e always happy, free from all traces of
thought. ~ The Heart of the Ribhu G=
ita

Reality is simply loss of the ego. Destroy the ego by seeking its
iden=
tity.Because the ego has no real existence, it will automatically
vanish, a=
nd Reality will shine forth by itself in all its glory. This is the
direct =
method. All other methods retain the ego.

Without consciousness, time and =
space do not exist; they appear within
Consciousness but have no reality of=
 their own.

You speak as if you are here, and the Self is somewhere else a=
nd you had to
go and reach it=E2=80=A6 =E2=80=A6But in fact the Self is her=
e and now, and you are always
It. It is like being here and asking people t=
he way to the ashram, then
complaining that each one shows a different path=
 and asking which to follow

Happiness is born of Peace and can reign only =
when there is no disturbance.
Disturbance is due to thoughts, which arise i=
n the mind. When the mind is
absent there will be perfect Peace.

The world=
 does not exist in sleep and forms a projection of your mind in the
waking =
state. It is therefore an idea and nothing else.

"If you seek God with you=
r whole Heart, then you may be assured that the
Grace of God is also seekin=
g you." ~ Sri Ramana Maharshi

Place your burden at the feet of the Lord of=
 the Universe who accomplishes
everything. Remain all the time steadfast in=
 the heart, in the
Transcendental Absolute. God knows the past, present and=
 future. He will
determine the future for you and accomplish the work. What=
 is to be done
will be done at the proper time. Don=E2=80=99t worry. Abide =
in the heart and
surrender your acts to the divine.

Your duty is to Be, an=
d not be this or that.Let the world bother about its
reality or falsehood. =
Find out first about your own reality. Then all things
will become clear.

<br>The mind is only a bundle of thoughts. The thought=

<br>Reality is simply loss of the ego. Destr=
