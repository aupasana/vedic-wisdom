Namaste,

Om Ganeshai Namah!!

Since Navaratri, for last three months, I ha=
ve been doing Maha Ganapati Homam once a month. Now, from yesterday with Lu=
nar Eclipse, my intention is to do the Homam weekly basis each weekend.

I =
would also like to increase the counts of Moola Mantra and Vedic Mantra, bu=
t I have following questions:

1) How do we keep count of the number of Man=
tra chanted?
2) Homam Manual the suggested count is 4/8/12/21/28/108/1008, =
for progressing the count, there is big gap between 28 and 1008, is this in=
tentional or any other suggestion?

As I am doing Homam in terrace, for fir=
e in Kunda, I have only trouble in the start but once fire is big enough no=
 problem, but the lamp get put off, quite frequently, yesterday, I put the =
lamp inside one Steel vessel, is there any better way ?

Thanks and regards=
.
Mihir
