Namaste,

I am cc'ing this mail to the list anonymously.

(1) You can use Shiva homam manual as the template and replace "shiv" 
with "indr" everywhere. For the main homam, you can use any of the 
thousands of Veda mantras available for Indra or simply "OM indrAya 
namaH svAhA".

(2) You CAN visualize a homa kundam and do a mental homam when it is not 
possible to do a physical homam. In fact, instead of visualizing an 
external homa kundam, you can visualize a homa kundam at the base of 
your spine and perform homam in that homa kundam.

Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Narasimha,

I wanted to write for several reasons, and chose to send a private 
message instead of an e-mail to the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup - I've been 
a member there for some months but rarely write.

First and most importantly, thank you - to both the beautiful Divine 
Mother who guides us with such loving patience, and to you who serves as 
a vessel for her wisdom. I have learned so much since joining the 
e-group some months ago, and look forward to the messages I receive 
every day. Thank you especially for your message about Sri Krishna's 
words in Gita, explaining the words "those who worship Me come to Me," 
etc.

I have two questions to ask which I hope are not burdensome, and the 
first is this: Recently I have learned of drought conditions in east 
India, and closer to home in Texas, as well. Sri Indra is my ishta-deva, 
and I will have a rare opportunity to perform homam sometime this month, 
thanks to a friend offering a large backyard for a weekend. I would like 
to do a homam to ask for help against the suffering of these droughts. 
Are there any changes I may make to your regular homam procedure, to use 
it for Indra?

The other question I have is about homam in general. For those who wish 
to perform this rite daily but lack the ability, would there be any 
value in practicing homam as a meditation - in mentally visualizing the 
kund, offerings, and proceeding through all of the steps and mantras as 
your manual teaches? On the one hand, the physical manifestation of Agni 
is vital to carry offerings, but perhaps the agni within us might serve 
in a similar manner if fed with pure-hearted, devoted meditation?

Please do pardon me if either of these questions has already been 
addressed via the group, or if I'm reaching you at a particularly busy 
time. I hope that this message finds you well and enjoying Her many 
blessings!

Thank you, again,
<deleted>
