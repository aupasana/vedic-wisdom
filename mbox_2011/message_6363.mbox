I was reading some information about the mother goddesses of various cultur=
es 
and I found a very interesting thing. The Sumerian goddess Inanna share=
s so much 
with the hindu goddess lakshmi. I think one of the greatest acco=
mplishments of 
our culture is to accord proper place and divinity to the m=
other goddess. Here 
is a link that speaks about the Sumerian goddess Innan=
a. 


I am really stuck by the association of owls to the Sumerian goddess =
as we 
associate owl to goddess lakshmi. My interest in exploring mother go=
ddesses 
comes from my family goddess and ista devatha being goddess lakshm=
i. There are 
references to mother goddess in celtic culture that are close=
 to our own 
culture. 


I really thank Mr Narasimha Raoji for making avaia=
lbe all Homa manuals on the 
web so that it helps with the sadhana of the p=
eople. =A0It is my belief that we 
should either transcend or fulfil all ma=
terial desires and that fulfilment will 
make one go beyond them. Even a gr=
eat sage such as Sankaracharya was advised to 
seek the blessings and fulfi=
lment from goddess lakshmi is his path to moksha or 
ultimate liberation. I=
nfact to be able to worship the goddess with the whole 
mind, heart and sou=
l is liberation itself.
