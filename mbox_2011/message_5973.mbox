namaste learned ones.

Please clarify me the meanings of adhi devatha and pratyadhi devatha for a
particular planet.

IF adhi devatha is the controller of the planet, pratyadhi devatha is
controller/superior of the adhi devatha?
what is the significance of adhi devatha and pratyadhi devatha japam during
the japam conducted for a planet.

also, can japam technique be used for performing shanti of a planet and also
strengthening a planet?

for example, if someone is told to perform shanti for saturn and strengthen
moon, can performing japam for shani and chandra alone suffice or anything
additional is needed in either of the case.
kindly clarify.
