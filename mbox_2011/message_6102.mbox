Test To Determine Your Spiritual Growth & Mental State 

Step 1:  Take a fe=
w moments and determine what you are very passionate about.  This can be yo=
ur career, but, does not necessarily have to be so.  It should be something=
, though, that you are actively engaged in doing and something that you fee=
l deeply about.  Here are some examples:  Yoga Teacher, Professional Blogge=
r, Health Care Professional, Technology Professional, Businessman, Politici=
an, etc=E2=80=A6

Step 2:  In this field that you care very deeply about, t=
hink about someone who is enormously successful.  Successful in all ways if=
 possible.  Someone who has made a huge amount of money in that field, beco=
me famous and is powerful.  Now one more criteria is important about this p=
erson.  If possible, have it be someone who you don=E2=80=99t like, or don=
=E2=80=99t agree with.  The more you dislike their ways and methods the bet=
ter, but the test will also work pretty well even if you don=E2=80=99t disl=
ike the person or their systems.

Step 3:  Watch your reaction to when you =
hear complimentary information about this person, or just hear about the su=
ccess this person is having in their life.  Be brutally honest, or you will=
 just be cheating yourself.  Does it create any negative wave within you?  =
Any tinge of jealousy?  Any feeling of irritation?  Any feeling of frustrat=
ion?  Any feeling of hurt?  Does it cause any ripple, any disturbance, in y=
our psyche?  The greater the disturbance the more the test indicates its ti=
me to get busy with your spiritual practice.  Here is a more detailed analy=
sis of the test results.

A negative reaction or disturbance can indicate t=
he following with regard to your spiritual state=E2=80=A6

1.  Too Much Amb=
ition:  You are probably focused too much on getting results and are overly=
 ambitious.  These attachments to the results can cause jealousy and ill-wi=
ll towards those who have already achieved what you so badly seek.  Another=
 way to look at this is you may not be doing what your really love to do in=
 life?  This is the only way to be free of the clutches of society and gain=
 oriented living.  Doing what you love to do, will free you from everything=
.  If this test produced negative waves, it could mean that you are only do=
ing things to see what you will get out of them, instead of doing things fo=
r their own sake.

2. Non-Dual Perception of Reality:  The test could also =
indicate that you are living excessively in an ego-centric way.  You are se=
eing the world as full of separate people and focusing on the various perso=
nalities, instead of seeing the world in a non-dual light with all of creat=
ion being One and having nothing but divine nature.  As Yogi Bhajan points =
out, "If you don=E2=80=99t see God in all, you don=E2=80=99t see God at all=
."  Are you seeing the Divine Nature of he who is getting under your skin? =
 Are you seeing the Oneness of Reality?

3.  Chasing the Wrong Things in Li=
fe:  If you have never thought about it, let me point out an interesting fa=
ct about enlightenment.  In society there is so much competition because re=
sources/rewards are limited.  There are only so many top 10 Blogs, there is=
 only 1 winner in the tournaments, there are only limited political seats, =
there is only 1 CEO, only so much oil, land, etc etc.  This breeds competit=
ion and conflict.  But Enlightenment is not limited.  Just because I am enl=
ightened, does not mean you can=E2=80=99t be also.  We can all be enlighten=
ed (and are), so this is one of those things you can chase without worrying=
 about having to wrestle it away from anyone else.  There is no need to com=
pete, it is an infinite, inexhaustible resource.  So this test implies that=
 you are not exclusively chasing enlightenment.  You are getting distracted=
 and running around all over the place chasing useless stupid things.  Time=
 to buckle down and get back to the business of going after that which is t=
he highest purpose of man.  Time to fulfill your destiny.

Take this test f=
rom time to time, or be aware when life brings it your way.  It is an insig=
htful instrument to gauge your goodness and spiritual understanding.
