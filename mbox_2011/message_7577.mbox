This prayer=
 asks for all aspects of the devata (in this case,
mahavishnu) to come and =
be present here. First his prana-shakti and
then his jiva shakti. All the s=
enses, speech, mind, skin, eyes, ears,
tongue, ears, and five pranas -- all=
 of these are asked to come here,
comfortably take up residence, and stay f=
or a long time.

Note: There are many different variations of this sanskrit=
 phrase.
Some are shorter, and some are much longer. The essence is the sam=
e.

This is a mantra from the Rig Veda (10.59.6). =
You can see Swami
Dayananda's commentary (in Hindi) here:
http://www.aryasa=
majjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/p71.htm


>> 2. If doing manas puja, while panch=
opchar puja do we say "samarpayami"
>> or "kalpayami"


You can use either =
... both are fine.


>> 3. What is the Significance of steps in panchopar p=
uja, what is the inner meaning other than material offering


All of creati=
on is composed of five elements, which get progressively
grosser -- space, =
air, fire, water, earth. These are linked to the
five sense organs -- sound=
, touch, sight, taste and smell -- and are
represented by five symbolic off=
erings. At each step, we try to
re-remember that the devata we have just in=
voked is the reality that
underlies this creation.

For example, "p=E1=B9=
=9Bthivy=C4=81tmane gandha=E1=B9=81 samarpay=C4=81mi" basically means this:=

"I offer this substance, made out of the earth element, to Him who is
of t=
he nature of earth". Through this simple process of five
offerings, we have=
 offered all of creation to him. ( From another
perspective, what we are do=
ing is like offering a bubble to water, or
a spark to fire ! )

Usually, th=
e panchopachara puja is done in a tantric way, and no real
materials are of=
fered. We simply touch the five fingers with each of
the five prayers, and =
mentally visualize the offering. Since the five
elements represent many thi=
ngs (including the five sense organs), many
different kinds of visualizatio=
ns are possible.

sasneham,
