Respected Narasimhaji & Members,
=A0To clarify in the beginning =
with deep respect to all : I have no intention of fuelling the current disc=
ussion on Bhagwaan Shiva.
My request is to invite your views and others abo=
ut the apparent contradictions in the portrayal of Bhagwaan Shiva :
=A0
For=
 example - he is considered Smashhanwasi=A0 or Kailaaspati (desolate and un=
inviting places) yet is the shelter of one of the most beautiful celestial =
object visible from earth=A0(Moon) and one of the most purifying waterbody =
for Hindus (Bhaagirathi-Gangaa).
Without elaborating such contradictions -j=
sut wish to state that he is=A0'Ajanmaa' yet=A0a symbol of fertility and pa=
rallelly pictured as the most ascetic of ascetics=A0!!! He is also worshipp=
ed as 
Natraaj- the patron of Performing arts and is also an object of wors=
hip for seekers of Sciences.
I refer here the book : Tao of Physics by reno=
wned particle physicist Fritjof Kapra.
=A0
My request to learned members is=
 to elaborate on the mixing of Dravidian and Aryan Symbolism in Bhagwaan Sh=
iva's portrayal in traditional mindset.
I have read long time back that whe=
n Aryan's came to Bhaarat(India) they had altered this chracterization of B=
hagwaan Shiva to erase the Dravid culture and worship practices but could n=
ot succeed completely in changing the Snake worship and Shiva Puja traditio=
ns.
What I had read years back may also be a biased version-hence this requ=
est.
=A0
Apologies for any transgressions in writing this lines -as this ma=
y be result of my own ignorance and I bow to all seekers.

Namaste,

>>=A0 Maa lakshmi and lord Vishn=
u are considered as rajasik deity. Lord 
>> Brahma and maa Sarasvati are co=
nsidered as Sattavik.

Vishnu is pure sattwa. Creator Brahma OTOH is not sa=
attwik as you say, 
but raajasik. Creation or any expansive process is raaj=
asik, whereas 
sustaining an equilibrium in a stable manner is sattwa. Vish=
nu's 1000 
names includes "sattwavaan" and "saattwikaH".

Saptashati rahasy=
a also describes how the original energy of the cosmos 
(Aadyaa Mahalakshmi=
) divided herself into 3 portions - Mahalakshmi, 
Mahasaraswati and MahaKal=
i with sattwa, rajas and tamas.

>> As Brahma is considered as aim of sattv=
ik methodologies

Brahman or Aatman or Self considered the ultimate aim is =
Nirguna, i.e. 
beyond gunas. That's different from Creator Brahma.

>> Thes=
e ten mahavidiyas along with their consorts such as Shiva, 
>> Bhairava, Ma=
hakala
>> are considered as the chief deity in various left handed literatu=
re.

Not all mahavidyas are worshipped in the left handed way. For example,=
 
Kamala (MahaLakshmi), Lalita Tripurasundari and Bhuvaneswari ARE 
worship=
ped using right handed tantra. Even Kali has forms (e.g. 
Bhadrakali) worsh=
ipped using right-handed tantra, though there exist 
forms worshipped using=
 left-handed tantra.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

Finally, one sho=
uld realize that deities are made of very light/thin 
conditioning, compare=
d to us. The tamas in a human being is far 
different from that as it appli=
es to a deity. Ruthlessly killing a 
person is different from ruthlessly ki=
lling a weakness such as lust or 
anger. Even if borth require the same gun=
a, the nature of the guna is 
different in both.

This is what I mentioned =
as the 3x3 matrix of gunas mentioned by 
Vasishtha in Yoga Vaasishtham to d=
escribe the difference between various 
deities, human beings and demons!

=
Anybody who thinks that Kaali or Taaraa or Chhinnamastaa or Shiva or 
Durga=
 or Rudra are taamasik like "demons" is in terrible 
misunderstanding.

Bes=
t regards,
Narasimha

<DIV>Respected Narasimhaji & Members,</DIV>
<D=
IV> To clarify in the beginning with deep respect to all : I have no i=
ntention of fuelling the current discussion on Bhagwaan Shiva.</DIV>
<DIV>M=
y request is to invite your views and others about the apparent contradicti=
ons in the portrayal of Bhagwaan Shiva :</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>For e=
xample - he is considered Smashhanwasi  or Kailaaspati (desolate and u=
ninviting places) yet is the shelter of one of the most beautiful celestial=
 object visible from earth (Moon) and one of the most purifying waterb=
ody for Hindus (Bhaagirathi-Gangaa).</DIV>
<DIV>Without elaborating such co=
ntradictions -jsut wish to state that he is 'Ajanmaa' yet a symbo=
l of fertility and parallelly pictured as the most ascetic of ascetics =
;!!! He is also worshipped as </DIV>
<DIV>Natraaj- the patron of Performing=
 arts and is also an object of worship for seekers of Sciences.</DIV>
<DIV>=
I refer here the book : Tao of Physics by renowned particle physicist Fritj=
of Kapra.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>My request to learned members is to =
elaborate on the mixing of Dravidian and Aryan Symbolism in Bhagwaan Shiva'=
s portrayal in traditional mindset.</DIV>
<DIV>I have read long time back t=
hat when Aryan's came to Bhaarat(India) they had altered this chracterizati=
on of Bhagwaan Shiva to erase the Dravid culture and worship practices but =
could not succeed completely in changing the Snake worship and Shiva Puja t=
raditions.</DIV>
<DIV>What I had read years back may also be a biased versi=
on-hence this request.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Apologies for any trans=
gressions in writing this lines -as this may be result of my own ignorance =
and I bow to all seekers.</DIV>
