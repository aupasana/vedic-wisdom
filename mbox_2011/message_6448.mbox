If you like seclusion, if you are free from raga or passion, worldly ambiti=
on, karmic tendencies and attractions of this world, if you are reticent an=
d serene, if you have disciplined yourself while remaining in the world, if=
 you can live on simple food, if you can lead a hard life, if you have a st=
rong constitution, if you are not talkative, if you can remain alone withou=
t company and talk, if you have a meditative temperament or reflective natu=
re, if you can bear all the difficulties in the spiritual path, if you can =
lead a difficult life of an ascetic till the end of your life, if you can b=
ear any amount of insult and injury done to you, then you can take to the p=
ath of renunciation. Only then you will be benefited by embracing sannyasa.=
 You should actually lead the life of a sannyasi for one or two years in th=
e world itself. Otherwise you will find it extremely difficult to tread the=
 path. For a man of dispassion, discrimination and strong will, this path i=
s all joy and bliss.
