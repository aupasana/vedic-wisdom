Even in an advanced stage, people remain in their house with family, wives =
and children, but take fancy to say, =E2=80=9CI have got mental detachment;=
 I am a mental sannyasin.=E2=80=9D There is really terrible attachment in t=
hem! Sannyasa has its own glory and splendor! Sannyasa is extremely necessa=
ry. One may say, =E2=80=9CI do not need orange-colored robes;=E2=80=9D stil=
l sannyasa is necessary. Sannyasa has got its own psychology. All arguments=
 against it are false! The Mundaka Upanishad will tell you how necessary sa=
nnyasa is. The world has not produced a greater genius than Shankara,4 the =
greatest sannyasin! Why did Ramakrishna Paramahansa take sannyasa? No use o=
f argumentation and logic=E2=80"vanity of the intellect! Sannyasa is necess=
ary though you may have advaitic realization! Totapuri, Ramakrishna=E2=80=
=99s guru, though he had advaitic realization, took sannyasa. Why did Madan=
a Misra take sannyasa? Yajnavalkya had the highest realization, but why did=
 he take sannyasa? The world has not produced a greater sage than Yajnavalk=
ya. Study his instructions to his wife, Maitreyi.
