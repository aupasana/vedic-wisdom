Namaste

I would like to share my opinion but the other gurujans=
 on the board might have more valid viewpoints. People often only take the =
external imagery and concentrate a lot of attention on the peel of the oran=
ge rather than the fruit within.

Cow's ghee is praised in Ayurveda as one =
which can increase both the material that forms the spleen ,bones and nervo=
us system.Pregnant women are often told to take a lot of ghee for good form=
ation of the foetus in the womb.Also it is a very good practise to use Ghee=
 instead of Oil while cooking even though modern nutrition experts will sca=
re people into beleiving it will increase harmful cholestrol.

Cow's ghee w=
hen lit in a lamp or in a homa releases many organic compounds and vapours =
which are quite beneficial to the human body. Also Cow's ghee is one of the=
 most sattvic substances that can be found. IIT -BHU has a published paper =
on the chemical compounds formed during a homa and the temperature study. Y=
ou could google for it on the net. 

Lighting such a substance would never =
displease Mother Lakshmi or any other god for that matter.

Doing any ritua=
l should inspire one to change oneself internally as well. Just external ri=
tuals will not take anybody much further.

Narasimha ji's message can be fo=
und in the archives where he summarized the meaning of lighting three wicks=
 in the lamp ( Ida,Pingala ,Sushumna ) and I think you can happily offer a =
ghee lamp with the same attitude.

Regards
