Namaste Jitendhar,

As Hari and Rama says, it it better to avoid spoiled d=
ry coconuts.But,these days the dry coconut halves are not easily infected b=
y fungi or attracted by ants. I heard from one of the vendor that while the=
y dry the coconut pieces, they do apply some chemicals in which to avoid fu=
ngi and ants attraction. Recently i bought 20 kgs of dry coconut and i made=
 them into tiny pieces for offering and i preserved. i didnt find any spoil=
ed stuff within.

For Poornahuthi you can easily jugde by pressing the full=
 coconut to identify whether it is spoiled or not. If it is spoiled very ea=
sliy it would break into pieces,if not, it is bit hard to do so.Try it.


A=
ll the best,

Thank you,
Srini.
