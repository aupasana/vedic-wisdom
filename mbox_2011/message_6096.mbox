Thank you for your replies; I am aware, nay, I have read non-dual nature. M=
y specific question is if non-duality is the final stage, who attained it s=
o far ? Whosoever attained, how could they be in duality later !
All the ga=
nas who are with Lord Shiva, they are present with him; they see him as mah=
AkAla and yet are separate from him ? 

Anyways, non-duality is good to rea=
d, just impossible to comprehend. For ex: some of the heinious crimes in th=
e world are part of the negativity and how could any one see it without the=
 dual nature as "negative" and just neutral ?

 is like coming very close to diamond. realising that this is a big diamond=
 with many facets instead of a big star. After we come more closer we see o=
