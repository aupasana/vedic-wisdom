PVR

Respected sir, I had sent your 3-4 mails last week at PVR regarding my=
 situation as i am completely shaken. Guess you might have missed in your s=
urely flooded mailbox.

I am delighted to see your response.

Because of my=
 karmic pattern I do have a nature full of worry, doubt, sadness, anxiety b=
ut I truly know and believe that the way out of all troubles/misery is sinc=
erity of bhakti and karma. So I want to strongly come out of all this. I re=
spectfully seek your blessings.

* * * *

Sir I have read each and every po=
st of yours for all last 5-6 yrs and 
I understand that if one does homam, =
a god truly comes to help you in all ways possible. In this job of cleaning=
 the karmic room some dust might initially rise up but after that the room =
will be beautiful and blessed.

I know you have earlier also made clear tha=
t 
a. Technicalities are never a hinderance at all 
b. Sincerity, devotion =
and poorahuti meditation are the main things.

I have one general question.=
 
1. Can homam (for soyma deity)(leaving aside initial issue) backfire unde=
r any other circumstances. 
a. Any chart combination.
b. any wrong days in =
general
c. any difference in diety days (like VS homam on Pradosh time)
d. =
any other situation we might watch out for


Have sent a mail to you with m=
y name and gotra details at ur id, many many thanks for adding me in sankal=
p.


* * * *


Sir I am unable to understand things/life/ form all five sid=
es
1. Increased issues after homam
2. My strong premonition that healthwise=
 something is wrong with my father
3. My Sadesati and Guru antar dasha (sup=
posedly markesh/bhadhakesh) is starting
4. Should I invest more money in Co=
llege fees in US or go back to India. For last 6yrs am jobless
5. How do I =
improve my weak pschylogy.

Request 
Will appreciate if you can find out so=
me time to guide and make me understand my life. I have posted my DOB and a=
ll details in vedic astrology forum. thread num - 126118, priyank_priyank, =


Help me fine tune my spiritual sadhana.


Regards
Priyank
