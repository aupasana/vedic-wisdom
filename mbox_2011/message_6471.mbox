=

222. (Reply): These two meanings do not accord with the Advaita view. They=

postulate a difference between Jiva and Ishvara, but in the Advaita doctri=
ne
there is
no distinction between =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Thou=
=E2=80=99. Statements appearing to make such
a
distinction are only steps t=
owards understanding of non-duality.

235. The Shruti declares that in fact=
 there is no destruction and no
origination; none in bondage and none engag=
ed in practice for liberation; no
aspirant for liberation and none liberate=
d. This is the transcendental
truth.

236. Maya is said to be the desire-fu=
lfilling cow. Jiva and Ishvara are its
two calves.Drink of its milk of dual=
ity as much as you like, but the truth
is non-duality.

261. Owing to lack =
of true discrimination a man identifies egoism with the
Self, and then thin=
ks: =E2=80=98May this object be mine=E2=80=99, and so forth. This is
called=
 desire.

274. The man who is attached to objects is troubled by the world;=
 happiness
is enjoyed by the unattached. Therefore give up attachment if yo=
u desire to
be happy.

283. Without the knowledge of Reality even perfect d=
etachment and complete
withdrawal from worldly actions cannot lead to liber=
ation. A man endowed
with
detachment and withdrawal, but failing to obtain =
illumination, is reborn in
the
superior worlds because of great merit.

284=
. On the other hand by the complete knowledge of the Reality a man is
sure =
to
have liberation, even though his detachment and withdrawal are wanting. =
But
then
his visible sufferings will not come to an end owing to his fructi=
fying
Karma.

VII. THE LAMP OF PERFECT SATISFACTION

20. When a man is as f=
irmly convinced of his identity with Brahman as an
ordinary
man is convince=
d of his identity with the body, he is liberated even if he
does not
wish f=
or it.

22. The Self is ever cognised. We speak of Its being known directly=
 or
indirectly,
being known or unknown, as in the illustration of the tenth=
 man.

23. The tenth man counts the other nine, each of whom is visible to =
him, but
forgets himself the tenth, though all the time seeing himself.

24=
. Being himself the tenth, he does not find him. =E2=80=98The tenth is not
=
visible, he is
absent=E2=80=99, so he says. Intelligent people say that thi=
s is due to his presence
being
obscured by ignorance or Maya.

129. If you =
give up food, you will not live; but will you not be alive if
you give up
s=
tudies (other than scriptures)? So why so much insistence on pursuing such
=
studies?

130. (Doubt): How then the ancient knowers like Janaka administer=
ed kingdoms
?
(Reply): They were able because of their conviction about the=
 truth. If you
have that,then by all means engage yourself in logic or agri=
culture or do
whatever you like.

131. Once he is convinced of the unrealit=
y of the world, a knower, with mind
undisturbed, allows his fructifying Kar=
ma to wear out and engages himself in
worldly affairs accordingly.

147. =
=E2=80=98The desires are never quelled by enjoyment but increase more like =
the
flame of a fire fed on clarified butter=E2=80=99.

162. When a man is n=
either willing nor unwilling to do a thing but does it
for the
feelings of =
others and experiences pleasure and pain, it is the result of
=E2=80=98fruc=
tifying Karma through the desire of others=E2=80=99.

163. (Doubt): Does it=
 not contradict the text at the beginning of this
chapter which
describes t=
he enlightened man as desireless ? (Reply): The text does not
mean that
des=
ires are absent in the enlightened man, but that desires arising in him
spo=
ntaneously without his will produce no pleasure or pain in him, just as
the=

roasted grain has no potency.

164. Roasted grain though looking the same =
cannot germinate; similarly the
desires
of the knower, well aware of the un=
reality of objects of desire cannot
produce merit
and demerit.

168. That w=
hich is not destined to happen as a result of our past Karma will
not happe=
n; that which is to happen must happen. Such knowledge is a sure
antidote t=
o the poison of anxiety; it removes the delusion of grief.

191. There is t=
herefore no contradiction between the two statements in the
scriptures that=
 =E2=80=98desires are a sign of ignorance=E2=80=99 and that =E2=80=98the wi=
se man may
have
desires=E2=80=99, because the desires of a wise man are too=
 weak to bind.

193. Many Shruti texts declare that a husband loves his wif=
e not for her
sake and the wife loves him not for his sake, but for their o=
wn sake.

198. When King Janaka asked Yajnavalkya about the nature of the S=
elf, the
sage
first told him of the sheath of intellect and then, pointing =
out its
inadequacy (to be the Self), ended in teaching him of the immutable=

Kutastha.

211. It is common experience that the states of waking, dreamin=
g and deep
sleep are distinct from one another, but that the experiencing c=
onsciousness
is the same.

213. =E2=80=98When a man realises his identity w=
ith that Brahman which illumines the
worlds
of the waking, dreaming and sle=
eping states, he is released from all bonds=E2=80=99.

214. =E2=80=98One sh=
ould consider the Self to be the same in the waking, dreaming
and sleeping =
states. That Atman which knows itself as beyond the three
states is free fr=
om rebirth=E2=80=99.

215. =E2=80=98That Self which is not subject to exper=
ience in any of the three
states, which can be called pure consciousness, t=
he witness, the ever
blissful and which is neither the enjoyer nor the enjo=
yment or the object of
enjoyment, That I am=E2=80=99.

225. The subtle body=
 is affected on the one hand by desire, anger and so
forth and
on the other=
 by inner and outer control, peace of the mind and serenity of
the
senses. =
The presence of the former affections and the absence of the latter
lead to=

misery.
