These are the concluding sentences of the Mundaka Upanishad where renunciat=
ion and emancipation are extolled: =E2=80=9CHe who strives by these means, =
possessed of knowledge, enters into the abode of Brahman. Attaining that st=
ate, the seers who are satisfied with knowledge, who are perfected souls, f=
ree from attraction, tranquil in mind, attaining that which is universally =
present, those wise devout souls enter into the All itself. As the flowing =
rivers in the ocean disappear leaving their names and forms, so the knower,=
 being liberated from name and form, goes to the Supreme Purusha who is hig=
her than the highest. He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman. In his family n=
o one who is ignorant of Brahman arises. He crosses over sorrow He crosses =
over sin. Liberated from the knots of the heart, he becomes immortal.=E2=80=
=9D
