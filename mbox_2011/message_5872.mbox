Very well said Utpal ji

In start of our journey, we hold on to logic and a=
s we move forward, faith start to develop. As we move further, percentage o=
f faith increase overtime and that of logic decrease. At one time, you have=
 to leave all the logic. At a stage, During his lessons to M Shri Ramakrish=
na Paramahansa told him to leave all reasoning. Shri Ramakrishna repeated/h=
ighlighted this to him many times.

In start of spirituality we find that b=
ooks are our best guide. They answer our questions very well. But after som=
e time a stage comes when we feel that books are infact 'over-guiding' us. =
They are trying to give words to our emotions and trying to limitize our fe=
elings. I think it is right time to quit reading. I am also feeling so abou=
t myself. But dont know if I am thinking right.

Sometime back someone said=
 to me "I was reading Geeta when Shri Krishna said to Arjuna 'Oh Arjuna, st=
op reading all the books...'. I didnt read even Geeta from that shloka onwa=
rds"

Thanks for the links Chandraprakash ji.

May Lord keep showing the ri=
ght way to all of us.

Deep regards
