 Unless there exists one continuous principle equally connected with the
pa=
st, present and future, or an absolutely unchangeable Self which cognizes
e=
verything, we are unable to account for remembrance, recognition and so on,=

which are subject to mental impression on place, time and cause. The Self =
is
distinct from and superior to ideas, because the ideas require an ultima=
te
principle which unites and connects them, while the Self is itself the
u=
ltimate Principle which renders the cognition of the ideas possible.

The M=
anas (mind) is an organ of sensation and thought. It must be under the
cont=
rol of some one who uses this instrument. The Jiva or human soul is not
the=
 director of the mind, because we see that ordinary men are swayed away
rut=
hlessly by the mind. Therefore, there must exist some other Supreme
Being, =
who is the Director of the mind. He is the Antaryamin, the inner
Ruler and =
Controller.

Then again look at the miraculous power of the mind. In the Ke=
nopanishad the
first Mantra begins, 'Who is the Director of the mind?' Ther=
e is the play of
the Divine hand here also. Can my brother psychologist man=
ufacture a mind
from his laboratory? We are struck with wonder when we look=
 into the diverse
faculties of the mind, viz., power of discrimination, pow=
er of
judgment,reasoning, retentive power, imagination, cogitative faculty =
or the
power of reflection,understanding, etc. No one but God can create su=
ch a
powerful and miraculous mind.
