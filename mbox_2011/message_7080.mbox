Dear Jitender, namaste

I always throw away those copras which have some dr=
y powder/fungi inside it.
As for full coconut, as Rama said, I generally us=
e a half coconut as
poornahuti. If I use a full copra, then I prepare the p=
oornahuti by slicing
off the top carefully, checking to see if it is good a=
nd then filling it
with ghee, coin, other materials offered as ahuti and th=
en tie up the copra
with a thread or cloth.

best regards
Hari
