Namaste Sundeep

I am just sharing couple of inputs on the opening of the h=
eart question, might prove useful to you.If anything disturbs you or sounds=
 offensive please excuse me beforehand.Narasimha ji when he finds the time =
would be the best person to answer rest of your question.

Most meditations=
 (both western and eastern) techniques often have opening of the heart visu=
alization sequences.One that comes to my mind is the twin hearts meditation=
 of pranic healing where you visualize the entire earth being blessed with =
positive energy and also forgive each and every person that has hurt you an=
d so forth.Also many techniques of the shiva sutras have similar visualizat=
ions. Each person is usually protected by his own aura which extends six in=
ches from the physical body. Normal healthy people have nothing to fear fro=
m any entities and so on. Only when there is a rupture in the aura or imbal=
ance in some of the chakras there is a possibility of intrusion .Again such=
 an intrusion should be sanctioned by one's own karma's in the past life wh=
ich make such an individual susecptibile to possession which might be revea=
led by astrology chart.

Just remain as the witness during your meditation =
and all your fears will melt away . One of the members of this group recent=
ly had a nice forward email from Swami Sivananda where the swami says " man=
y sanyasis chant Sivoham ,Sivoham externally but will run away at the mere =
sight of a cat in the jungle at night " . Just gently remind yourself that =
you are neither the body , nor the experiences you see during meditation. T=
his will immensely heal your subconscious and reduce many fears.

If it wil=
l help to reassure you further , just like Narasimha ji had posted a few mo=
nths back ...ghosts or spirits are not out to get you nor do they have a wh=
ole planning mechanism on attacking people . They are simply souls waiting =
in a different dimension to take rebirth.

All that you experience during m=
editation is your own subconscious bringing about thoughts from your mind w=
hirlpool.Just be the witness and you will see a majority of those ripples w=
ill disappear.

Wish you happy meditations henceforth.

Regards
Vemparla Ra=
m Kishore

 At each of the 7 stations, all underground without light, were "half forme=

 a sense "trying to get their identity together" without as much as a ray o=

 other dreams in which someone is around me, trying to get to/into me.

 I have also been doing meditations in which I am trying to open my heart, =
let my emotions out (I am very reserved by nature). These meditations are q=
uite cathartic and give me peace at the end. But here is my fear: I feel th=
is "opening myself out internally" is attracting some huge external negativ=

 past that is being revealed to me? How do I tell if this negativity is to =
be experienced and suffered (if it is my own), or is to be avoided (if it i=
s someone else)?
