Hi Vijay,

Good thought,Though the Manuals,Video and Audio tutorials by PV=
R are more than enough for the seekers to learn homam. Sometimes,a physical=
 presence in guiding/teaching would help.

One more advantange is ,a group =
of peoples can collectively perform a homam at one place on specific cause =
(sattvic).Also they can share their experinces and correct/clarify each oth=
er. 

Thank you,
Srini.

Likewise, others can enter the details and Narasimha can perhaps add this c=
