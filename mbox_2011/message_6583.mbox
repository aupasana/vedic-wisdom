Namaste,

I do not think what Shri Narasimha and Swami Sivananda are saying=
 are
mutually exclusive or in any way contradictory. No precepts or princip=
les
are universally applicable--just like medicine is dosed according to th=
e
illness of a particular patient, so too, what orientation and instruction=
s
are given to a sadhaka are dependent upon time, place and the phase of th=
e
sadhaka's development. There is no one medicine or dosage that is correct=

for everyone at all times. Words of power also emerge from certain bhavas.=

In Swami Vivekananda's writings, some are very action-oriented when he was=

in the bhava of karma yogaand some are in the mode of deep renunciation wh=
en
he was in the bhava of complete renunciation. It is fruitless to look fo=
r
logical principles to tie everything together into a simple explanation o=
r
principle or personality trait. As Mahatma Gandhi said once (to paraphras=
e),
my duty is towards truth, not towards consistency. Swami Sivananda wrot=
e
these words out of a tremendously deep bhava and samadhi--there is intens=
e
vairagya that emanates from these words--and there certainly is a place f=
or
such exhortations in the spiritual life. They are intended for certain
p=
ersons at certain stages of their spiritual journey and are valid for them.=

Such writings are not to be read intellectually and/or understood
intellec=
tually--they are to be drunk as nectar from the mouths of men and
women who=
 realized the divine and through the tapas shakti of their writing,
they he=
lp guide us and propel us forward on our own spiritual path. If we
take the=
ir words and become argumentative, the fault lies with us that we
have not =
read them in the proper spirit or attitude.

Warm regards,
Aditi

 You cannot say that even begging for bread is a binding rule on a sannyasi=
n. That is not a desire and the sannyasin is virtually a mendicant without =
rules binding him. He is not liable to any kind of command. Even one who do=
es not know Brahman but who is desirous of emancipation should enter into t=
he order of a sannyasin. The sruti says: =E2=80=9CLet one live in the order=
 of sannyasa which is a means to the knowledge of Brahman.=E2=80 Brahmachar=
ya may help one to attain knowledge but it is not the case with a household=
er. When a means is not properly followed it can never accomplish any objec=
t. The heavenly bliss of the karma-kandin is only a form of worldly enjoyme=
nt. Heaven is only another world. If one professes to have knowledge he can=
not do actions, for actions are worldly. The atman is entirely opposed to a=
ction and hence it cannot be an auxiliary to the knowledge of it. The sruti=
 says: =E2=80=9CWhen to him everything has become the Self, who should see =
what and through what should one see?=E2=80 etc. This nullifies the meaning=
 of actions in one who has knowledge. </font></font></div>
