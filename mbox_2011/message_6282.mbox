Determination and self-reliance are very necessary for success in Self- rea=
lisation. In Mundaka Upanishad you will find: "This Atman cannot be obtaine=
d by one who is destitute of strength or without earnestness or by penance =
without mark. But if a wise man strives after it by those means, then his s=
elf enters into Brahman (God)." Fearlessness is an important qualification =
for an aspirant. One should be prepared to renounce this life at any moment=
. Without renunciation of this little sensual life, the eternal spiritual l=
ife cannot be attained, 'Abhayam' (fearlessness) comes first in the Daivi S=
ampatti or divine qualities that are enumerated in the Gita- Chapter XVI-I.=
 A timid man or a coward dies several times before he actually dies. When y=
ou have once decided to take to spiritual practices, stick to it tenaciousl=
y at any cost, nay, at the risk of your life. Come what may. Be bold, Stand=
 up. Realise the Truth. Proclaim it everywhere, THOU ART THE IMMORTAL SELF.=
