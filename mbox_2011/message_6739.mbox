> About Sadhanaas or homams on funeral Pyre


A couple of weeks a=
go on twitter from @mmpandit (slightly reformatted)

(1) "Only one with spe=
cial purity and agya can perform homa on a funeral
pyre without it affectin=
g his consciousness adversely."

He also mentioned the lakshanas of each ch=
akra up to agya -- first four
obviously need to be overcome, last two need =
to be obtained.

(2) "Muladhara - Acquisitiveness ; Svadhisthana - Sex ; Ma=
nipur - Food ;
Anahata - Selfishness ; Vishuddha - Special purity ; Agya - =
Awaits
instructions".

My take away is that we first need to work on the fi=
rst four obvious
defects.

sasneham,

   ajit

</p><div style=
=3D"font-family:tahoma, new york, times, serif;font-size:10pt">Hi,<br><br>A=
ddendum to below explanations.<br><br>We can explain meaning of burning diy=
as as following...<br><br>i) it=A0 is one type of sewa offered to god.<br>
=


ii) by burning it in front of god we are asking god to remove the andhaka=
ar or tamas that has covered us and show the path of light and take us towa=
rds the ultimate which is devoid of any gunas and full of light and self il=
luminating (swayamprakash)<br>


iii) by burning it in front of god we are =
asking him to burn all our karmas (good bad and all ) and make us free from=
 bondages of karmas and to take us back in him who is free from all karma b=
andhanaas.<br><br>so the method and materials used in doing it has its own =
impact on it.<br>


<br>Sesame Seeds and its Oil:-- The quality of (gun) se=
same Seeds and its oil is coolness (sheetal gun).( The sesame seeds are use=
d to reduce problems of heat or Ushna baadhas) and=A0 the
 burning of same =
(oil) gives coolness to environment and to the mind too. hence most of the =
times in temples sesame oil is used for burning diyas. It is also helpful i=
f you are trying to do meditation it will help in creating a environment fo=
r it.<br>


<br>Ghee -- And in ghee it is only ghee of gaay or cow=A0 shoul=
d be used and in that too of one which has its calf alive( nowadays we don&=
#39;t come to know it as we buy it from shops so this point cannot be appli=
ed but it is still observed in rural areas where people prepare ghee for th=
emselves)<br>


The reason I mentioned this because its only cows ghee is p=
ure and is of satvic gun and can give similar fruits if used where as the g=
hee of female buffalo (bhains) is said to be of gaadh tamas and use of same=
 would give similar results i.e. yield more tamas.( And so is difference in=
 milk too...)<br>


<br>And most importantly it is said that the devatas ea=
t with their drishti and by sensing the fragrance. hence in

<br><br>I understand that Agni is a carrier of information (subtlest possib=

used. How many variations - possibly infinite.<br>
