Hello all, 

In my daily vishnu sahastranaam puja schedule i have inclinati=
on of add something for laxmi. please guide me which will be better option =
of the following three.

1. 108 times "Hrim Shrim Krim Mahalakshmayai namah=
" with full devotion. Is this the correct mantra or something else.

2. 108=
 different names of laxmi, i feel it becomes more of intellectual/technical=
 than devotional as i dont know the meaning of the names.

3. Listening to =
Sri suktam, Since its Vedic mantra and i dont know how to pronounce it i th=
ink its better to hear it with full concentration and devotion.

Kindly gui=
de.

Regards,
Akshaya Dayal
