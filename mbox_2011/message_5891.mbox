 26th April, 1948

This morning a Tamil youth approached Bhagavan and asked=
,=E2=80=9CSwami, it is good
to love God, is it not? Then why not follow the=
 path of Love?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWho said you couldn=E2=80=99t follow it? =
You can do so. But when you talk of love,
there is duality, is there not =
=E2=80=94 the person who loves and the entity called
God who is loved? The =
individual is not separate from God. Hence love means
one has love towards =
one=E2=80=99s own Self.

For this, i.e., loving one=E2=80=99s own Self, exa=
mples have been given in the
Vasudeva
Mananam, stage by stage. Man loves mo=
ney most; but he loves his son more
than money; his own body more than the =
son; his indriyas (the organs of the
body) more than the body; the eye most=
 among the organs; life more than the
eye; and the self (atma) more than li=
fe.

This is exemplified thus: If the son does something untoward and the
g=
overnment decides to punish him for it, the parents offer money and even
br=
ibes to set him free. Hence the love towards the son is more than money.

I=
f, however, the government does not accept money but say that they will let=

off the son if the father agrees to undergo the punishment himself instead=
,
then the father
will say, =E2=80=98Do whatever you like with the boy; I h=
ave nothing to do with
him=E2=80=99.

Hence the father loves his own body m=
ore than his son. If a man does
something for which the powers that be say =
that his eyes must be plucked
out, he tries to save
his eyes by agreeing to=
 bodily torture; so bodily torture is preferred to
loss of an organ.

If, h=
owever, they decide to take his life by beheading him, he would be
prepared=
 to lose his eyes or any other organ rather than lose his life; so
life (pr=
ana) is loved more than the organs.

In the same manner,a person who desire=
s to have Atma-Anandam (bliss of the
Self)
would be prepared to lose his li=
fe even, if necessary; so the Self is loved
more than life.

Hence the idea=
 of a person in loving God, is only with a view to being happy
himself. He =
is, however, the embodiment of happiness and that happiness is
God. Who els=
e is to be loved? Love itself is God,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan.

=E2=80=9CTha=
t is why I am asking you whether God could be worshipped through the
path o=
f love?=E2=80=9D said the questioner.

=E2=80=9CThat is exactly what I have=
 been saying. Love itself is the actual form of
God. If by saying, =E2=80=
=98I do not love this; I do not love that=E2=80=99, you reject all
things, =
that which remains is Swarupa, i.e., the innate Self. That is pure
bliss. C=
all it pure
bliss, God, atma or what you will. That is devotion; that is re=
alization and
that is everything,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan.

=E2=80=9CThe mea=
ning of what you say now is that we should reject all outside things
which =
are bad, and also all those which are good, and love God alone.

Is it poss=
ible for anyone to reject everything, saying this is no good, that
is no go=
od,unless one experiences them?=E2=80=9D said some other.

=E2=80=9CThat is=
 true. To reject the bad, you must love the good.In due course that
good al=
so will appear to be an obstacle and will be rejected. Hence, you
must nece=
ssarily first love what is good. That means you must first love and
then re=
ject the thing you love.

If you thus reject everything, what remains is th=
e Self alone. That is real
love. One who knows the secret of that love find=
s the world itself full of
universal love,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan and resum=
ed silence.
