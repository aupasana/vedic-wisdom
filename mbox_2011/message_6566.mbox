One acts only when there is desire. A desireless man, whose desires have be=
en fulfilled, who has risen above desires, whose desire is the atman, has n=
o necessity to act. It is not reasonable to ask the question as to why a pe=
rson who is travelling does not fall into a pit or a mire in broad daylight=
. If you say that a householder can remain in his state without doing karma=
 after he gets knowledge of Brahman, we say, it cannot be; for the househol=
der=E2=80=99s life is based on desire. Sannyasa is cessation from all desir=
es and not merely a change of the order. Therefore it is impossible for a K=
nower to lead a householder=E2=80=99s life.
