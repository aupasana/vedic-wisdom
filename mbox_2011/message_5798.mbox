Namaskaram Narsimha garu,

Lately I am getting repetitive bad dreams. Most =
of them are premonitions of bad events(fire,train derailment,murder,kidnapp=
ing etc) going to happen around the world. The fear tension that gropes aro=
und a person when he is kidnapped or murdered etc runs through my body. Alm=
ost everyday I get up at the middle of night upset/scared apply vipudhi and=
 sleep. Shouldn't homams give one bliss then why do I feel so much pain of =
people? How is this related to spirituality? Kindly advice and is there a s=
olution to this. 

Many thanks,
Priya
