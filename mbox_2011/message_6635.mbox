That was=C2=A0a nice post Ajit. I am also one of those people who, because =
of guilt factor of skipping sandhyavandana, unable to do the homa daily. I =
do it every week. But there is a little other logistics issue for me. I liv=
e in the US and I do my homa in my living room where the Wood burning Firep=
lace (east facing)=C2=A0is located. My pooja room however, is in a differen=
t location towards north of the house. I have a big Shiva Lingam in my pooj=
a room for which I do daily abhishekam in the morning, (with Rudra Adhyaya =
on Mondays). So, if I have do both nithyapooja and homam daily, it is reall=
y time taking as arranging for homam takes almost 20 minutes, on a routine =
basis. Any ideas for managing this better? For instance, arrangements inclu=
de, 
=C2=A0
1. cleaning up the previous homam residues, 
2. putting new alu=
minium foil in the homa kunda and below the homakunda, 
3. putting aluminiu=
m foils before the homa kunda where I keep the ghee so that any spills woul=
d happen on the foil, 
4.cleaning the Kalasa, putting chandan and kumkum fo=
r kalas, putting askshatas pouring water, putting a flower in the kalasa.
5=
. preparing an oil lamp
6. putting darbhas around the homa kunda
7. putting=
 starter wood block in the homa kunda along with camphor and darbhas
8. mel=
ting the gree 
=C2=A0
All these take from 15-20 minutes. If I have time, I =
do have a ninth step of cooking some food for mahanaivedyam which takes an =
additional 20-30 minutes. With all these, doing a homam and regular pooja i=
n=C2=A0a different place is really difficult on a daily basis. But I want t=
o do that. Any ideas for keeping it simple?

In the past, I have asked exactly the sa=
me question.

If you are not already doing sandhyAvandana and aupAsana (and=
 are
doing homa), don't worry about it. Just skip this mail altogether. If
=
you are doing sandhyAvandana, don't want to stop doing it (because of
the g=
uilt factor), and want to better integrate it with homa, this
mail may be o=
f some limited value. I have studied several
sandhyAvandana, aupAsana and h=
oma manuals.

Many traditions split sandhyAvandana into two parts: (a) puri=
ficatory
rites and (b) gAyatri-japa. If you want to integrate with homa, do=

homa between parts (a) and (b). The first part, with the mArjana etc
hardl=
y takes 1-2 minutes. After that, do the homa. After the purnahuti
etc, you =
can do the second part of sandhyAvandana (gayatri japa)
starting with the A=
vAhana. Spend as much time in this meditation as
you can. Then, you can do =
the upasthAna etc, which will add another 2
minutes or so. Consider skippin=
g all the elaborate nyAsas, and the
repeated prAnAyAmas.

Really speaking, =
everything important is already there in the homa
manual. From the "full sa=
ndhyAvandana" procedure, you can pull in a
few veda mantras if you choose t=
o. But, it really isn't necessary.

If you look at aupAsana procedures, you=
 will find that Narasimha's
manual is more elaborate than the aupAsana. Hom=
a is basically a
superset of aupAsana. Where the manual differs, it is more=
 relevant
for our modern lifestyle, and you don't need to add anything to i=
t.
Frankly, I basically follow Narasimha's manual, but say "aupAsana" in
th=
e sankalpa. They are that similar. The fire in which you do
"upAsana" is "a=
upAsana".

bhavadiiyaH,

ajit
