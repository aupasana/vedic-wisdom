The Buddhist and the Jaina order of ascetics had its equal share of world-r=
enouncing nuns as of its famous monks.

Nearer our times, a most brilliant =
example of a woman sannyasini is that of the great Bhairavi Brahmani who wa=
s the tantric guru of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa. She was a fiery example =
of wonderful renunciation, great boldness and courage, that distinguished h=
er out as a fearless yogini.Among the later lady devotees of Sri Ramakrishn=
a, and the holy Mother Saradamani Devi, the name of Gauri Mata should be me=
ntioned. She felt the call for the higher life from her very girlhood and r=
esisting all efforts of her relatives to get her married she renounced home=
 and hearth and became a sannyasini. She wandered about fearlessly in many =
parts of India and performed severe austerities in the Himalayas, and later=
 on, in Brindavan.

Yogini Mata is another such lady and an associate of Ga=
uri Mata. She was a highly spiritual lady living a life of great detachment=
 and intense continuous sadhana. She had performed the purnabhisheka ceremo=
ny of the tantras as well as the viraja homa of the Vedas, both indicative =
of having renounced the worldly life completely. The present Durga Mata of =
Saradeshwari Ashram, Calcutta, is a similar sannyasini.
