I would not use the fungi infected ones or the ones that look spoilt. Sayin=
g that, it becomes difficult to judge which ones are good as sometimes the =
dryness is more with no fungi.

For poornahuti I use half coconut although =
I used a full coconut only once. I see Sh Narasimha's video and he uses hal=
f coconut for poornahuti and I just went with what he does :-)
