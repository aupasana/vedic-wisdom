 Ashtavakra said:

Abandon desire, the enemy, along with gain, itself so fu=
ll of loss, and the
good deeds which are the cause of the other two -- prac=
tice indifference to
everything. 10.1

Look on such things as friends, land=
, money, property, wife, and bequests as
nothing but a dream or a magician'=
s show lasting three or five days. 10.2

Wherever a desire occurs, see sams=
ara in it. Establishing yourself in firm
dispassion, be free of passion and=
 happy. 10.3

The essential nature of bondage is nothing other than desire,=
 and its
elimination is known as liberation. It is simply by not being atta=
ched to
changing things that the everlasting joy of attainment is reached. =
10.4

You are one, conscious and pure, while all this is inert non-being.
I=
gnorance itself is nothing, so what is the point of wanting to understand?
=
10.5

Kingdoms, children, wives, bodies, pleasures -- these have all been l=
ost to
you life after life, attached to them though you were. 10.6

Enough =
of wealth, sensuality, and good deeds. In the forest of samsara the
mind ha=
s never found satisfaction in these. 10.7

How many births have you not don=
e hard and painful labour with body, mind,
and speech. Now at last, stop! 1=
0.8


Ashtavakra said:

Unmoved and undistressed, realising that being, non=
-being and change are of
the very nature of things, one easily finds peace.=
 11.1

At peace, having shed all desires within, and realising that nothing=
 exists
here but the Lord, the Creator of all things, one is no longer atta=
ched to
anything. 11.2

Realising that misfortune and fortune come in their=
 own time from fortune,
one is contented, one's senses under control, and d=
oes not like or dislike.
11.3

Realising that pleasure and pain, birth and =
death are from destiny, and that
one's desires cannot be achieved, one rema=
ins inactive, and even when acting
does not get attached. 11.4

Realising t=
hat suffering arises from nothing other than thought, dropping
all desires =
one rids oneself of it, and is happy and at peace everywhere.
11.5

Realisi=
ng, "I am not the body, nor is the body mine. I am awareness," one
attains =
the supreme state and no longer remembers things done or undone.
11.6

Real=
ising, "I alone exist, from Brahma down to the last clump of grass," one
be=
comes free from uncertainty, pure, at peace, and unconcerned about what
has=
 been attained or not. 11.7

Realising that all this varied and wonderful w=
orld is nothing, one becomes
pure receptivity, free from inclinations, and =
as if nothing existed, one
finds peace. 11.8


Janaka said:

First of all I=
 was averse to physical activity, then to lengthy speech, and
finally to th=
ought itself, which is why I am now established. 12.1

In the absence of de=
light in sound and the other senses, and by the fact
that I am myself not a=
n object of the senses, my mind is focused and free
from distraction -- whi=
ch is why I am now established. 12.2

Owing to the distraction of such thin=
gs as wrong identification, one is
driven to strive for mental stillness. R=
ecognising this pattern I am now
established. 12.3

By relinquishing the se=
nse of rejection and acceptance, and with pleasure
and disappointment ceasi=
ng today, brahmin -- I am now established. 12.4

Life in a community, then =
going beyond such a state, meditation and the
elimination of mind-made obje=
cts -- by means of these I have seen my error,
and I am now established. 12=
.5

Just as the performance of actions is due to ignorance, so their abando=
nment
is too. By fully recognising this truth, I am now established. 12.6

=
Trying to think the unthinkable, is doing something unnatural to thought.
A=
bandoning such a practice therefore, I am now established. 12.7

He who has=
 achieved this has achieved the goal of life. He who is of such a
nature ha=
s done what has to be done. 12.8


Janaka said:

The inner freedom of havin=
g nothing is hard to achieve, even with just a
loin-cloth, but I live as I =
please, abandoning both renunciation and
acquisition. 13.1

Sometimes one e=
xperiences distress because of one's body, sometimes because
of one's speec=
h, and sometimes because of one's mind. Abandoning all of
these, I live as =
I please in the goal of human life. 13.2

Recognising that in reality no ac=
tion is ever committed, I live as I please,
just doing what presents itself=
 to be done. 13.3

Yogis who identify themselves with their bodies are insi=
stent on fulfilling
and avoiding certain actions, but I live as I please ab=
andoning attachment
and rejection. 13.4

No benefit or loss comes to me by =
standing, walking or lying down, so
consequently I live as I please whether=
 standing, walking or sleeping.13.5

I lose nothing by sleeping and gain no=
thing by effort, so consequently I
live as I please, abandoning success and=
 failure. 13.6

Continually observing the drawbacks of such things as pleas=
ant objects, I
live as I please, abandoning the pleasant and unpleasant. 13=
.7


Janaka said:

He who by nature is empty-minded, and who thinks of thin=
gs only
unintentionally, is freed from deliberate remembering like one awak=
ened from
a dream. 14.1

When my desire has been eliminated, I have no weal=
th, friends, robbers,
senses, scriptures or knowledge. 14.2

Realising my s=
upreme self-nature in the Person of the Witness, the Lord,and
the state of =
desirelessness in bondage or liberation, I feel no inclination
for liberati=
on. 14.3

The various states of one who is free of uncertainty within, and =
who
outwardly wanders about as he pleases like an idiot, can only be known =
by
someone in the same condition. 14.4


Ashtavakra said:

While a man of p=
ure intelligence may achieve the goal by the most casual of
instruction, an=
other may seek knowledge all his life and still remain
bewildered. 15.1

Li=
beration is distaste for the objects of the senses. Bondage is love of the
=
senses. This is knowledge. Now do as you wish. 15.2

This awareness of the =
truth makes an eloquent, clever and energetic man
dumb, stupid and lazy, so=
 it is avoided by those whose aim is enjoyment.
15.3

You are not the body,=
 nor is the body yours, nor are you the doer of actions
or the reaper of th=
eir consequences. You are eternally pure consciousness,
the witness, in nee=
d of nothing -- so live happily. 15.4

Desire and anger are objects of the =
mind, but the mind is not yours, nor
ever has been. You are choiceless awar=
eness itself and unchanging -- so live
happily. 15.5

Recognising oneself i=
n all beings, and all beings in oneself, be happy, free
from the sense of r=
esponsibility and free from preoccupation with "me." 15.6

Your nature is t=
he consciousness, in which the whole world wells up, like
waves in the sea.=
 That is what you are, without any doubt, so be free of
disturbance. 15.7

=
Have faith, my son, have faith. Don't let yourself be deluded in this. You
=
are yourself the Lord, whose very nature is knowledge, and you are beyond
n=
atural causation. 15.8

The body invested with the senses stands still, and=
 comes and goes. You
yourself neither come nor go, so why bother about them=
? 15.9

Let the body last to the end of the Age, or let it come to an end r=
ight now.
What have you gained or lost, who consist of pure consciousness? =
15.10

Let the world wave rise or subside according to its own nature in yo=
u, the
great ocean. It is no gain or loss to you. 15.11

My son, you consis=
t of pure consciousness, and the world is not separate
from you. So who is =
to accept or reject it, and how, and why? 15.12

How can there be either bi=
rth, karma, or responsibility in that one
unchanging, peaceful, unblemished=
, and infinite consciousness which is you?
15.13

Whatever you see, it is y=
ou alone manifest in it. How can bracelets, armlets
and anklets be differen=
t from the gold they are made of? 15.14

Giving up such distinctions as "He=
 is what I am," and "I am not that,"
recognise that "Everything is myself,"=
 and be without distinction and happy.
15.15

It is through your ignorance =
that all this exists. In reality you alone
exist. Apart from you there is n=
o one within or beyond samsara. 15.16

Knowing that all this is just an ill=
usion, one becomes free of desire, pure
receptivity, and at peace, as if no=
thing existed. 15.17

Only one thing has existed, exists and will exist in =
the ocean of being. You
have no bondage or liberation. Live happily and ful=
filled. 15.18

Being pure consciousness, do not disturb your mind with thou=
ghts of for and
against. Be at peace and remain happily in yourself, the es=
sence of joy.
15.19

Give up meditation completely but don't let the mind h=
old on to anything.
You are free by nature, so what will you achieve by for=
cing the mind? 15.20
