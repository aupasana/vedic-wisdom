Dear Prasad,

Since the goal is inner transformation, look for inner validation. Pick =
a

Examine your mind each and every day. See if you truly lived, laughed an=

<DIV align=3Dleft><FONT color=3D#000000=
 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana>1. Perfect devotion to any one form of god is enou=
gh to take care of all aspects of one's life. Though different forms work d=
ifferently in the short run (though they lead to the same thing in the long=
 run), choosing forms based on horoscope is not foolproof. I have studied v=
arious classics and modern works on astrology and know the subject as thoro=
ughly as anybody on earth today. I can declare confidently that astrology i=
s not reliable for deciding the deities to worship.</FONT></DIV>

ecides the nature of one's worship is not just the name used for the deity =
and the prayer used, but also the intention and attitude. The vibrations cr=
eated in the consciousness are a function of which deity/prayer is used and=
 with which intention/attitude.</FONT></DIV>

 As we pray, god gives what we seek. He also creates situations that make u=
