Namaste,

This is a unique case from Muslim community because the person ac=
tually handled the pressure from his own community. If such truly "Vedic" M=
uslims are bold enough to assert themselves overcoming almost insurmountabl=
e opposition from their community, real positive change will be visible.

Utpal
