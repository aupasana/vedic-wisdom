For the illiterate souls like me who have barely learnt enough Samskritam (=
or not), I request Narasimhagaru (& Ajit, who is very well qualified too) t=
o clarify - I spent nearly an hour mulling over this sentence, and I still =
don't get it:-
"The first consonant in "Siva" or "Shiva" (S or Sh) should b=
e pronounced similar to "s" in the English words "saturn" or "sam" or "savv=
y"."

I entered these three words into iTrans, and I think I understand the=
 different output for:
(1) siva
(2) shiva
(3) shhiva

However, for the life=
 of me, I can't see the same pronunciation for the "s" sound in (2) or (3) =
above being used for Sam or Saturn?
Perhaps, some audio recording(s) upload=
ed would help?

My apologies for testing your patience in advance!!
