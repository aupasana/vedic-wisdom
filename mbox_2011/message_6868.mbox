Hello

1. There is hardly any smoke with proper use of ghee (you will know =
the ratio when you do it).

2. If you can manage fire alarm inside apart or=
 have a balcony then you should definetly do homam.

3. The simple procedur=
e at the end of homam manual is the best to start with. so dotn wait for an=
ything just start with Ganapati homam. Homam is extremely powerful. Do what=
ever you can to start with ganapati homam. You are welcome to ask more ques=
tion in this forum.

4. If not possible daily you can do weekly homam but d=
o regular sadhana. Pick any mantra/strotra of your favorite Diety and chant=
 it for 1 hr with full devotion and sincerity.

5. For non homam sadhana - =
I suggest start with ganapati mool mantra for atleast 444 times (around 45m=
in) for 40days and see the result yourself.

regards
priyank
