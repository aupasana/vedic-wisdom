Hi,
=A0=A0=A0=A0 I've been unable to write because I am caring for someone =
and so lots of tension.
But as Eakadasi cycle just started nearly 17 days a=
go, I=A0will try=A0to write my experience.
I do Eakadasi vrat every 15 days=
.
=A0I do this vrat for spiritual upliftment and not to give my 
system any=
 detox. My focus is on spiritual growth.
=A0
I have a personal temple or al=
tar in my home where e,very thing that is cooked in our kitchen
is offered =
with devotion and also cooked food that comes from outside. I remember once=
 I was 
talking to Utpal on yahoo and I said I have just made tea and I am =
offering to Deities. I thought
he was a bit surprised that I am offering te=
a.
=A0
Anyway, everyday food is very normal indian sattvic=A0vegetarian foo=
d.but on Eakadasi day only
potato or sweet potato=A0cooked in ghee or butte=
r=A0 are offered and fruits and then I take that as 
prasad. I keep all pot=
s and spoons etc used in cooking away from other=A0utensils. I also take te=
a 
and aspirin during the day=A0but avoid taking several other vitamins etc=
.
=A0
I am doing this vrat for=A0many years and few times tried to stop it =
but received spiritual nudges that I 
should keep it on. Then=A0some years =
back,=A0a relation sent us a booklet about Eakadasi vrat from america, I sa=
id to my=A0mother why
she has sent this book to us. My mother said that her=
 mother-in- law has given=A0this book to her and she 
wants us to read it. =
As I was looking through it I saw that on Eakadasi day, one should not drin=
k water from a conch. I knew immediately it has come for me because everyda=
y in the morning I drink water from a conch after saying prayers.
It gave s=
uch a feeling of joy that Eakadasi Deviji was watching me.
