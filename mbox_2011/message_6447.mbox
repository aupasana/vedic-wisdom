Thank you both for the excellent commentary on Swami Sivananda's words, a=
nd the wisdom regarding sannyasa and family life.

I remember being slightl=
y offended, and somewhat concerned about my apparently toxic nature, on rea=
ding in Sivananda's "Practice of Brahmacharya" that "women are the flames o=
f vice; they are burning fire, which destroys man like a dry straw."  But h=
e obviously anticipated this reaction, because he follows several more line=
s with this explanation:

"Lust is a potent force, very difficult to be got=
 rid of. That is the reason why the Sastras and saints censure and condemn =
women in order to create dispassion and discrimination in men and wean them=
 from lustful tendencies and aggressive attacks. Sri Sankara, Sri Dattatrey=
a, Sri Rama, Sri Tulasidas have all criticised women not out of hatred, pre=
judice or dislike, but out of compassion for elevating people from the quag=
mire of Samsara. Their criticism of women implies and includes criticism of=
 man also. Their criticism aims at weaning the minds of worldly persons fro=
m sexual sin and creating disgust for sexual pleasure, and dispassion for w=
orldly objects. This is misunderstood by people.

The same scriptures and s=
aints who censure women in one place praise them in another.  They say, 'Wo=
men should be honoured. They are Ardhanginis. They are manifestations of Sa=
kti or the energy of the Lord. Only those who honour women can attain prosp=
erity.'...

The minds of young people are saturated with impure Samskaras a=
nd Vasanas owing to vicious company and the false modern civilization. Even=
 the company or talk of a woman is quite sufficient to drag the mind into v=
icious thoughts. So, I have to place before the minds of the vast majority =
such a mental picture that the very company of women will do havoc. When I =
say that a woman is only a leather bag, I do not hate women in any way. It =
is only to produce disgust and induce Vairagya. Really, a woman should be a=
dored as Mother Sakti. She is the creatrix, generatrix and nourisher of the=
 universe. She must be revered. In India, religion is preserved and maintai=
ned only through the devotional element in women. Devotion is a fundamental=
 characteristic of Hindu ladies. Hate lust, but not women."

I absolutely a=
gree that disgust for anyone - family members, women, or anybody else - is =
simply another form of attachment and not beneficial to anyone.  But part o=
f Swami Sivananda's way seems to be the use of discomfiting and unpleasant =
language, to either startle the reader into a different sort of understandi=
ng, or touch a nerve with someone who might be on the fence about the topic=
 he's discussing.  I think the term "leeches," and his disparaging remarks =
about family in general, may be intended to accomplish a similar goal as hi=
nted in the discussion above - to shock a sluggish, worldly mind into reali=
zation.

If nothing else, controversial wording can change ideas by sparkin=
g discussion - and here we all are, discussing sannyasa on a Friday morning=
 (or Saturday afternoon, for some!) instead of doing more worldly things. :=
