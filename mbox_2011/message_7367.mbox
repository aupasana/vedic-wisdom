Subject: Sani homam throws up ash
X-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=137531079; y=geiI7JRfrO3YtWe1zXY916sonmo1rUbv2aSl6BAAbY2gXnO_rHtIwUTrMjwQ

I have done Sani homam for the first time on my own today. I feel great tha=
t I have learned this. I did the long (45 minute) procedure. As recommended=
, I have used dried coconut pieces in the fire. The fire died out a few tim=
es but within a short time I could light it again. By the end of the proced=
ure the fire was burning bright. However I notice that the fire left behind=
 fine traces of ash on the furniture, on the sofa etc.

Is there a way out =
of this? How do you all manage to do the homam without causing the fire to =
fly? There is no way I can do this outside in the balcony, in the sub-zero =
temperature. 

I may have to do the short, 10-minute homam if I do not find=
 a way solution to the ash. 

Thanks for sharing your experience.
