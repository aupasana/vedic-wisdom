Namaste,

[>...that act of homam or japam is also a karma that pushed out =
or
>blocked the older karma.]


Japam/Homam etc...are offcourse "new Karmas=
". So is it possible that it
may "nullify" bad results of some past Karmas?=
. it is understood from
your message that past results of bad karmas may be=
 blocked (for
timebeing and will be experienced some time later).

for inst=
ance, act of oblations in Fire may indeed burn away results of
some past ka=
rmas (good or bad) without actually bearng the fruits of
those?
