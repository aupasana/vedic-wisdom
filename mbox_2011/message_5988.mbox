A single Shakyamuni Buddha, a Lord Jesus Christ, a Saint Mahavira, a Lord K=
rishna, a Mahayogi Pantanjali, a Guru Nanak have a massive lasting impact o=
n the whole of humanity, so tell me something, if there was a school, insti=

ed folks by the dozens would not humanity be in better shape than it is?  W=
ould not the message of love and peace spread and penetrate society at leas=
t to a larger extent than today, where it seems to be almost non-existent? =
 OK, forget that argument, think about this, would not this saint-producing=
 factory have a line twenty miles long outside of aspirants and be all over=
 the news?  This is the Internet age, the age of information, a time where =
multiple 24/7 news channels thrive, where small news in a remote corner of =
the world shows up at your doorstep almost instantly.  So given that, would=
 not this incredible nirvana factory be the talk of the town?  Wouldn=E2=80=
=99t all the spiritual junkies be flocking to it?  But the last time I tune=
d into CNN, the news was still who just died, alas=E2=80=A6 I might have mi=
ssed the grand opening.  OK, forget that argument, think about this, the mo=
nks and yogis of old retreated to the mountains and forests for decades to =
practice meditation.  Were they mad, incompetent, or masochistic?  Were the=
y just plain dumb and clueless to the fact that there was a quick fix avail=
able?  Could it be that these potent, massive human beings just all kept mi=
ssing the short cut?  These fellows have practiced meditation for thousands=
 of years and all of them never discovered the short cut!  No, sorry my fri=
end there is no short cut, but if you are still not convinced I will contin=
ue with some more reasons below. 

Let=E2=80=99s look at life.  Getting in =
shape takes hard work, mastering an art can take a lifetime, learning a sci=
ence, skill or language can take years, but you figured that the greatest a=
rt of all, the highest accomplishment possible to man, would be made possib=

atter no matter what the salesman says.  And speaking of salesman, that is =
probably the best clue of all that something is amiss.  The one trait that =
is common across all the definitions of enlightenment is compassion.  Does =
it really make sense that a fully awakened enlightened person, who is suppo=
sed to be completely free, full of joy, bliss and compassion, decides he wo=
uld rather be a businessman and only help you if you pay him?  He decides t=

 a genuine place to help guide you, be warned - you are about to be conned.=
  No, my friend, don=E2=80=99t waste your money, there are no short cuts an=
d I will tell you something else, it is not ever possible to have one. 

En=
lightenment cannot be brought about through any act of will.  It comes on i=
ts own and goes on its own.  No formula can produce it, no method can creat=
e it, and no path can take you to it.  Any effort on your part to bring abo=
ut enlightenment only strengthens the noose of desire and perpetuates self-=
centered activity, so no outside solution can possibly work for this condit=
ion. To illuminate this point the following traditional example is often us=
ed=E2=80=A6

Think of your life as a movie.  Reality is what is happening o=
n the screen, everything that takes place is in the movie; the Truth is the=
 screen itself.  It is forever hidden by the images moving on it.  It only =
becomes visible when the movie stops playing.  Any willful attempt to stop =
the movie just adds another theme, another story line and the show goes on.=
  Any angle you undertake is another scene in your movie.  This movie has t=
o stop itself and when it does the Truth becomes visible.  All you can do i=
s watch the movie.  As you watch and study the movie you start to see its m=
onotony and meaninglessness.  You start to see the pettiness of being endle=
ssly drawn into your self-centered drama.  This is the beginning of the end=
.  Keep watching carefully, meticulously, and diligently. This watching lea=
ds to the movie ending itself.  Then you may be blessed with the Truth.  So=
 next time someone comes up to you and tries to sell you magic beads of enl=
ightenment, politely show them the garbage can.
