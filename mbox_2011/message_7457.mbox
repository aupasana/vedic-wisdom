Respected Sir, 

I wanted to ask you this long time back (4mts back) but di=
dn't feel like asking at that time for some reason. At that time I made mp3=
 of atharv shirsham from your mahaganapati homam video and got a pleasant s=
atisfaction/contentment/serenity in listening to your chanting. If i am not=
 wrong i could sense that somehow the consciousness of the person chanting =
affects strotra.

(I had mailed you that copy with request to make it avail=
able for all on your site, I didn't share or uploaded it as I didn't have y=
our permission)

For last 2 days I got a great urge to ask you again for LN=
H chanting with a note that I might have to ask through devi first. Guess I=
 jumped the note part. So dont listen to your inner voice for next few days=
, let me talk to devi first. :)

Rather than going for simpler alternative,=
 I would rather request devi to persuade you. 

But its nice to know that t=
hese kind of samput are allowed. Ofcourse its better if these directions co=
me from some serious sadhak rather than ones own inclination.

regards,
Pri=
yank
