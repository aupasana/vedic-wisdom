Namaste Nagaraj ji,

"Yendian..." was a light hearted comment which i think=
 did not go well with you. I am sorry for that.

Actually due to my good ex=
perience i know what are the peculiarities in the pronunciation of people f=
rom various states which are Gujaratis, Marathis, Uttarpradeshiya, Punjabis=
,Tamilian, Andhraites,Keralites, Oriya and Bengolis.

>Most North Indian pe=
ople I know, do not put the vowel endings, esp. >when the words end with "a=
"

This is generally true.

I would not comment on other things you mention=
ed because there is a danger of getting in to wrong track but one thing for=
 sure that be whatever Indian (south-north-east-west), everyone has their p=
eculiarities and flaws of pronunciations.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 Shri Narasimha's! You might be pronouncing with proper vowel endings but s=
urely you are an exception. Most North Indian people I know, do not put the=
 vowel endings, esp. when the words end with "a". And South Indians do not =
put a "aa" either. It is only when south indians, speak in English and they=
 have to refer to the names "rama" and "Shiva" or "Atma", they say that as =
"Raamaa", "Shivaa" or "Aatmaa" because that is how all "a" ending English n=
ouns end!

pronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the spirit of surrende=

t Veda mantras, but very few who can actually "experience" a mantra.

ra means "unperished". Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an ak=
shara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has n=

 pronounce "t" as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain =
the sound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It =

s one akshara. Because "t" has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the =
akshara "yaa" (which has the vowel "aa" as its praana) and becomes part of =
that akshara. In chhandas, "yaat" is considered one letter (one guru). When=
 you pronounce "yaat" correctly, it is difficult for the listener to know f=
or sure whether you said "yaat" or "yaak" or "yaan". It is possible if one =
listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The "t" at the end is a very qu=
ick and abrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.=

ts applies to all consonants and not just "t", though "t" is more commonly =

In the sankalpa before many poojas, people say "dharmaartha kaama moksha ch=
aturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham". This means "for attaining the purusha=
rthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (wo=
rk and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment=
)". Most people end up pronouncing "dharmaartha kaama moksha" as "dharmaard=
ha kaama moksha". It means "half of dharma, kaama and moksha". Even "siddha=
rdham" means "half attainment" and "purushaardha" means "half a human". Mis=
-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committ=
ed by many many trained priests!
