The householder cannot attain even by a hundred sacrifices what state the s=
annyasin will attain by living properly even for one night. Purified are hu=
ndred families of his ahead, and purified are three hundred families of his=
 of the past, in whose line even a single one takes to the path of sannyasa=
. The sun trembles when he sees a sannyasin, for he feels that the sannyasi=
n will break the surya-mandala32 with his force of the soul and attain immo=
rtality.=E2=80=9D
