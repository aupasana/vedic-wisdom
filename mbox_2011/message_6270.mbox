 595 The first Guru [Dakshinamurti], who taught those great munis by silenc=
e
the truth of his own supreme state, and who afterwards appeared as the gr=
eat
Guru, Sri Sankaracharya, is himself our Guru, Sri Ramana [Bhagavan].

T=
his should be self-evident.

A notion prevails among the people that a sage=
 or a perfected man must be
able to perform miracles. These miracle-working=
 powers are called siddhis.
The word literally means =E2=80=98gain=E2=80=99=
 of something. The sages make a difference
between these so-called siddhis =
and the real siddhi, whereby the whole of
samsara is transcended, and the h=
ighest state, egolessness, is reached.

596 Our Guru, Sri Ramana, tells us =
that the real siddhi [to be striven for]
is to be firmly established in the=
 natural state of the real Self, which is
ever-present in the Heart; nothin=
g else.

And since it is in the Heart, the only thing needed is to seek it =
there and
enjoy its bliss.

597 The notion that the Self has to be won is u=
ntrue, because really, from
the point of view of truth, it was never lost. =
The sages therefore say that
the real Self is ever-present.

This fact is i=
llustrated by the simile of the forgotten necklace, which was
diligently so=
ught while all the time it was on the neck of the seeker.
Those that go aft=
er the vanities of the world are enamoured of the false
siddhis because the=
y do not know that the Self is the summum bonum, the
greatest good.

598 Re=
velation teaches this truth by saying that the Self is infinite, and
all el=
se finite and trivial. He that buys the whole world by selling the
real Sel=
f is just a pauper, and is to be pitied.

The so-called siddhis are of no v=
alue because they are in samsara and are
therefore mere vanities, unreal, l=
ike the world. A saying of the same import
is attributed to Jesus, who was =
a sage.

599 Therefore, says the revelation, that supreme state is freedom =
from
poverty, and all else is only poverty. Like an emperor, the sage is ab=
ove
all wants [in a different way].

Even when going about begging [his dai=
ly meal] he is not cast down.

600 It is the deluded men with outward-turne=
d minds, hankering for worldly
enjoyments, who talk of these siddhis, namel=
y becoming minute, etc.
Revelation
mentions these siddhis for attracting th=
e dull-witted ones also to the path
for deliverance.

601 Since these are i=
n the realm of ignorance, and therefore unreal like
dream-gains, no discrim=
inating person will be deluded by them. [Of course,]
the sage is not delude=
d by these unrealities, as he has attained the supreme
state, which is the =
state of reality.

602 Though thus it has been made clear that there is no =
gain equal to the
gain of the Self, undiscriminating ones are afraid of the=
 supreme state,
believing that in it the Self will be lost.

That the Self =
is not lost there is next demonstrated by a summary of a verse
from Yoga Va=
sishtam.

603 =E2=80=98Just as, by the oncoming of spring, great qualities =
such as beauty and
so on come to trees, so to the sage who abides in the su=
preme state, come
lustre, keen intelligence and strength [of all kinds].

E=
ven a common man, without education, if he becomes somehow aware of the
rea=
l Self, becomes a centre of attraction for others and is worshipped as a
pe=
rfected one.

Also, other perfections are seen in the sage.

604 Peace of m=
ind and other good qualities, which aspirants to deliverance
have to acquir=
e and retain with effort, are natural to the sage. He is
beyond the [three]=
 qualities [sattva, rajas and tamas] and at the same time
is the abode of a=
ll good qualities.

So the conclusion is as follows.

605 So, when the ego =
is lost, there is no real loss. The supreme state
[attained on by the loss =
of the ego] is not one in which the Self is lost.
But the Self is as good a=
s lost due to the ego sense, and when this [ego
sense] is lost, there is a =
loss of this loss.

It is like a creditor unexpectedly receiving payment of=
 a debt, which he had
written off as irrecoverable.

This loss of the ego i=
s indeed an enormous gain, as shown below.

606 This complete and final los=
s of the ego is itself all these things [and
more]: righteousness, wealth, =
enjoyment [of all pleasures at once],
truthfulness, true renunciation, sile=
nce, tapas, union with God and true
surrender of oneself to Him.

Innumerab=
le gains and all manner of goodness are comprised in egolessness.

The thin=
gs that have the same names as the items on this list are next shown
to be =
worthless because they are usually associated with the ego.

607 Those havi=
ng the same names [which are prized greatly] are tainted and
of little wort=
h, because of association with the ego. But these are natural
to the sage, =
who [always] dwells in the supreme state.

Another unique feature of the sa=
ge is next dealt with.

608 Two excellent qualities are stated as belonging=
 to the sage, freedom
from obligation to perform prescribed actions and at =
the same time being
contented and happy. For the common man the absence of =
these is due to his
ignorance.

The latter is bound by duties and never rea=
ches the goal of action. In the
sage these two rare good features are unite=
d and inseparable. Bhagavat Pada
Sankaracharya has given prominence to thes=
e two unique features of the sage
at the end of a long discourse that estab=
lishes the truth that illumination,
unaided, confers deliverance.

609 The =
sage is not bound to perform actions because for him there is
nothing to be=
 gained by means of action. He for whom there is an obligation
to perform a=
ctions is not free, but is bound by the fetters of delusion.

This shows up=
 well the vast difference there is between the bound and the
free.

Inciden=
tally, a question is dealt with next that shows the ignorance of the
questi=
oners.

610 Some, not knowing the truth [about sages] ask whether the sage =
does not
need to practise meditation. By others the question is raised: =E2=
=80=98Should not
the sage go to foreign countries and teach the people ther=
e?=E2=80=997

611 He that practises the meditation, =E2=80=98I am That=E2=
=80=99 is not a sage, but only a
sadhaka. If the sage meditates =E2=80=98I =
am That=E2=80=99, it would be like a man
meditating =E2=80=98I am a man=E2=
=80=99.

612 It is proper for one to remember something he has forgotten. I=
n the
world, remembrance of something not forgotten cannot occur. Since the=
 truth
of the Self is never once forgotten by the sage, how can he meditate=
 on it?

613 The true meditation on the supreme reality [the Self] is only =
to remain
as the Self in the thought-free state. This =E2=80=98meditation=
=E2=80=99 can neither be
given up, nor taken up by the sage.

This is the s=
ense of the latter half of the first benedictory verse in
Bhagavan=E2=80=99=
s =E2=80=98Forty Verses on the Real=E2=80=99. The experience of the Self by=
 the
sage in his natural state is not knowing, but being the Self. From thi=
s
state of Being there can never be a relapse to the thought =E2=80=98I am =
the body=E2=80=99.

The answer to the question about going about lecturing =
or teaching the
people all over the world is as follows.

614 Even though a=
pparently dwelling in some corner of the world, he is
really like the sky. =
While remaining always [uninterruptedly] in his own
natural state [samadhi]=
, by his power he pervades the whole world.

This power of the sage is =E2=
=80=98grace=E2=80=99, the power to bless.

615 The sage, remaining all the =
time continuously in the natural state, with
his mind utterly stilled, prot=
ects his own people even from a very great
distance by his unthinkable powe=
r of grace.

But this protection is automatic, without effort, or even cons=
cious
knowledge of doing this work of grace.

616 Does anyone worry, after =
awakening, about men seen in a dream? So too,
the sage who has awakened fro=
m the sleep of ignorance is not anxious about
those who are still in ignora=
nce.

>From his point of view no one is really ignorant.

The actions of a s=
age ought not to be judged from the ordinary, human
standpoint.

617 Since =
the sage has transcended the three grades of character, there can
be no fau=
lts in him. Whatever he does in the world is surely blameless.

618 For thi=
s reason the sage transcends the sacred books that deal with
human conduct,=
 because the mind-free one is not bound by them. Those books
are concerned =
with ignorant ones; they are subject to regulation by them
because they hav=
e the sense of being performers of activities.

The conventions of samsara =
have no place in the state of the sage.

619 By revelation the sage=E2=80=
=99s state is described as one in which the Vedas
are not Vedas, and the de=
vas [the gods] are not devas.

Incidentally, a warning is given to disciple=
s and sadhakas.

620 Though one should act upon the teachings of the sages,=
 one must not
imitate any act done by a sage.

The teachings of a sage are =
the highest authority, not their actions.

A noteworthy passage in the Gita=
 in this context is the following: =E2=80=98Even if
he kills all these peop=
le, he is not a killer, nor is he bound.=E2=80=99

Nor is the sage bound to=
 conform to any particular mode of life.
