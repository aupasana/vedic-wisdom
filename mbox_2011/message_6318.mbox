 Yoga and Science are inseparable. Science and Religion are inseparable.
Sc=
ience is part of Religion. Science and Religion are necessary
correlatives.=
 Scientists are also monists in one sense.They also
emphatically declare th=
at there is only one thing viz., Matter or Energy.

A Yogi tries to control=
 the mental forces,a scientist the physical forces.
This is all the differe=
nce between a Yogi and a scientist. A scientist is
also an unconscious Raja=
-Yogi, but his mind works in external grooves.

Before the invention of wat=
ch, Yogius used to calculate time by measuring
the shadow in day and by the=
 study of the movement of the stars in the
heavens at night. They were perf=
ectly exact in their calculations. Astronomy
and medicine received their fi=
rst impulse from the exigencies of religious
worship. Yogins have a sound p=
ractical knowledge of Ayurveda. One who
endeavours to qualify himself as hi=
s own doctor can become a Yogi.

He has to live sometimes in the jungles an=
d has to treathimself first,
whenever diseases manifest. Otherwise his Sadh=
ana will suffer and he cannot
have rapid progress in Yoga. You will find in=
 the books on Ayurveda: "A
healthy body is a good instrument for doing virt=
uous actions and practising
Yoga." Those who wrote these Ayurvedic books we=
re great Rishis and Yogins.

Science is partially unified knowledge. A scie=
ntist observes the laws of
Nature,experiements in his laboratory, investiga=
tes, infers and draws exact
conclusions from his observations. He understan=
ds Nature. But he knows
nothing of the origin or destiny of Nature! Who mad=
e the sun and gave power
to its rays?

Who combined four parts of nitrogen =
with one part of oxygen? Who gave power
to electrons? Who gave power to ato=
ms to combine into molecules? Who or what
made and bestowed upon the ultima=
te particles of matter their marvellous
power of varied interaction? Scienc=
e does not know this great mystery. On
the contrary, Yoga is completely uni=
fied knowledge. A Yogi gets inner divine
realisation.

He clearly sees with=
 his inner Yogic eyes the subtle rudiments of matter. He
identifies himself=
 with the Supreme Being who is the Lord of the Prakriti
(matter). He gets c=
ontrol over the five elements. He clearly understands the
whole mystery
of =
creation through direct intuitional knowledge. The scientist lacks this
sor=
t of knowledge. He has only experimental knowledge.

The business of scienc=
e is generalisation of phenomena; it is the function
of philosophy and Yoga=
 to explain. Religion is the practical aspect of
philosophy. Philosophy is =
the rational aspect of religion.The scientist
tries to answer the "How=E2=
=80=9D of the problem; the philosopher and the Yogi the
"Why" of it. It is =
a mistake to say that such and such an event occurs
because of certain laws=
 of Nature.

The laws of Nature do not give any real explanation of the phe=
nomena. It is
simply a
statement in terms as general as possible of what ha=
ppens under given
circumstances in his expression of an observed order or u=
niformity in a
natural phenomena. Science is concerned only with the phenom=
ena. It shows a
marvellous harmony of Nature.

But it is the problem of phi=
losophy and Yoga to solve the "Why" of Nature"s
harmony. Scientists possess=
 partial knowledge of the universe. They have not
understood the whole code=
 of Nature"s laws. They have no knowledge of the
occult side of things. The=
y have no knowledge of the astral, mental and
higher planes such as Brahma-=
Loka (world of Brahma). The unseen world is of
far greater importance than =
the sense-universe which is visible to the naked
eye.

A fully developed Yo=
gi can function in all the planes and so he has full
knowledge of the manif=
ested and unmanifested Nature. The senses by which you
get knowledge of the=
 external objects are not fully developed. Therefore the
knowledge obtained=
 is partial. The external senses are exact counterparts of
the internal ast=
ral senses. Scientists have no knowledge of the subtle
rudiments of matter.=
 Life will become fuller and richer, when one develops
this inner eye-sight=
 by the practice of Yoga.

Just as blood, when seen under the microscope, r=
eveals many mysterious
things such as leucocytes, lymphocytes, nuclei, pigm=
ent,germs, bacilli,
etc., so also the inner Yogic eye reveals many mysterie=
s of the hidden side
of things.The knowledge of the scientists is only frag=
mentary or partial
whereas the knowledge of the Yogi is
full and perfect.

=
Scientists have to learn many things from the Seers of the East. Who gave
p=
ower to the electrons to revolve? Who gave life to the cell or the
protopla=
sm? What is that power that unites atoms to form molecules? Who gave
intell=
igence to the cells to secrete milk or bile or gastric juice from the
blood=
? Scientists are still observing and experimenting.

They are still groping=
 in darkness.What is the cause of the origin of an
impulse? Who is the dire=
ctor of the mind? What is the cause of the origin of
thought? Even if all t=
he living scientists were to put their heads together
to solve these questi=
ons, they cannot give definite conclusive answers.

But I do not mean to co=
ndemn the wonderful discoveries and inventions that
modern
science has cont=
ributed to the vast store of knowledge and happiness which
the present gene=
ration enjoys today. The radio, the aeroplane, the
microphone and other mar=
vels of science are bound to baffle human
intelligence. Scientists have fou=
nd ways to fertilize an ovum with
chemicals, without the help of semen. It =
is stupendous success. Some
children are also born.

They inject the semen =
that is obtained from renowned and cultured men of the
world in order to im=
prove the race. They are attempting to fix a radio in a
match-stick. They a=
re trying to get the necessary nutrition to the body by
pressing an electri=
c button, so that eating and defecation may be entirely
abandoned.

They ar=
e endeavouring to make the streets move so that there will be no
necessity =
for motor-cars and carriages. They are trying to establish means
of communi=
cation with the planet Mars. They may succeed in all their
attempts.

May G=
od bless them with roaring success in all their undertakings! But the
quest=
ion is: Can all these comforts and scientific discoveries and
inventions gi=
ve immortality,eternal satisfaction and everlasting peace? Have
these mater=
ial comforts enhanced human happiness? Is not man more restless
today than =
ever before? Is he not more dissatisfied and discontented despite
all these=
 comforts? Life has become more complex and intricate. Luxuries are
increas=
ing day by day. Even a rich man finds it difficult to make both ends
meet.
=

There is only one remedy for all these ills. You will have to abandon all
=
luxuries and go back to simple natural living,if you want to enjoy real and=

lasting happiness. Immortality can be attained by realising the Self throu=
gh
simple living, practice of Yoga, self-control, mental discipline and
med=
itation.

Matter exists in different conditions or states viz., solid, liqu=
id and
gaseous. The conditions may be made to change by variation of pressu=
re and
temperature. Water is turned into ice at a low temperature and steam=
 at a
higher temperature.

Every solid may become a liquid or gas under sui=
table conditions; every
liquid may be rendered solid or gaseous; every gas =
may be made liquid or
solid. One form of energy can be also transmuted into=
 another form of
energy. Heat can be transmuted into light and light into e=
lectricity. Even
so, seminal energy or muscular energy, anger,
etc., can be=
 transmuted into spiritual energy (Ojas-Shakti).

There is life in the mine=
ral kingdom. This has been conclusively proved by
the experiments of Prof. =
Von Schron at Naples. Even the elements manifest
distinct preference.One el=
ement has a strong liking for the company of
another. One element may even =
give up the company of one substance in order
to join another element.

Thi=
s is chemical affinity. Every chemist fully knows this well. Hydrogen
likes=
 the company of oxygen. Two molecules of hydrogen combine with one
molecule=
 of oxygen. Water is formed. If you place sodium in the water, you
will not=
ice that oxygen
likes sodium better than hydrogen and immediately abandons =
the company of
hydrogen and joins sodium.

Likes and dislikes are more mark=
edly present in the vegetable kingdom,than
in the mineral.Many plants exhib=
it a remarkable degree of ingenuity in
accomplishing their ends.

It is imp=
ossible humanly to imagine how the earth, for instance, can move
along the =
same track which it was following for aeons up to this time, as if
thers is=
 a set of rails laid down on its path in space.
