The Sadguru is Brahman Himself. He is an ocean of bliss, knowledge, and mer=
cy. He is the captain of your soul. He is the fountain of joy. He removes a=
ll your troubles, sorrows, and obstacles. He shows you the right divine pat=
h.

He tears your veil of ignorance. He makes you immortal and divine. He t=
ransmutes your lower, diabolical nature. He gives you the rope of knowledge=
, and takes you up when you are drowning in this ocean of Samsara (cycle of=
 birth and death). Do not consider him to be only a man. If you take him as=
 a man, you are a beast. Worship your Guru and bow to him with reverence.

=
Guru is God. A word from him is a word from God. He need not-teach anything=
. Even his presence or company is elevating, inspiring, and stirring, His v=
ery company is self-illumination. Living in his company is spiritual educat=
ion. Read the Granth-saheb (the holy scripture of the Sikh religion). You w=
ill come to know the greatness of the Guru.

Man can learn only from man, a=
nd hence God teaches through a human body. In your Guru, you have your huma=
n ideal of perfection. He is the pattern into which you wish to mould yours=
elf. Your mind will readily be convinced that such a great soul, is fit to =
be worshipped and revered.
