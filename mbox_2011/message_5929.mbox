----------------------------------------------------
May i please request y=

-matter and please give comment=
s-suggestion.
...for this wonderful spritual experience..in dreams...

I wi=
sh to know that ..
how we should treat if some one feels that "he has been =
given diksha in dream" ?

=A0should he take it seriously and consider himse=
lf dikshit ?
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 or
=A0he should forget it and take it as a simple matter. not dikshit

=
Here is a the description of the dream incidence as naratted by my friend.
=

His back ground story is that "he is a house holder, and have a good
faith=
 in Gods/occult Science/ Dreams / Sprituality/ and Tantra
Mantra..etc. But =
NOT DIKSHIT...
He has been doing puja of Mata in the form of Bagulamukhi + =
Durga +
Lord Shiva mostly since=A0 long time.(Several Years=A0 10+).

His D=
ream Incidence:-
One Morning He saw a dream that "he is going in the train.=
.and feels
that he is passing by the side of=A0 Mata Bagalamukhi Mandir", D=
atia.

On return journey he gets off the train near Mandir. and go inside t=
he
mandir for mata darshan...
mandir is closed and some renovation work is =
going on. But still he
sits on ground saying that "mandir is closed, but ma=
ta is present in
sorrounding, so no problem..and he sits on ground.".

Ther=
e he is approached by a Senoir Pujari--he feels a feeling of
GURU-bhakti=A0=
 for the pujari.
He wanted to talk/discuss to GURU ji=A0 Re:diksha matter..=

But The Guru ji did not gave chance to speak and asked him to Come Close.
=

In Dream he feel that this GURU ji already knows Everything about his
Curi=
osity and his Icchha.

Guru asks him about Importance of Cow Dung...Gobar. =
he replies
satisfactory about importance of gobar from vedic point of view
=
etc.etc. here....some discussions.....

then Guru ji asks him to put Gobar =
on his own head (friend).
he does. he takes around a Kilo and Covers Whole =
Head.

Then GURU ji Keeps Talking about other puja matter...while Doing som=
e
Formalities.
Guru ji=A0 also says that in Garbh-Grih only He with his=A0 =
Some selected
dikhit -Sishya do puja..other people not allowed.
My friend s=
ays that, "He Knows He has heard/read about this".

My Friend in dreams Str=
ongly Feels That he is getting Diksha. (Guru ji
is Giving Diksha).
(as guru=
 ji doing some mantra jaap....touching his head several times)

After this =
Guru ji Instructs his one disciple to bring the Mata
Bagalamukhi Idol from =
Garbh-Grih and let the Friend do Darshan. which
he did..

After that guru j=
i tells him,=A0 "have you decided your Diksha Name"
My friend tells No, "bu=
t i will be happy whatever name you decide for me".

Guru tell him,"from to=
day your name will be Dityanand".
my friend touches the Guru Ji feet. Guru =
ji blessed him...

and dream breaks.......

My friend feels very happy on w=
aking up ....very energetic.....
He notes down=A0 some important point of d=
ream.(so he does not forget later)

He Notes:
Time- 04:20 am,=A0 Wednesday =
Morning.
Day- Shivaratri Day,
Date-2nd -March-2011, Early Morning.
Krishna =
Pachh-Trayodashi Thithi.

He remembers that: The guru ji did not tell any p=
articular mantra to him.
So he assumes that probably the puja vidhi and man=
tra=A0 is ok. whatever he does.

The Guru ji in Dreams was a Thin person in=
 the age of 60-70, with some
small=A0 white beards.
The place in dreams he =
feels about Datia.

your comments will be highly appreciated.....

thanks
