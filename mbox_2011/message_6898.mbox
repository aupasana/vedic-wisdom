Some others say, =E2=80=9CWe can find out good and evil, right and wrong, b=
y consulting our conscience only.=E2=80=9D No individual will be able to do=
 this by consulting his conscience merely. Conscience will not help you unl=
ess you have reached the height of purity and understanding. The impure con=
science cannot give right suggestions. The pig thinks that the whole world =
is full of pigs only, and that it itself is nothing more than a pig. Simila=
r is the fate of those men of little understanding with an impure conscienc=
e who try to think for themselves and get suggestions from their conscience=
. Conscience is one=E2=80=99s own habit and conviction. The conscience of t=
he individual speaks in accordance with his tendencies, proclivities, incli=
nations, education, habits, passion and the like. The conscience of a savag=
e speaks a language entirely different from that of a civilized European. H=
ow can you depend upon this false so-called conscience? The conscience of a=
n aboriginal brute speaks a language entirely different from that of an eth=
ically developed yogi of India. The sense of duty ingrained in the clerk of=
 a collectorate, a car-driver, a scavenger, are all different. There are te=
n different consciences in ten different persons of the same district. Viro=
chana thought for himself, took guidance from his conscience, and enquired =
=E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D But with what result? He =E2=80=9Crealized=E2=
=80=9D that the body is the Self.
