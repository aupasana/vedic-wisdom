Dear Narasimha,

Excellent description of the process. What do you recommen=
d for people
trying to start this homam in a closed apartment. I know fire =
alrarms will
go off, I think I can manage that part. But beyond that, to ke=
ep the flame
levels to a more manageable size and yet not create a havoc ar=
ound?

I've been sincerely thinking of starting this as a daily ritual and =
could
not get to the first step. I think Bagavathechha is important to begi=
n.

Thanks,
Srinivas
