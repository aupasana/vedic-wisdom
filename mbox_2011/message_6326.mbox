Namaste PVR

After reading this post of your, i got confident and wanted to=
 try the most simplified homam and feel the difference.

Earlier i was shor=
t homam procedure with vishnu sahastranaam (i dont know the meaning of 75% =
of the words and also dotn the correct pronunciation for many words)

After=
 your post i did short homam procedure with "108 om namo narayanaye" mantra=
 and Hari strotra whose meaning i know. I felt a huge/warm/friendsly connec=
tion to the whole process, the meditation after wards was also beautiful. T=
his short homam + meditation (15min+15min) was atleast 50 times better than=
 vishnu sahastranaam homam.

Once i am able to perfect this devotion/connec=
tion then i will slowly move to Vishnu sahastranam homam. for time being i =
do VS puja separately in morning.

Also to bring my mind on the glories of =
Narayan, before homam i read 1 dasakam/chapter(10 shloks)of narayaneeyam. (=
1 chapter contain 10 shloks and it is summary study in poetic form of the B=
hagavata Purana. total 100 chapters)(One chapter one day takes only
5min an=
d gives mind new food of Narayans glory)(I read it for myself in english to=
 know the glories myself)

thank you PVR so much for all your guidance.

gards
