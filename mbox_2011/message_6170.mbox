Namaste Nagaraj Ji,

Thank you for giving your views and i understand that=
 there is no State
wise bias in you and same is with me. I absolutely disli=
ke about those
divide and on this backdrop i am giving my views.

***

My v=
iews are based on Devanagari script in which we find Sanskrit
language writ=
ten.

***
First let me take GANAPATI. I agree to your views.

In Sanskrit l=
anguage which is always found witten in Devanagari script,
Ta & Tha are dif=
ferent consonants and obviously their pronunciation is
different. and as Ga=
napati is always *found* written as "GanapaTI" and
NOT "GanapaTHI", The pro=
nunciation of  "TI" is correct one which is same
as it comes in "MaTI" or "=
BhranTI" or "SaTI" etc... to pronounce as
"Thi" in Ganapati is definately I=
ncorrect.

***

[>>>In my observation, most North Indians, replace "S" with=
 "sh" and
write Lord Siva as Lord Shiva and also=C2 refer to him as "Shivji=
".<<<]

Good that you came out with this point. that was also my one of the=

pending point w.r.t ponunciation.

Here i disgree. In My opinion, "SHiva" =
is correct Pronunciation where as
"Siva" is incorrect one.

i just finished=
 reading Durga SaptaShati. Take "SaptaShloki Durga".  It
Starts with "SHIV =
uvaach". It does not mention "SIVA uvaach".  in the
same 7 verses, we have =
"...SHUbham dadaSI". now it is vey clear that SH
in Shubham AND SI in dadas=
i are diffeent consonants and should have
diffent sound assigned. so for co=
rrect reading, SHUbham should be
pronounced as SHu as in SHobha and dadaSI =
should be pronounced as Si as
in ManaSi, VaranaSi etc...

Take one more exa=
mple. "SHive Sarvartha Sadhike..." Consonant in SHive
and Sarvarth are diff=
erent. hence SHive is correct in the first word and
it is incorrect to pron=
ounce it as SIve.

***

Please think over the above and give me your views.=


Best Regards,

Utpal

I have gone thru this and my observations are exactly like Shri
Narasimha's=
! You might be pronouncing with proper vowel endings but
surely you are an =
exception. Most North Indian people I know, do not put
the vowel endings, e=
sp. when the words end with "a". And South Indians
do not put a "aa" either=
. It is only when south indians, speak in
English and they have to refer to=
 the names "rama" and "Shiva" or
"Atma", they say that as "Raamaa", "Shivaa=
" or "Aatmaa" because that is
how all "a" ending English nouns end!

 the recent times I was pondering about how north Indians
speak Hindi, wher=
e they reduce most of the words to "Halanthas", like
"Shiv", "Ram", "Krishn=
" and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones
of Sanskrit that a conson=
ant cannot exist by itself and its life is
given by the Vowel. But for what=
ever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid
ending vowels. They carry that habit=
 to other languages as well and
recently I heard one of the North Indian bh=
ajan singers (I don't know
the name) singing Adi Sankara's Bhaja Govindam a=
s "Bhaj govindam, bhaj
govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE", which sounded =
quite odd to me! And
they take that approach to languages like Braj Bhasha =
and Avadhi as
well. For instance, for them "Ramacharita Manasa" is more imp=
ortant than
even Valmiki's Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also without=
 proper
vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that approach=
 is
incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like "Sri Gurucharana
> > Saroja

Gurucharan=
 saroj raj". You may shed more light on this aspect as well.

 Most priests and
scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. They change "t=
" to something
like "tu" or "ttu" or "ti" or "tti". There is a reason why t=
his
corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption nevertheless.

letter/syllable=
/akshara. If you change it into "yaattu" or "yaatu" by
adding a vowel sound=
 at the end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases
the number of aksharas=
, changes the chhandas and changes the meaning
also. You may still experien=
ce something when meditating on the mantra,
but you will never experience t=
he mantra to the fullest with that
pronunciation.
> > > > >
> > > > > Aksha=
ra means "unperished". Vowels (swaras) are the praana
(life force) of an ak=
shara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel
after it, then it has n=
o praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It
perishes. For example, if you=
 pronounce "t" as is (without adding any
sounds to it), you cannot sustain =
the sound and the listener cannot
decipher what exactly you pronounced. It =
has no life force.
> > > > >
> > > > > In "prachodayaat", the whole sound "=
yaat" is one akshara.
Because "t" has no praana by itself, it simply joins =
to the akshara
"yaa" (which has the vowel "aa" as its praana) and becomes p=
art of that
akshara. In chhandas, "yaat" is considered one letter (one guru=
). When
you pronounce "yaat" correctly, it is difficult for the listener to=
 know
for sure whether you said "yaat" or "yaak" or "yaan". It is possible =
if
one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The "t" at the end is a
=
very quick and abrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to
hear c=
learly.

 an

Probably the students thought the mantra was "yaat=
u" (instead of "yaat")
and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, th=
at became a standard
practice after a couple of centuries.

The same thing hold=

What I said about words ending in consonants applies to all

There can be words t=

normally add an artifici=

the chhandas and altering the=
 flow of energy in the mantra. That is also

<P>i just finished reading Durga SaptaShati. Take "SaptaShloki Durg=
a".  It Starts with "SHIV uvaach". It does not mention "SIVA uvaach".&=
nbsp; in the same 7 verses, we have "...SHUbham dadaSI". now it is vey clea=
r that SH in Shubham AND SI in dadasi are diffeent consonants and should ha=

<P>Take one more example. "<STRONG>SH</STRONG>ive <ST=

ter 'ta', in Ganapati, it should be the softer "ta", like "lata", "pati" an=

noticed that most of the tamilians have the habit of writing it as "Ganapat=
hi" leaving one wonder if it is the word like "katha". Their argument is th=
at if you write it as "Ganapati" then, "ti" part could be interpreted like =
the "T" in "Tea". But in my opinion it should be "ti". Transliteration sche=
mes allow "t" to represent "T" sound like in "lata", "th" to represent "T" =
sound like in "katha" and the "T" to represent "T" sound like in "ganTa - (=
bell)" and finally "Th" to represent "T" sound like in "kanTha - (like in n=
eela kanTha - Lord Shiva)". I hope I made it clear now. <BR>> =C2 <=

 "S" like lin rasa, prAsa etc. S for middle "S" like in Sree, maa Saarada, =

ndi, where they reduce most of the words to "Halanthas", like "Shiv", "Ram"=

Take the "t" sound at the end of the words like "prachodayaat", "ava purast=
aat", "sahasrapaat" etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound inc=
orrectly. They change "t" to something like "tu" or "ttu" or "ti" or "tti".=
 There is a reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corr=
uption nevertheless.<BR>> > > > > <BR>> > > > &g=
t; In "prachodayaat", the sound "yaat" as one letter/syllable/akshara. If y=
ou change it into "yaattu" or "yaatu" by adding a vowel sound at the end, i=
t becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the =
chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still experience something w=
hen meditating on the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra to t=
he fullest with that pronunciation.<BR>> > > > > <BR>> &g=
t; > > > Akshara means "unperished". Vowels (swaras) are the praan=
a (life force) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel =
after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perish=
es. For example, if you pronounce "t" as is (without adding any sounds to i=
t), you cannot sustain the sound and the listener cannot decipher what exac=

There can be words that end in "n" or "k" etc also. There also, people norm=
