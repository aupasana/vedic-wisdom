Dear Mr. Prasad,

Check the possibility of doing Homam directly under runni=
ng Exhaust fan. You may keep a wooden Plank on your Stove and keep Homa Kun=
dam on that.
Also ypu may try to complete homa with 2 or 3 cocnut Halves Ma=
ximum till you find a better solution.

I hope you dont mind my interventio=
n.

Regards,

Utpal
