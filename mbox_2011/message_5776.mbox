When the mind is concentrated and turned backward on itself, all within us =
will be our servants, not our masters. The Hindu concentrated on the intern=
al world, upon the unseen realms in the self, and developed the science of =
Yoga. Yoga is controlling the senses, will, and mind. The benefit of its st=
udy is that we learn to control instead of being controlled. Mind seems to =
be layer on layer. Our real goal is to cross all these intervening strata o=
f our being and find God.
