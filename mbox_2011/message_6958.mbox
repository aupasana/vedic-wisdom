THE SWAMI                        Sri Ramakrishna used to say, "He who
has =
denied himself

                                               for the sake=
 of God has a
strong and undisputed claim on

                             =
                  Him." As one can
endearingly demand anything of one's

  =
                                             parents or one's near
relation=
s,so a devotee has a right to ask

                                        =
       God, "Lord, appear before
me.Will you not come? You must

          =
                                     come." When a devotee is
earnest,God c=
annot remain

                                               unmoved.He has=
tens to him
and takes him on His lap.Oh,

                                 =
              how inexpressible that
joy! How boundless that bliss! He

   =
                                            alone knows it who has had
that=
 supreme experience.

                                               Compar=
ed to it,worldly
pleasures, so dear to most people,
                       =
                        become insipid and
worthless.
