Namasta Narasimhagaru
Surey pouring into the sink which is a wase water rce=
ptacle sensibly should be last option. But my understanding is that AT NO C=
OST SHOULD THE SESAME SEEDS GERMINATE AND HENCE ONE PUTS THEM INTO FLOWING =
WATER.=C2=A0 
NOW, IF the germination issue is NOT all that important then =
it makes sense to pour it at the base of a tree. The risk of germination ho=
wever will be high.
Narasimhagaru, please clarify the relative importance o=
f the GERMINATION ISSUE. 
1- is it a BETTER practice to pour at the base of=
 a ree where people dont stamp with their feet despite risk of germination?=

OR
2- is it better to pour into a waste water receptacle like sink where t=
he flowing water will ensure that there is no risk of germination?And ultim=
ately all that water ends up in some sea.. hopefully..
=C2=A0
We can follow=
 whayever you recommend.

with gratitude
dr hiramalini dseshadri

Namaste frie=
nds,

I agree with Utpal. Sink is the last option. Things poured in sink mi=
x 
with all kinds of junk.

The best option is to pour the water at the bas=
e of a plant/tree. If 
that is not possible, pour it in a place where peopl=
e usually don't 
walk. Pour in sink only if unavoidable.

Thanks,
Narasimha=
