 12th December, 1945

One morning, during the usual conversations the topic=
 turned on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
mother coming away to live with him and on he=
r manner of life, and Bhagavan
spoke to us as
follows:

=E2=80=9CMother beg=
an coming here frequently and staying with me for long periods.
You know I =
always address even beasts and birds in a respectful manner. In
the same wa=
y, I used to address Mother also with the respectful form of
speech. It the=
n occurred to me that I was doing something hurtful. So I gave
up the pract=
ice and began addressing her in the familiar way. If a practice
is natural =
and has become habitual you feel uncomfortable at changing it.
But anyway w=
hat do these bodily things matter?=E2=80=9D He spoke with deep feeling
and =
my eyes filled with tears.

Before the dawn of youth appeared on his face h=
e had relinquished all
worldly desires, and with Divine desire he hastened =
to the holy Arunachala
where he reigns
in the Kingdom of Eternal Bliss. How=
 can one speak of the enormous fortune
of that mother, in having had the pr=
ivilege of being called =E2=80=98Amma=E2=80=99 (mother)
by such a son?

In =
the Vedas, the mother holds the first claim for worship: =E2=80=9CMathru de=
vo
bhava=E2=80=9D (Let mother be your God). Even so,the beauty of it is tha=
t Bhagavan
felt it unnatural for him to address her in the respectful form.=
 If he
addressed her so, would she not feel hurt? She felt satisfied only i=
f he
addressed her as =E2=80=9CMother.=E2=80=9D Perhaps Bhagavan felt that =
he ought not to wound
her feelings in so small a matter.

=E2=80=9CWhen my =
Mother passed away I thought I had escaped bondage and could freely
move fr=
om place to place and live in solitude in some cave or other, but in
fact I=
 have now an even greater bondage; I cannot even move out.=E2=80=9D Bhagava=
n
often speaks in this way. Mother he had only one, but children he has in
=
thousands, so is not this greater bondage?
