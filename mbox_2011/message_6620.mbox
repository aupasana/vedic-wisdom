Thanks a lot for your patience and responses :-)

I browse this group occas=
ionally and I missed to ask these questions or look for answers before I st=
arted. It was a strong resolve, but wavering in between, in the last 24 hou=
rs that I shopped yes'day evening and started today.

But again, thanks for=
 all your answers. 

regards
rAma
