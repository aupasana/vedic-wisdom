Thank you Girish Ji and Srikanth Ji. And espec=

The worl=

Extremely thankful for the guidance which has cleare=

Namaste Balaji,

I have been doing Sapthasati for =
a four years now though not counting because personally I don't believe in =
counting and proclaiming it. Divine Mother will only offer a smile at our i=
gnorance though will still acknowledge.


Coming to initiation, don't break=
 your head about
 rituals as in Kali Yuga, the best option is to be sincere=
 and regular but with SUCHI( Cleanliness). Bathe well, put on clean clothes=
 and follow what I have attached.

Trust Maa completely as she knows your p=
ast lives(All the skulls in her throat are representing you past lives) and=
 knows your karmic debt too.


Buy the compact disc of "Prakash Koushik" fo=
r Devi Mahatmyam and follow the pattern indicated in the document.

If you =
cannot do any chanting on some days, atleast do Kunjika Stotram once as it =
gives you full result and is very
 powerful.

When you fear the world and i=
ts misdeeds, chant DEVI KAVACHAM" which will protect you from everything. M=
y personal take on mantras are that "Devi Mantras" are the most potent and =
are high voltage for obvious reasons as she is the manifest form of Lord Sh=
iva who is always in Unmanifest form and in deep meditation. You will be sh=
ocked to know that the kavacham protects the devotee from bomb blasts too a=
s it is stated in it.


Devi Atharvaseersham is a part of the sapthasati wh=
ich can be done thrice a day and it does indicate that MAA stays with you/ =
around you with you and protects your pysche.

If you want to chant the "Na=
varna Mantra", you would need the initiation as it needs so unless you are =
already initiated into Gayathri. People who are already initiated into Gaya=
thri are authorized to do it right away as stated in Mantra Shastra. Again,=
 no racist remark here but just an FYI.


Narasimhaji has made a wonderful
=
 document on Chandi Homa which can be followed later.

Please note that you=
r tiny steps towards evolution are being watched by Divine Mother as your o=
wn mother in the kitchen watches you in the verandah with a side glance. Th=
ere is no doubt about it that She is VERY KIND and knows the best for you.
=


I wish Maa bless you with Lot of LOVE.

Jagadambaarpanamastu.

Srikanth

 [vedic-wisdom] Query Regarding Durga Sapthashati







=
 



    
      
      
      Namaste Narasimhaji,
This is my first post, I=
'm a silent member of Vedic  Wisdom, i read all the posts and thankful to a=
ll the members of this group.
I have a query regarding reading Durga saptha=
shati. 



My query is i have a desire to read durga sapthashati, this has =
been there since more than a year or two. I got the book last year, but i s=
till haven't started reading.
The reason being i've come across all your po=
sts and people responding to your posts, i.e whether a person who has not b=
een initiated could read or should not read. I'm not able to conclude, even=
 now i'm reading the post and text by Dr. Sathya Prakash Choudhary, but sti=
ll unable to conclude.



I've read that people should be very careful whil=
e reading Durga Sapthashati, i don't know to what extent and what could be =
the consequences
I do read Aditya Hrudayam, Srisuktham, Vishnu Sahasranamam=
, Lalitha Sahasranamam, Lalitha Trishati. I don't know how i started readin=
g, no body guided me or initiated me how to read but i read it easily, when=
ever i do prayer i ask for for well being of all the people i know, sometim=
es just blessings and sometimes i don't even ask anything.



I try to foll=
ow reading for one deity continuously for N number of days, then start read=
ing for other deities and follow the same rule.
About me: I'm a bachelor ag=
ed about 28


My questions
1. Should i start reading Durga Sapthashati.2. I=
f so what are the do's and don'ts . 

Finally the process to read, i read t=
he book and as per it, it is

=95 Kavacham =95 Argala Stotra =95 Keelakam =
=95 Navakshari japam 


=95 Ratri Suktam =95 Devi Mahatmyam =95 Navakshari =
mantra japam =95 Devi Suktam =95 Rahasya trayam =95 Kshama Prarthan
Does it=
 require the above process to be followed strictly to read single adhyaya p=
er day or it's ok to just read the chapter without above process. 


Or in =
other ways what all should be read if i read a single chapter a day.
Apart =
from these questions can a person read Laitha Sahasranaama / Trishati after=
 reading Vishnu Sahasranama or vice versa.



Best Wishes,Balaji
