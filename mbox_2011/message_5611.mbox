Namaste Gaurav Ji,

I asked this question because somebody suggested me som=
etime back that Navaarna Mantra can be recited directly starting with Aim H=
reem...without adding Om at the start and the person was *allowed* to recit=
e like that by His Guru after reaching some level.

If "Om" nullifies the r=
isk invloved in a Mantra (Such as getting swayed by Sidhhi of the Mantra), =
Then it occurs to me that the effects of a Mantra (for eaxmple Sidhhi given=
 by a mantra) would be felt eariler and powerfully without adding Om and mi=
ght overwhelm the Sadhaka and block the further spiritual progress.

I want=
ed to know exactly what is the difference between
"Tatsavitur varenyam..." =
instead of "Om Tatsaviturvarenyam..."
or "Aim Hreem Klim..." instead of "Om=
 Aim Hreem Klim..."
or "Trayambakam Yajaamahe..." instead of "Om Trayambaka=
m Yajaamahe..."

Best Regards,
Utpal

 I have made an observation that whenver I am meditating with this mantra b=
ut without Om I get some sensations on top of the head as if something is p=
ushing it and that feeling even remains after finishing the meditation. But=
 the same doesn't happen with om added to it.
