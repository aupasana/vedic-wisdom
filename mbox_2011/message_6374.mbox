Hi Narasimha Rao

1) I do not understand sanskrit, so it is sufficient that=
 i read the slokas
 in english. Is the meaning of the sanskrit sloka more i=
mportant, or is
 the sound if the sanskrit sloka the over powering factor. =
If so to what
 degree. Any language, such as Sanskrit has meaning, but the =
inability 
to fully understand it fully posts a challenge. Please let me kn=
ow your opinion.


2) Do you have a general structure for Homama, so that a=
ll homam like Chandi, Navagrasha, Sudarshana or=C2=A0 Rudra=C2=A0 or larger=
 ones others as=C2=A0 ATHARVA VEDA SAMHITHA HOMAM or=C2=A0 Rig Veda Samhita=
 Homam could be performed. See link
http://www.vinayaka.org/Photo Gallery.h=
tml

Are there any standard texts, say in snaskrit that are used by pandits=
 to have a complete and accurate, mantra recital from begining to end of th=
e homa, with 100 percent accuracy.

Thanks
With Regards

Raj Pai
