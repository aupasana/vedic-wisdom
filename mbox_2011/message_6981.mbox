Dear Murahari,

'prakriti' is a difficult word to translate, because it has many shades of
meaning. 'svAm prakRtim' can be translated as 'my form' or 'my nature'. The
'form' of a cow is 'cow-form'. The 'form' of a person is 'person-form'.
Similarly, the 'form' of the formless is 'formless-form' :-) i.e. don't get
trapped by the use of the word 'form' in your translation.

This verse can be seen as the synthesis of all vedanta philosophies in a
unifying way.

God is three-fold. (1) ajaH -- he is that entity which is unborn, because
brahman is beyond birth. (2) avyayAtmA -- he is the unchanging consciousness
which underlies this manifest world that appears in front of us. (3)
bhUtAnAm IshvaraH -- he is the personal Lord whom we can interact with in
this world that appears in front of us.

All three of these may appear contradictory to each other, but they are also
simultaneously true. How is this possible? Because of the nature of
Atma-mAyA.

Putting the verse in context, Krishna is simply trying to answer Arjuna's
previous question and explain that he is not an ordinary person. He is
timeless, but takes 'birth' every now and again. This birth is not the
result of dharma and adharma, or punya and papa. He is not controlled by
maya or karma or the three gunas. Even in his avatara-form, he is the
supreme lord himself. As a result, though he may take 'birth', he has
knowledge of all events of the past and future.

Beautiful verse.

sasneham,

   ajit
