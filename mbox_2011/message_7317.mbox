   pitru karma is done not merely for the parent=
s of this life, it is for
one and all who has associated with us kaarmicall=
y in this janma and
past many janmas and also those who are connected with =
us directly and
indirectly. pitru devataas and all those who were responsib=
le for our
existence and welfare need to be thanked. We have been given thi=
s
beautiful janma to pay off rinas and debts and one need to be thankful
to=
 pitru devataas whom we know in the lineage, and also need to be
thankful t=
o all those who have taken care of us in the past but are no
more in this p=
lane of existance.
the only way to thank all of them is to pray for them by=

tarpaNam/shraaddha, these yaGYas can bestow them uttama lokas so that
they=
 get elevated to next levels or make them take new birth's where
they can h=
ave unsatisfied desires fulfilled appropriately lessening
their kaarmic bon=
dages. pitru devataas inturn will offer us blessings
because of this.
Garud=
a Purana says, "there is no salvation for a man without a
son" which really=
 means tarpaNa/shraaddaH performed by sons is the
mode of salvation to pitr=
u devataas.
Markandeya Purana says that if the ancestors are content with t=
he
shraaddha, they will bestow health, wealth, knowledge and longevity, and=

ultimately heaven and salvation upon the performer. Who can perform
pitru =
tarpaNaM - there are lot of debates on this, but please get first
hand info=
rmation and decide upon if you want to do this pavitra(holy)
yaGYa (or) kee=
p faith in your guru and proceed , Manu shaastra has given
a lot of rules o=
n how to choose a bhokta (into who you would invoke
pitru devataas and feed=
/donate him appropriately) in pitru kaarya but
never mentioned that a jivit=
a pitru cannot do pitru kaarya, in fact manu
in 3.220 says "if the sacrific=
er's father is living, he must offer
the oblations to three remote ancestor=
s; or he may also choose his
living father at the shraaddha ritual as one o=
f the bhoktaas (brahmana
guest)" which clearly means any one can do pitru t=
arpaNa.
all dharma shaastras proclaim pitru tarpaNam is invariably a part o=
f
daily saadhana, and that is what i learnt after joining this group and
go=
t that confirmed after doing some research on the topic in the last
two wee=
ks.
I would like to thank you all for bearing with me on the topic and here=

is the last part of the rig vedic hymn on pitrus, as they say "Veda is
hid=
den by the ignorance, pride and laziness in the manas of the
observer, and =
they reveal themselves with different meanings with the
evolution of concis=
ouness of the sadhaka", hence  if there are any
mistakes in the riks discus=
sed - please pardon the mistakes as they are
because of ignorance/pride/laz=
iness of this saadhaka.

Interpretation -  One more classification of pitru dev=

here, the ones who are agnidagdhaaH[consumed by fire, i.=

invocations and are seated on barhi[barhisad, so=
mapaaH, somyaasaH,
haviShpaaH, haviradaH etc...] have accepted our offering=

agni as agni himself is the sacrifice - refer to 10.015.13),=
 and also
pitru devataas who have not come to our place and are in higher r=

[gharmasadaH - refer to 10.015.09] have also received our oblations b=
y
agni[as kavyaM], both are gladdened by receiving our offerings.  the
conc=
luding part of the rik/hymn is the hallmark and tell us why pitru
kaarya's/=
pitry yaGYas need to be performed -
   Agni is said to be svaraaT[sovereign=
 lord], having conveyed our
oblations to pitru devataas as he knows all abo=
ut them and as well as
about the whole of the creation, agni is being reque=
sted to make the
pitru devataas capable[kalpayasva] of a new body[tanvaM] a=
nd guide the
souls[asu=3Dsoul, niitim=3Dguide] of pitru-devataas to the nex=
t birth and
next body[tanvaM] as according to the will and wish[yathaa-vash=
aM] of
pitru devataas. we find a similar rik's in RV -
    RV 10.16.04 - ya=
aste shivaastanvo jaatavedaH taabhiH vahainaM

   i.e. in the last part of the hymn agni is requested to direct and
=
prepare pitru devataas for new bodies to clear off if they have any
karmic =
bondages left, this yaGYa named pitru kaarya/shraaddha/tarpaNam
may propiti=

 a prayer to agni in the form of svaraaT(universal
