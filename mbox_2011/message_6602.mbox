When one attains to this state (where there is nothing to be seen; nothing =
to be heard. Everything is lost in the Infinite.),one can bring down the mi=
nd only with great effort to the world of phenomena, which appear to be unr=
eal. It is "beyond duality and non-duality=E2=80=9D. Some persons attaining=
 to this state look upon the body as an obstacle in the  way of unbroken sp=
iritual  experience, and cast it off in Samadhi .It is like the breaking
of=
 an earthen jar,                                             
Sri Ramakrish=
na used to give a beautiful illustration to explain the state of highest sp=
iritual realization .Suppose there are nine pots full of water, the sun ref=
lected in each one. You break the pots one after another until only one is =
left, with the sun reflected in it; finally even this last pot is broken. T=
hen whatever is, is there .It can neither be seen nor described.           =
