Namaste,

Dinesh asked on Twitter about the meaning of Vedic chant "Mantra 
Pushpam":

You can refer to the following website to see the traditionally given 
meaning:

http://www.celextel.org/vedichymns/mantrapushpam.html

For example, a couple of verses are taken to mean:

"Fire is the source of water,
He who knows this,
Becomes established in himself,
Water is the source of fire,
He who knows this,
Becomes established in himself.
He who knows the source of water,
Becomes established in himself"

Then repeat the same by replacing fire with wind, burning Sun, Moon, 
stars, clouds, year etc.

Does it make any sense to you?

*        *        *

The word "Apas" is used in the 4th line above (with long vowel "A"), 
while the word "apas" (with short vowel "a") is used in other places. 
This happens consistently in all verses. Though both are translated as 
water by many people, my take is that they are different.

The word ap or apas means "actions" in addition to water. In fact, it is 
used in that meaning in many places in Veda. The word Apas means 
inspired or equanimous actions. According to some, it means riligious 
ceremonies also, but note that a religious ceremony is supposed to be an 
inspired and balanced action.

In my view, apas above means action and Apas means an equanimous action, 
i.e. action where the doer is established in Self.

*        *        *

The physical, mental and spiritual realms are controlled by Fire, Wind 
and Sun gods. Fire, the transformer, creates the physical reality by 
processing the elements through the physical senses and transforming 
them into physical experiences. Wind, the mover, creates the mental 
reality to by moving the notions and concepts in the mind. Sun, the 
shiner, shows the spiritual reality by throwing light on the divinity in 
everything. That is why we make aahutis to fire, wind and Sun in 
uttarangam of a homam.

Whene Mantra pushpam refers to those three, it is saying that one who 
realizes that actions arise in the physical, mental & spiritual realms 
of one's being, is established in Self. In other words, "I" am not doing 
actions, but actions arise in parts of my being, which are repsented by 
fire, wind and Sun. Next, it is saying that one who realizes that 
equanimous action arising in Self is the source of all these realms of 
being (physical, mental and spiritual), is established in Self.

In other words, equanimous actions arising in Self give rise to various 
aspects of one's being. And actions arise in various aspects of one's 
being. One who realizes this and does not entertain notions that "I am 
doing, I did this ritual" etc will be established in Self.

This the main purport.

Best regards,
Narasimha
