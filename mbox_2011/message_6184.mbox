Namaste,

corpse) >or sukra (Venus) or "sani" (Saturn)

>(3) s as i=

]

That exactly Shri Hari =
sharma ji said and i was pointing out.

your 1st point given above refers t=
o "Talvya", 2nd point refers to "Murdhanya" and 3rd refers to "Dantya"

and=
 shiva's correct pronunciation is 1st one (i.e. Taalvya) where in you said =
that it is similar to the sounds of sh which comes in shava, shani. shashi.=


Best Regards,

Utpal
