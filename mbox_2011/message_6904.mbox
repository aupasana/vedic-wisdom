Dear PVR garu,
Actually I wanted to post this message privately but all m=
y previous pvt messages that I sent to you never got responded so I decided=
 to post it public. The reason is I don't want anyone to get any wrong noti=
ons about God. 
Anyway, ever since I started homam my health problems have=
=A0started increasing.I patiently accepted every problem or any test that G=
od threw on my way. But recently along with Vishnu homam I have started cha=
nting Laxmi Narayan Hrudyam and khadgamala stotram too. my health problems =
have manifolded to the extent that homams which I did everyday has been red=
uced twice a week to once a month, to nothing due to very bad health.I rece=
ntly came from the emergency room and escaped jaws of death. The doctor cau=
tioned against a recurring attack eventually leading to death. With two sma=
ll kids my heart for the first time=A0cried and asked God why such a big pu=
nishment what did I do. All the while when I did homams I saw good spiritua=
l progress also and many good things happening on the side.=A0 detachment t=
owards abstract things is easy to overcome but what about attachment of a m=
other towards their kids.=A0=A0For the first time in life I feel very depre=
ssed. I don't
 feel like looking or talking to God anymore. Although there =
is a hope that nothing wrong will happen he is by my side watching.=A0

Wit=
h your divine instinct kindly guide me what future do you see for me or if =
any=A0remedies can help. I can send in birth details privately if needed. 
=

Sincere thanks and regards from a worried mother,
Priya
