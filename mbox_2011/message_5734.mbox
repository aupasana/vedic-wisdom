 Introduction

The Kaivalya Navaneeta is a widely known Advaita classic in =
Tamil. Navaneeta
means butter. Kaivalya or Revala is the state in which the=
 soul exists,
isolated from all connection with the body etc. From the vast=
 ocean of milk
(the Upanishads etc.) the great teachers have drawn the milk=
 of wisdom and
filled it in pots (ancient texts).

Tandavaraya Swami, the a=
uthor of Kaivalya Navaneeta says that he has
extracted the butter from the =
milk. Those who have obtained this (being fed
on the butter of divine wisdo=
m - Brahma Jnana - and being eternally
satisfied) will not roam about feedi=
ng on dust (non-real objects of sense).

The two sections of this work are =
called 'The exposition of the Truth'
(Tattva Vilakkappadalam) and 'Doubts c=
leared Away'(Sandeham
telitarppadalam). They explain the basic philosophica=
l principles and clear
doubts which are likely to arise in understanding th=
ese principles.

Kaivalya Navaneeta

1. P=
rostrations to the Holy Feet of the Unique Lord who like ether remains
as s=
ole witness in the hearts of all beings, whether they are swayed by
desire =
for wealth, lands, and women, or are free from such desire, and who
shines =
as the towering peak over the seven successive spiritual heights,
which are=
 in themselves exalted over all other planes (of mind), or in
Nannilam, the=
 holiest of the seven holy places!

5. I adore the feet of the Holy Master =
who shines forth forever as the wide
Expanse which has no beginning or end =
or interval, and I proceed to tell you
the true nature of the Absolute Bein=
g, to explain bondage and liberation so
that even those who are too dull to=
 learn the scriptures, may understand.

7. After adoring my Master, Venkate=
sa Mukunda, who is himself ever-free, and
who made me his own, I write this=
 Kaivalya Navaneeta divided into two parts,
the first of which contains a c=
lear exposition of the Truth, and the second
clears away all doubts arising=
 from the former.


The First Section

The Exposition Of The Truth

8. The =
Sages say that there are four prerequisites for realisation of the
Truth:

=
1. Viveka: discrimination between the temporary (therefore unreal phenomena=
)
and the permanent (therefore the Reality, i.e., the noumenal);
2. indiffe=
rence to the enjoyment of pleasures here or hereafter;
3. the group of six =
qualities and
4. the longing for Liberation.


9 and 10. The six qualities =
are sama, dama, uparati, titiksha, samadhana and
sraddha. Of these, sama is=
 control of mind; dama is control of the senses;
uparati is cessation of ac=
tivities (relating to caste, creed, family etc.);
titiksha is control of pa=
ssions, and includes endurance(The power to
withstand hardship or stress); =
samadhana is, according to the sages, the
settling down of the mind to refl=
ect the Truth, as revealed (by the
scriptures and the sages); sraddha denot=
es faith in the master and the
scriptures; such are the meanings of the six=
 terms of this category.

14. After eagerly saluting his Master, he stood u=
p and sobbed out his heart,
saying "O Lord! I have suffered long the tortur=
e or worldly life, which is
after all so false! Gracious Master, save me by=
 tearing off the cords which
bind me to the five sheaths, so that my heart =
may be at peace!''

19 and 20. "Look here, my son! He who has forgotten his=
 true nature is
alternately born and dies, turning round and round in the u=
nceasing wheel of
time, like a feather caught up in a whirlwind, until he r=
ealised the true
nature of the Self. If he comes to see the individual self=
 and its
substratum, the Overself, then be becomes the substratum, i.e., Br=
ahman, and
escapes rebirths. Should you know yourself no harm will befall y=
ou. As you
asked I have told you this.''

51. The question then arises: Whe=
reon does the superimposition rest when the
substratum is completely hidden=
? And how can there be any superimposition if
the substratum is not hidden?=
 "(The answer is:) The substratum is twofold,
general and particular, of wh=
ich the general substratum remains continuous
and unbroken. Transient super=
imposition is particular.

52. In the world, the common substratum 'This is=
' can never be veiled; but
only the particular identity - 'This is a rope.'=
 Similarly with the jiva,
ignorance does not veil the substratum - 'I AM'; =
but it veils the specific
knowledge - 'I am Brahman'.''

72. By the Lord un=
der the sacred banyan tree! I speak the truth;You are the
unchanging Witnes=
s of the gross, subtle and (casual) ignorance, the waking
dream and sleep s=
tates, and the passage of time - past, present and future,
which endlessly =
rise and fall, like waves in the ocean of bliss.

80. In the example; 'This=
 is that Devadatta,' the man who was seen in
another place and on another o=
ccasion, and also known as Devadatta, is this
man who is seen in this place=
 and on this occasion. Although the time and
place are different, a little =
consideration reveals the man to be the same.

81. Similarly, in the words =
'That' and 'thou', their literal meanings
excluded, the Consciousness-Princ=
iple is taken as Brahman and the Witness,
whose unbroken identity is establ=
ished by 'art', so that Brahman is the
Self, and the Self is Brahman.

107.=
 Just as the ether though all-pervading seems to be newly opened in a
well =
which is newly dug, so Brahman though ever-present yet appears as if
realis=
ed afresh by enquiry into the self as taught by a master or the
scriptures.=
 Therefore, O son, be at peace that we are always the same
limitless Being!=


108. The whole universe is as unreal as water in a mirage, silver in
moth=
er-of-pearl, the city of Gandharvas in the air, the dreamland of dream,
the=
 blue of the sky, the serpent in the rope, the off-spring of a barren
woman=
, the horn of a hare, or the thief in the thick post. O Son! Pure
Conscious=
ness is alone real. Do not therefore forget the Self at any moment.


Secti=
on Two

Doubts Cleared Away

1. "Just as men dig a hole, gently plant a lon=
g post in it, fill in earth
and ram it in, to fix it firmly so too, I take =
to clearing away doubts that
your mind which has realised the Self as being=
 the Supreme Consciousness may
remain unshaken.''

44. Disciple: "O Siva in=
 the form of my Master. If these powers and
Deliverance are together the fr=
uits of tapas, then all the sages should
possess both, as the ancient sages=
 did. We have known that the ancient sages
had these siddhis and were also =
liberated at the same time. Why do not all
jnanis possess such powers as we=
ll?''

45. Master: "Of the two types of tapas, namely, tapas, for the fulfi=
llment
of one's desires, and dispassionate tapas, the former bestows the po=
wers
desired, and the latter wisdom. Each can yield its allotted fruits onl=
y.
That is the law. The ancient sages had evidently performed both kinds of=

tapas.

46. "Sinless son, Janaka, Mahabali, Bhagirata and others got deliv=
erance
only.
Did they display any siddhis? (No). Some of the sages sought s=
iddhis only;
others sought both siddhis and emancipation. These siddhis are=
 simply for
display and nothing more. They do not make for liberation.''

1=
07. Disciple: "O Master! I do not see the propriety of the statement that
a=
ll beings are permeated by the single non-dual Self which is all-embracing
=
as Being-Consciousness-Bliss. The existence of the jivas is clear because
t=
hey all say 'I'; Consciousness also is clear because of knowledge which is
=
obvious; why does not-Bliss show forth in a similar way?''

108. Master: "S=
on, although there are shapes, fragrance and softness
together present in t=
he same flower, each of them is cognised by a separate
sense only. Otherwis=
e they are not perceived; such is the law of nature.
Similarly though the b=
eatific qualities, Being, Consciousness and Bliss
together form the Self, y=
et the modes vary constantly and give rise to the
difference which appear a=
s the world.

109. My son! the three qualities - Satva, Rajas and Tamas - g=
ive rise to the
three modes - repose, agitation and ignorance respectively.=
 Being,
Consciousness and Bliss which are themselves glorious, always remai=
n a
homogeneous Whole yet appear different.

110. Bare existence alone is n=
oticed in plants, minerals and the earth which
look insentient and are igno=
rant.

There can be no happiness in the state of disturbance caused by pass=
ions,
such as lust, which act like poison. But Being and Consciousness are =
evident
in it.
Being, Consciousness and Bliss together become manifest in t=
he state of
Peace which is characterised by a stern detachment (from extern=
alities).
Therefore Bliss becomes clear in a peaceful mind rid of ignorance=
 and
agitation.''

168. Disciple: "How should I remain, so that I may exper=
ience what you have
described as Bliss?''

Master: "If you get rid of the m=
ode of mind which give rise to the states of
waking, dream and sleep, you w=
ill remain as your true being and also
experience Bliss.

169. If you ask h=
ow to control the activities of the mind, rising up from
its latencies: Rul=
e over the intellect and sense as your slaves. They will
become extinct.

1=
70. Also by gentle control of the breath which blows like bellows, the
acti=
vities of the mind cease. If you are not inclined to practice this yoga,
th=
ey will cease if you root out the massive ignorance of the casual body.
The=
n too the mind stops its activities.''

171. Disciple: "By what means can I=
 root out ignorance, the casual body?''

Master: "The srutis can never misl=
ead one. How can there be ignorance if you
firmly fix their teaching in you=
r mind; ' I am the all-perfect being in whom
the worlds appear?''

172. Dis=
ciple: "How can I remain so when I engage in worldly transactions,
with wan=
dering mind?''

Master: "There is nothing apart from Me. Whatever is seen, =
is of Me. I am I
who is consciousness which sees all this as fictitions as =
my dream.

173. If you always remain aware that 'I' am perfect Consciousnes=
s, what does
it matter how much you think, or what you do? All this is unre=
al like dream
visions after waking. I am all-Bliss!''

178 and 179. Such is=
 Vidyananda. Those who study this work with devotion
will realise the high =
state of Repose and be liberated here and now. In
order that all may unders=
tand clearly Vidyananda, the true spirit of the
Holy books, in Nannilam Mas=
ter Narayana appeared in my samadhi and commanded
me to make this Kaivalya =
Navaneeta perfect in every detail, and free from
defect.

184. Praise, prai=
se to the author of my salvation! He placed on his head the
Foot of Narayan=
a, the Infinite Lord, who made him his slave, and who, by
means of the proc=
ess of negation had destroyed what through imposition had
arisen as a mere =
fictitious appearance, and put me in such a condition that
I, with eyes of =
Grace, can remain for ever the Spectator.
