Dear Everyone, 
=A0
One of our friends, who are not really religious at all=
, are claiming that they found a shiva lingam in their backyard here in mic=
higan. I would like to ask the learned members of this forum, as to how to =
genuinely decide which is a real shivalingam versus just another stone of t=
hat shape! Does this have to be given any significance at all? Can any such=
 lingam found be called a Swayambhu lingam and a temple be constructed at t=
hose places? Would any harm happen of nothing is done about it? Would like =
to know people's opinions on this!
