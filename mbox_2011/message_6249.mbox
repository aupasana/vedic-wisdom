Thanks for your opinion, i appreciate it.

One attribute of a sishya, one w=
ho is in lookout for knowledge, a guru is --
"Open Mind" .To: a. See , b. E=
xperience and then c. believe/buy-it or make a
decision. You tube videos or=
 spiritual discourses, miracles are just
"Visiting Cards"--ultimately a tru=
e sishya MUST go through a,b& c to reach
HIM.

Please forward it as necessa=
ry.

Regards,
Srinivas

A tru=

<br>
The true guru is the humblest of sages, yet the=
 strongest of leaders. The true guru will guide you to transcend your illus=
