Hello Jitender ji and Gaurav ji,

thanks for sharing your experience.  You =
dont need to stop your homam. You can find any other alternative. For me i =
use only dry coconut and only ghee for aahutis. i avoid even putting too mu=
ch of camphor etc.  for food i use one or two raisins.  i dont use havan sa=
magri or puffed rice.  for poornahuti  i use 1/4 of dry coconut. 

You can =
experiment with different and cheaper options like placing  your havan kund=
 near window/door. or using an exhaust above homam kund. try keeping it awa=
y from walls or do homam in balcony or roof if possible. other cost heavy o=
ptions can be getting a custom made chimney like utpal ji. using chemical s=
pone as advised can be a good idea. 

homam is not the problem problem is s=
moke. so let us stop the smoke not homam :-)

if you find yourself still in=
 mid of problem please give some more details u think can be needed. we all=
 will be happy to help

regards
