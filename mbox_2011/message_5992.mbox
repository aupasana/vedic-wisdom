Subject: Offering black sesame seeds in homam

Since a lot of technical questions regarding homam have been answered of la=
te by kind members who have accumulated vast knowledge and rich experiences=
 and have taken the pains of sharing it with the larger group I thought I m=
ight respectfully ask one which may or may not be a common occurrence. 

In=
 homam I liberally offer black sesame (til) seeds in the divine fire. I did=
 this in the past but of late I find that most offered seeds pop with a cra=
ckling noise and a good few shoot out of the homa kunda with a trail of wis=
p of smoke and scatter about the floor. I do not put them back in thinking =
anything rejected by Fire God should not be re-offered. I would be lying if=
 I pretended that I am not apprehensive of the significations but my questi=
on really has to do with the practical aspect of how to prevent this.  I wo=
uld be grateful to hear from others of their experiences of the same and ho=
w to alleviate it.

Thanks,
Alok.
