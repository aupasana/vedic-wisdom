Namaste Mike, 

I am no "scholar or yogi"

Vedic mantra should be chanted i=
n vedic pronunciation. The reason is that vedas are shruti (were heard by s=
eers). In fact all MANTRA should have clear and correct pronunciation and s=
hould be chanted with devotion and focus. 

For any STROTRA you can choose =
whatever rhythm pleases you. They are mainly for devotional aspect.
