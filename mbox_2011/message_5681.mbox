This question has =

 and is also one of the cornerstone arguements against the Aryan Invasion t=
heory or for the AIT. This period of history is very murky since it has its=
 basis in the Sindhu Saraswati Civiization ( I will not call it the Harappa=
 Mohenjedaro civilization ) . The AIT proponents claim Brahmi owes its orig=
ins to the phoenician and Aramaic scripts of the middle east and was carrie=
d by the invaders into India.



(There are similarities but they were carr=
ied from India to the other world as Subhash Kak and other researchers have=
 shown ) 



The Anti AIT research shows it could have originated from the =
Sindhu Saraswati script which has not been deciphered fully.  I strongly be=
leive the AIT is a huge theory foisted upon the hindus to discredit the val=
ue of the vedas and modern gene tracing research done by Stephen Oppenheime=
r and others who collected of millions of gene samples to study this actual=
ly discredits the AIT.



The beauty of Sanskrit was it being a oral living=
 language rather than a written language and one of the many reasons could =
be the proper intonation and pronounciation emphasis and also this gave it =
the ability to survive multiple invasions!!!! A language that is not writte=
n anywhere will still stay alive even after the books are burnt.



The ath=
arva veda talks about Mandalas and the Yantras emerged only later in the Ta=
ntra period ( 5th Century B.C) by the time Brahmi had emerged.I am not enti=
rely sure of the above but other members can comment.
