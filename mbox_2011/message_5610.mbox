Dear Sir,

Sorry, when I further checked for Paris it is 2:0 (East of GMT) =
with 2E20,
48N52. As I said, I am not technically that wise. Now it becomes=
 Leo Ascendant
chart than Virgo. I apologise for my ineptitude. You great A=
strologers may be
able to do better job than me on these lines. Again thank=
ing you for your
interest on the subject.

Regards,

J. Koperumcholan

Res. Sir,

Thanks for your query. Unfortunately, I'm not=
 even an Amateur astrologer. I'm
just a humble spiritual practitioner trust=
ing in God's Grace. I give you the
copied information from Wikipedia.

Alex=
andra David-N=E9el born Louise Eug=E9nie Alexandrine Marie David (born in
S=
aint-Mand=E9, Val-de-Marne on 24 October 1868, and died in Digne-les-Bains,=
 on 8
September 1969) was a Belgian-French explorer,anarchist, spiritualist=
, Buddhist
and writer, most known for her visit to Lhasa, Tibet, in 1924, w=
hen it was
forbidden to foreigners. David-N=E9el wrote over 30 books about =
Eastern religion,
philosophy, and her travels. Her teachings influenced bea=
t writers Jack Kerouac
and Allen Ginsberg, philosopher Alan Watts, and Theo=
sophistBenjamin Creme.
[edit]Early life

Born in Paris in 1868, she moved t=
o Ixelles (Brussels) at the age of six. During
her childhood she had a very=
 strong desire for freedom and spirituality. At the
age of 18, she had alre=
ady visited England, Switzerland and Spain on her own,
and she was studying=
 in Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical Society.

I took her as Paris born =
and quoted what I got from the present 10000 Famous
Horoscopes of JHora.

I can get hands on. So thanks for your data. More than birthdata of the fir=
st life, I am interested in deathdata (date, time and place of death). The =
last moment of life is an important one. It gives clues to the last thought=
/desire, which is the foundation of the next life. Moreover, death data is =
effectively birthdata of another existence, which will end when conception =
for rebirth occurs. Thus, if death chart is taken as the chart of an indepe=
ndent existence, rebirth (or rather conception for it) should show up as a =
major major event in annual/monthly charts and transits. I have made some o=
bservations before, but more work is needed.
