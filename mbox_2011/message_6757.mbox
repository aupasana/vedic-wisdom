Dear Anand Ji,

About wo=
od used for Homams: The best ones for good purposes are the milk giving 
tr=
ee's wood. (I mean dried ones.). In south mostly wood of Jackfruit tree is =

used and in its absence there is another tree resembling fruits like that =

of jack fruit but small in size (in south it is called small-jack-fruit or=
 
pivalsa or peja kayi and  I don't know its name in other languages)
 Wher=
e as in other circumstances where such wood is not accessible then any wood=
 
can be used which is not of sour taste. 
The outer coverings (shells) of =
Coconut are also used for creating the base of 
homa and also for carrying =
agni as it is being one of the part of Kalpavriksha 
(coconut tree is also =
called kalpavruksha on earth as no part of it is wasted) 
it is considered =
to be pure.

About Sadhanaas or homams on funeral Pyre: Yes such saddhanaas=
 do exist but they 
are not meant for the common people like us.  There is =
no doubt that such 
sadhanaa is also equally yielding as that of the mainst=
ream simple saadhanas or 
homams carried out by normal people like us, but =
the challenge is to have mental 
strength to do it and most importantly kno=
wing their meanings. It is near to 
impossible for people like us to do suc=
h saadhanas unless we get some guru who 
is always there to protect us. so =
though being parallel path to that of 
mainstream saadhanas it is not recom=
mended to common people.  And as far as my 
opinion is concerned it is best=
 to not to venture into such saadhanas without 
knowing them  properly.

Th=
anks & Regards,
Chetan

Hi,

Addendum to below explanations.

We can explain meaning=
 of burning diyas as following...

i) it  is one type of sewa offered to go=
d.
ii) by burning it in front of god we are asking god to remove the andhak=
aar or 
tamas that has covered us and show the path of light and take us to=
wards the 
ultimate which is devoid of any gunas and full of light and self=
 illuminating 
(swayamprakash)
iii) by burning it in front of god we are as=
king him to burn all our karmas 
(good bad and all ) and make us free from =
bondages of karmas and to take us back 
in him who is free from all karma b=
andhanaas.

so the method and materials used in doing it has its own impact=
 on it.

Sesame Seeds and its Oil:-- The quality of (gun) sesame Seeds and =
its oil is 
coolness (sheetal gun).( The sesame seeds are used to reduce pr=
oblems of heat or 
Ushna baadhas) and  the  burning of same (oil) gives coo=
lness to environment and 
to the mind too. hence most of the times in templ=
es sesame oil is used for 
burning diyas. It is also helpful if you are try=
ing to do meditation it will 
help in creating a environment for it.

Ghee =
-- And in ghee it is only ghee of gaay or cow  should be used and in that 
=
too of one which has its calf alive( nowadays we don't come to know it as w=
e buy 
it from shops so this point cannot be applied but it is still observ=
ed in rural 
areas where people prepare ghee for themselves)
The reason I m=
entioned this because its only cows ghee is pure and is of satvic 
gun and =
can give similar fruits if used where as the ghee of female buffalo 
(bhain=
s) is said to be of gaadh tamas and use of same would give similar results =

i.e. yield more tamas.( And so is difference in milk too...)

And most imp=
ortantly it is said that the devatas eat with their drishti and by 
sensing=
 the fragrance. hence in  appeasing any deity the respective material 
need=
s to be used for offering or burning. where as ghee is most widely used in =

homams as comon material the remaining offerings vary as per deity.
  

Th=
anks & Regards,
Chetan

Shr=
i Ananda Ji,

I understand that Agni is a carrier of information (subtlest =
possible one) to 
the system(read as god/the other/etc) so i guess subtle v=

based on the combinations of thoughts/intents and ma=
