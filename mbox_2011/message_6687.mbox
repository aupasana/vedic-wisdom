so your inner mind says go to temple
why not visit the temple in mind and =
not physically
your outer mind is stopping this and in the end your energy =
is getting wasted

Respected (Viswanath) Sir
Thank you very muc=
h for your reply. But I want to tell you that I hate God 
because one part =
of my brain always tells me from behind to go to a certain 
temple on accom=
plishing some task.And then I counter that thought saying that I 
will not =
go to temple even if my work gets done. This way whole of my energy is 
exh=
austed in getting these obsessive thoughts and countering them. I hate god =

because he forces me to do so.I was a very religious girl even since by 
c=
hildhood.
But now I cant see him.
Thanks
