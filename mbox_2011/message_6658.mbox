Oh ! I would never put it in garbage. I am putting it in the plants where l=
ot of clay is present. But I guess, Sh Ajit has mentioned it as the last op=
tion if nothing works out.
Also, I found a place near by where a family has=
 a cow and I am giving my bali there.

So, some progress.. :-)

o, I bought a metal homa kund (not copper, probably iron), 6x6 inches in th=
