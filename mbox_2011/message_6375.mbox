=C2=A0 I am like curious about one thing. When we 
do Homa, pooja or some o=
ther spiritual practise for a diety , is there any way 
to know that we are=
 on the right path. Is there a way to know that our prayers 
are being conv=
eyed to the particular diety and if the diety is really happy with 
that. 
=


Validation is important on the path of spiritual practice. Some people ge=
t 
dreams and stuff like that....but is there a more accidental way that th=
ese 
things happen too....For example I was thinking about doing something =
for Shani 
dev (sankalpam) and then when I went out in my car I saw the pic=
ture of a large 
crow depicted on a van moving in front of me...it may be s=
imply an accidental 
event but the totem crow being associated with Shani d=
ev...why I should see that 
picture on that particular day.....

Let us say=
 one starts doing homa for a particular diety....does something happen 
tha=
t can show that we are on the right path....

Want to know your thoughts on=
 this. 

Prasad

=C2=A0 
Hi Naras=
imha Rao

1) I do not understand sanskrit, so it is sufficient that i read =
the slokas in 
english. Is the meaning of the sanskrit sloka more important=
, or is the sound if 
the sanskrit sloka the over powering factor. If so to=
 what degree. Any language, 
such as Sanskrit has meaning, but the inabilit=
y to fully understand it fully 
posts a challenge. Please let me know your =
opinion.


2) Do you have a general structure for Homama, so that all homam=
 like Chandi, 
Navagrasha, Sudarshana or=C2=A0 Rudra=C2=A0 or larger ones o=
thers as=C2=A0 ATHARVA VEDA 
SAMHITHA HOMAM or=C2=A0 Rig Veda Samhita Homam=
 could be performed. See link
http://www.vinayaka.org/Photo Gallery.html

A=
re there any standard texts, say in snaskrit that are used by pandits to ha=
ve a 
complete and accurate, mantra recital from begining to end of the hom=
a, with 100 
percent accuracy.

Thanks
With Regards

Raj Pai
