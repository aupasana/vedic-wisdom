Hari Om,

My understanding on Karma kindly clarify accordingly.

Impression=
s in the bio memory - basically all our thought patterns everything is reco=
rded as a image/memory

Aagamya - The action in the current birth ..new/bor=
rowed desires can be avoided with awareness

prarabda - can be burnt with m=
editation and the help of a guru

Sanchita - Only any enlightened master ca=
n swallow this, great gnanis just burn it through some process , even som m=
asters run you through the regression and burn it and awaken the energy whi=
ch will take care through the course of sadhana and finally make enlightenm=
ent possible, intially the masters in the physcial body is requried to do t=
he shakthipat and then later one will be helped by masters even in the astr=
al plane who will take it and purify the energy body

your thoughts and inp=
uts please
