Namaste,

According to our ancient scriptures, Brahma, the creator, creates=
 and destroys the universe cyclically. The life of Brahma is 120 divine yea=
rs called Mahakalpa. Everyday he creates 14 Manus one by one and they creat=
e and control the world. So there are fourteen Manus in one divine day call=
ed Kalpa of Brahma. The life of each Manu is called Manvantara and it has 7=
1 eras of four quarters. Each quarter is has four Yugas - Krita or Satya, T=
reta, Dvapara and Kali. The following are the complete calculations of Vedi=
c units of time and periods.

The time taken to tear apart the softest peta=
ls of a lotus is called 'TRUTI' 
100 Trutis make 1 Lub
30 Lub make 1 Nimesh=

27 Nimesh make 1 Guru Akshar
10 Guru Akshar Make 1 Pran
6 pran Vighatika m=
ake 1 Ghatika or Dand
60 Ghati make 1 day and night 

That means, in a day =
and night, there are 17,49,60,000,00 Trutis
Thus, according to Western scie=
nce, there are 86,400 seconds in a day and night, whereas in Indian science=
, a day and night consists of 17,49,60,000,00 Trutis. 

According to anothe=
r system, the division of time is

1 day or 24 hours =3D 60 Ghatis
1 Ghati =
=3D 60 Vighati (also called Pala or Kala)
1 Vighati =3D 60 Lipta or (also c=
alled Vipala or Vikala)
1 Lipta =3D 60 Vilipta
1 Vilipta =3D 60 Para
1 Para=
 =3D 60 Tatpara

As a lot of charts made in the olden days mention the birt=
h time in Ghatis and Vighatis the following is the conversion to remember:
=

5 Ghatis =3D 2 hours
5 Vighati =3D 2 minutes
Another system of time at mic=
ro level is
60 Tatparas =3D 1 Paras
60 Paras =3D 1 Vilipta
60 Vilipta =3D 1=
 Lipta
60 Lipta =3D 1 Ghatika (Dand)
60 Ghatika =3D 1 Day & Night)

Therefo=
re, it is clear that there are 46,65,60,000,00 Tatparas in a day and night.=


6.3. The Vedic Units of Time =96 Macro level

SATYUG 4,32,000 YEARS X 4 =
=3D 17,28,000 YEARS
TRETA 4,32,000 YEARS X 3 =3D 12,96,000 YEARS
DWAPAR 4,3=
2,000 YEARS X 2 =3D 8,64,000 YEARS
KALIYUG 4,32,000 YEARS X 1 =3D 4,32,000 =
YEARS
1 MAHAYUG (GRAND TOTAL OF ALL THE YUGAS) =3D 4,320,000 YEARS
71 MAHAY=
UG =3D 43,20,000X71 =3D 1 MANVANTAR
1 MANVANTAR =3D 30,6720,000 YEARS
14 MA=
NVANTAR =3D 4,294,080,000 YEARS
(There are 14 Manvantars)

The earth remain=
s submerged in the water for the period of 8,64,000 years i.e. half the num=
ber of Satyug, before the start of each Manvantar, it also remains submerge=
d in the water for the same number of years, i.e. 8,64,000 years, after the=
 completion of each Manvantar. 
So in 14 Manvantars the number of years

17=
,28,000 x 15 =3D 2,59,20,000
(Number of year in Satyug)
+ 14 Manvantar =3D =
42,9, 40,80,000
1 Kalpa =3D 43,2,0000000 years
One day & night of Brahma =
=3D 4,320,000 Mahayug x 100 =3D 4,320,00,000 years 
Since the one moment in=
 the life of Brahma is considered to be of our 100years, therefore the life=
 of Brahma in 100 years will be 
4,32,00,00,000 x 360 x 100 =3D 1,555,200,0=
00,000 years 

The Present Age of Cosmos according to the Vedic System is a=
s follows:

There are 14 Manvantaras altogether. The present period is pass=
ing through the seventh Manvantara called Vaivaswata Manvantara.
One Manvan=
tara consists of 71 Mahayugs, out of which 27 Mahayugs have already passed.=
 We are passing through the first phase of the Kali Yuga which itself is th=
e third Yuga of the 28th Mahayuga and which has come after the passing of S=
atya Yuga, Treta and Dwapar Yuga. 
The time period of Manvantara (exclusive=
 period, when the earth is submerged in water, in the beginning and in the =
end) =3D 306,720,000 years 
1) Multiplying these years by 6 =3D 30,67,20,00=
0 x 6 (Because we are in the midst of 7th Manvantara, of the Svetvaaraah Ka=
lpa and 6 Manvantaras have already passed) =3D 1,8,0,300,000 years 
The tim=
e period of Pralaya consists of 17,28,000 years since 7 Pralayas have passe=
d, after the end of 6th Kalpa and before the beginning of 7th Kalpa, so 17,=
28,000x 7 =3D 12,096,000 years 
Adding we have:
1,840,300,000 + 120 96 000 =
+ 1,852,396,000 years
Therefore, after 1,85,24,16,000 years 'VAIVASVAT MANV=
ANTARA' has started.

2) 27 Mahayugs with each Mahayuga consisting of 43,20=
,000 years. 43,20,000 x 27 =3D 116,640,000 years have passed
Total =3D 1,96=
,90,56,000 years 
3) Now the time period of Kali Yuga in the 28th Yuga =3D =

Time period of Satya Yuga =3D 17,28,000
Time period of Treta =3D 12,96,000=

Time period of Dwapar =3D 8,64,000
TOTAL =3D 38,88,000
Since all the above=
 three Yugas have already passed, it means that after 38,88,000 years, Kali=
 Yuga came into existence. 
4) Kali Yuga started on Bhadrapada, Krishnapaks=
ha -13th day, in Vyatipaat yoga at midnight, in the Aashlesha Nakshatra and=
 the age of the Kali Yuga has been fixed as 5101 years as till date that is=
 Vikram Samvat 2057 =3D Shaka 1922 =3D 2000 AD. 
Sum of all the three Yugs =
=3D the Sum of 27 Mahayugas and Manvantar + the time period of Kali Yuga ti=
ll date.

Kalpa consist of 4,32,00,00,000 years and out of these 1,97,29,49=
,101 years have passed. Therefore, the earth's existence, according to the =
calculations devised by our ancient sages, comes up to 1,97,29,49,101 years=
 till date. It is interesting to note that according to scientific calculat=
ions, the age of the cosmos is estimated between 15 and 20 billion years. 
=

India has given the idea of the smallest and the largest measure of time.
=
Krati =3D 34,000th of a second
1 Truti =3D 300th of a second
2 Truti =3D 1 =
Luv 
2 Luv =3D 1 Kshana
30 Kshana =3D 1 Vipal
60 Vipal =3D 1 Pal
60 Pal =3D=
 1 Ghadi (24 minutes)
2.5 Gadhi =3D 1 Hora (1 hour)
24 Hora =3D 1 Divas (1 =
day)
7 Divas =3D 1 saptaah (1 week)
4 Saptaah =3D 1 Maas (1 month)
2 Maas =
=3D 1 Rutu (1 season)
6 Rutu =3D 1 Varsh (1 year)
100 Varsh =3D 1 Shataabda=
 (1 century)
10 Shataabda =3D 1 sahasraabda
432 Sahasraabda =3D 1 Yug (Kali=
yug)
2 Yug =3D 1 Dwaaparyug
3 Yug =3D 1 Tretaayug
4 Yug =3D 1 Krutayug
10 Y=
ug =3D 1 Mahaayug (4,320,000 years)
1000 Mahaayug =3D 1 Kalpa
1 Kalpa =3D 4=
.32 billion years
