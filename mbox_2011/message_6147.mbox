The one great lesson I was taught is that life is misery, nothing but miser=
y. Mother knows what is best. Each one of us is in the hands of Karma; it w=
orks itself out=E2=80"and no nay. There is only one element in life which i=
s worth having at any cost, and it is love. Love immense and infinite, broa=
d as the sky and deep as the ocean=E2=80"this is the one great gain in life=
. Blessed is he who gets it.
