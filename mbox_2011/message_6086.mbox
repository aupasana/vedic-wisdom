Namaste Atul Ji,

>Can we use this mantra to give ahutis
>also? if yes when=
 can we do this during homam

Seriously i do not know! actually i do not kn=
ow the qualifying criteria for any Mantra/Stotra/shloka/Ardh-Shloka for usi=
ng it in offering Aaahutis during Homam. No knowledge is some times benefic=
ial in such cases;)

What i can think at the moment is that you may think o=
f using that Mantra at the begining when you ask for permission of doing Ho=
mam and substitute "MAM SUPRABHATAM" with "MAM HOMAKARMA" 

Best Regards,

=
Utpal
