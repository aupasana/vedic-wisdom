<The Damara Tantra says that Sri Hari understands 3/4 of the Chandipath, Sr=
i Brahma understands 1/2 of the Chandipath and Sri Veda Vyasa understands 1=
/4th>

This is in a way off-topic; but any deep insights by anyone in the g=
roup on why in the texts of Lord Siva, Vishnu, Devi, etc each one is shown =
as supreme to the other. Ex: Siva gita has Lord Siva as the source of all c=
reation where Gods cannot understand his potency, Bhagavadgita has Lord Krs=
na as the source where even Gods are trying to know that truth and now this=
 :-)
At Iskcon, we have Lord Krsna, the original as the milk, with Lord Siv=
a, transformation of milk to curd. Essentially same, but transformed. 
As p=
er some texts, Devi is the mother of LordVisnu and as per some she is the s=
ister; somewhere some link is missing !
