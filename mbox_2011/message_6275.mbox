 621 In the course of life the sage, who has transcended all the yogas,
bei=
ng established in the supreme state, may live like a yogi, or even like a
b=
hogi, but that yoga and that bhoga are not real.

=E2=80=98Bhoga=E2=80=99 m=
eans enjoyment, and a bhogi is one, such as a householder, who
lives for en=
joyment. Some sages, like Ribhu, have been without any ashrama,
which is a =
particular, prescribed mode of life. Such a one is called an
atiasrami. The=
 next topic concerns the pair of opposites, bondage and
freedom.

622 The p=
air of bondage and freedom, which are spoken of in the course of
instructio=
n to disciples, does not really exist. Since it is settled that
all pairs o=
f opposites are unreal, how can this pair be real?

623 The real Self is ev=
er free. The bound one is only the soul, the
consequence of ignorance. Ther=
efore, in truth, there is no deliverance. The
thought of deliverance is due=
 only to the belief in bondage.

How to verify this unreality?

624 =E2=80=
=98If one makes the quest, =E2=80=9CWho is he for whom there is bondage?=E2=
=80=9D, at the
end of the quest the ever-free Self will be experienced.=E2=
=80=99 This is what the
most holy one [Sri Ramana] has said.

625 Since the=
 non-becoming of the supreme reality has been made clear by
both revelation=
 and the sages, and since it is that reality which is the
real Self, how ca=
n it be said that that one became bound?

Whoever does not accept the perfe=
ct supremacy of the reality is unfit to be
a disciple. He disqualifies hims=
elf by not accepting this as true.

626 If bondage were real, it would be w=
ithout end. Also, having a beginning,
deliverance would have an end. Thus, =
the unreality of bondage is
irresistible.
It is an axiom of advaita Vedanta=
 that whatever is real has neither
beginning nor an end, and that what has =
a beginning must have an end, and is
therefore unreal, as set forth already=
.

627 We do not hear from the sage the saying, =E2=80=98I was bound before=
 but now I
am free=E2=80=99. That supreme state is beyond time. How can its=
 beginning be
imagined?

What Bhagavan did say is next recorded.

628 Bhaga=
van, when asked, =E2=80=98When did your holiness attain deliverance?=E2=80=
=99,
replied, =E2=80=98Nothing has happened to me. I am the same always, un=
changed.=E2=80=99

To make this teaching intelligible Bhagavan used the fol=
lowing two similes.

629 This talk of deliverance is just like the singing,=
 by dwellers in
Pandharpur, of songs to the effect, =E2=80=98When shall we =
go to that place?=E2=80=99 and
finally singing, =E2=80=98We have reached th=
at place=E2=80=99.

630 =E2=80=98Just as someone in his dream, after wander=
ing abroad and returning
home, goes to sleep there and, waking, finds himse=
lf in his own home, so is
deliverance.=E2=80=99 This is what our Guru has s=
aid.

So, deliverance is only a change in the understanding, as shown below=
.

631 Deliverance is just the clarification of the mind, the understanding=
: =E2=80=98I
am ever in my own real nature; all other experiences are illus=
ory.=E2=80=99 It is
not something that has newly come about.

Another very =
notable feature of the sage=E2=80=99s being is next taken up.

632 The eter=
nal greatness of the sage consists in this: that he neither
waxes nor wanes=
 by actions done or not done. For him there will never accrue
any result fr=
om actions, whether unpleasant or pleasant.

This is a necessary corollary =
from the teaching that the sage, being only
the real Self, is egoless, and =
therefore not an actor, but at the most only
a witness, or not even a witne=
ss.

Some sectarians identify the real Self with the sheath of the intellec=
t, the
vijnanamaya kosha. But they are not advaitins.

Pandharpur is a famo=
us Krishna temple in Maharashtra. The verse refers to a
song and ritual tha=
t is performed by devotees of this shrine. Bhagavan
referred to it in the f=
ollowing exchange, which is taken from Letters from
Sri Ramanasramam, lette=
r 82, dated 27th January 1947:

Question: Where can we see the soul? How ca=
n we know it?

Bhagavan: Where can we see the soul? This question is like s=
taying in
Ramanasramam and asking =E2=80=98Where is Ramanasramam?=E2=80=99 =
The soul is at all times in
you and everywhere, and to imagine that it is s=
omewhere far off and to
search for it is like performing Panduranga bhajan.=
 This bhajan commences in
the first quarter of the night with tinkling bell=
s tied to the feet of the
devotees, and with a brass lamp-stand placed in t=
he centre of the house. The
devotees go round and round the lamp-stand, dan=
cing rhythmically to the
tune, =E2=80=98Pandharpur is thus far! Pandharpur =
is thus far! Come on, proceed!=E2=80=99,
but as they go round and round, th=
ey actually do not proceed even half a
yard further. By the time the third =
quarter of the night is reached, they
will begin to sing, =E2=80=98See! See=
! There is Pandharpur! Here is Pandharpur! See,
See!=E2=80=99

During the f=
irst quarter of the night they were going round the same lamp as
they were =
in the third quarter. It dawns and they sing, =E2=80=98We have arrived in
P=
andharpur. This is Pandharpur.=E2=80=99 So saying, they salute the lamp-sta=
nd and
end the bhajan. It is the same with this also. We go round and round=
 in
search of Atma, saying, =E2=80=98Where is Atma? Where is Atma?=E2=80=99=
 till at last the
dawn of jnana drishti [the vision of knowledge] is reache=
d and we say, =E2=80=98This
is Atma. This is me.=E2=80=99

This is explaine=
d further by Bhagavan himself.

633 Just as one engaged in listening to a s=
tory does not really hear it, on
account of his mind having wandered far aw=
ay, so the sage, though apparently
doing actions, is not really an actor wi=
th a mind full of previous habitual
modes of functioning.

It has been show=
n before that the mind is just a bundle of habits of
activity, which means =
that when those habits have been extinguished, it
ceases to bind. The actio=
ns of the sage are not due to his personal will, as
will be shown later.

B=
ut the condition of one whose mental vasanas are active is different, as
sh=
own below.

634 But the ignorant man, because his mind is subject to vasana=
s, becomes an
actor, even without actively doing any action, just as a man =
in his dream
may fall from the cliff of a mountain, though his body is lyin=
g motionless
in his bed.

The fact is, the mind is the real agent in action=
, not the body, which by
itself is inert and actionless.

The following is =
from the Vasishtam:

635 Action is not what is done by the body alone. That=
 alone is action which
is done by the mind. The body, being insentient, can=
not be an actor. The
mind being sentient, can be an actor.

636 =E2=80=98Wh=
atever the body, the senses, life and the mind do by the force of
prarabdha=
 karma, the sage is not affected by it.=E2=80=99 So said Bhagavan, our
Guru=
.

This is further sustained by comparison of the sage with God in his pers=
onal
aspect.

637 God is unaffected by his activities of creation, protecti=
on, etc. In
just the same way the sage remains unaffected by his actions, s=
ince, from
the standpoint of the truth, there is no real difference between=
 them [God
and the sage].

It is taught that God is not Himself the doer of=
 all that work, the work
being done in His presence by His power, called ma=
ya, as said before.

638 He appears to the ignorant as acting =E2=80=93 eat=
ing, walking, talking and
remembering =E2=80=93 but in truth he is neither =
an actor nor a recipient of the
fruits of action, because all his activity =
is entirely subject to God.

The following is what Bhagavan says on this to=
pic.

639 If the Self were the actor, then the sage would receive the fruit=
s of
action. But when, by the quest of the real Self, the sense of doership=
 is
lost, at the same time all the three kinds of karma will be lost. Under=
stand
that this deliverance is eternal.

The following also was said by Bha=
gavan.

640 Just as a sleepy child eats the food given by his mother, but d=
oes not
know it is eating, in the same way the sage receives the fruits of =
actions,
without being an enjoyer or sufferer.

But that is not all.

641 I=
n truth, no one is performing actions. The difference between the
knower an=
d the non-knower of the Self is only this: the ignorant man
believes himsel=
f to be the performer of actions, but to the sage the thought
of being an a=
ctor does not arise at all.

Here is an incidental problem, due to a differ=
ence of views.

642 The saying, =E2=80=98The agami karma and sanchita karma=
 are lost for the sage,
so he is not reborn again; but the prarabdha karma =
remains over=E2=80=99 is not true
from the standpoint of the supreme truth.=


This Bhagavan illustrates with a simile from life.

643 Just as, when a h=
usband dies, none of his wives remain unwidowed, so
when the actor [the ego=
] dies, no actions remain over, which would yield
result [to the sage].

An=
other simile is also available.

644 Just as actions done in dream do not s=
urvive on waking, so actions done
during the prevalence of ignorance do not=
 survive when the true nature of
the Self is experienced.

When ignorance d=
ies, all its products also cease to be.

But the survival of prarabdha karm=
a is stated in the vedantic lore. The
answer to this is given.
