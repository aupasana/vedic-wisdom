K.                                     Maharaj, you spoke to us of the
prac=
tice of  Puja  (worship),meditation,  continence and study of the
Scripture=
s.
                                          What does Puja mean?

THE SWAM=
I                Puja means both external and mental worship. In
external w=
orship certain accessories  such as  flowers,incense
                      =
                    and water are necessary.  It is
difficult to get these =
things always. So mental worship is more
convenient for you.
              =
                            After worshipping the Ishtam 
(Chosen Ideal) me=
ntally with Padya(water for washing the feet) , flowers
and incense        =
                                       which are
offered in external worshi=
p, practise  meditation  and  mental Japam. In
purely mental  Japam the
Man=
tram  (name of  the Deity)  is to be repeated without moving the
lips.    B=
ut in ordinary Japam one has to utter the
                                 =
         Mantram and there is therefore
movement of the  lips.
            =
                              In meditation you should think
of the form of=
  your Ishtam as effulgent. Imagine that everything is 
shining through    =
                                      its  lustre.
Think of this  effulgenc=
e as non-material  and possessed with
intelligence.  This kind of  meditati=
on will
later on develop  into meditation on the formless and infinite aspe=
ct of
God. In the beginning the aspirant has to take
help of  imagination l=
ater on, when  he develops his  spiritual  sense,
he will  feel  the presen=
ce of the Divine. Next
when when he gets the highest spiritual vision,  he =
will  come face to 
face with Truth.  He is then transported
into a differe=
nt realm altogether  of which this  world of matter
appears to be a mere sh=
adow and, as such, something
                                          unre=
al. The mind is  then lost 
in Savikalpa Samadhi (superconscious vision wit=
h thought).  Next comes
Nirvikalpa                                         =

Samadhi(superconscious  vision without thought). There is  then the
realis=
ation of that which is beyond thought
                                     =
     and speech. In this state there
is nothing to be seen;  nothing to be =
heard. Everything is lost in the
Infinite.
