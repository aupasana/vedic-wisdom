Hello Priya ji,

I can understand your situation. Although i am not able en=
ough to answer your query. but I want to remind you story of Churning of oc=
ean. Please remember that I may be wrong so please ignore if you think so.
=

When ocean was churned, by devas and devatas, by placing Meru parvat on ba=
ck of Kurmavtar. First thing which came out was 'halahal'. The poison.

Thi=
s terrified both Gods and demons, halahal was so toxicating that the whole =
world began trembling. Then Lord Shiva came to rescue and because of compas=
sion Lord Shiva swallowed the poison. Although the poison was stuck, no whe=
re to go. So it didnt harmed either Shiva or Srishti.

After that other rat=
nas and ultimately amrita came out.

IMHO, same is happening to you. You ne=
ed to request to Lord Shiva to swallow this poison so that your srishti is =
spared. As you know, Lord shiva rules tamas guna, and meditates on kailash =
parvat, coldest place. He is sitting with his eyes closed. 

You also need =
to do the same. Swallow this poison. neither let it enter your stomach nor =
let it come out. Simply close your eyes and be cool. Means accept this pois=
on, and also accept it that this is reality. You can not change it. Bad thi=
ngs happen to every one. After you accept, you need to ignore it. close you=
r eyes toward these. if you do not swallow and ignore this poison, this poi=
son may harm and derail you from your sadhna.

After Shiva swallowed posion=
, he felt extreme burning sensation. you may also feel the same. that burni=
ng sensation was relieved by drinking milk. Milk signifies love and knowled=
ge.

I may have committed many mistakes in this message. please pardon me f=
or mistakes. i hope senior and able members will rectify my mistakes.

Kind=
 Regards
