Him, who has fully witnessed this supreme state of existence, actions do no=
t bind; without this knowledge a man shall revert to this mortal world.

Th=
e sannyasin should take refuge in the wisdom of Brahman and the sentences o=
f the Vedantas which treat of the eternal truth. Brahman is the refuge of a=
ll knowing as well as ignorant beings. It is the final goal of the aspirati=
ons of all who wish to become immortal.

Bereft of all work, indifferent to=
 the pleasures of heaven as factors of embodiment and enchainment, on accou=
nt of the privilege of witnessing the Self, and by constantly brooding over=
 the Supreme Brahman, the wise sannyasin attains the highest bliss!
