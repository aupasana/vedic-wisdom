Namaste Priyank,

I understand your privacy concerns and have responded to =
your privately about 
this :)

As for as the meaning of Guru's 108 names, I=
 could not find any. However, I will 
say this, you never know about the qu=
ality of documents on the internet. Here is 
an audio of the namavali.

htt=
p://www.youtube.com/user/bhaktisongs?blend=3D21&ob=3D5#p/search/13/78yi7dh7=
KGQ

but if you compare it with the printed documents, then there is a disc=
repancy 
between the two. 


http://www.astroiq.com/remedies/p5_Jupiter_top=
tab.aspx

Which one is correct?. It would be better if you can find a publi=
shed book with 
the namavali or maybe someone on the forum who is familiar =
with the names can 
help us.

While I could not find  what you were asking =
for ( I admire your tenacity), I 
did find some other things that might be =
helpful. The following link has the 
namavali's (with meaning) for Ganesha,=
 Durga, Lakshmi, Shiva, Krishna, Rama,...

http://forum.spiritualindia.org/=
printpage.html;topic=3D16073.0

For documents in the Devnagri script, this =
seems to be the best site:

http://www.sanskritdocuments.org/

BTW, this we=
ekend (Saturday or Sunday - depending on where you live) is Nirjala 
Ekadas=
hi. (http://www.sivanandadlshq.org/religions/calendar.htm)

For more on the=
 significance of this Ekadashi:   
http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/?p=3D12167=


sincerely,
Chandraprakash

Namaste Chandra prakash ji, 

I rea=
lised that the threads are being copied to soem other site like divineindia=
 
which are visible over google. Hence decided to create an avatar, hope th=
at is 
ok with you.

Yes i had asked that question before also and still co=
uld not find the meaning 
to the 108 names. Thats why i asked again. hope t=
his is also ok with you.

Now in case you know where i can find the meaning=
 for 108 names that will be 
great.

much regards
priyank
