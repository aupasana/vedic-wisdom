Priyank Ji

Narasimha ji has answered this question many times and the lear=
ned members of the group have often quoted Vimalananda's teachings in this =
regard.Still I will try to rephrase the answer .I am an learner like you an=
d kindly forgive me if anything is not well explained or does not seem to m=
ake sense.This is just from my limited understanding.

"How is vedic worshi=
p different from tantra worship of same diety. In what quality one tool dif=
fers form another?"

1.The one primary difference between both systems is t=
his. God pervades both the pure and impure in the world. To quote vimalanan=
da from the third book of karma " He can seen both in the butcher and the g=
oat that is being butchered " . It takes somebody of the level of Vimalanan=
da to make no distinction between the butcher and the butchered or an Yogi =
of the Calibre of Trailinga swami who worshipped Kashi vishweshwara with hu=
man waste to prove that god pervades everything.

In the traditional Vedic =
form of worship we use only the best pure sattvic substances to worship god=
.Also we specifically worship only the positive gentle qualities of god. It=
 is a slow step by step process for one's inner growth.

2.The Tantric form=
 of worship is the cry of the beloved unable to bear the separation from on=
e's Istha. The worshipper dares to take the best shortcut available. Tantra=
 does not just worship the gentle forms of god ,it adores even the most vio=
lent form of god. To give an example the food grains that we all eat are ob=
tained after considerable violence inflicted on mother earth and the millio=
ns of organisms present in the soil . Death is what gives rise to life and =
not the other way around. Tantra gives an form to all the qualities of god =
and uses every substance possible to achieve these goals.

It is the intens=
e love for god which motivates this love driven craziness for an Aghori or =
tantric to worship the fierce form of the mother so that she can strip away=
 all mental conditioning in a couple of lifetimes itself. A tantric will tu=
rn every activity of his into playful worship of the divine . It could be s=
omething as extreme as shava sadhana or something as mundane as eating one'=
s meal.

The path has many dangers for one is attempting to quickly cut thr=
ough one's karmas and conditioning and that is why emphasis is laid on a li=
ving guru to guide one in the path.Also when the deity comes to play the te=
sts can be quite severe .


One is a long winded safe path to eternal bliss=
  .The other is a shortcut to eternal bliss passing through momentary hell.=
 :) Which path one chooses is dependent on how much one yearns for the divi=
ne.

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
