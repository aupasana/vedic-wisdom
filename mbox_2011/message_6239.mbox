Do you ask anything from your children in return for what you have given th=
em? It is your duty to work for them, and there the matter ends. In whateve=
r you do for a particular person, a city, or a state, assume the same attit=
ude towards it as you have towards your children =E2=80" expect nothing in =
return. If you can invariably take the position of a giver, in which everyt=
hing given by you is a free offering to the world, without any thought of r=
eturn, then will your work bring you no attachment.
