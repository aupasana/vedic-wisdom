Respected J=
haji/ PVR ji and other Members,

Lately I came to know (and I was surprised=
 to learn) that the earliest script
used for writing sanskit is Brahmi and =
not Devanagri! Why would the oldest
language in the world and so advanced a=
t that not have a script? Or is this
knowledge hidden from us till date?

I=
t is hard to imagine that such a perfect and beautiful language so widely u=
sed
(and maybe for secular purposes also) would not have a script! E.g. if =
yantra's
were made what script were they written in?

Is it also possible t=
hat we lost many precious treasures of knowledge over the
years as they wer=
e not written down? Writing down is somehow similar to burying
a pot of gol=
d to be recovered later on, isn't it?

Also, if Devanagari was used later o=
n to write sanskit how come it suddenly
sprang from Brahmi? And came to be =
widely used throughout India? Who would have
spread the writing? Is there a=
ny record?

Please pardon any foolish statements made above as I am just cu=
rious.

Respectfully,

Girish
