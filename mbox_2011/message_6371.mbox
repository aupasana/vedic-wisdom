I. THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE REAL PRINCIPLE

3. The objects of knowledge,=
 viz., sound, touch, etc., which are perceived
in the waking state, are dif=
ferent from each other because of their
peculiarities; but the consciousnes=
s of these, which is different from them,
does not differ because of its ho=
mogeneity.

4. Similar is the case in the dream state. Here the perceived o=
bjects are
transient and in the waking state they seem permanent. So there =
is
difference between them.But the (perceiving) consciousness in both the
s=
tates does not differ. It is homogeneous.

11. If the supreme bliss of the =
Self is not known, there cannot be the
highest love for it. (But it is ther=
e). If it is known, there cannot be
attraction for worldly objects.(That to=
o is there). So we say, this blissful
nature of the Self, though revealed, =
is not (strictly speaking) revealed.

15. Prakriti (i.e. primordial substan=
ce) is that in which there is the
reflection of Brahman, that is pure consc=
iousness and bliss and is composed
of sattva, rajas and tamas (in a state o=
f homogeneity). It is of two kinds.

16. When the element of sattva is pure=
, Prakriti is known as Maya; when
impure
(being mixed up with rajas and tam=
as) it is called Avidya. Brahman,
reflected in
Maya, is known as the omnisc=
ient Isvara, who controls Maya.

17. But the other (i.e. the Jiva, which is=
 Brahman reflected in Avidya) is
subjected to Avidya (impure sattva). The J=
iva is of different grades due to
(degrees of) admixture (of rajas and tama=
s with sattva). The Avidya
(nescience) is the causal body. When the Jiva id=
entifies himself with this
causal body he is called Prajna.

18. At the com=
mand of Isvara (and) for the experience of Prajna the five
subtle elements,=
 ether, air, fire, water and earth, arose from the part of
Prakriti in whic=
h tamas predominates.

19. From the sattva part of the five subtle elements=
 of Prakriti arose in
turn the five subtle sensory organs of hearing, touch=
, sight, taste and
smell.

20. From a combination of them all (i.e. sattva =
portions of the five subtle
elements) arose the organ of inner conception c=
alled antahkarana. Due to
difference of function it is divided into two. Ma=
nas (mind) is that aspect
whose function is doubting and buddhi (intellect)=
 is that whose functions
are discrimination and determination.

21. From th=
e rajas portion of the five elements arose in turn the organs of
actions kn=
own as the organ of speech, the hands, the feet, and the organs of
excretio=
n and generation.

22. From a combination of them all (i.e. the rajas porti=
ons of the five
subtle elements) arose the vital air (Prana). Again, due to=
 difference of
function it is divided into five. They are Prana, Apana, Sam=
ana, Udana and
Vyana.

23. The five sensory organs, the five organs of acti=
on, the five vital airs,
mind and intellect, all the seventeen together for=
m the subtle body, which
is called the Suksma or linga sarira.

24. By iden=
tifying himself with the subtle body (and thinking it to be his
own), Prajn=
a becomes known as Taijasa, and Isvara as Hiranyagarbha. Their
difference i=
s the one between the individual and the collective (i.e. one is
identified=
 with a single subtle body and the other with the totality of
subtle bodies=
).

25. Isvara (as Hiranyagarbha) is called totality because of his sense o=
f
identification with all the subtle bodies (of the universe). The other (t=
he
Taijasa) is called =E2=80=98individual=E2=80=9D because it lacks this kn=
owledge (and is
conscious only of his self, being identified with his own s=
ubtle body).

26. To provide the Jivas with objects of enjoyment and make t=
he bodies fit
for such
enjoyment, the all-powerful Isvara has made each of =
the (subtle) elements
partake
of the nature of all others.

27. Dividing ea=
ch element into two equal halves and one half of each again
into four (equa=
l parts) the Lord mixed the subtle elements so that each
gross element thus=
 formed should contain one half of its own peculiar nature
and one eighth o=
f that of each of the other four.

28. From these composite elements the co=
smic egg arose, and from it evolved
all the
worlds as well as all the objec=
ts of experience and the bodies in which the
experience take place. When Hi=
ranyagarbha identifies himself with the
totality of gross bodies he is know=
n as Vaisvanara; when Taijasas do so with
individual gross bodies (e.g.) of=
 the devas, men or lower animals, they are
known as Visvas.

29. They see o=
nly external things and are devoid of the knowledge of their
true inner
nat=
ure. They perform actions for enjoyment, and again they enjoy for
performin=
g
action.

30. They go from birth to birth, as worms that have slipped into=
 a river are
swept from one whirlpool to another and never attain peace.

3=
1. When the good deeds performed by them in past births bear fruit, the
wor=
ms
enjoy rest being lifted from the river by a compassionate person and pla=
ced
under
the shade of a tree on the bank.

32. Similarly, the Jivas (findi=
ng themselves in the whirlpool of samsara),
receive the appropriate initiat=
ion from a teacher who himself has realised
Brahman, and
differentiating th=
e Self from its five sheaths attain the supreme bliss of
release.

33. The =
five sheaths of the Self are those of the food, the vital air, the
mind, th=
e
intellect and bliss. Enveloped in them, it forgets its real nature and
be=
comes subject to transmigration.

45. When the supreme Brahman superimposes=
 on Itself Avidya, that is, sattva
mixed
with rajas and tamas, creating des=
ires and activities in It, then it is
referred to as =E2=80=98thou=E2=80=99=
.

46. When the three mutually contradictory aspects of Maya are rejected,
=
there
remains the one individual Brahman whose nature is existence, conscio=
usness
and
bliss. This is pointed out by the great saying 'That thou art=E2=
=80=99.

53. The finding out or discovery of the true significance of the i=
dentity of
the
individual self and the Supreme with the aid of the great sa=
yings (like
Tattvamasi) is what is known as sravana. And to arrive at the p=
ossibility of
its validity through
logical reasoning is what is called mana=
na.

54. And, when by sravana and manana the mind develops a firm and undou=
bted
conviction, and dwells constantly on the thus ascertained Self alone, =
it is
called unbroken meditation (nididhyasana).

55. When the mind gradual=
ly leaves off the ideas of the meditator and the
act of
meditation and is m=
erged in the sole object of meditation. (viz., the Self),
and is
steady lik=
e the flame of a lamp in a breezeless spot, it is called the
super-consciou=
s state (samadhi).

II. THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE FIVE ELEMENTS

10. The v=
arious actions of man can be classified into five groups; speech,
grasping,=

movement, excretion and enjoyment of sexual intercourse. Action performed =
in
agriculture, commerce, service and so forth may be included into one or
=
other of the
groups.

13. The mind enquires into the merits and defects of =
the objects which are
perceived
by the senses. Sattva, rajas and tamas are =
its three constituents, for
through them
the mind undergoes various modific=
ations.

20. Differences are of three kinds: The difference of a tree from =
its
leaves, flowers,fruits etc., is the difference within an object. The
di=
fference of one tree from another tree is the difference between objects
of=
 the same class. The difference of a tree from a stone is the difference
be=
tween objects of different classes.

59. With Brahman as its basis, Maya cr=
eates the various objects of the
world, just as
a variety of pictures are d=
rawn on a wall by the use of different colours.
