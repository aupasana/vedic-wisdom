Namaste,

Today is celebrated as Swamiji's birthday.=A0India needs another =
Vivekananda now, 
but then he was too unique. On this occassion let us read=
 and re read some of 
his saying which=A0have inspired millions of people f=
or the last 200 years.
=A0
=A0
	* You cannot believe in God until you belie=
ve in yourself. 
=A0
	* When an idea exclusively occupies the mind, it is t=
ransformed into an actual 
physical or mental state. 

=A0
	* Truth can be =
stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true.
=A0
	* The w=
ill is not free - it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect - but 
there=
 is something behind the will which is free. 

=A0
	* That man has reached =
immortality who is disturbed by nothing material. 
=A0
	* External nature i=
s only internal nature writ large. 
=A0
	* All the powers in the universe a=
re already ours. It is we who have put our 
hands before our eyes and cry t=
hat it is dark.
And finally, the one I personally love most:
	* Take up one=
 idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, 
live on th=
e=A0idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be 
full=
 of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to 
s=
uccess!

(Be it sadhana or be it anything else in life, unless the words of=
 the above 
quote are followed, it is impossible to achieve anything of rea=
l worth)
=A0
-Regards
=A0Rajarshi

=A0
"All that is gold does not glitter,
=
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
=
...Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
>From the ashes a fire shall be =
woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be the=A0blade =
that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king. " -J.R.R.Tolkien
