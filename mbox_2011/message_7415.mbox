Dear Biswajit,

Bear with my long response.

Have you been initiated into t=
he "Deity's" MANTRA? I'm giving my opinion
owing to little experience and i=
nitiation from my beloved Guru with the
same deity and some divine glimpses=
 and not to be taken negatively.

In the 32 forms of Shri Ganapati, this on=
e deity is  different from others
and has specific purpose. The Homa Vidhi =
has some specifics which need to
be followed. I did meet few people who did=
 fair amount of sadhana on this
deity.

In terms of clarity on the word pis=
acha, "Pisacho Guhyakaha Siddho,
Bhutosmi Devayonayaha" which ensures that =
this is devatha upasana.

Let me know if you need further details.

Thanks
=
Srikant
