namaste,

Congratulations on your first homam !

I'm able to repeat answers=
 to some of your questions only because they
have come up in the past.

(1)=
 Partially burnt poornahuti / ahutis -- leave it in the homa kundam
so that=
 it finishes burning in the next homam.

(2) Ashes / Cleaning the kunda -- =
you can leave it in the homa kunda,
or clean it. It is a tradeoff ... if yo=
u want less smoke, it is better
to clean it, but there are also likely to b=
e some partially burnt
particles in the ash. If you leave it, some small pa=
rtially burnt
particles may finish burning, but there is likely to be a lit=
tle more
smoke.

(3) Disposing of ashes. As Narasimha has written, you want=
 to
distribute the energy in the ashes back to nature in a respectful way.
=
Do whatever is possible given your constraints. If no other
alternative pre=
sents itself, throw them out in the garbage.

(4) Twigs & Ghee -- The twigs=
 are dipped in ghee before they are
offered. After that you offer ghee ahut=
is to the fire (and thus, the
twigs) until they burn.

(5) Copper vs Iron -=
- Narasimha has told us that iron is unlikely to
have a good mix of gunas, =
and copper is a much better choice. If you
have to get a new kunda, why not=
 get a copper one?

(6) Size -- The size of the homa kinda is a matter of p=
reference based
on the size of the fire that you light. With a smaller kund=
a, you may
have trouble  exposing all sides of all ahutis to air, which mig=
ht
prevent them from burning well. With a larger kunda, if you don't keep
a=
n equivalently large fire ablaze, you may have more smoke. Once you
do homa=
m repeatedly, you will figure out if you need (or want) a kunda
of a differ=
ent size.

(7) Washing & Cleaning -- You do not have to wash the kunda dail=
y
(though you can if you choose to). It is a good idea to keep the
prayer a=
rea relatively clean ... you should be comfortable with it.
Using something=
 like aluminum foil can make regular cleanup easy.

(8) Bali -- After puja,=
 bali is offered to animals, and is not
consumed by us. If this is not poss=
ible, you can throw it out.

(9) Base of the kunda -- Putting the kunda on =
newspaper is a bad idea
... it may easily catch on fire. A wooden plank may=
 work, though it is
better if it is raised (i.e. has a gap of air between t=
he main plank
and the ground). Even with a wooden plank, two bricks between=
 the
plank and kunda is a good idea.

When you have extra free time, consid=
er searching the group archives
for these same questions. You'll come acros=
s many other interesting
points from previous discussions on the same topic=
s.

bhavadiiyaH,

=A0 =A0ajit
