O ignorant man, who is fully immersed in worldliness! Just hear this intere=
sting story and wake up from the long slumber of ignorance!

Even some Euro=

annyasa. Mr. Nixon, M.A. (Oxon) who was a Professor in Lucknow University i=
s now a sannyasi. He is Swami Krishna Premi. He is a scholar in Sanskrit an=
d Hindi. He does kirtan. He dances in divine ecstasy. He is the author of f=
amous books such as Yoga of the Bhagavadgita, Yoga of the Katha Upanishad, =
etc. He gives impressive, forcible speeches in English and Hindi also. You =
will be stunned when you hear his lectures.

Mr. Alexander I.M.S., who was =
in the Medical College, Lucknow, is a sannyasin. He stays in Uttara-Brindav=
an along with Sri Krishna Premi.

Sri Swami Tapovanam, the lion of Vedanta,=

acon-light of the Himalayas, lived in Uttarakasi. Even the biggest officers=
 sat at his lotus feet to learn Vedanta.
