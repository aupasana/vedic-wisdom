Namaste,

For a few days ,I have been pondering over a few points.I wanted =
to share it with you all.
*************************************************=
********************

1.Which is more powerful=85..strength of devotion or =
strength of mantras ?

I have seen people who have deep love for God,but wh=
en they had  a tuff with someone,they were affected by black magic an suffe=
red.So doesn't the Mother protect 
Her child against those who misuse Her p=
ower through avichara kriyas ?
Is this is the law of karma again that was t=
he real cause of suffering and black magic is only a medium by which their =
karmas fructified ??...
I would have taken their sufferings to be a result =
of their karmas if that was `normal' in occurance.But since there is a avic=
hara kriya taking part in this ,I was forced to think on these terms .
Does=
 this mean one must be a spiritually uplifted person inorder to be protecte=
d by Her. ?? OR.
One can try to be as close to her as one can be and push t=
he limit.Wouldnt that be a right thing for a person who has a yet to shed a=
 load of karmas ??? 

*****************************************************=
****************

2.Where lies our own responsibility in handling our lives=
 ?? If most (99%) of what we do,is a result of conditioning and dominated b=
y the law of cause and effect,wherein lies our share of responsibility ?? 
=

Are we mere puppets in the hands of our past karmas ??....What is the solu=
tion ???

*****************************************************************=
*****
3.Keeping love towards a specific diety,what shud be our attitude tow=
ards the mantras,tantras ,homas etc ???..
Are we supposed to view them as m=
erely tools,roadways that lead to our goal or are they 
Are supreme denying=
 which even the deities cannot act ??

I ask this question because of two f=
actors :
A) I have  read about some sadhanas requiring the sadhak to wear a=
 specific coloured cloth ,sit on a asan of certain colour,use a specific ma=
la(rudraksha,padmabeeja etc) and do a specific no of repitations,which keep=
 varying.


B)Why is sadhana important ??? Can ever increasing love for one=
's diety be called a sadhana too ??? Does this help us to diminish karmas f=
rom our causal body ??

***************************************************=
*******************

I am a man who doesn't have much spiritual experiences=
.So I have to ask the ones who might have some experiences and are more ele=
vated than me and know if I am on the right path and where do I need correc=
tions ?? :-)

With Warm Regards,
Parijat Dutta
