Each race has a peculiar bent, each race has a peculiar raison d'etre, each=
 race has a peculiar mission to fulfil in the life of the world. Each race =
has to make its own result, to fulfil its own mission. Political greatness =
or military power is never the mission of our race; it never was, and, mark=
 my words, it never will be. But there has been the other mission given to =
us, which is to conserve, to preserve, to accumulate, as it were, into a dy=
namo, all the spiritual energy of the race, and that concentrated energy is=
 to pour forth in a deluge on the world, whenever circumstances are propiti=
ous.
