Namaste,

All the best!

That manual gives many options, including two Veda mantras. But, in my 
view, pournaanika mantra by Veda Vyasa (neelaanjana samaabhaasam) is 
better for most people without proficiency in Sanskrit.

Just as one cannot pay off a thousand dollar loan with a one dollar 
bill, similarly sufferings from serious karmas cannot be annulled with 
just one ritual. Any practice yields results with regularity. There are 
thousands of people now, who are doing a homam daily or weekly and 
experiencing the material and spiritual benefits. A one-off homam may 
not do anything tangible, but a homam done daily or weekly can do 
something. But it is good beginning and all the best!

*        *        *

It is fashionable today to look down upon rituals and give empty talks 
on high philosophy. Ritualism and high philosophy are reconcicled and 
explained in the white paper presented at World Association of VEdic 
Studies (WAVES) 2010 conference:

It is not without a reason that fire had a prominent place in many 
ancient religions. Fire is a living representative of god on earth. It 
has a very powerful influence on one's consciousness and accelerates the 
purging of bad samskaras (through which planets give us troubles). There 
is no need to take someone's words for it - if one spends some time with 
fire on a regular basis, one will know this for oneself.

Best regards,
Narasimha
