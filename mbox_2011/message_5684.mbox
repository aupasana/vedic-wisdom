 26th August, 1948

At 3 o=E2=80=99clock this afternoon while we were discu=
ssing something in Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
presence, a stranger came to the Ashr=
am with a platter full of fruits. It
seems that on the way to the hall some=
 monkey came, snatched some of the
fruits and escaped.

Hearing the noise o=
utside and realising what had happened, Bhagavan
laughingly said that the m=
onkey took away its portion of the fruit as it was
afraid we would not othe=
rwise give it. We all laughed.

While this was going on, a female monkey wi=
th a baby at her breast approached
the fruit basket. People near the basket=
 shouted it away. Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CIt
is a mother with a child. Why =
not give her something and send her away?=E2=80=9D

But he was not sufficie=
ntly audible, and so the monkey got frightened, went
off and hid herself in=
 a tree.Bhagavan, full of pity and kindness, said, =E2=80=9CIs
this fair?

=
We call ourselves sannyasins; but when a real sannyasi comes we drive him
a=
way without giving him anything. How unfair! We want to eat for years and
l=
ive. We store things in a room, lock it and keep the keys with us. Has the
=
monkey got a house?

Can it put anything by for the morrow? It eats whateve=
r it can get and
sleeps on whatever tree available. It carries the child un=
der its belly,
wherever it goes, until the child is able to walk about, whe=
n it leaves the
child to itself. Who is a real sannyasi, the monkey or ours=
elves? That is
why the male monkey took its share on
the way itself.

That =
was a male and could do it with impunity. This is a female. What can
she do=
?=E2=80=9D So saying Bhagavan began calling that monkey cajolingly. The mon=
key
came on to the side of the couch and stood there.In an endearing manner=
,
Bhagavan gave her all the fruit she wanted and sent her away.

A little l=
ater, the white peacock came in all its grandeur.Bhagavan, looking
at it, s=
aid to me, =E2=80=9CLook, their ears are not visible. In the usual place fo=
r
ears there are big holes.They are covered by feathers in the shape of a
f=
an.=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9CIs that so? I never knew it before.=E2=80=9D
=

Bhagavan then remarked, =E2=80=9CI observed this while I was on the hill. =
We then
had two
peacocks with us. The peahen always used to sleep in my lap=
. I observed this
when she was thus sleeping. The peacock never came so clo=
se to me. He used
to wander about in all sorts of places. She never used to=
 leave me but
always sit by my side or sleep in my lap. She was very famili=
ar with me.

The peacock used to call her to accompany him whenever he went=
 out, but like
a little child, she would never leave me and go.=E2=80=9D
