THE SWAMI               The mind is like a packet of mustard seeds.If 
the=
 seeds are once

                                       scattered, it is ve=
ry difficult to
gather them up.So I ask you to

                           =
            mould your mind before its energy
becomes scattered.When you

 =
                                      grow old and the energy of your
mind =
has been frittered away,

                                       you will h=
ave to make very
strenuous efforts to concentrate it;you

                 =
                      will experience tremendous
difficulty when you try to=
 focus it on

                                       a particular object.Do=
 you not see
how impressionable is the mind

                              =
         of a little boy?You are now like
him.If you want to mould

       =
                                yourselves,strive for it earnestly
from you=
r sixteenth to your

                                       thirtieth year.=
After that there is
less chance of achieving

                             =
          illumination.Up to the thirtieth
year the body and the mind remai=
n

                                       fresh.That is the time when the
m=
ind can be given a definite

                                       shape.B=
ut you must labour hard and
devote yourselves heart and

                  =
                     soul to your ideal of
life.Whatever impression the min=
d may

                                       receive during youth will las=
t
throughout life.If therefore you

                                       =
have determined to lead a holy
life in order to realise God, strive

      =
                                 your utmost from today.Your health
is all =
right now.The mind

                                       also is plastic.=
This is the time
for spiritual practices.Mould your

                      =
                 mind through constant struggle.If
this period of your life=
 goes

                                       by,it will be more difficult =
to do
anything afterwards.
