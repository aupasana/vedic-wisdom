Dear Sir/Madam,

Following are my replies to your questions below.

1.What is the significance of showing various mudra in homam procedures
>
I am not aware of the deeper meaning of the various mudras in a homam. My
understanding is that after the deity is invoked in the fire, the mudras are
symbolic of asking the deity to sit down and make him/herself comfortable,
accept the offerings etc.

>
> 2.Is there any dimensions that has to be followed to do homakundam
> do we need to place homa kundam on any yantra like figures.can we make homa
> kunda using bricks.Do wee need to decorate it
>
If you are talking of building a homa kundam in the ground, then there are
specific rules to be followed in the construction of the homakundam. Do
consult a learned agnihotri / temple priest in this regard. Robert Svoboda
in the Aghora series of books gives some information relating to this
question.
 3.Any purification procedure is there for spoons used for providing aahuthi

I have seen some priests sprinkle holy water on the spoons and instruct that
the spoons be held above the fire for a few seconds.

> 4.I have seen people using 2 types of spoon .One with flat end similar to

I think it is to avoid wastage/spillage of ghee when transferring from the
bowl to the homa.

>
> 5.I have seen people using herbal sticks/ twig of banyan trees/sesame etc
> .What is the purpose of it

They all constitute items which can be offered to the fire. Each offering
has its own unique effect.

>
> 6.How to make ring using dharba grass/any rules are there

I think that the towel is tied over the stomach mainly to prevent the dhoti
from falling down!

I have not seen this but I think it may be some tarpanam sort of offering.
Is the pouring of water done before or after the fire has been lit?

Sri Narasimha can guide in this question.
