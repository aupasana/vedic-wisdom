Hello Utpal ji,

Thanks for sharing your experience. I was thinking that I=
 am having some 'Hocus-Pocus illusions' :)

I have one more doubt. In my re=
gular sadhna practice, Sometimes I am doing very good and concentration,exp=
erience is very good. But sometimes concentration is very poor, I dont even=
 want to meditate. Even slight meditation feels like headache because of po=
or concentration. 

It is basically like hiting peak and bottom turn by tur=
n. After I hit bottom I start to improve and after i touch peak I fall down=
 suddenly. 

I understand that this is due to my own incompetency in sadhna=
. Most probably I commit some mistake when at peak and then I loose my bala=
nce. But I make mistakes even when I am going up, but then I do not loose b=
alance and instead i rectify my mistakes very well. When I am having my bes=
t experience, a small mistake make me loose my balance.

I dont know why th=
is happens. Does this happen to everyone or I am lacking ability to do sadh=
na? This disappoints me a lot. During some days I even do not do my regular=
 practice and I feel that I am not worthy of doing sadhna. I feel guilty of=
 forgetting Krishna. Suddenly lot and lot of non-sense questions and stupid=
 ideas arise in mind and I am totally confused. During those days, I dont e=
ven remember Krishna. I dont even want to hymn my favourite mantra. I do no=
t bother about pleasant experience. I know these are not my aim. But I feel=
 disappointed for forgetting Krishna. During these days every day feels lik=
e I have forgotten him since decades. This disappoints me even more.

Does =
this happen to everyone? Any suggestion will be helpful.

I understand that=
 we should not share our spiritual experience with everyone. But today I wa=
s not able to stop myself. I do not know that whether I should have written=
 these lines here or not.

Please ignore this mail if it is not worthy of a=
nswering. I usually write useless words.

Sorry for mistakes

Kind Regards
=
