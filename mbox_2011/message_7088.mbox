Narasimha ji

I went through this mail of your and it almost brought tears =
to my eyes since it reminded me of the message of my guru.The content is ve=
ry very similar to what you just said  and I am just sharing the link below=
. My sincerest apologies if the below link's message would be diverting fro=
m the topic,strongly feel it is the same topic.

Again this might be an cre=
ation of my mind :) .

http://blog.ishafoundation.org/2011/06/20/a-powerful=
-way-to-transform-yourself/


"Every human being, either consciously or unc=
onsciously, through the process of what we call life, creates a certain ima=
ge, a certain personality of himself. This image that you have created with=
in yourselves has nothing to do with the reality. It has nothing to do with=
 the self, your inner nature. It is a certain image that you have built, mo=
st of the time unconsciously. Everybody has some image of what they are. Ve=
ry few human beings have built a conscious image of themselves. All others =
have built images according to whatever kind of patterns or external situat=
ions they fell into.

Now, why don't we create a new self-image consciously=
, the way you really want to be? If you are intelligent enough, if you are =
aware enough, you can recast your image, a totally new image, whichever way=
 you really want it. It is possible. But you should be willing to leave the=
 old one. This is not pretension. Instead of acting unconsciously, you act =
consciously. You can create that kind of image which supports you best; tha=
t kind of image which creates maximum harmony around you; that kind of imag=
e which has least friction. You create that kind of an image which is close=
st to your inner nature. What kind of an image, do you think, is closest to=
 your inner nature? Please see, the inner nature is very silent, not domina=
nt but very forceful. Very subtle but very forceful. Now that is what we ne=
ed to do: the grosser elements within you =96 your anger, your limitations =
must be chopped off. Create a new self-image, which is subtle but tremendou=
sly forceful.

Think about it for the next one or two days and create a pro=
per image for yourself; what should be the fundamental nature of your thoug=
ht and emotion. Before we create something, let's really see, if what we ar=
e creating now is better than what we have. Choose a time when you would no=
t be disturbed. Sit comfortably with your back rested and be relaxed. Now, =
close your eyes and visualize how other people should experience you. Creat=
e a whole new human being. Look at it with as much detail as possible. See =
if this new image is more human, more efficient, more loving.

Visualize th=
is new image as powerfully as you can. Make it alive within yourself. If yo=
ur thought is powerful enough, if your visualization is powerful enough, it=
 can even break the bonds of karma. The karmic limitations can be broken by=
 creating a powerful visualization of what you want to be. This is the oppo=
rtunity to transcend all your limitations of thought, emotion and action."

Again, I had no clue and did not know this person at all. So, rationally
