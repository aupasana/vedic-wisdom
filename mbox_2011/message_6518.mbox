Namaste,
   Noble scholars and yogis, could someone please advise me on a question I
have about japa.

   It is OK to change the "rhythm" of a mantra, if that particular rhythmic
deviation has more appeal to you?

   As an example, here is the Gayatri mantra chanted one way:

   Here is another rhythmic variation:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qscYsuT29A0&playnext=1&list=PLC693EED2F572C24B

   This second variation really touched my heart.
   Yet when I listen to Brahmin scholars reciting the Gayatri mantras, their
recitation all sound the same, without the musical rhythm.
   Kindly please advise as to which way is prefered way of chanting mantras.

 Take care,
 Mike
