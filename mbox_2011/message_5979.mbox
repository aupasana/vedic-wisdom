Dear Narasimha, 

Whole day i was trying to find parashar vedic mantras onl=
ine, but i could find. i did end up reading a lot of your previous mails 

=
to quote you form your post yr back
"Interestingly, the Vedic mantras recom=
mended by Parasara for Moon
and Venus are different from what people normal=
ly use today. For
other planets, mantras recommended by Parasara are still =
the ones in
common use. In the above case, the commonly used Veda mantras
(=
"kayaanaschitra" for Rahu and "brihaspate atiyadaryo" for Jupiter)
are in a=
greement with Parasara."


A thousand of people have tarted doing homam in =
line with Parashar teaching, it will be very apt if we use those vedic mant=
ras to thank the Grahas in daily homam. In my humble opinion It will be gre=
at idea to keep parashar's tradition alive.


As to the japa/mantra sadhana=
 as per your advice time and again, i agree that beej mantras will be more =
effective, as the correct vedic pronunciation is lost.

regards,
Akshay
