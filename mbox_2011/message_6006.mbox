Other alternatives are to (1) install a fireplace and do the homa in the
fi=
replace or (2) if you have outdoor space (balcony or backyard), homa can
be=
 done outdoors. For those of us in the West, the weather makes it
difficult=
 in the winter, but I am experimenting by having a little shelter /
enclosu=
re designed for my terrace, and I think with an electric outlet set
up for =
a space heater / lighting for evening homa, this may be a workable
solution=
. Still brainstorming, though, as I can't install a fireplace in my
condo (=
because I can't install a chimney).

Warm regards,
Aditi
