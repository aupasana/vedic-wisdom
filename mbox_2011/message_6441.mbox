When a man has fulfilled the duties and obligations of that stage of life i=
n which he is born, and his aspirations lead him to seek a spiritual life a=
nd to abandon altogether the worldly pursuits of possession, fame or power,=
 when, by the growth of insight into the nature of the world, he sees its i=
mpermanence, its strife, its misery, and the paltry nature of its prizes, a=
nd turns away from all these =E2=80" then he seeks the true, the Eternal Lo=
ve, the Refuge.
