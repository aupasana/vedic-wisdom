Dear Chaitanya,

Make every effort to attend classes in person. It will be =
much more
effective than anything you can do by yourself.

There are severa=
l options for self-study:
(a) The first level of Samskrita Bharati classes =
is available as a DVD set.
These classes are suppossed to be interactive. P=
retend that the DVD
instructors are in front of you, and talk to the televs=
ion. Really.
(b) Samskita Bharati (and many other organizations) have corre=
spondence
courses available.
(c) Rashtriya Samskrita Samsthan has published=
 a good "Teach Yourself
Sanskrit" series (diikShA book series).

Make every=
 effort to speak in sanskrit. If you and your friends (or family)
can't att=
end classes, then try to speak in sanskrit to each other when you
meet. It =
will accelerate your sanskrit learning significantly.

sasneham,

   ajit
