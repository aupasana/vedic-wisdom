Dear as16475,

I looked at the replies you got. Unfortunately, barring some=
, most of the advice you've gotten is useless (with due respect to all the =
sincere people who have given it: dont advise unless you have known OCD). I=
 have struggled quite a bit with OCD, my sister has full fledged OCD for 19=
 yrs. My brother-in-law has OCD. Others in both my wife's and my family hav=
e had OCD.

Read this carefully. Your problem is not with God. From my basi=
c analysis of your writeup your problem is exactly the same as every other =
OCD patient - the mind is terribly scared of a certain outcome, and in orde=
r to avoid confronting that outcome, it adopts a ritual repetitive practice=
 in a hollow way (without meaning). Instead of recognizing that the practic=
e is hollow, it believes that more repetition will bring meaning, and it do=
es more and more and more until it takes over life altogether. Thats why yo=
u go to the temple again and again - the temple has no meaning for you othe=
r than an empty physical practice to allay the fear and doubt. There is no =
God in the temple for you, really.

The solution is not to adopt more ritua=
l practices. A mantra becomes a meaningless ritual repetitive practice unle=
ss the mind is wholeheartedly participating in it with surrender and withou=
t fear. Homam may be a little better, but powerful fears can render that us=
eless too.  


Try the homeopathic/ayurvedic/allopathic options to get basi=
c control of your life. Then confront the fear using a psychotherapist i.e.=
 one who will talk to you and help you deal with the fear. Then you may try=
 some homam/mantra, but only when your mind is calm and empty, and not assa=
iled with fear and doubt.

Most people dont understand that repetitive reli=
gious practices of any kind frequently increase the trouble of OCD sufferer=
s, not because there is no God or because God has abandoned them. It is bec=
ause OCD sufferers get attached to and obsessed with the repetitive practic=
es which drown out the real content completely. God is to be found using ri=
tual and symbolic practices only when the mind is truly calm and wants to s=
urrender, otherwise these practices themselves become fuel to the all consu=
ming destructive fire called OCD. This is exactly what has happened to you.=
 

You must search for real meaning  (astrologically - Jupiter). Who is God=
? What does he mean to you? 


Sundeep
