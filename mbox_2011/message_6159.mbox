Namaste Nagaraj Ji,

It would be useful to go through the following chain o=

 that approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like "Sri Gurucharana Sar=

haran saroj raj". You may shed more light on this aspect as well.

e.
> >

se "t" has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara "yaa" (which=

andas, "yaat" is considered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce "yaat=
" correctly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you =
said "yaat" or "yaak" or "yaan". It is possible if one listens carefully, b=
ut otherwise difficult. The "t" at the end is a very quick and abrupt trans=
ient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.

e common mistake is the sound "tha" (as in "kathaa" =3D story). Most south =
Indians pronounce this as "dha" (as in "dhana" =3D money). In Telugu and Ka=
nnada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks very similar and just one d=

started following. Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pro=
nouncing correctly will be the odd person out.

lish. We never have two different symbols for the same sound or two differe=

taamra" =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to get "th" (as in "kathaa" =
=3D story).

moksha". Even "siddhardham" means "half attainment" and "purushaardha" mean=
