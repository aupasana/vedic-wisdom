Namaste narasimha,


will appreciate if you can guide me on how to approach=
 Narayan hrudayam, read stand alone or follow tradition. i think shlok 27 s=
ays thats benefits are there for stand alone also. 

please see my dilemma =
in below thread


* * *

God is in everyone and does everything, but

gets things done through a person, *in accordance with* the

of that person. God makes each person experience good and

I am still trying to wr=
ap my mind around this, can you give an analogy.

regards
priyank
