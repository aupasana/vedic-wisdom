 Ashtavakra said:

My son, you may recite or listen to countless scriptures=
, but you will not
be established within until you can forget everything. 1=
6.1

You may, as a learned man, indulge in wealth, activity, and meditation=
, but
your mind will still long for that which is the cessation of desire, =
and
beyond all goals. 16.2

Everyone is in pain because of their striving t=
o achieve something, but
noone realises it. By no more than this instructio=
n, the fortunate one
attains tranquillity. 16.3

Happiness belongs to noone=
 but that supremely lazy man for whom even opening
and closing his eyes is =
a bother. 16.4

When the mind is freed from such pairs of opposites as, "I =
have done this,"
and "I have not done that," it becomes indifferent to meri=
t, wealth,
sensuality and liberation. 16.5

One man is abstemious and avers=
e to the senses, another is greedy and
attached to them, but he who is free=
 from both taking and rejecting is
neither abstemious nor greedy. 16.6

So =
long as desire, the state of lack of discrimination, remains, the sense
of =
revulsion and attraction will remain, which is the root and branch of
samsa=
ra. 16.7

Desire springs from usage, and aversion from abstension, but the =
wise man is
free from the pairs of opposites like a child, and becomes esta=
blished. 16.8

The passionate man wants to eliminate samsara so as to avoid=
 pain, but the
dispassionate man is free from pain and feels no distress ev=
en in it. 16.9

He who is proud about even liberation or his own body, and =
feels them his
own, is neither a seer nor a yogi. He is still just a suffer=
er.16.10

If even Shiva, Vishnu, or the lotus-born Brahma were your instruc=
tor, until
you have forgotten everything you cannot be established within. =
16.11


Ashtavakra said:

He who is content, with purified senses, and alwa=
ys enjoys solitude, has
gained the fruit of knowledge and the fruit of the =
practice of yoga too.
17.1

The knower of truth is never distressed in this=
 world, for the whole round
world is full of himself alone. 17.2

None of t=
hese senses please a man who has found satisfaction within,just as
Nimba le=
aves do not please the elephant that has acquired the taste for
Sallaki lea=
ves. 17.3

The man is rare who is not attached to the things he has enjoyed=
, and does
not hanker after the things he has not enjoyed. 17.4

Those who =
desire pleasure and those who desire liberation are both found in
samsara, =
but the great-souled man who desires neither pleasure nor
liberation is rar=
e indeed. 17.5

It is only the noble-minded who is free from attraction or =
repulsion to
religion, wealth, sensuality, and life and death too. 17.6

He=
 feels no desire for the elimination of all this, nor anger at its
continui=
ng, so the fortunate man lives happily with whatever sustinence
presents it=
self. 17.7

Thus fulfilled through this knowledge, contented, and with the =
thinking mind
emptied, he lives happily just seeing, hearing, feeling, smel=
ling, and
tasting. 17.8

In him for whom the ocean of samsara has dried up,=
 there is neither
attachment or aversion. His gaze is vacant, his behaviour=
 purposeless,and
his senses inactive. 17.9

Surely the supreme state is eve=
rywhere for the liberated mind. He is neither
awake nor asleep, and neither=
 opens nor closes his eyes. 17.10

The liberated man is resplendent everywh=
ere, free from all desires.
Everywhere he appears self-possessed and pure o=
f heart. 17.11

Seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting, speaking, and =
walking about,
the great-souled man who is freed from trying to achieve or =
avoid anything
is free indeed. 17.12

The liberated man is free from desire=
s everywhere. He neither blames,
praises, rejoices, is disappointed, gives,=
 nor takes. 17.13

When a great-souled one is unperturbed in mind, and equa=
lly self-possessed
at either the sight of a woman inflamed with desire or a=
t approaching death,
he is truly liberated. 17.14

There is no distinction =
between pleasure and pain, man and woman, success
and failure for the wise =
man who looks on everything as equal. 17.15

There is no aggression nor com=
passion, no pride nor humility, no wonder nor
confusion for the man whose d=
ays of samsara are over. 17.16

The liberated man is not averse to the sens=
es nor is he attached to them. He
enjoys hinself continually with an unatta=
ched mind in both success and
failure. 17.17

One established in the Absolu=
te state with an empty mind does not know the
alternatives of inner stillne=
ss and lack of inner stillness, and of good and
evil. 17.18

A man free of =
"me" and "mine" and of a sense of responsibility, aware that
"Nothing exist=
s," with all desires extinguished within, does not act even in
acting. 17.1=
9

He whose thinking mind is dissolved achieves the indescribable state and=
 is
free from the mental display of delusion, dream, and ignorance. 17.20

=

Ashtavakra said:

Praise be to That by the awareness of which delusion its=
elf becomes
dream-like, to that which is pure happiness, peace, and light. =
18.1

One may get all sorts of pleasure by the acquisition of various objec=
ts of
enjoyment, but one cannot be happy except by the renunciation of ever=
ything.
18.2

How can there be happiness, for one who has been burnt inside=
 by the
blistering sun of the pain of thinking that there are things that s=
till need
doing, without the rain of the nectar of peace? 18.3

This existe=
nce is just imagination. It is nothing in reality, but there is
no non-bein=
g for natures that know how to distinguish being from nonbeing.
18.4

The r=
ealm of one's self is not far away, nor can it be achieved by the
addition =
of limitations to its nature. It is unimaginable, effortless,
unchanging, a=
nd spotless. 18.5

By the simple elimination of delusion and the recognitio=
n of one's true
nature, those whose vision is unclouded live free from sorr=
ow. 18.6

Knowing everything as just imagination, and himself as eternally =
free, how
should the wise man behave like a fool? 18.7

Knowing himself to =
be God, and being and non-being just imagination, what
should the man free =
from desire learn, say, or do? 18.8

Considerations like "I am this" or "I =
am not this" are finished for the yogi
who has gone silent realising "Every=
thing is myself." 18.9

For the yogi who has found peace, there is no distr=
action or
one-pointedness, no higher knowledge or ignorance, no pleasure an=
d no pain.
18.10

The dominion of heaven or beggary, gain or loss, life amo=
ng men or in the
forest, these make no difference to a yogi whose nature it=
 is to be free
from distinctions. 18.11

There are no religious obligations=
, wealth, sensuality, or discrimination
for a yogi free from such opposites=
 as "I have done this," and "I have not
done that." 18.12

There is nothing=
 needing to be done or any attachment in his heart for the
yogi liberated w=
hile still alive. Things things will last just to the end of
life. 18.13

T=
here is no delusion, world, meditation on That, or liberation for the
pacif=
ied great soul. All these things are just the realm of
imagination.18.14

H=
e by whom all this is seen may well make out it doesn't exist, but what is
=
the desireless one to do? Even in seeing it he does not see it. 18.15

He b=
y whom the Supreme Brahma is seen may think "I am Brahma," but what is
he t=
o think who is without thought, and who sees no duality? 18.16
