Namaste,

Some Dry coconuts tak=
es time to catch fire and start burning while some catches fire instantly. =
with experience you will come to know by just seeing a dry coconut half if =
it'll take time to catch fire or will start burning instantly.

There are 2=
 ways to instantly make Dry coconut pieces. Simpler of the 2 is to Hold Coc=
onut half between two palms and apply enough pressure so that it'll break i=
n to 4 pieces of adequate size.
Or 2ndly (for relatively smaller coconut ha=
lves) just hold the dry half from both sides and apply shearing pressure. I=
 mean pull it to create 2 pieces. this will give you 2 bigger pieces but th=
e advantage is that that will burn well and quickly because of more hollow =
space it'll have (Its difficult for me to explain this).

***

Keep appx 2 =
Coconut pieces at the edge of Burning camphor and see to it that it catches=
 fire adequately. too much ghee is not required.

However all of these with=
 come with experience automatically.

Best Regards,

Utpal
