Hello LN,

It is nice of you to share your experiences. I have some questio=
ns.

1. Do you break your fast in the evening and have dinner? or do you fa=
st the whole day and night and have breakfast the next day (dvadasi)?

2. I=
f you have dinner at night, is it only sweet potato or normal dinner with r=
ice?

Regards
Ram

=C2=A0 
Hi,
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I've be=
en unable to write because I am caring for someone and so lots of tension.
=
But as Eakadasi cycle just started nearly 17 days ago, I=C2=A0will try=C2=
=A0to write my experience.
I do Eakadasi vrat every 15 days.
=C2=A0I do thi=
s vrat for spiritual upliftment and not to give my 
system any detox. My fo=
cus is on spiritual growth.
=C2=A0
I have a personal temple or altar in my =
home where e,very thing that is cooked in our kitchen
is offered with devot=
ion and also cooked food that comes from outside. I remember once I was 
ta=
lking to Utpal on yahoo and I said I have just made tea and I am offering t=
o Deities. I thought
he was a bit surprised that I am offering tea.
=C2=A0
=
Anyway, everyday food is very normal indian sattvic=C2=A0vegetarian food.bu=
t on Eakadasi day only
potato or sweet potato=C2=A0cooked in ghee or butter=
=C2=A0 are offered and fruits and then I take that as 
prasad. I keep all p=
ots and spoons etc used in cooking away from other=C2=A0utensils. I also ta=
ke tea 
and aspirin during the day=C2=A0but avoid taking several other vita=
mins etc.
=C2=A0
I am doing this vrat for=C2=A0many years and few times tri=
ed to stop it but received spiritual nudges that I 
should keep it on. Then=
=C2=A0some years back,=C2=A0a relation sent us a booklet about Eakadasi vra=
t from america, I said to my=C2=A0mother why
she has sent this book to us. =
My mother said that her mother-in- law has given=C2=A0this book to her and =
she 
wants us to read it. As I was looking through it I saw that on Eakadas=
i day, one should not drink water from a conch. I knew immediately it has c=
ome for me because everyday in the morning I drink water from a conch after=
 saying prayers.
It gave such a feeling of joy that Eakadasi Deviji was wat=
ching me.
