Krishna Kanth Ji

Even though the query was intented for Narasimha ji ,hope=
 you do not mind if I share a few thoughts. Swami Rama in his other books a=
lso has mentioned a similar thing. As you might be aware Swami rama was bro=
ught up the sadhus since a very early age and later on had very high experi=
ences with Mahavatar babaji.

Swami rama always held the Guru in very high =
esteeem but often noticed the disciples just took to blind worship of the g=
uru instead of striving for internal change. It is a very valid path if the=
 disciple can offer himself completely that if the guru commands him to cut=
 off his head ...the disciple should do so in a twinkling of an eye. But mo=
dern rational thinking disciples only have maybe 20% of the bhakti and ofte=
n put on a show of bhakti.This kind of bhakti is very dangerous ..in fact i=
s detrimental to progress.

Swami Rama like Swami Vivekananda and Yogananda=
 was a man of action and he often gave a call to rise oneself through one's=
 own efforts.

The analogy of the Guru being a boat and need to respect the=
 guru instead of worshipping the guru flows from the same philosophy.

If o=
ne can offer oneself in the fire of devotion completely like a moth smitten=
 by fire as Vimalananda says in the aghora books like a forlon lover torn b=
y intense passion for the diety or guru ....he/she does not need any more r=
ituals /understanding or procedures.


Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
