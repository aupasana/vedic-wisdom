Shankara says that the atman should and can be realized only through knowle=
dge and not by ritual. He positively asserts that, on the dawn of knowledge=
, karma naturally and necessarily ceases to function. Karma of any kind is,=
 according to Shankara, a hindrance to final emancipation of the soul, and =
the performance of karma involves one in the cycle of samsara. It is only B=
rahmajnana that rends asunder the knots of ignorance and bestows moksha on =
the soul.

Sannyasa is absolutely necessary whether it be vividisha-sannyas=
a or vidvat-sannyasa. Without perfect renunciation it is impossible to purs=
ue the path of Brahmavidya.
