Namaste,

I am leaving in top floor apartment in Bangalore. I am planning t=
o start Ganapati Hoamam once a week every Sunday. Pooja room is very small =
to do Homam inside and wife is not comfortable with doing Homam in leaving =
room as there woods of uncompleted carpentry work there.

Is it okay to do =
the Homam in Terrace?

Regards.

Mihir
