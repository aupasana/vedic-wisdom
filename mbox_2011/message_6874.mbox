Hello,

I think that using dry coconut instead of wood is better option for=
 you. I also do homam in a very small room with less ventilation and i have=
 found dry coconut better because of following reasons

dry coconut does no=
t produce black smoke hence blackening of walls is very minimal

dry coconu=
t burn seamlessly. i dont have to worry about fire once it starts. hence i =
can  concentrate more on the procedure

very less ghee is needed with cocon=
ut. two three drops per aahuti is more than enough.

ash after the homam is=
 very less. and quite a long homam can be done even in small homam kundam.
=

i cut coconut in pieces of 1.5 inch x 0.5 inch approx. they last longer as=
 compared to 1 x 1 inch if you put them on edges of fire

with the grace of=
 guruji
regards
