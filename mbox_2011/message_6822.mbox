The duty of a brahmachari is different from that of a grihastha, vanaprasth=
a and a sannyasin. The duty of a grihastha is quite unconcerned with the du=
ty of the other three. Similar is the case with the vanaprastha and the san=
nyasin. One has nothing to do with the works of the other. The brahmachari =
studies the samhita portion of the Vedas as swadhyaya.The grihastha perform=
s action according to the brahmana portion of the Vedas. The vanaprastha le=
ads a mystic and secluded life according to the sylvan text or the aranyaka=
 portion of the Vedas. The sannyasin contemplates according to the upanisha=
dic or knowledge portion of the Vedas.
