Dear Narasimha,

I'm doing navagraha tarpana reciting nava graha slokas in =
Panchangam. 3 times for each of 8 grahas and 108 for Kuja reciting "Dharani=
 GarBha samBhootham...". I do Achamanam only once before & after the reciti=
ng navagrahs slokas. 

Since, I was told that I could not do the navagraha =
tarpanam along with Sandhya( with Deva & Gayathri tarpanam), I'm doing this=
 after Sandhya but before daily prayer.

I was told and believe that my Kuj=
a is very badly afflicted
My question to you is:

a. is that the right Kuja=
 japam that I'm performing. Link on your JHora points a different sloka>
b.=
 Is my process correct? can you rectify or offer other remedies?
c. I want =
to start the daily homam that you prescribed, could not start it yet for wa=
nt of time. Already my prayer is taking about 45 min in the morning. I'll s=
tart one of these days, God willing.

Thanks!
