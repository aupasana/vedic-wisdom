Respected Srini ji,

I am not able enough to answer.  Infact I am also pass=
ing through the similar phase. 

In last some time, i have realised that be=
st think is 'not trying to unlearn'

I try to follow two steps. 1st is surr=
endering to god.  I try surrender whole of my efforts to Guru. whether i me=
ditate or not. whether i am able to concentrate or not whether i feel somet=
hing or not all is guru's wish. 

Second is to concentrate on mantra (or pi=
cture or any other point) alone.  any other thought or idea  or experience =
is welcome and is honoured and is kept aside respectfully.  and i try to at=
tend the mantra again. although i am not perfect in this and i dont know wh=
ether it is correct method or not. But who cares when guru is therr. even i=
f i do something wrong he will take care of it.

Sorry for mistakes

Regard=
s
