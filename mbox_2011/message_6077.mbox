Namaste,

Thanks Utpal and KK for such a prompt reply. 
@Utpal--But the pro=
blem i face is even if there is unburnt coconut in fire i need too add ghee=
 from time to time otherwise that extra ghee added before meditation goes a=
nd gets accumulated in the bottom.
The fire would go off after 5-7 minutes =
of starting my mediattion if i dont give some attentiion to it.

@KK-- as f=
ar as i doing another homam as quickly  is possible, i try to do that every=
day. But you dont feel good when you see unburnt pieces in kund..:)

Regard=
s
Jitender
