Subject: Offering whole fresh coconut in homam

Namaste,

Depending on the materials offered in homam, the effect on one's subtle 
consciousness changes. One of the nice substances that one can offer in 
homam fire is a whole fresh coconut. Though dry coconut (copra) can also 
be offered, normal fresh whole coconut with water in it is a fantastic 
material. Traditionally this is what was offered as poornaahuti 
(symbolic of head, i.e. ego).

BTW, those who do homam with a small fire using dry coconut pieces 
should ignore this mail completely. Offering a whole fresh coconut in 
fire is practical only for those who do homam with a big fire using logs 
of wood. You want to offer something only if you can fully burn it.

If a fresh coconut is offered in fire, it will take a while to burn 
completely, because it has layers (fiber, shell, white stuff and water 
etc, just like our own ego-consciousness!). If one offers it in the end 
of homam, it will be a challenge to make it burn fully.

One idea is to offer it in the beginning instead of the end, and give it 
time to burn, as one goes through homam. I, for example, offer a fresh 
coconut in my daily homam at the end of offerings to Ganapathi at the 
beginning of homam. Then I invoke Chandi and offer Chandipath in fire 
with various offerings. During the course, the fresh coconut burns fully 
and gets reduced to ashes by the end. Having offered a whole fresh 
coconut in homam daily for six months, I can tell you that it is a very 
good idea (if and only if it is practical in your case).

One risk is that coconut can break in a spot and hot water can gush at 
you at a speed. Though that can be avoided with a little understanding 
of the dynamics, one should not do this if one is worried about the 
inhury.

Best regards,
Narasimha
