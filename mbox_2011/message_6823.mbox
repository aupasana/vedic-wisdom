THE SWAMI                You are boys - very young boys.Your mind has
not =
yet received

                                        any evil impression f=
rom the
outside world.If you can struggle

                                =
        hard from now on, you will  be
able to escape life's sorrows and

 =
                                       miseries.

                         =
               Whatever the riches you may
possess,whatever your chances of=


                                        living a happy and prosperous
lif=
e,however  wide your circle of

                                        fri=
ends and well-wishers,you will
not have real happiness.All

               =
                         these things last for a few
moments, or at the mos=
t an hour;they

                                       do not last  longer.=
Then comes a
reaction of misery.Thus reaction

                            =
           follows action.If one is to attain
true and eternal happiness,on=
e

                                       must aspire after that joy which
=
brings no reaction in its train.

                                       Wh=
erein lies that true and eternal
happiness?It lies in realizing

          =
                             God.This divine enjoyment alone
brings no reac=
tion; all other

                                       Kinds of enjoyments=
 you can name
are followed by reaction.And

                               =
        you must know that wherever there
is reaction,there is sorrow and

=
                                       suffering.
