The idea of freedom is the only true idea of salvation =E2=80" freedom from=
 everything, the senses, whether of pleasure or pain, from good as well as =
evil. More than this even. We must be free from death; and to be free from =
death, we must be free from life. Life is but a dream of death. Where there=
 is life, there will be death; so get away from life if you would be rid of=
 death.
