[Though this mail originated on an astrology list, it has content that 
may=
 be interesting here too.]

Namaste Ranjan,

 person (not even experienced Saturn's

The only "ritual" KK mentioned is a regular homam for 2.5 years using=
 
Vishnu sahasra naam. That would not take "so many hours" or "a lot of 
ti=
me". In fact, one can do it in just 25-30 minutes. Spending half an 
hour e=
veryday need not compromise "learning about his job and career".

In fact, =
most people today complain of being busy and not having any 
time, but they=
 do waste a lot of time in useless gossips, TV and other 
temporary enterta=
inment that neither enriches nor enlightens one. In 
fact, some of the ente=
rtainment these days drains people's energy 
instead of recharging. Compare=
d to it, spending half an hour worshipping 
Vishnu in fire is not a drag on=
 one's career and material life.

*        *        *

Spiritual sadhana is=
 not a waste of time otherwise spent in material 
pursuits, but it focuses =
the mind better so that one can engage in one's 
material pursuits better. =
People spend 90% of their energy on things 
that are not in their control -=
 either regretting past that is out of 
their hands or worrying about futur=
e that is still hazy. As a result, 
they do not always do the best job they=
 can, in the present (which is 
the only thing in their hands right now!).
=

The goal of spiritual sadhana is to teach the mind to let go what it 
need=
 not be attached to and focus on its present dharma and karma. That 
is the=
 essence of upanishads and BhagavadGita.

Spiritual sadhana burns mental co=
nditioning and brings clarity and focus 
of the mind, which do not compromi=
se one's material life but improve it.

Sadly, corruptions in spiritual con=
cepts in Kali yuga made people see 
spiritual sadhana as an equivalent of r=
enunciation of the material 
world. That is not true. The goal of spiritual=
 sadhana is neither to run 
away from nor to run after, specific material p=
ursuits. The goal of 
spiritual sadhana is to engage in the material pursui=
ts that are 
required based on one's previous karmas and conditioning, and =
to do so 
*efficiently*. Crying over past that is out of control and worryi=
ng over 
future that is yet to come, do not make one more efficient. On the=
 
contrary, they make one inefficient. On the other hand, focusing on the 
=
best action possible right now and doing it detachedly, will make one 
very=
 efficient. It will help one fulfill one's dharma and pay off one's 
kaarmi=
k debts, without incurring too many new debts.

However, that efficiency do=
es not come easily and some spiritual sadhana 
is required. There is no min=
imum age limit for gaining this efficiency. 
So anyone can do spiritual sad=
hana.

*        *        *

Now I will make some generic comments on destin=
y vs free will. These 
comments are not necessarily about KK.

>> Success n=
ever depends on your decision. Your own country
>> or abroad, it comes to y=
ou as destined. Rather, you can't
>> exercise your discretion here.

Someti=
mes, destiny is too powerful and forces one's free will in a 
specific path=
. Sometimes, free will has more scope. In fact, destiny and 
free will are =
not different. Yesterday's free will is today's destiny 
and today's free w=
ill is tomorrow's destiny!

"Success never depends on your decision" is wro=
ng. Decisions taken at 
important kaarmik crossroads CAN and DO impact one'=
s life in future. 
Anybody who believes otherwise is thinking that actions =
of our free will 
have no consequences. Yes, consequences of an action can =
sometimes come 
after a life or two, but they can come in the same life too=
.

If Saturn is in 8th and his dasa comes (or any other such planetary 
com=
bination), exactly what he gives cannot be fixed by anyone. There are 
seve=
ral possibilities and what exactly comes to happen, within the field 
of po=
ssibilities, IS dependent on the decisions native has taken until 
now in t=
his very life.

Anybody who believes otherwise is dismissing the whole fiel=
d of remedial 
measures. If a remedial measure can have a consequence, then=
 a decision 
on whether to stay in India or go to Dubai does have a consequ=
ence.

Bottomline: One who has an important decision to make and has a choi=
ce 
between two drastically different options has to realize that the 
deci=
sion made WILL impact the journey of one's life, weigh the 
possibilities, =
pros and cons and take the decision after due 
deliberation.

Exercise of f=
ree will is not only a privilege, but also a 
responsibility. If one wants =
to keep the privilege in future (instead of 
being forced by destiny's hand=
 and not have a choice), one needs to take 
the responsibility seriously.

Narasimha
