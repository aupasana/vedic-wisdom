On the topic of Yantras, I have a few questions. Is there a way we can crea=
te our own yantras? Are people aware of any writing instruments on copper p=
lates that we, as end users can use, instead of going to a special store? T=
he reason I ask this is, people sell all kinds of yantras these days, in ya=
ntra factories and sell them on internet, which in past Shri Narasimha ment=
ioned. And he did dismiss them as not too useful things for sadhana. In thi=
s group, all of us do involve in some kind of sadhana with a sincere approa=
ch, in my opinion. So, in my opinion if we can create our own yantras, that=
 would be a lot better than any ready made stuff available on the net.

Namaste KK,

Robert Svoboda in "K=

in th=

Fig-1 shown in Homam Manual (which is to be drawn at the base of Homa Kun=
