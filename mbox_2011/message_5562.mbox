 A KING WAS passing through a forest in all pomp and pageantry, with his
ar=
my and retinue behind him. He came across a man with not even a cod-piece
o=
n, lying on the ground,with one leg cocked over the other. He was laughing
=
away,apparently supremely happy, contented with himself and all the world.
=

The king was struck with the man=E2=80=99s happy state and sent for him. B=
ut when
the king=E2=80=99s men approached the nude ascetic and delivered th=
e king=E2=80=99s message,
he took absolutely
no notice and continued in his=
 ascetic bliss. On being told of this, the
king himself went to the man and=
 even then the man took no notice.

Thereupon it struck the king that this =
must be no common man, and said,
=E2=80=98Swami, you are evidently supremel=
y happy. May we know what is the secret of
such happiness and from which gu=
ru you learnt it?=E2=80=99

Thereupon the ascetic told the king, =E2=80=98I=
 have had twentyfour gurus.
Everything,this body, the earth, the birds, som=
e instruments, some
persons,all have taught me=E2=80=99. All the things in =
the world may be classed as
either good or bad. The good taught him what he=
 must seek. Similarly, the
bad taught him what he must avoid. The ascetic w=
as Dattatreya, the avadhuta.
