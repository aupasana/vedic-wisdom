 On 14th August 2010, Ravi Ramanan, the leading member of Sarangati
newslet=
ter Editorial Team and youngest son of the Ashram President Sri V. S.
Raman=
an, was absorbed in Arunachala. Ravi faced his two year battle
against brai=
n cancer with remarkable courage and dignity.

A Satsang was held at the As=
hram President=E2=80=99s residence on Saturday the 21st
of August 2010 on t=
he eighth day of Ravi Ramanan=E2=80=99s Absorption in Bhagavan.
Sri V.S. Ra=
manan, Susila Ramanan, Ranjani Ravi Ramanan, her mother Mangalam,
daughters=
 Rasika and Raksha, and many relatives and other devotees of
Bhagavan were =
present.

Nochur Sri Venkataraman spoke on the occasion when he expressed h=
is
heart-felt feelings to Ranjani and other bereaved members of the family =
and
proceeded to explain how devotees of Bhagavan may effectively face such=
 a
crisis in the light of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching.

He began by saying =
that he knew the mental agony of one who loses a dear
one, especially at a =
young age. His sister=E2=80=99s husband passed away young last
year and the=
 agony lingers in his heart. However, as devotees of Bhagavan we
have no ch=
oice
but to listen to his words and live by them and attain the highest goa=
l of
life. Bhagavan=E2=80=99s own life and his teachings give us very preci=
ous insights
into the phenomenon of death.

Bhagavan has poured his Grace o=
n Ravi like a torrent. Ravi was totally
devoted to Bhagavan and identified =
himself with the interests of the Ashram.
It is for us to realize that Bhag=
avan=E2=80=99s ways cannot be comprehended by our
finite minds and accept w=
hatever happens. His basic teaching =E2=80=9CWhatever is
destined to happen=
 will happen, do what you may to prevent it,=E2=80=9D is like a
mantra, whi=
ch, when followed in actual practice, is sure to give us peace.

Bhagavan=
=E2=80=99s basic teaching, quoted above, is a Cosmic Law and death and birt=
h
happen in nature strictly according to that Law. Ravi=E2=80=99s illness a=
nd death
were according to that Law.But Bhagavan=E2=80=99s arul (Grace) mad=
e it so sacred
that his own parents and his wife could feel its sacredness =
and maintain an
amazing inner calmness and composure at the moment of the h=
appening and
afterwards. This shows how deep was Ravi=E2=80=99s devotion to=
 Bhagavan and how
abundant is Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Grace on the whole family.=
