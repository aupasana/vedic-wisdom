The true Bhakta's love is this burning madness, before which everything els=
e vanishes for him. The whole universe is to him full of love and love alon=
e; that is how it seems to the lover. So when a man has this love in him, h=
e becomes eternally blessed, eternally happy; this blessed madness of divin=
e love alone can cure forever the disease of the world that is in us.
