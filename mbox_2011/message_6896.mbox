Namaste,

The best solution will be to go to good electrical shop and buy a=
 aluminum lamp shade something like in the following photos. They are prett=
y cheap in india.

Hang it on above fire of your havan kund (on a stich with supported on ch=
air or something while you do homam), Keep the hole meant for the bulb open=
 as it will allow air to flow up through convection and 95% of the sooth wi=
ll get deposited on the lamp shade.

You can easily clean the lamp shade on=
ce in 6 months.
For a 10x10inch havan kund, a 8-10inch diameter lamp shade =
will be more than enough. 

regards
priyank
