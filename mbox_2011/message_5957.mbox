Namaste Rajarshi ji,  I would like to thank you for reiterating a very sign=
ificant point that if the offerings are not burnt completely, it should be =
burnt in the next homam by the same person as soon as possible.  I hope all=
 the newbies to the group will make a note of this suggestion.  Though we a=
ll read PVRji's guidelines at the onset, out of excitement to make spiritua=
l progress we take a nose dive into performing homams and we tend to overlo=
ok few such suggestions.  

For the well being of the newbies of this group=
, I'm quoting Rajarshi ji's previous explanation below.

"Whatever you put =
in the fire as ahuti is nothing but your own karmas from your kareen sharir=
. So when you put a purnahuti, it is also some karma from your kareen share=
er. Now what you do when you give it in fire, is bring it out from your kar=
een sharir and dispose it off. This could be a karma which you were suppose=
d to experience at a later date. If you burn it to ash, it means the karma =
is over. But if it does not burn to ash, it means you have brought the karm=
a out of your karan sharir and now it is on your being! Basically, it is li=
ke acclerating a future karma into the present time, if the punahuti is not=
 burnt sufficiently.
 
So next time when you give a purnahuti, if it does n=
ot burn completely, don't throw it away. Next day when you start the homa, =
place that unburnt piece in the kunda before you light the fire so that thi=
s time it gets completely burnt." 

Wishing everyone all that is desirable,=

-Sunitha
