For the last 3 days I have been doing the same, never used aluminium foil a=
nd am not planning to use also. But still, today being a working day, I put=
 some time limit and was not too convinced with the way the homam went toda=
y. The dry coconuts were not catching fire (unlike the twigs I used the las=
t 2 days) and the fire went off twice before I put camphor to reignite. 
An=
yways, I am planning to do the homam in the weekends only unless I get to k=
now how I can manage sandhyavandanam along with homam ! 
Previously I was a=
ble to do Gayatri mantra and HareKrsna mahamantra in 90 mins or 100 mins an=
d that was all completely mantras.
Then, I started sandhya vandanam along w=
ith Harekrsna mahamantra and my mahamantra numbers came down to accommodate=
 the rituals of sandhya vandanam.
Today (unliked the weekend where I took m=
ore than 2 hours), I realized neither I have done sandhya vandanam properly=
 nor the homam properly to accommodate both of them. Not sure if I should d=
o daily homam if the main part of the prayers go in worrying about the agni=
 in the kundam !

My ranting aside, do we need to further dry the dry cocon=
uts; not sure why the small 1x1 pieces did not burn well. The final poornah=
uti has burnt well with half dry coconut. I use good amount of ghee and I a=
m not sure if that much is needed as most of it simply flows down.

Lastly,=
 I tried in some shops yes'day and everyone is selling iron homa kundam onl=
y and they reply back that copper is not used !!

Thanks Ajit for your resp=
onses again.

Thanks VPathak.

regards
rAma
