Namaste,
=C2=A0
<<=C2=A0
Question here is; should we follow the actual visi=
on or the description mentioned for the visualization?>>


If the manual sa=
ys so, follow it. Some people worship Chandi in a four handed form as well.=
 But think, does the description of the vairkritikam rahasya actually paint=
 a complete picture of Her? It leaves a lot to your imagination, doesn't it=
. Buddhists also worship Chandi , in some sects. She is called the mother o=
f 7000 Buddhas of all universes. But the Thangka paintings of Chandi all ha=
ve very typical Tibetian/Chinese face. Thats the way they have imagined her=
. 

To understand this try and understand what is a form of a deity, any de=
ity. You see the image of Durga riding a lion. The lion that we paint and m=
ake is the pantera leo, a lifeform that came into existence through the pro=
cess of evolution a million years ago. This evolved from an earlier form of=
 a=C2=A0prehistoric=C2=A0lion with larger and scarier=C2=A0fangs. Why don't=
 we use the earlier imagery of the lion in our pictures? The energy of Durg=
a is called eternal, but the entity of the lion evolved at a fixed point in=
 history. How did that form become her vehicle? Even the weapons she uses a=
re humanly evolved with time? What happened before these came into existenc=
e?

A deity is a cosmic energy, and in the field of duality it has some att=
ributes. Internally it is connected to the supreme, unspeakable, nameless e=
ntity which is impossible for the average human mind to imagine even remote=
ly. Some specific qualities of that unspeakable,=C2=A0purely transcendental=
=C2=A0energy are manifested in certain fashions through archetypical cosmic=
 energies which we call deities. The forms/iconographies that we attribute =
to the=C2=A0deities are symbolic of these qualities. For example, we can't =
see magnetic lines of force, but if you keep iron-fillings, they can create=
 a pattern and give the impression of a shape.=C2=A0When perception is very=
 subtle, due to purity of the internal nadis, then the energy can manifest =
as a form which has been created as a symbolic=C2=A0aggregate of its differ=
ent attributes. Thus each aspect of the iconography is a representation of =
some quality. The lion represents strength, power, raw courage, confidence =
and fearlessness.
 Exactly the qualities that a sadhaka will imbibe when he=
/she keeps successfully=C2=A0meditating on the iconography of Durga. Simila=
rly=C2=A0Chamunda is savasana, sitting on a corpse. Die to the material wor=
ld you must, if you have to=C2=A0become Her vehicle.=C2=A0 And when you rai=
se=C2=A0your awareness to the shahasrar, then you can=C2=A0percieve these c=
osmic=C2=A0energies without any attributes any more. But untill you have th=
e ability to reach that state of consciousness, it is mere theory with zero=
 real value. 


So what the Rahasya explains is the basic fundamental icono=
graphic=C2=A0outline of Mahalakshmi. The plethora of weapons are precisely =
because her chief quality as manifested in the world of duality in a war-li=
ke ferocity. 
Not everybody who does the Chandi path may have a connection =
with this iconography. Infact, most people don't. Some may have a connectio=
n with another iconography. The Chandipaath contains a whole galaxy of icon=
ographies. This is where one needs guidance in pinpointing the exact form u=
nfailingly, which will cause faster spiritual evolution. 

________________=
_______________________________________________________________________


T=
he distinction between ferocious forms and non-ferocious forms is not a cre=
ation of some. It is the way it is, and has been reconfirmed over and over =
by people who have realized the different forms in the field of duality. If=
 the iconography of a deity holds a weapon, it is not for show purposes. An=
d if it holds plenty of weapons, then there are plenty of good reasons wher=
e=C2=A0he/she amply uses them. If you worship Smashan Kali at home, She wil=
l make the area you live in into a smashan, whether you want it or not. Som=
e opine that the smashana is merely=C2=A0in the heart of the sadhaka, and S=
he is not really that fierce. This is solid misunderstanding based on a boo=
kish understanding superimposed with Vedanata type thinking. Where the smas=
hana will be created for Kaali depends on your personal conditioning. If yo=
u are continuously living in perfectly universal condition, unattached to a=
nything, THEN you literally ARE the Universe. Then the smashana is only
 in=
side your heart, which in that case has become the whole world.=C2=A0Else, =
for the rest whose minds still firmly work in the field of duality, the sma=
shana is both outside and inside, depending on the degree of connection the=
 person has to the universal. Smashana Tara told Vimalananda that she canno=
t come to his home, he has to go to the smashana every night. Thats the way=
 it is. Similarly, an ugra form is=C2=A0actually ferocious. A soumya form i=
s actually non-ferocious.=C2=A0Some will love the former, some will love th=
e later. Chandi, the very name, comes from the root word "chand", which is =
also the root word for Chandala. One who does not follow rules, cannot be m=
ade to confirm to any rule, breaks down rules and restrictions.=C2=A0This d=
erivation is mentioned in some of the texts on Chandi sadhana. That gives a=
 slight hint of what kind of energy She manifests.

Namaste Rajarshi=
,

Thank you for your kind sharing of your knowledge on Chandi with the gro=
up.

How does this person's vision impact the description mentioned in vaik=
tikarahasyam?
Isn't this used in the dhyanam for the invocation of Chandi i=
n the homam manual.

Question here is; should we follow the actual vision o=
r the description mentioned for the visualization?

Thank you.
