Dear Narasimha,

I read this email again and one question came to my mind r=
egarding
homa/yagya: It is stated in 'Muhurtha Cintamani' by Girish Chand S=
harma,
page 70, that there are different effects when havana/yagya is done =
in
certain time... also, it is stated the abode of living of fire in the ha=
vana
and the auspicious and inauspicious effects of it.

There are 1-2 page=
s detail explanations on it.

When doing general yagya/homa (not samskaras =
which might need it), do you
consider muhurtha for it?... and if yes, which=
 one?... like no Moon in the
8th (or 8th house vacant) and other standard m=
uhurtha principles?

Also, this info from Muhurtha Cintamani, what is your =
opinion?

thanks in advance,
Medha

Yes, some peopl=
e use bamboo tubes. Some people use the tubes in which incense sticks (dhoo=
p or agarbatti sticks) are sold. Even with bamboo tubes, if air directly go=
es from mouth into fire, it can carry saliva. The key is that air blown fro=
m mouth should touch some surface (e.g. inside wall of bamboo tube) at an a=
ngle slightly less than 180 deg, get reflected and then go towards fire. Th=
en, air touching fire will not have saliva in it. You can experiment by blo=
wing air onto one palm by reflecting it off the other palm. You'll see =
that air coming to the latter is wet and the air coming to the former is dr=
y. In any case, like I said, maintaining a good sized fire always is better=
 than letting it nearly extinguish and then resuscitate it by blowing air.<=
br>

 <br>
Ideally, one should not leave in the middle and stay till the en=
d. If one must leave the area for a nature's call, one can add enough w=
ood (or other fuel) before the break.<br>
 <br>
After the nature's call=
, it is a good idea to take bath again. Some level of physical cleanliness =
is to be maintained with external fire. One cannot say "I am pure insi=
de and why does external purity matter". Just as the internal fire is =
affected by internal purity, external fire is affected by external purity.<=
br>

 <br>
When the external fire is strong, the internal fire tries to fol=
low it and resonate with it. So the rules of external fire must be obeyed. =
If a yogi with a very strong internal fire is doing homam, then actually th=
e internal fire may dominate and the external fire may follow it and resona=
te with it! Then the rules of external fire do not apply.<br>
