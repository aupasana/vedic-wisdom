O man! Wake up! Walk in the footsteps of your forefathers, the great Seers!=
 This world is full of miseries and tribulations. The more you think there =
is joy in it, the more are you deluded! The more you forget your soul, the =
more are your miseries. Be not deluded by the thought, =E2=80=9CI have to l=
ook after my family! They will die if I do not earn money for them. My chil=
dren will weep of hunger,=E2=80=9D and so on.
