Some may say: =E2=80=9CFrom. this it follows that it is not necessary for a=
 knower even to serve his preceptor or to perform tapas.=E2=80=9D Household=
ers who are afraid of begging for bread and are afraid of ridicule argue li=
ke this through their sharp intelligence. You cannot say that even begging =
for bread is a binding rule on a sannyasin. That is not a desire and the sa=
nnyasin is virtually a mendicant without rules binding him. He is not liabl=
e to any kind of command. Even one who does not know Brahman but who is des=
irous of emancipation should enter into the order of a sannyasin. The sruti=
 says: =E2=80=9CLet one live in the order of sannyasa which is a means to t=
he knowledge of Brahman.=E2=80=9D Brahmacharya may help one to attain knowl=
edge but it is not the case with a householder. When a means is not properl=
y followed it can never accomplish any object. The heavenly bliss of the ka=
rma-kandin is only a form of worldly enjoyment. Heaven is only another worl=
d. If one professes to have knowledge he cannot do actions, for actions are=
 worldly. The atman is entirely opposed to action and hence it cannot be an=
 auxiliary to the knowledge of it. The sruti says: =E2=80=9CWhen to him eve=
rything has become the Self, who should see what and through what should on=
e see?=E2=80=9D etc. This nullifies the meaning of actions in one who has k=
nowledge.
