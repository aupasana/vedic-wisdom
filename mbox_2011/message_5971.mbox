 35 The sage is wide-awake, having become established in the true state of
=
the Self, which is free from the darkness of ignorance. In respect of the
d=
ream-world that is being seen by those drowsy with ignorance of the Self,
h=
e is asleep.

36 Hence it is said that this world is as night to the sage, =
whereas to the
ignorant the real Self is as night. For this reason the natu=
ral state, the
fourth state is described by the sages as a state of waking =
sleep.

This distinction between the sage and the ignorant finds a place in=
 the
following verse of the Gita: =E2=80=98The sage is awake in what is nig=
ht to all
creatures. That in which the creatures are awake is night to the =
sage,
though he is, in fact, awake.=E2=80=99

This implies that from the st=
andpoint of the sage, the world is unreal. This
verse suggests a question: =
how the sage, whose body is still alive, can
carry on his mission as a teac=
her of supreme wisdom. The solution to this
riddle lies in the fact that th=
e natural state of a sage does not interfere
with the sage=E2=80=99s work a=
s a teacher. That activity goes on in a mysterious
way, which is explained =
to the extent possible in a later context.

>From all this it might appear t=
hat sagehood is something anomalous. What is
anomalous is the worldly outlo=
ok, which is blind to the real and attentive
to the unreal dream, the world=
-appearance. The worldly ones are just like
intoxicated or mad people. It i=
s the sage who is both sober and sane.

Up to now the supreme state of the =
sage has been called the fourth state.
But this name is only a concession t=
o novices, as is shown presently.

37 For those to whom the three states, w=
aking and the rest, are real, that
[supreme] state is mentioned as =E2=80=
=98the fourth state=E2=80=99. But since that so-called
fourth state alone i=
s real, and these three are unreal, the term =E2=80=98fourth
state=E2=80=99=
 is not rightly applicable to it.

The supreme state is therefore just the =
transcendental state. When compared
to this state, the three worldly states=
 cannot be considered to be real.
Their seeming reality is no more authenti=
c than the reality that is ascribed
to a dream while it lasts. This point w=
ill be further elaborated later.

The cause of the difference between the t=
hree states and the supreme state
is explained next.

38 In dream and wakin=
g, the mind, being active, itself creates the world. In
deep sleep it goes =
into seed form; on awaking it again creates the world.

In deep sleep the m=
ind is not completely lost; it goes into a latent state,
out of which it ca=
n emerge and become active again as before. This is the
reason for the cont=
inuance of bondage. Thus, these three states form a
vicious circle that can=
 be broken only by finally extinguishing the mind so
that it cannot revive =
on awaking.

To reach this goal the mind-free state must be attained in the=
 waking state
itself since the other two states are useless for this purpos=
e.

39 Unless and until the mind becomes utterly extinct, these three state=
s
will continue to prevail. When the mind becomes extinguished, the supreme=

state, in which this world once and for all ceases to appear [as real], is=

won.

During the prevalence of ignorance the three states conceal the supr=
eme
state. The latter cannot be experienced because of these. To be able to=

experience that state the mind must be destroyed so that the world-creatio=
n
will also cease. To this end, the quest must be taken up and pursued unti=
l
the mind-free state is established.

This is often styled the state of kn=
owledge. But this description is
misleading for the reason stated presently=
.

40 Though that state of being the real Self is called the state of
knowl=
edge, it is one in which there is none of the three: the knower, the
object=
 known, and the act of knowing. That being the case, what does one
know the=
re, by what means, and who is there to know? It must be understood
that kno=
wledge is just a name for the state of being the Self.

That state is diffe=
rent from anything else because it is a state of
non-duality (advaita). The=
re is no object to be known, nor is there a knower
=E2=80=93 the soul =E2=
=80=93 and hence there is no knowing. So =E2=80=98knowledge=E2=80=99 or =E2=
=80=98awareness=E2=80=99
are just arbitrary names for this state. This will=
 be explained later.

41 The upanishadic text that says: =E2=80=98Where the=
 Self is all there is, how and
what does one know there?=E2=80=99 makes it =
clear that in the supreme state the real
Self is alone [as the one without =
a second].

A possible misconception is next pointed out and the true state=
 clearly
explained.

42 In that state there is not, in reality, even the di=
fference of place and
the occupant thereof. Since the Self, the all-inclusi=
ve reality, is one
without a second, he, the Supreme Being, is his own plac=
e.

This is an echo of the upanishadic passage =E2=80=93 =E2=80=98He abides=
 in his own
greatness, or rather, not even in that greatness=E2=80=99 =E2=
=80=93 given to Narada by Guru
Sanat Kumara. This means that the real Self =
is not in space.

Who then is the advaitin?

43 Since the sage has put an e=
nd to all duality by attaining the supreme
state, the real state, he has th=
erefore attained the advaitic state. Hence,
he alone should be regarded as =
an advaitin.

This is important. Bhagavan has warned us against thinking of=
 advaita as a
doctrine, just like the doctrines of the sectarians. Since th=
e advaitic
state is the mind-free state, there is no room in it for doctrin=
es. This is
further explained as follows.

44 Duality comes to be taken as =
real because of taking something that is not
the Self to be the Self. The s=
ages tell us that the state of being free from
this ignorance is itself the=
 advaitic state.

This means that so long as this ignorance endures, the ad=
vaitic state is not
attained.

45 Thus, advaita is not a dogma like those o=
f the other religions. Also,
because the mind does not function in it, true=
 advaita is declared to be
just the state of being in one=E2=80=99s own rea=
l nature [as the real Self], free
from thoughts and worldless.

It must be =
remembered that the world can never be without the mind. For this
reason a =
merely theoretical =E2=80=93 intellectual =E2=80=93 belief in advaita is of=
 no
value whatever.

46 On the other hand, the advaitic state has not been =
attained by one who,
knowing the substance of the sacred lore as a doctrine=
, by his intellect
alone, is satisfied with it, without striving to win act=
ual experience of
the real Self.

This is explained in detail as follows:

=
47 Such a one has not dissolved the world-appearance by remaining in the
tr=
ue state of the Self as the supreme reality. He that knows the Self by
unde=
rstanding the substance of the books has not got rid of his false notion
th=
at the body is the Self!

Identification of the body as the Self is the pri=
mary ignorance, and
theoretical knowledge has not the least effect on that =
ignorance. It
survives. It ceases only by the attainment of the true state =
of the Self.

48 It has been stated by the Guru Sankara that such a one is =
really not
different from the brute animals. Brute-hood is defined by the s=
ages as that
state in which one regards the Self as being limited to the bo=
dy.

49 Hence, for him who just knows the sacred lore, the belief that the =
world
is real as such [in its own sight] does not cease. Deluded by this fa=
lse
belief, he, like all the rest, ever wanders helplessly in samsara.

50 =
It is said [by Bhagavan] that the knower of the sacred lore whose mind
has =
not subsided in the peace [of the supreme state] is just like a
gramophone.=
 It is also said [by Bhagavan] that he is even worse off than the
man witho=
ut learning, because, unlike the latter, he is overwhelmed by moods
of prid=
e, and so on.

In Ulladu Narpadu Anubandham Bhagavan has stated: =E2=80=98A=
 sincere and wide-awake
aspirant may even bewail the barrenness of result o=
f his theoretical
knowledge saying: =E2=80=9COh! The illiterate ones are be=
tter off than I am!=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

Such lamentations abound in the writ=
ings of the great saint Thayumanavar.
Indeed, as shown below, this theoreti=
cal conviction is only belief, not
knowledge.

51 This [theoretical] knowle=
dge is styled =E2=80=98inferential knowledge=E2=80=99, [as of a
thing absen=
t]. But the Self is never absent. How can inferential knowledge
of one that=
 is ever-present be true knowledge?

Logicians distinguish between knowledg=
e that is either direct or
inferential. The former pertains to objects perc=
eived by the senses and the
latter to objects not so perceived, but only in=
ferred. But for the reason
stated in this verse, there can be only direct [=
experiential] knowledge of
the Self, and hence the Self is never the subjec=
t matter of inference.
Descartes=E2=80=99 famous proposition, =E2=80=98I th=
ink, therefore I am=E2=80=99, is unsound for
this reason. The Self shines b=
y its own light of consciousness, and not by
any other light.

Also, knowle=
dge by sense perceptions is not really direct, that is,
immediate, but only=
 functions through a medium, a sense organ. The Self,
being consciousness, =
needs no medium.

52 The ignorance-causing bondage is just the [mistaken] e=
xperience that
takes the form =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. How can such=
 ignorance come to an end except
by the awareness, =E2=80=98I am the pure c=
onsciousness=E2=80=99?

Illusory experience can cease only by the illusion-=
free experience. That is
the reason why learned men still remain in ignoran=
ce and bondage.

53 This theoretical knowledge is only intellectual. But th=
e intellect has no
access to the real Self. Just as evil spirits are [ironi=
cally] styled as
=E2=80=98good people=E2=80=99, so this ignorance is styled=
 =E2=80=98knowledge=E2=80=99.

In Sanskrit literature the term =E2=80=98goo=
d people=E2=80=99 is used ironically to
designate evil spirits, the asuras =
or rakshasas.

54 When a man scorched by the sun becomes cooled by bathing =
in a mirage, or
when one succeeds in cooking food on a painting of a fire, =
then one may
attain deliverance by theoretical knowledge.

Thus, emphatical=
ly, the notion that theoretical knowledge is knowledge is
denounced.

55 Th=
erefore, one who talks advaita without actual experience of that truth
is j=
ust the same as a dvaitin [a dualist]. Neither speech nor mind has any
acce=
ss to that supreme state. He that abides in that state has no doctrine
what=
ever.

Doctrines, more or less true, are of help to the aspirant. They do n=
ot
survive in the state of deliverance (illumination). The sage does not =
=E2=80=98know=E2=80=99
the Self, because he is the Self.

This equation of =
him who has only theoretical knowledge with the dvaitin is
justified as fol=
lows:

56 Those who think of themselves as advaitins say [from intellectual=

conviction alone] that the world is unreal, miserable and inert
[unconscio=
us]. Others [professing dvaitins] say otherwise. But in the result
all are =
alike.

That is, all are in bondage and suffer the evils of samsara. They a=
ll act as
if the world were real.

=80=98knowledge=E2=80=99.<br>

<br>In Sanskrit literature the term =E2=80=
=98good people=E2=80=99 is used ironically to designate evil spirits, the a=
suras or rakshasas.<br><br>54 When a man scorched by the sun becomes cooled=
 by bathing in a mirage, or when one succeeds in cooking food on a painting=
 of a fire, then one may attain deliverance by theoretical knowledge.<br>

=
<br>Thus, emphatically, the notion that theoretical knowledge is knowledge =
is denounced.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">55 Therefore, one who=
 talks advaita without actual experience of that truth is just the same as =
a dvaitin [a dualist]. Neither speech nor mind has any access to that supre=
me state. He that abides in that state has no doctrine whatever.</span><br>=


<br>Doctrines, more or less true, are of help to the aspirant. They do no=
t survive in the state of deliverance (illumination). The sage does not =E2=
=80=98know=E2=80=99 the Self, because he is the Self.<br><br>This equation =
of him who has only theoretical knowledge with the dvaitin is justified as =
follows:<br>

<br>56 Those who think of themselves as advaitins say [from i=
ntellectual conviction alone] that the world is unreal, miserable and inert=
 [unconscious]. Others [professing dvaitins] say otherwise. But in the resu=

<br>That is, all are in bondage and suffer the evils=
 of samsara. They all act as if the world were real.<br><br><span style=3D"=
