Dear Nagraj

Namaskar ! I always make the yantras myse=
lf. I have got 6x6 copper plates made 
and I use the machine which can writ=
e on utensils, the one used for writing 
names  on steel utensils. You can =
get it for around 300 rupees in Delhi. It 
works fine with copper plate and=
 with a little practice u would be able to make 
a perfect yantra.

On the topic of Yantras, I have a few=
 questions. Is there a way we can create 
our own yantras? Are people aware=
 of any writing instruments on copper plates 
that we, as end users can use=
, instead of going to a special store? The reason I 
ask this is, people se=
ll all kinds of yantras these days, in yantra factories 
and sell them on i=
nternet, which in past Shri Narasimha mentioned. And he did 
dismiss them a=
s not too useful things for sadhana. In this group, all of us do 
involve i=
n some kind of sadhana with a sincere approach, in my opinion. So, in 
my o=
pinion if we can create our own yantras, that would be a lot better than an=
y 
ready made stuff available on the net.
