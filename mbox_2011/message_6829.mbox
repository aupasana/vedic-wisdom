Gopis were re-incarnations of blessed beings from higher lokas (realms of c=
onsciousness) and were instinctively drawn to Krishna as they were aware th=
at Krishna was the perfected being. They had perfect surrender to the perfe=
cted being and aspired for his company always.

 of the overly sensualized society we live in.

 and karmendriyas respectively. After all, this is the meaning in "Sri Sook=

 been superficially interpreted by scholars as "one who gives cows and hors=

 time. The true meaning is that our jnanendriyas and karmendriyas come into=
 being and operate through the shakti of the Mother. Anyway, let us go back=
 to gopis.

Bottomline: Those yogis and authors were unconditioned by lust and were sho=

everything has a symbolic meaning too. However, if you are teaching a young=
 and conditioned mind, I'd suggest not teaching verses that can appear to b=

let me give an analogy. Suppose seeing anything red makes a person remember=
