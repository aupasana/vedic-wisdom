      <p>Dear All,<br>
<br>
I am from Orissa=
. Living in Bhubaneswar. I got Jogannatha Hora from my Friend. I found it v=
ery nice in creating birth charts. One point surprised me that, It is so fl=
exible in calculating charts, I am confused, what are the configuration set=
tings that shall be correct for me. I wanted to create chart for myself and=
 my brothers. Our birth place being in orissa, I want your help in letting =
me know the preference setting in Hora software for calculating charts for =
myself and my brothers. In other words which settings shall favour for crea=
ting chart for Orissa region.<br>


<br>
Thanks and regards,<br>
