Namaste,

Veda Vyasa is not just "someone".

> Lord Vishnu is rajasi=
k deity, he always sustains.

Creation/expansion is an activity of rajas. S=
ustenance is of sattwa. 
Vishnu has always been considered as pure sattwa. =
The names sattwavaan 
and saattwikaH appear among his 1000 names.

I really=
 wonder how some people get highly judgmental and start 
pontificating, des=
pite really shallow understanding and utter 
confusions!

Rudr=
a, Chandi, Shiva etc are NOT "arch demons"!

We started this conversation b=
ecause you "condemned" homam to Shiva as 
it is not given in any scripture =
according to you. When shown ample 
references, you bemoaned that taamasik =
deities should not be worshipped 
with saattwik methods and said homam to t=
aamasik deities should include 
"menstruation blood, meat, fish, alcohol" e=
tc. Now you are making them 
out to be demons. See my note in the other mai=
l on gunas.

> If you really wants to promote homa then do it for sattavik =
deities 
> only

If YOU have faith in saattwik deities, you worship saattwi=
k deities. We 
WILL enable people to worship various deities (including Shi=
va!) in 
fire, in a saattwik manner.

Vaama maarga is not=
 just consuming alcohol and fish. Your understanding 
of vaama maarga is pi=
tiable. It is not that you just have fun and a 
deluded demonic deity who a=
lso likes fun comes along and helps you.

We say "all is Brahman" and yet w=
e treat some things as pure and some as 
impure. Vaama maarga is about taki=
ng something considered impure and 
being able to actually view it as Brahm=
an and not as a limited thing 
that evokes attraction or aversion in mind. =
It is about removing 
attraction and aversion for various things from the m=
ind completely and 
liberating one. Vaama maarga is not for all and certain=
ly not for those 
who want to enjoy alcohol, fish etc.

Naras=
