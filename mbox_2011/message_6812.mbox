Namaste,

I agree to 99 percent of this email, except the quote from John a=
bout baptism by 
fire. All John ment was someone coming after him who would=
 baptise with a 
"spiritual fire",=C2=A0and was a clear reference to Jesus =
who came after=C2=A0John.=C2=A0Taking 
that verse to mean a fire ritual is =
too far fetched.


There are better verses in the Bible/Torah which refer t=
o=C2=A0fire rituals.

"Then you call on the name of your god, and I will ca=
ll on the name of the 
LORD.The god who answers by fire=E2=80=94he is God.=
=E2=80=9D King James Bible 18:24

"Leviticus 1 The Burnt Offering" (whole s=
ection on offering sacrifies in=C2=A0fire to 
God)

"And there came a fire =
out from the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt 
offering and the =
fat:.." Lev 9.24

"And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it s=
hall not be put out: 
and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, a=
nd lay the burnt offering 
in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the =
fat of the peace offerings." Lev 
6.12

"For our God is a consuming fire." =
Hebrews 12:29

The temple of Solomon was consecreted with fire and an altar=
 was constructed to 
maintain a continuous offer in fire.

Etc

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

> Please do not answer this with answers li=
ke "faith" or "fate"

When Vivekananda first met Margaret Noble (Sister Niv=
edita), he told her 
that religion should not be a matter of "faith", but a=
 matter of 
"experience". In the beginning, one may start with blind faith,=
 but 
eventually one has to know by experience. Otherwise, it is not of muc=
h 
use. The problem in the world right now is that there are many relgions =

led by people who have not experienced god in any manner and yet leading 
=
people. This has resulted in people fighting and killing in the name of 
go=
d.

* * *

Anyway, coming back to your question, I did not say planetary ka=
vachas 
are a much. In fact, I said Chandi kavacham and Narayana kavacham a=
re 
better for most people. In fact, any prayer can protect one, if one doe=
s 
with enough intensity for enough duration.

* * *

I never said or will =
say that doing a particular ritual or mantra is the 
only way to solve a pa=
rticular problem or to experience a particular 
aspect of god. Just as one =
can reach a mountain top from various sides 
using various paths, one can r=
each god using various paths. God is not 
elsewhere, but within us. But, th=
e conditioning accumulated thru many 
lives makes us look at things with at=
traction and aversion and mind 
vibrates with attraction, aversion, pride, =
shame, anger, jealosy etc. If 
mind becomes nearly still, one can be in bli=
ss and the divine energy 
within expresses outside. The goal of various rel=
gions is to take the 
mind to that state.

There are many ways to facilitat=
e that. Chanting a sacred combinations 
of syllables with a focused mind is=
 one way. In my opinion, one can 
achieve one-pointedness of mind with any =
syllable combination. Mind 
achieving one-pointedness with any mantra and/o=
r mental imagery is a 
good thing. But depending the mantra/imagery, a diff=
erent kind of energy 
envelopes that focused mind, purifies it and affects =
it. It just so 
happens that many great realized yogis came on the blessed =
land of India 
and cataloged many mantras and imagery. In other religions a=
lso, many 
people have experienced one-pointedness of mind on a 
thought/im=
agery/sound combination and experienced divinity. A muslim can 
take a sura=
h from Quran and meditate with it. In fact, some sufi saints 
did experienc=
e divinity like that. Also, there are paths other than 
meditation. Serving=
 others and trying to see god in all is a valid path 
too. Oneday, mind can=
 experience god that way too.

While other areas of the world had their sha=
re of realized souls, India 
had just too many of them. What is known today=
 as Hinduism has a rich 
library of knowledge from their experiences and re=
velations. One can try 
a path that was traversed by others and is well-und=
erstood. It does not 
mean those on the other side of the mountain are doom=
ed.

* * *

> doing homams or not doing homams or any other hindu worship m=
ethod

Japam and homam are not the monopoly of any religion and not just "H=
indu 
worship methods". People who meditated with special chants and 
exper=
ienced ecstasy, bliss and inner divinity came in every part of the 
world a=
nd in every religion.

As for homam, sacredness of fire and the ability to =
connect to the 
divine faster when using fire, was known to many religions.=
 Not only 
Hindus, but native Americans worshipped god in fire, Zoroastrian=
s did 
it, ancient Greco-Romans did it, some Buddhists did it, some south 
=
Americans did it, some Scandinavians did it, and so on. There are 
referenc=
es in Bible of even Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses having 
worshippe=
d god in fire. For example, GENESIS 8:20 says "And Noah builded 
an altar u=
nto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every 
clean fowl, and =
offered burnt offerings on the altar". The Korban Olah 
("whole offering") =
of Judaism, where a whole animal was burnt in fire, 
is very similar to "po=
ornaahuti" (whole offering) of homam where a full 
coconut symbolizing head=
 or ego is burnt in fire. The seven candles of 
minorah, an integral part o=
f judaism, remind us of the seven tongues of 
Agni.

New Testament refers t=
o baptism with fire (baptism is purification by 
sprinkling or dipping in h=
oly water). John the Baptist says, "I indeed 
baptize you with water unto r=
epentance, but He who is coming after me is 
mightier than I =E2=80=93 He w=
ill baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire." 
(MATTHEW 3:11). Purificati=
on with fire is superior to purification with 
water. Note that fire is clu=
bbed with Holy Spirit here. In Veda also, 
fire is used as a symbol of Self=
.

Many seekers in many religions achieved the ascension of individual 
con=
sciousness into cosmic consciousness using the medium of fire. With 
advanc=
ing Kali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in many 
religions and =
now finally in Hinduism too! However, a Satya yuga like 
sub-period within =
Kali yuga is coming again.

BTW, the under construction website http://Fire=
Yoga.net has some more 
information along these lines.

ombination. Mind <BR>achieving one-pointedness with any mantra and/or menta=
l imagery is a <BR>good thing. But
 depending the mantra/imagery, a differe=
nt kind of energy <BR>envelopes that focused mind, purifies it and affects =
it. It just so <BR>happens that many great realized yogis came on the bless=
ed land of India <BR>and cataloged many mantras and imagery. In other relig=
ions also, many <BR>people have experienced one-pointedness of mind on a <B=
R>thought/imagery/sound combination and experienced divinity. A muslim can =
<BR>take a surah from Quran and meditate with it. In fact, some sufi saints=
 <BR>did experience divinity like that. Also, there are paths other than <B=
R>meditation. Serving others and trying to see god in all is a valid path <=
BR>too. Oneday, mind can experience god that way too.<BR><BR>While other ar=
eas of the world had their share of realized souls, India <BR>had just too =
many of them. What is known today as Hinduism has a rich <BR>library of kno=
wledge from their experiences and revelations. One can try <BR>a path that =
was traversed by others and
 is well-understood. It does not <BR>mean those=
 on the other side of the mountain are doomed.<BR><BR>* * *<BR><BR>> doi=
ng homams or not doing homams or any other hindu worship method<BR><BR>Japa=
m and homam are not the monopoly of any religion and not just "Hindu <BR>wo=
rship methods". People who meditated with special chants and <BR>experience=
d ecstasy, bliss and inner divinity came in every part of the <BR>world and=
 in every religion.<BR><BR>As for homam, sacredness of fire and the ability=
 to connect to the <BR>divine faster when using fire, was known to many rel=
igions. Not only <BR>Hindus, but native Americans worshipped god in fire, Z=
oroastrians did <BR>it, ancient Greco-Romans did it, some Buddhists did it,=
 some south <BR>Americans did it, some Scandinavians did it, and so on. The=
re are <BR>references in Bible of even Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Mose=
s having <BR>worshipped god in fire. For example, GENESIS 8:20 says "And No=
ah builded <BR>an
 altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and =
of every <BR>clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar". The Kor=
ban Olah <BR>("whole offering") of Judaism, where a whole animal was burnt =
in fire, <BR>is very similar to "poornaahuti" (whole offering) of homam whe=
re a full <BR>coconut symbolizing head or ego is burnt in fire. The seven c=
andles of <BR>minorah, an integral part of judaism, remind us of the seven =
tongues of <BR>Agni.<BR><BR>New Testament refers to baptism with fire (bapt=
ism is purification by <BR>sprinkling or dipping in holy water). John the B=
aptist says, "I indeed <BR>baptize you with water unto repentance, but He w=
ho is coming after me is <BR>mightier than I =E2=80=93 He will baptize you =
with the Holy Spirit and fire." <BR>(MATTHEW 3:11). Purification with fire =
is superior to purification with <BR>water. Note that fire is clubbed with =
Holy Spirit here. In Veda also, <BR>fire is used as a symbol of Self.<BR><B=
R>Many seekers in
 many religions achieved the ascension of individual <BR>=
consciousness into cosmic consciousness using the medium of fire. With <BR>=
advancing Kali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in many <BR>relig=
ions and now finally in Hinduism too! However, a Satya yuga like <BR>sub-pe=
riod within Kali yuga is coming again.<BR><BR>BTW, the under construction w=

ities<BR>> Namaste,<BR>><BR>> Kavacha means protective sheath/coat=
. Kavachas
 of various deities (or <BR>> planets) are protective sheaths=
 covering one's consciousness and <BR>> stopping harmful influences.<BR>=
><BR>> Grahas (literal meaning: those who grasp or get hold of) give =
good and <BR>> bad results by grasping one's consciousness and affecting=
 it.<BR>><BR>> Each planet has positives and negatives, in general an=
d also based on <BR>> the chart. If one chants the kavacha of a planet m=
any times, <BR>> eventually a protective sheath is formed around one's c=
onsciousness <BR>> with the nature and energy of that planet. This will =
obviously offer <BR>> protection that is consistent with the nature of t=
hat planet, in <BR>> general and in one's chart. But, please remember th=
at reading the <BR>> kavacha of any planet will NOT harm you. Even the k=
avacha of 8th lord <BR>> or 6th lord will not harm one.<BR>><BR>> =
Suppose one has Pi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavacha, Venus will <BR>>
 =
protect one from loss of courage (3rd), problems to shoulders (3rd), <BR>&g=
t; untimely death (i.e. loss of longevity/8th), problems in anus/genital <B=
R>> area (8th) etc. There may be other things based on other factors lik=
e <BR>> aspects, occupancy etc. Based on his inherent nature, Venus may =
also <BR>> protect in the matters of love, romance, creativity etc also.=
 <BR>> Bottomline is that the aspects of one's personality that the plan=
et is <BR>> conducive to will be protected by the planet's energy.<BR>&g=
t;<BR>> If you pick a wrong planet, you may not get the desired result, =
but no <BR>> harm is done. Even bad planets in your chart will have some=
 aspects <BR>> they want to protect and doing their kavacha will protect=
 those <BR>> aspects.<BR>><BR>> Best will be to chant the kavachas=
 of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna <BR>> lord, Moon's dispositor and Su=
n's dispositor. Even better will be to <BR>> chant the kavachas
 of deva=
tas instead of planets. Out of all the <BR>> kavachas I have seen until =
now, Narayana kavacha (from <BR>> SrimadBhagavatam) and Chandi Kavacha a=
re the most potent kavachas.<BR>><BR>> But please note that chanting =
a kavacha once or twice or even once or <BR>> twice a day is hardly suff=
icient. If one has enough purity already, <BR>> most mantras work right =
away. But most of us have very dense <BR>> conditioning and the energy o=
f mantras gets dispersed. The energy of <BR>> the planet/deity of the ka=
vacha we chant cannot form a sheath around <BR>> us easily. It requires =
intense sadhana for most people. If one chants <BR>> a kavacha 10-30 tim=
es everyday and does it for 40-60 days, then some <BR>> kind of results =
can be expected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is <BR>> needed for mos=
t people to see some results. Getting things done by a <BR>> professiona=
