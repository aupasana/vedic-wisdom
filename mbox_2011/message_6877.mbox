The Sandhya Worship

By Sri Chandrashekara Bharati Swamigal
Compiled by Sri R. Krishnaswamy Iyer

A touring Educational Officer once met His Holiness and said,

"I have occasions of being in constant touch with young boys, mostly
Brahmanas, studying in schools which I have to inspect. I have found that
even the boys who perform their sandhya do so more as a form than as real
worship. I shall be very grateful if Your Holiness would give me some
valuable hints which I could convey to them"

*Acharya: *I am very glad to see that you are not content with mere official
routine of inspection but desire to utilise the occasion for the betterment
of the boys. It will be well if all educationists, inspecting officers or
teachers, realise that they have been entrusted with the very grave
responsibility of training up young men in the most impressionable period of
their lives. In my opinion they are really to blame if they confine their
attention only to the prescribed text books and neglect the spiritual side
of the young generation.

I always keep that end before me and I don't miss any opportunity of talking
to the boys and giving them some useful advice. It is mainly with a view to
do that work better that i request Your Holiness to give some practical
suggestions.

*Acharya: *Even if the boys to whom you propose to convey such suggestions
may not benefit by them, you will certainly be benefited.

Certainly.

*Acharya: *You may therefore, for the present, ignore the boys and ask such
questions the answers to which are likely to be useful to you.

The first question which suggests itself to me is with reference to the
sandhya worship. What is the deity or upasya devata in the sandhya Worship?

*Acharya: *Before we consider that, please tell me what you understand
ordinarily by the sandhya worship?

By sandhya worship we mean the worship of the rising Sun, the setting Sun or
Sun in the mid heavens.

*Acharya: *Quite so. Comprehensively speaking, you mean worship of the Sun?

Yes.

*Acharya: *You tell me that sandhya is the worship of the Sun and yet you
ask me what is worshipped in the sandhya. Don't you think it is an
unnecessary question?

Put so, it may seem an unnecessary question, but my real question is, what
is the Sun that is worshipped?

*Acharya: *What do you understand ordinarily by the Sun?

We mean the bright celestial orb in the sky.

*Acharya: *Then it is that bright celestial orb that is worshipped.

But that orb is, according to science, mere inert matter in a state of high
combustion and is certainly not worthy of being worshipped by intelligent
beings like ourselves. It can neither hear our prayers nor respond to them.
I cannot believe that our ancestors were so ignorant as to address their
prayers to a mere burning mass of matter

*Acharya: *I quite agree with you. They could never have been so foolish.

What then did they see in the Sun to justify their prayers being addressed
to it?

*Acharya: *You said just now that addressing of prayers to inert matter
cannot be justified by reason.

Yes.

*Acharya: *What then must be the nature of the entity to which a prayer is
addressed?

The primary condition is that it must not be mere inert matter, but must be
endowed with intelligence.

*Acharya: *And the second condition?

That it must be able to hear our prayers and be powerful enough to answer
them.

*Acharya: *Quite so. If our ancients were not fools and yet addressed their
prayers to the Sun, their conception of the Sun must have been quite
different from that of mere inert matter, in a state of high combustion.

Yes, they must have also postulated of it intelligence, the capacity to hear
us and the ability to help us.

*Acharya: *The 'us' including not only all those who are now living to raise
their hands in prayer to the Sun, but also the generations, past and future,
infinite in number though they may be?

Of course.

*Acharya: *The entity that is worshipped as the Sun is therefore one whose
intelligence or ability knows no limitation of space or time.

It must be so.

*Acharya: *You have now got your answer to the question as to who is
worshipped in the sandhya? It is an intelligent Being, omniscient and
omnipotent in the matter of hearing and responding to its votaries.

Your Holiness then means that it is a deva who has his habitation in the
solar orb?

*Acharya: *Quite so. He has not only his habitation there, but the solar orb
itself is his physical body.

Your Holiness means that the deva enlivens the solar orb, just as we do our
physical bodies?

*Acharya: *Just so.

If then he is embodied just like us, how does he happen to have such high
intelligence or power as to merit our obeisance?

*Acharya: *He attained that status by virtue of the appropriate karma and
upasana done by him in a previous life.

Does Your Holiness mean that he was at one time just like ourselves and that
he attained that status by his endeavour?

*Acharya: *Yes.

Then he is no more than a jiva, which I aIso am. Why should a Jiva make
prostration before another Jiva, howsoever superior?

*Acharya: *Why should your son or pupil respect you and why should you show
respect to your superior officers? Are not both of you jivas?

No doubt we are. But we respect our superiors as it is in their power to
help us or injure us, if they so desire.

*Acharya: *That is a very low kind of respect. Anyhow, taking even that kind
of respect, we must respect Surya devata if it is in his power to help us or
injure us, if he so desires.

Of course.

*Acharya: *Being a jiva as much as your superior officers, he will help you
if you appeal to him for help or injure you if you ignore or despise him. In
your own interest then, you are bound to worship him and secure his
goodwill.

But 1 need not court the favour nor fear the displeasure of my superior
officer, if I carry out the duties of my office faithfully.

*Acharya: *Quite so.

If I preserve that attitude, there is no reason why I should propitiate my
superior officer

*Acharya: *Certainly not.

Similarly, if l carry out strictly the duties enjoined on me by the sastras,
I need not propitiate any other jiva, be he the highest devil.

*Acharya: *Quite so.

Then, should I not give up the worship of Surya devata?

*Acharya: *Certainly you may, unless of course such a worship is part of the
duties enjoined on you by the Sastras.

How can that be?

*Acharya: *It is true that an honest and strict officer in performing the
duties of his office need not mind the pleasure or the displeasure of his
immediate superior. But the mere fact that he thinks it necessary or
obligatory to perform those duties properly, shows that he has as the
ultimate end the pleasure, or avoidance of the displeasure of a still higher
officer who is superior to him as well as to his immediate superior. Even if
he has no personal acquaintance with that higher officer, he always has in
the background of his mind an undefined power, call it the King or the
Government, when he performs the duties of his office. And that power has
the ability to benefit him by a recognition of his services or to punish him
by taking note of his delinquencies. Further, that power rules both him and
his immediate superior officer. If therefore that power requires him to
behave in a particular manner towards his superior officer, he cannot afford
to disobey that injunction, for if he disobeys, not only does he incur the
displeasure of that officer but also of the higher power.

That is so.

*Acharya: *Similarly, if a power which rules both you as well as Surya
devata requires you to conduct yourself in a particular manner towards that
deva, you cannot afford to neglect that injunction, but must conform to it
or take the risk of incurring the displeasure of that deva as also of the
higher power.

It is no doubt so. But in that case, in prostrating myself before Surya
devata, I shall be really worshipping the higher power even when my worship
may seem addressed to the Surya.

*Acharya: *What of that?

If I am able to conceive of such a higher power who rules even the Surya,
that power is really the worshipped entity although to all appearances the
worship is addressed to the Surya only.

*Acharya: *Quite so.

But Your Holiness said that it, was Surya devata who was worshipped?

*Acharya: *Yes. It is correct so far as persons who are not able to conceive
of a higher power are concerned. To those however who can conceive of that
power, He is the real upasya. That power is called Hiranyagarbha. He
enlivens and ensouls not only the Surya, but all devils. He enlivens and
inhabits not only the solar orb but all things. He is the cosmic personality
who is the soul of all things.

I suppose just as we have the sense of I 'in our physical bodies, so does
that cosmic personality has the sense of "I" in the entire cosmos.

*Acharya: *He has.

If so, the difference between Him and me lies not in the presence or the
absence of the sense of 'I' but only in the degree, the range or the
magnitude of that sense. Mine is restricted, His is extended.

*Acharya: *It is so.

if it is the sense of "I" that is responsible for the concept of a Jiva, he
must be as much a jiva as myself

*Acharya: *Quite so. In fact He is called the First Born.

Then, even if this higher power happens to belong to the category of Jivas,
just like myself, the same objection which I mentioned against the worship
of Surya devata holds good in his case also.

*Acharya: *What then would you like to worship?

A transcendent power which is not a jiva.

*Acharya: *Have it then that it is such a transcendent power that is
worshipped in the sandhya. We give Him the name of lswara, the Lord, or the
antaryami, the inner ruler.

But I have heard it mentioned that the terms Lord' and Ruler' are only
relative terms which are used in regard to Him when we want to describe Him
in relation to the universe, which is 'lorded over 'or 'ruled' by Him.

*Acharya: *Yes, it is so.

It cannot be that we can have no conception of him apart from his
relationship of some sort to the universe. His relationship to the universe
can at best be only an extraneous circumstance. In His essence, He must have
an independent existence quite unrelated to anything else.

*Acharya: *You are right. We call that unrelated essential existence
Brahman.

If it is so, that must be the real object of worship rather than the
relative aspect called lshwara.

*Acharya: *It is even as you say. It is really the unqualified Brahman that
is worshipped in the sandhya.

I cannot really understand Your Holiness. You first said that it was the
solar orb that was the objector worship, but when I pointed out that it was
only inert matter, you said that it was Surya devata that was the object of
worship; when again I pointed out that he was only a limited jiva like
myself, you said it was Hiranyagarbha, the cosmic soul, that was the object
of worship: when once again I pointed out that he was after all a jiva,
however cosmic his sense of 'I' may be, you said that lswara the Lord and
Ruler of the universe was really the object of worship; and lastly when I
said that even he is but a relative aspect of Brahman, you said that the
object of worship was Brahman itself

*Acharya: *I did say so.

But I fail to see how all these statements can be reconciled.

*Acharya: *Where is the difficulty?

The object in a particular worship can be only one. How can it be the solar
orb or the deva enlivening it or Hiranyagarbha or Iswara or Brahman at the
same time?

*Acharya: *I never said that it was the solar orb or the devil and so on.

Does Your Holiness mean to say then that the object of worship is the solar
orb and the devil and Hiranyagarbha and Iswara and Brahman all put together?

*Acharya: *Nor did I say anything of that sort.

How then am I to understand Your Holiness' statements?

*Acharya: *When did I tell you that the upasya was Surya?

When I mentioned that the physical mass of burning matter cannot be the
object of worship.

*Acharya: *Before you mentioned it, I said that it was even that mass that
was the upasya.

Yes.

*Acharya: *I never mentioned that it was the solar body or the deva as an
alternative. To one who cannot conceive of an enlivening soul, the upasya is
the physical mass; to one, however, who declines to accept inert matter as
an object of worship, I said the upasya was Surya devata. The upasya is ever
one, but its exact nature varies with the competence of the worshipping
aspirant. The upasya gets further refined when even the concept of a devil
does not satisfy the enquiring devotee. We say then that it is
Hiranyagarbha. When even such a concept seems meagre or unsatisfactory, we
tell the devotee that he is really worshipping the Supreme Lord himself When
he begins to feel that even the Lord-ness is a limitation of His essential
nature, we tell him that it is the infinite Brahman itself that is really
worshipped. Where is the difficulty?

Does Your Holiness then mean that it is not possible to definitely say what
the object of worship in the sandhya is except with reference to the mental
equipment or intellectual advancement of the worshipper?

*Acharya: *How can there be an object of worship if we ignore the
worshipper? The nature of the worshipped necessarily depends upon the nature
of the worshipper.

How?

*Acharya: *Take me for example. All of you show me respect. But the object
of respect, though it is, roughly speaking, myself, does differ with each
one of you. Ordinary people respect me and like to see me surrounded by
glittering paraphernalia; their attention and respect are claimed by those
articles rather than by my personality. Such people will show the same
respect to others who have similar paraphernalia. Their homage is not
therefore really paid to me but only to the paraphernalia. Some others
respect me for the position that I hold or for the Asrama in which I am.
Such people will equally respect others who are or may come to be in such a
position or in such an Asrama, their homage is therefore not paid to me but
to my position or to the Asrama. And some others may not care what position
I hold or in what Asrama I am, but give me homage wherever I go and however
I may be; their object of respect is my physical body. A few others will not
mind if my body is dark or ugly or even diseased, but will nevertheless give
me homage if by purity of mind and character or by the power of my intellect
and learning or by any spiritual merit that I may possess I command their
respect. Very few indeed will respect me for the spark of divine
intelligence which inheres in me, as it does in all of you.

Of course it is not possible to say that all the devotees that approach Your
Holiness are of the same mental equipment.

*Acharya: *Quite so. But, ordinarily all these people, whether they really
tender homage to the paraphernalia or to my status and Asrama or to my body
or to my mind or to my intellect or to the divine spark in me, prostrate
before me to show their respect. Can you tell me, apart from any reference
to the several devotees, to whom or to what they prostrate?

It is no doubt very difficult to answer

*Acharya: *Similarly, with every kind of worship. Externally viewed, there
will be no appreciable difference between the one who respects me for the
paraphernalia and another who respects me for the divine spark in me.
Externally viewed, there will similarly be no appreciable difference between
the devotee who in his blind faith is content to address his prayers to the
luminous Sun and another who turns to it as a visible symbol of the infinite
Brahman. The question as to what is the upasya in the sandhya worship can
therefore be answered only in this way.

I now understand how in the simple worship of the Sun all possible stages in
spiritual perception have been provided for

*Acharya: *It is not only this, for you will find if you consider the matter
still further, that all the three ways known as karma, bhakti and Gyana have
been given places in the daily worship, but that is a different matter.
Simple as the sandhya worship seems to be, it is sufficient to help us on to
the highest stages. It is as useful to the highest aspirant as it is to the
beginner. It is a folly, therefore, to belittle its value or to neglect it
in practice.

is so.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Similarly, if a power which ru=
les both you as well as Surya devata requires you to conduct yourself in a =
particular manner towards that deva, you cannot afford to neglect that inju=
nction, but must conform to it or take the risk of incurring the displeasur=
e of that deva as also of the higher power.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>It is no =
doubt so. But in that case, in prostrating myself before Surya devata, I sh=
all be really worshipping the higher power even when my worship may seem ad=
dressed to the Surya.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>What of that?</=
p>

<p></p><p></p><p>If I am able to conceive of such a higher power who ru=
les even the Surya, that power is really the worshipped entity although to =
all appearances the worship is addressed to the Surya only.</p><p></p><p></=
p>

<p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Quite so.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But Your Holiness sa=
id that it, was Surya devata who was worshipped?</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Ach=
arya:=A0</i>Yes. It is correct so far as persons who are not able to concei=
ve of a higher power are concerned. To those however who can conceive of th=
at power, He is the real upasya. That power is called Hiranyagarbha. He enl=
ivens and ensouls not only the Surya, but all devils. He enlivens and inhab=
its not only the solar orb but all things. He is the cosmic personality who=
 is the soul of all things.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>I suppose just as we have=
 the sense of I 'in our physical bodies, so does that cosmic personalit=
y has the sense of "I" in the entire cosmos.</p><p><i>Acharya:=A0=
</i>He has.</p><p></p><p></p><p>

If so, the difference between Him and me =
lies not in the presence or the absence of the sense of 'I' but onl=
y in the degree, the range or the magnitude of that sense. Mine is restrict=
ed, His is extended.</p><p></p>

<p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>It is so.</p><=
p></p><p></p><p>if it is the sense of "I" that is responsible for=
 the concept of a Jiva, he must be as much a jiva as myself</p><p></p><p></=
p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Quite so. In fact He is called the First Born.</p>

=
<p></p><p></p><p>Then, even if this higher power happens to belong to the c=
ategory of Jivas, just like myself, the same objection which I mentioned ag=
ainst the worship of Surya devata holds good in his case also.</p><p></p>

=
<p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>What then would you like to worship?</p><p></p>=
<p></p><p>A transcendent power which is not a jiva.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>=
Acharya:=A0</i>Have it then that it is such a transcendent power that is wo=
rshipped in the sandhya. We give Him the name of lswara, the Lord, or the a=
ntaryami, the inner ruler.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>But I have heard it mentio=
ned that the terms Lord' and Ruler' are only relative terms which a=
re used in regard to Him when we want to describe Him in relation to the un=
iverse, which is 'lorded over 'or 'ruled' by Him.</p>

<p><=
/p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Yes, it is so.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It cannot=
 be that we can have no conception of him apart from his relationship of so=
me sort to the universe. His relationship to the universe can at best be on=
ly an extraneous circumstance. In His essence, He must have an independent =
existence quite unrelated to anything else.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><i>Achary=
a:=A0</i>You are right. We call that unrelated essential existence Brahman.=
</p><p></p><p></p><p>If it is so, that must be the real object of worship r=
ather than the relative aspect called lshwara.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><i>Ach=
arya:=A0</i>It is even as you say. It is really the unqualified Brahman tha=
t is worshipped in the sandhya.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I cannot really underst=
and Your Holiness. You first said that it was the solar orb that was the ob=
jector worship, but when I pointed out that it was only inert matter, you s=
aid that it was Surya devata that was the object of worship; when again I p=
ointed out that he was only a limited jiva like myself, you said it was Hir=
anyagarbha, the cosmic soul, that was the object of worship: when once agai=
n I pointed out that he was after all a jiva, however cosmic his sense of &=
#39;I' may be, you said that lswara the Lord and Ruler of the universe =
was really the object of worship; and lastly when I said that even he is bu=
t a relative aspect of Brahman, you said that the object of worship was Bra=
hman itself</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>I did say so.</p><p></p=
><p></p><p>But I fail to see how all these statements can be reconciled.</p=
><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Where is the difficulty?</p><p></p><p><=
/p><p>The object in a particular worship can be only one. How can it be the=
 solar orb or the deva enlivening it or Hiranyagarbha or Iswara or Brahman =
at the same time?</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>I never said that=
 it was the solar orb or the devil and so on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Does Your=
 Holiness mean to say then that the object of worship is the solar orb and =
the devil and Hiranyagarbha and Iswara and Brahman all put together?</p>

<=
p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Nor did I say anything of that sort.</p><=
p></p><p></p><p>How then am I to understand Your Holiness' statements?<=
/p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>When did I tell you that the upasya w=
as Surya?</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>When I mentioned that the physical mass of =
burning matter cannot be the object of worship.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acha=
rya:=A0</i>Before you mentioned it, I said that it was even that mass that =
was the upasya.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=
=A0</i>I never mentioned that it was the solar body or the deva as an alter=
native. To one who cannot conceive of an enlivening soul, the upasya is the=
 physical mass; to one, however, who declines to accept inert matter as an =
object of worship, I said the upasya was Surya devata. The upasya is ever o=
ne, but its exact nature varies with the competence of the worshipping aspi=
rant. The upasya gets further refined when even the concept of a devil does=
 not satisfy the enquiring devotee. We say then that it is Hiranyagarbha. W=
hen even such a concept seems meagre or unsatisfactory, we tell the devotee=
 that he is really worshipping the Supreme Lord himself When he begins to f=
eel that even the Lord-ness is a limitation of His essential nature, we tel=
l him that it is the infinite Brahman itself that is really worshipped. Whe=
re is the difficulty?</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Does Your Holiness then mean th=
at it is not possible to definitely say what the object of worship in the s=
andhya is except with reference to the mental equipment or intellectual adv=
ancement of the worshipper?</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>How can=
 there be an object of worship if we ignore the worshipper? The nature of t=
he worshipped necessarily depends upon the nature of the worshipper.</p><p>=
</p><p></p><p>How?</p><p></p><p>

</p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Take me for exam=
ple. All of you show me respect. But the object of respect, though it is, r=
oughly speaking, myself, does differ with each one of you. Ordinary people =
respect me and like to see me surrounded by glittering paraphernalia; their=
 attention and respect are claimed by those articles rather than by my pers=
onality. Such people will show the same respect to others who have similar =
paraphernalia. Their homage is not therefore really paid to me but only to =
the paraphernalia. Some others respect me for the position that I hold or f=
or the Asrama in which I am. Such people will equally respect others who ar=
e or may come to be in such a position or in such an Asrama, their homage i=
s therefore not paid to me but to my position or to the Asrama. And some ot=
hers may not care what position I hold or in what Asrama I am, but give me =
homage wherever I go and however I may be; their object of respect is my ph=
ysical body. A few others will not mind if my body is dark or ugly or even =
diseased, but will nevertheless give me homage if by purity of mind and cha=
racter or by the power of my intellect and learning or by any spiritual mer=
it that I may possess I command their respect. Very few indeed will respect=
 me for the spark of divine intelligence which inheres in me, as it does in=
 all of you.</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Of course it is not possible to say that=
 all the devotees that approach Your Holiness are of the same mental equipm=
ent.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Quite so. But, ordinarily all th=
ese people, whether they really tender homage to the paraphernalia or to my=
 status and Asrama or to my body or to my mind or to my intellect or to the=
 divine spark in me, prostrate before me to show their respect. Can you tel=
l me, apart from any reference to the several devotees, to whom or to what =
they prostrate?</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>It is no doubt very difficult to answ=
er</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>Similarly, with every kind of wors=
hip. Externally viewed, there will be no appreciable difference between the=
 one who respects me for the paraphernalia and another who respects me for =
the divine spark in me. Externally viewed, there will similarly be no appre=
ciable difference between the devotee who in his blind faith is content to =
address his prayers to the luminous Sun and another who turns to it as a vi=
sible symbol of the infinite Brahman. The question as to what is the upasya=
 in the sandhya worship can therefore be answered only in this way.</p>

<p=
></p><p></p><p>I now understand how in the simple worship of the Sun all po=
ssible stages in spiritual perception have been provided for</p><p></p><p><=
/p><p><i>Acharya:=A0</i>It is not only this, for you will find if you consi=
der the matter still further, that all the three ways known as karma, bhakt=
i and Gyana have been given places in the daily worship, but that is a diff=
erent matter. Simple as the sandhya worship seems to be, it is sufficient t=
o help us on to the highest stages. It is as useful to the highest aspirant=
 as it is to the beginner. It is a folly, therefore, to belittle its value =
or to neglect it in practice.</p>
