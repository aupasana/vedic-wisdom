Dear Sri Narasimhagaru and other learned sadhakas, 

I have the following q=
uestions and will be very happy if you respond at your convenience. 

1. I =
had been doing a one lakh purascharana of Siva Pancakshari mantra that will=
 be completed the day before Maha Siva Ratri. I intend to do a Siva Homam a=
nd offer the Dasamsa (10,000 offerings) in the homam. What material to be u=
sed for a such a large number of offerings? Usually, I call several people =
and divide the total number by the number of people chanting and offer the =
quotient number of offerings in the fire. But this being a working day I do=
n't think I will be getting any help. So, I will do the 10,000 swaha chanti=
ngs myself and I need to be doing 10,000 offerings. What is the best materi=
al to be used. Ghee, Havan Samagri or any other seeds like sunflower seeds =
etc.? Please advise. 

2. For Siva Ratri, in our community at the local tem=
ple some people are organizing a Siva Homam wherein they are distributing S=
iva Lingas for sponsors ordered from some place in Delhi. I do not know the=
 origin well. It could well be from internet. After that homam is done and =
I get the Siva Lingam, can I use it in my daily pooja or shall I put in the=
 show-case! 

On the same topic, several people are afraid that something b=
ad would happen if they do not do abhishekam for the lingam daily, so they =
are refraining from sponsoring the pooja. In  the process, the temple is su=
ffering with not enough funds. What would be your advise for such situation=
s?

3. Next month pournima is fast approaching and it is in the neighborhoo=
d of March 18th. I don't know what to do for Mantapa danam yet. Could you p=
lease advise?

Nagraj
