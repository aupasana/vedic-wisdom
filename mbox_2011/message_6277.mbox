The Post Secular Age

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya


"The last two cent=
uries have been a conspicuously unique era in the history of the human race=
. For, unlike any other epoch in our history, the last 200 years have witne=
ssed the systematic and seemingly unstoppable deconstruction of religion as=
 an important element of Western society and human culture. So seemingly su=
ccessful has the exorcism of religion from public life been since the moder=
n Enlightenment era, that many 20th century American scholars even went
so =
far as to prematurely pronounce the imminent death of religion in our age. =
As events and trends in recent world history have shown us, however, this w=
as an exceedingly mistaken pronouncement to say the least.

As is becoming =
increasingly apparent in the early years of the 21st century, religion's ob=
ituary may have been written somewhat prematurely. Our current era is witne=
ssing one of the greatest world wide religious resurgences ever recorded in=
 the annals of human history. In America alone, for example, we have seen t=
he importance of religiously based human values ushered center stage in the=
 elections of 2004. And the rest of the world has not been immune to this t=
rend. The centrality of religion in human life and culture has been aggress=
ively reasserted in India, Israel, throughout the Islamic world, and throug=
hout the Third World especially. Only the modern secular states of Western =
Europe seem, so far, to have remained relatively untouched by the global re=
vival of spirituality. Rather than ushering in a new secular age, an age fr=
ee from the influence of religion, spirituality and contemplation, the evid=
ence seems to indicate that we are actually entering a Post Secular Age: an=
 age wherein religion will necessarily fill up the vacuum created by the ru=
inous failure of 20th century secular materialism...."
