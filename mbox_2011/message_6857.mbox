Hello,

Although I am not able enough to interfere in the conversation. But=
 I want to say that Sadhna (Homam, japam etc) are themself to purify us. If=
 we are already pure then we do not need sadhnas. We need sadhnas to purify=
 us. More sadhna we do more pure we become. Waiting to become pure before w=
e start sadhna is 'futile'. 

As Ramakrishna paramhansa said, in start we s=
hould do sandhya, worships etc but after a stage we do not need them and ca=
rry no meaning for us.

Any person who want to become pure should start sad=
hna as per his/her capability. With time and consistent sadhna one becomes =
pure. we dont need to mop already clean floor. if your floor is dirty, mop =
it till it become clean. Waiting for getting the floor clean by self so tha=
t we can mop it, is 'futile'

Sorry for mistakes
Regards
