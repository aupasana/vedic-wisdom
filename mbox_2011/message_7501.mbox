Desert birds living by the Grand Canyon bury thousands of pine nuts in
wide=
ly scattered locations along the canyon rim. They retrieve this stored
food=
 during the winter, returning precisely to the nuts each one buried and
fin=
ding them under a deep layer of snow.

Salmon born in a small stream that f=
eeds the Columbia River in the Pacific
Northwest swim out to sea. After sev=
eral years spent roaming vast distances
of ocean, they return to spawn at t=
he precise place where they were born,
never winding up in the wrong stream=
.

Little children from several countries were read to in Japanese; afterwa=
rd
they were asked to pick whether they had just heard some nonsense words =
or
a lovely Japanese poem. The children from Japan all got the answer right=
,
but so did significantly more than half the children from other countries=

who had never listened to a word of Japanese in their lives.

Identical tw=
ins hundreds or thousands of miles apart have immediately
sensed the moment=
 when their sibling died in an accident.

Fireflies in Indonesia numbering =
in the millions are able to synchronize
their flashes over an area of sever=
al square miles.

In Africa, certain trees that are being overforaged can s=
ignal other trees
miles away to increase the tannin in their leaves, a chem=
ical that makes
them inedible to foraging animals. The distant trees receiv=
e the message
and alter their chemistry accordingly.

Twins separated at bi=
rth have met for the first time years later, only to
find that they=E2=80=
=99ve each married a woman with the same first name in the same
year and no=
w have the same number of children.

Mother albatrosses returning to a nest=
ing site with food in their beaks
immediately locate their chicks among hun=
dreds of thousands of identical
offspring on a crowded beach.

Once a year =
at the full moon several million horseshoe crabs emerge
together on one bea=
ch to mate. They have answered the same call, from
depths of the ocean wher=
e no light ever penetrates.

When air molecules cause your eardrum to quive=
r no differently from a
cymbal being hit with a stick, you hear a voice tha=
t you recognize speaking
words you understand.

On their own, sodium and ch=
lorine are deadly poisons. When they combine as
salt, they form the most ba=
sic chemical in support of life.

To read this sentence, several million ne=
urons in your cerebral cortex had
to form an instantaneous pattern that is =
completely original and never
appeared before in your life.

Why we need to=
 sleep remains a medical mystery, yet complete dysfunction
develops if we d=
on=E2=80=99t enjoy its benefits. In the silence of inactivity, the
future o=
f the body is incubating.
