Namaskaram Phatakji,
You know what I am faced with the same problem that yo=
u had (and I am sure many 
others doing regular homam do).. Black walls wit=
h smoke (I am doing this in my 
own house so had to repaint the puja room c=
ouple of times :) ).. I was pondering 
about the Chimney Idea for some time=
. Looking at your chimney had a few 
queries..
1)  Is it a portable chimney=
?
2) Can you share the specs like the material used, design etc ....
3) It =
looks like a metal covering ..does it not heated up during the homam...?
4)=
 do you have an exhaust at the end of the Chimney to push out the Smoke?

A=
ny more details on the Chimney would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Giri=
sh Sundaram

s to say, my neighbors will call >9-1-1 in 
>no-time :)

The above lighter =
quote is actually a practical worry which many aspirants 
harbour and right=
ly so. I am inspired to write my story in this regard. Hoping 
that it can =
inspire somebody on the list and removes mainly the fear factor.

***
about=
 2.5 years back, Narasimha wrote to me this: "Do whatever compromises, but =

20 minutues Homam every day is a must. find out ways to do that". I rememb=
er 
different fears i was having in my mind. I was then staying as a paying=
 guest 
with a family. though i had a separte room, i was not sure if they =
would allow 
me to do something related to fire. that was the main worry. t=
hen there was self 
doubt concerning my ability to perform Homam but I deci=
ded to perform and did 
the first Homam which was Maha Ganapati homam on 1s=
t day of Ashwin Navaraatri. I 
remember that i took me around 2.5 hours tot=
al including all the preparation 
after that rest of the 8 days, i performe=
d Chandi Homams. each Chandi homam took 
around 4 hours. I remember that on=
 the Ashtami day, some of My colleagues with 
family came to see my chandi =
Homam and they told me that the smoke was even 
visible in the ground floor=
 (The Apartment i was staying was on 4th) and there 
were nice smell every =
where. The interesting thing is that Old lady of the 
family actually co-op=
erated with me. she used to help me in cutting Dray coconut 
in to small pe=
ices with knife. I cut my finger on several occasions while 
cutting coconu=
ts for chandi homam. I used to offer the blood stained coconut 
peices in C=
handi Homas.

My all previous fears thus proved absolutely Non-existent. Fr=
om the very first 
Homam, It was a smooth ride. I was exahusted after Navar=
atri and could not 
continue and there was a break of a week or so. Then ag=
ain i started daily Maha 
Ganapti Homam while learnt the technic of breakin=
g Dry coconut halves by 
crushing it with both palms.

After few months, I =
had to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tried to search 
for it. few f=
amilies rejected when i put the condition of doing Homam everyday. 
at last=
 One christian family agreed for that. I paid bigger amount but they 
allow=
ed me to do homam and i continued there for around 3 months. during that 
t=
ime i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path everyday for 1 year.

after=
 3 months, i started searching for my own separate Rental Apartment because=
 
my family was joining me. Again the same concern (Prime) is to search for=
 
Apartment where there is no obstacle to do Homam. I got a brand new apart=
ment. I 
observed the flat and finalised the dealing. continued Homam every=
 day for 1 
year. The whole flat became black. even the Home applicances li=
em refrigerator 
etc.. were covered with black dust of Homa smoke. clothes =
in the wardrobe, 
Openings of Central A/c etc... were all filled with black=
 dust. My whole brand 
new apartment became dark due to the Homam. Smoke pa=
rticles travelled to my 
lungs and throat and i started coughing badly. I s=
uffered with severe Cough for 
many months and there was pressure from near=
 ones to stop Homam or atleast 
perform it once every week. But there was l=
ot of determination provided by *some 
power* which i like to call as "Moth=
er".

After 1 year in that Apartment, i started serching different place. I=
 searched 
whole area and was looking for a apartment which also has Balcon=
y so that My 
homam goes smoothly without nmaking my whole aprtment look bl=
ack and there are 
no more complaints from my wife .
I could not get one su=
ch perfect place which gives me a Blacony and at the same 
time there are n=
o buidlings in front which can observe me doing homam in balcony 
and make =
a instant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was very 
comfir=
table and required option so that i can do it there and smoke handling 
bec=
omes very easy but at the same time it is also that much risky because any =

road-side person can complain seeing smoke comming out.
Finally i got one =
aprtment without balcony but with a special location. When i 
vacated the p=
revious apartment, the owner'e representative was shell-shocked 
looking at=
 the condition of the apartment :) He told me over Phone - "Aaap Kya 
karat=
a tha flat me?". He then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the 
compens=
ation. I happily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal instaed 
of=
 going to police station.

In new Apartment (current one), security is very=
 tight. But I decided to make an 
arrangement so that i do not *spoil* cond=
ition of the  Apartment. hence i came 
out with the Idea of Chimney. (Pleas=
e see the more pictures in photo section) 
and started doing Homam. Though =
the chimney is visible to neighbours and other 
flat owners, no body has co=
mplained till now. neither to police nor to security 
personnel. Only once =
Security person cautiuoned me. I stopped for a few days and 
started as usu=
al. It is going on till today. I do not know about tomorrow but i 
do not w=
orry. becuase after 2.5 years of experience, it is more than clear to me 
t=
hat It is not I who is arranging all these but there is Mother behind all 
=
these. SHE is making my road clear so that i can perform Homam as i wish.

=
***
The moral of the story is that if you genuinely desire to perform Homam=
/Havan, 
then It will be done. No obstacle will stand on your way.
Do not f=
ear. All the fears will break like Papads once you start walking over 
them=
 to do homam. i can swear for it!

No owner will kick you out, No neighbour=
 will call 9-1-1 and even if that 
happens, there will open a way!

Best Re=
gards,

Utpal
