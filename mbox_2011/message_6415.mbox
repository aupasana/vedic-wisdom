 Translated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai
=

102. The Yogis postulate the existence of Ishvara. Prakriti functions owin=
g
to the proximity of consciousness and Ishvara is the controller of Prakri=
ti.
He is quite distinct from and superior to the Jivas, says the Shruti.

=
108. It is a fact that the Jivas, too, are not affected by sufferings etc.,=

as they too are unattached; but when they fail to comprehend their real
na=
ture, they imagine that they are affected by sufferings, works and so
forth=
.

116. So say people who worship the creator Brahma for obtaining children=
 and
quote
passages which say, =E2=80=98Brahma created the people=E2=80=99.=


117. The Bhagavatas call Vishnu the only Ishvara because the lotus-born
B=
rahma
issued from the navel of Vishnu.

118. The Saivas on the authority of=
 their Agamas declare Shiva alone to be
Ishvara,
as according to a traditio=
n in the Puranas, Vishnu in spite of all his
efforts could not discover the=
 feet of Shiva.

119. The followers of the creed of Ganesha say that the el=
ephant-faced Lord
is the
only Ishvara for Shiva in order to conquer the dem=
ons of the three cities
worshipped
Ganesha.

120. There are many other sect=
s which try to declare their own favourite
deity to be
the supreme. They qu=
ote hymns from Shruti and alleged traditions in support
of their
views.

12=
1. So every entity from the Inner Ruler to inert objects is considered as
I=
shvara by someone or other, for we find that even the sacred fig tree, the
=
sun-plant and the
bomboo etc., are worshipped by the people as family deiti=
es.

143. Even if all the learned people of the world try to determine the =
nature
of this world, they will find themselves confronted at some stage or=
 other
by ignorance.

144. Tell us, if you can, how the body and senses cam=
e out of the seed, or
how
consciousness was born in the foetus. What answer=
s will you give to these
questions
?

146. In the end you will have to say,=
 =E2=80=98I do not know=E2=80=99. Therefore the wise
declare this world to =
be like a magic show.

147. What can be more magical than the fact that the=
 seed in the uterus
becomes a conscious individual, that it develops head, =
hands, feet and other
organs, that it passes through the states of childhoo=
d, youth and old age
and that it perceives, eats,smells, hears, comes and g=
oes ?

152. As the tree is latent in the seed, so the waking and dreaming w=
orlds
are implicit in deep sleep. Similarly, the impressions of the entire
=
universe are latent in Maya.

185. The creation and destruction of the worl=
d are comparable to day and
night, to
the waking and sleeping states, to th=
e opening and closing of the eyes and
the
activity and quiescense of the mi=
nd.

199. There are two types of Shruti text describing the creation of the=
 world
either as a gradual evolution or as instantaneous. There is no
contr=
adiction, for the dream
world sometimes arises gradually out of deep sleep,=
 but at other times it
arises
instantaneously.

200. Hiranyagarbha or Sutra=
tman, otherwise called the subtle-body, is the
totality of
the subtle bodie=
s of all Jivas. He conceives Himself as the totality of all
egos or =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99 - consciousnesses, like the threads of a piece of cloth; and =
He
is said to be endowed with the powers of volition, conation and cognitio=
n.

209. In whatever form Ishvara is worshipped, the worshipper obtains the=

appropriate
reward through that form. If the method of worship and the con=
ception of the
attributes of the deity worshipped are of a high order, the =
reward also is
of a high
order; but if otherwise, it is not.

210. The Libe=
ration, however, can be obtained through the knowledge of
reality and not o=
therwise. The dreaming does not end until the dreamer
awakes.

216. From th=
e worshippers of objects like grass to the followers of Yoga,
all have
wron=
g ideas about Ishvara. From the materialist Charvakas to the followers
of
S=
ankhya, all have confused ideas about Jiva.

219. Therefore the aspirants t=
o liberation should never engage themselves in
disputations about the natur=
e of Jiva and Ishvara. They ought to practise
discrimination and realise th=
e reality of Brahman.

220. (Doubt): Such disputation is a means to the und=
erstanding of Brahman.
(Reply): It may be so, but be careful to avoid being=
 drowned helplessly in
the sea of
confusion.

221. (Doubt): All right, but =
the Vedantins must accept the Sankhya doctrine
that Jiva
and Ishvara are as=
sociationless, pure consciousness and eternal and the Yoga
doctrine that Ji=
va and Ishvara, referred to as =E2=80=98thou=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98that=E2=
=80=99
respectively in the
dictum =E2=80=98That thou art=E2=80=99, are of a=
 pure nature.
