Dear Biswajit Sir...

If you are seeking a shortcut to succes=
s with the use of intoxicants please beware that you may find after too lat=
e that there are no shorcuts.  Besides no real 'vira' sadhak would pussy fo=
ot around in an internet group and ask how to have the cake and eat it too.=
 Why dont you just go out there and experiment with your life and see what =
happens and come back here and tell us how it goes? Hmmmm?

Many warm regar=
ds

Ajaya
