Namaste all,

I sincerely hope our moderator forgives this question which I=
 also posted on the jyotish forum...I am a bit unclear about Kavacha for th=
e planets. 

For example, if a planet such as Rahu is giving one to have pr=
oblems during his dasha, would one recite the Kavach of Rahu, OR some other=
 "counter-balancing" planet that was strong in one's chart?

Thanks!

Raj
