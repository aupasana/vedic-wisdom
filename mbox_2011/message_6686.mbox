spirituality

   
Hello

Even i suffer form=
 OCD and in that process i ended up learning a hell lot of
things from bach=
 flower, homeopathy, reiki, Jinshinjyustsu.

My advise
1. Leave all the the=
ory aside, mind is a monkey and it will jump over, so you 
dotn have to fol=
low any thought. OCD means a compulsive monkey.

2. Do 20 min homam daily, =
pick ur favourite god, choose one simple mantra, offer 
in fire atleast 108=
 times with full love and devotion. Do it regularly for 3-4 
months

3. Cho=
ose a good homeopathy. there is a site abchomeoapthy where
brisbanehomeopat=
h gives free consultations and you can post ur queries daily, he 
will help=
 you out.

4. Bach flower remedies for OCD is combination of Cherryplum + W=
hitechestnut. if 
you want detailed analysis respond on my personal id.

5.=
 Join a group lalkitab_remedies and post your birth details, remedies for y=
our 
problems as per your chart will be given. 


6. Your reality is reflec=
tion of your karma, with medicines you can contorl and 
change it upto a ce=
rtain extent. Only with intense sadhana you can change your 
Karma and real=
ity itself. such is the power of intense sadhana. 20-30min of 
homam is ind=
eed equivalent to 4-5hrs of intense meditation. PVR said this some 
time ba=
ck, i doubted it at that time but when i did it i realised it was 
correct.=


regards
priyank
