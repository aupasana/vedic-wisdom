The srutis say: =E2=80=9CSeek the atman alone,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CThis atma=
n
is Brahman which  is Intelligence-bliss=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CThou art
That,=
=E2=80=9D etc. The active self of the  Vedic karma-kanda is only a
means to=
 realize the real Supreme Self. When  knowledge of the real Self
dawns, the=
re cannot be a false activity.

Knowing Brahman, a person observes self-den=
ial, which is a  cessation of
all actions. So long as a man is in ignorance=
 he wishes to  have
something, to do something, whereas in reality he is fu=
ll and  perfect,
and therefore he need not be active for any reason whatsoe=
ver.  This
ignorance exists in all beings.
