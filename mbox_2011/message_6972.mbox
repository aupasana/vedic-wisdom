Namaste Bala=
ji,

I have been doing Sapthasati for a four years now though not counting =
because personally I don't believe in counting and proclaiming it. Divine M=
other will only offer a smile at our ignorance though will still acknowledg=
e.

Coming to initiation, don't break your head about rituals as in Kali Yu=
ga, the best option is to be sincere and regular but with SUCHI( Cleanlines=
s). Bathe well, put on clean clothes and follow what I have attached.

Trus=
t Maa completely as she knows your past lives(All the skulls in her throat =
are representing you past lives) and knows your karmic debt too.

Buy the c=
ompact disc of "Prakash Koushik" for Devi Mahatmyam and follow the pattern =
indicated in the document.

If you cannot do any chanting on some days, atl=
east do Kunjika Stotram once as it gives you full result and is very
 power=
ful.

When you fear the world and its misdeeds, chant DEVI KAVACHAM" which =
will protect you from everything. My personal take on mantras are that "Dev=
i Mantras" are the most potent and are high voltage for obvious reasons as =
she is the manifest form of Lord Shiva who is always in Unmanifest form and=
 in deep meditation. You will be shocked to know that the kavacham protects=
 the devotee from bomb blasts too as it is stated in it.

Devi Atharvaseers=
ham is a part of the sapthasati which can be done thrice a day and it does =
indicate that MAA stays with you/ around you with you and protects your pys=
che.

If you want to chant the "Navarna Mantra", you would need the initiat=
ion as it needs so unless you are already initiated into Gayathri. People w=
ho are already initiated into Gayathri are authorized to do it right away a=
s stated in Mantra Shastra. Again, no racist remark here but just an FYI.

=
Narasimhaji has made a wonderful
 document on Chandi Homa which can be foll=
owed later.

Please note that your tiny steps towards evolution are being w=
atched by Divine Mother as your own mother in the kitchen watches you in th=
e verandah with a side glance. There is no doubt about it that She is VERY =
KIND and knows the best for you.

I wish Maa bless you with Lot of LOVE.

J=
agadambaarpanamastu.

Srikanth

 [vedic=
-wisdom] Query Regarding Durga Sapthashati







=C2=A0



    
      
   =
   
      Namaste Narasimhaji,
This is my first post, I'm a silent member o=
f Vedic =C2=A0Wisdom, i read all the posts and thankful to all the members =
of this group.
I have a query regarding reading Durga sapthashati.=C2=A0


=
My query is i have a desire to read durga sapthashati, this has been there =
since more than a year or two. I got the book last year, but i still haven'=
t started reading.
The reason being i've come across all your posts and peo=
ple responding to your posts, i.e whether a person who has not been initiat=
ed could read or should not read. I'm not able to conclude, even now i'm re=
ading the post and text by Dr. Sathya Prakash Choudhary, but still unable t=
o conclude.


I've read that people should be very careful while reading Du=
rga Sapthashati, i don't know to what extent and what could be the conseque=
nces
I do read Aditya Hrudayam, Srisuktham, Vishnu Sahasranamam, Lalitha Sa=
hasranamam, Lalitha Trishati. I don't know how i started reading, no body g=
uided me or initiated me how to read but i read it easily, whenever i do pr=
ayer i ask for for well being of all the people i know, sometimes just bles=
sings and sometimes i don't even ask anything.


I try to follow reading fo=
r one deity=C2=A0continuously=C2=A0for N number of days, then start reading=
 for other deities and follow the same rule.
About me: I'm a bachelor aged =
about 28

My questions
1. Should i start reading Durga Sapthashati.2. If so=
 what are the do's and don'ts .=C2=A0

Finally the process to read, i read =
the book and as per it, it is

=E2=80=A2 Kavacham=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Argala Sto=
tra=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Keelakam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Navakshari japam=C2=A0

=E2=80=
=A2 Ratri Suktam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Devi Mahatmyam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Navakshari ma=
ntra japam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Devi Suktam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Rahasya trayam=C2=A0=
=E2=80=A2 Kshama Prarthan
Does it require the above process to be followed =
strictly to read single adhyaya per day or it's ok to just read the chapter=
 without above process.=C2=A0

Or in other ways what all should be read if =
i read a single chapter a day.
Apart from these questions can a person read=
 Laitha Sahasranaama / Trishati after reading Vishnu Sahasranama or vice ve=
rsa.


Best Wishes,Balaji
