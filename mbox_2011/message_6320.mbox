Sannyasa is an absolute necessity. The mere desire to remain aloof and alon=
e shows that there is an advaitic inclination in you. Every moment you shou=
ld be ready for sannyasa. The very longing for sannyasa shows that there is=
 growth of spirituality. Deluded people bring various vain arguments: =E2=
=80=9CMohammed was a householder, Nanak was a householder, Rama married, Kr=
ishna married, and Ramakrishna Paramahansa married!=E2=80=9D Delusion! Even=
 if you think you are a jnani, you will have terrible downfall when you com=
e in contact with worldly persons and things! Many sannyasins have fallen! =
Many yogis have fallen! The Bhagavata says that actual fire is not so dange=
rous, burning charcoal is not so dangerous, as the company of worldly perso=
ns, worldly things! Worldly people always talk against sannyasa, against re=
nunciation and tapas! Even a cobra is not so very dangerous as these delude=
d people!
