Dear Priya,

Before the homam, you should melt the ghee that you need fully. During
homam, you will have the ghee in some vessel near the homa kunda. If the
fire is big enough, it will keep the ghee warm. If not, keep the ghee that
you need for the next 15-20 minutes in the ghee vessel, and the rest in a
glass bottle on a  "cup warmer". You can pour from this bottle into your
main ghee vessel as you need to.

You can search on any search engine for "cup warmer" or "mug warmer". They
are normally used to keep coffee mugs warm. These electric devices are
relatively cheap and readily available in North America.

sasneham,

   ajit
