Namaste friends,

Regularity and uniformity are the keys to success.

People of Kali yuga do not want to love their mother (or father) 
everyday, but want to dedicate one day every year for that. They do not 
want to ensure that their breathing is uniform, regular and relaxed all 
the time, but they want to do a breathing exercise for 10 minutes 
everyday and ensure uniform, regular and relaxed breathing during that 
time. People do not want to eat healthy food in moderation always, but 
want to overeat junk at most times and fast now and then to compensate 
for it. They do not want to pray to god regularly, but want to make it 
up one day every week or month or year by going to a temple/church or 
doing a ritual.

Friends, this approach isn't useful. Maintaining regularity and 
uniformity can work wonders.

Breath calmly and regularly at all times and not just during pranayama. 
Eat a balanced good moderately, just to sustain the physical body, and 
stop eating emotionally because something looks nice or smells nice and 
fasting now and then. Pray to god more regularly and, in fact, keep god 
in your mind at all times. Carry love and caring attitude for people 
around you, like parents, siblings, spouse, children, friends and 
relatives, at all times and not just on special days.

Best regards,
Narasimha
