 296 This ignorance is like darkness. It cannot be said that it exists. As
=
darkness does not bear the light, so this ignorance does not bear [the ligh=
t
of] right awareness.

But the question arises, in what, when it appears, =
does this ignorance
subsist? The answer is given next.

297 This ignorance,=
 as the world-form, appears to ignorant ones to be real.
In the Supreme Bei=
ng [which is consciousness] the world is like unreal
jewellery that appears=
 in the [relatively] real gold.

Here the simile of gold and jewellery is u=
sed. It is usually supposed that
both are real, but here the jewellery is d=
escribed as unreal. Why is it so
described?

298 If it is asked, =E2=80=98H=
ow is it said that gold is real, but jewellery is
unreal?=E2=80=99 [the ans=
wer is that] the words are used here by our Guru in order
to show that the =
world, which is the subject of comparison, is unreal.

Can this be done, it=
 may be asked? It is answered in the following way.

299 Since a simile is =
used to convey a clear knowledge of the subject of the
teaching, the simile=
 is presented so as to convey the intended meaning.

The propriety of thus =
presenting this simile is shown next.

300 The jewellery was [only] gold be=
fore; it is only that in the middle, and
it is that in the end also. Compar=
ed to the jewellery, gold is [relatively]
real, and because the jewellery-f=
orms are transient, they are unreal.

This is in accordance with the vedant=
ic definition of reality, which is here
stated once more.

301 Here imperma=
nence alone is the test of unreality. Permanence itself is
affirmed as [the=
 quality of] reality. Hence, [it follows] that ignorance and
the world whic=
h is born of it, are unreal, exactly like the serpent seen in
a rope.

This=
 has been discussed and settled in a previous context.

Another analogy is =
used next to explain the teaching.

302 Or, as the moving pictures pass upo=
n the unmoving lighted screen [in a
cinema show], so the series of pictures=
, namely the world, comes and goes on
[the substratum], the real [which is =
unmoving].

This is the simile used in =E2=80=98Forty Verses on the Real=E2=
=80=99, in the very
beginning, immediately after the first two benedictory =
verses.

303 In the analogy of the moving pictures, the seer is distinct fr=
om them,
whereas in the world pictures the seer is included. Thus the world=
 differs
[from the cinema show]. The result is that the world and its seer =
[the
individual] are both unreal.

304 Just as the light on the screen rema=
ins clear [of the shadow pictures]
when those moving pictures have ceased, =
so too when the series of
world-pictures cease, the consciousness, which is=
 the Self, will remain
clear [as the sole reality].

The unreality of the w=
orld is further highlighted by the world-appearance
being made up of a seri=
es of momentary pictures, as is shown next.

305 As at every instant of tim=
e the spectator,seeing only a new picture,
assumes that what he sees is one=
, so the ignorant one, seeing an utterly new
world every instant, assumes t=
hat what he sees is one continuous world.

This mistaken view concerns the =
seer=E2=80=99s own body also. From this it follows
that the seer, who is on=
ly a reflection in the three bodies, is unreal =E2=80=93
that is, as unreal=
 as the spectacle, the world.

The world-appearance is possible only becaus=
e the real Self, which is
consciousness, is present as the substratum.

306=
 As the succession of moving pictures shines only on the screen and by
its =
light, so the world shines only on the real Self and by its light of
consci=
ousness.

307 Just for this reason the real Self is real in its own right. =
This world
is not at all real in its own right. The unreality of the world =
and the
reality of the Self, which is pure consciousness, should be underst=
ood in
this way.

There is a distinction to be noted between the popular se=
nse of the world
=E2=80=98real=E2=80=99 and its use in advaitic Vedanta phi=
losophy, which has already been
expounded.

The next topic to be studied is=
 the mental impression that time and space
are objective realities. These t=
wo are inseparable from the
world-appearance, and hence the world would con=
tinue to be taken as real if
these two are taken to be so.

308 The mind kn=
ows all visible objects, the physical body and all the rest,
equally in dre=
am and in waking, as divided up in space and in time, and
hence it is neces=
sary to enquire whether these two are real [or not].

309 These three, name=
ly space, time and causality, have been shown to be
only mental by an occid=
ental philosopher named Kant by means of good
reasons.

310 Bhagavan, our G=
uru, makes it clear to the seekers of deliverance, from
the experience of a=
ll men in deep sleep, and from the experiences of sages
in the supreme stat=
e, that these three are unreal.

311 Because no one knows space and time in=
 deep sleep, where the mind is
latent, and in the supreme state, where the =
mind is lost, these two are only
mental.

312 In the dream state as well as=
 the waking state the mind creates these
two along with the world. Without =
them the mind knows nothing. This is the
enduring nature of the mind.

313 =
Only because of the ignorance =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 does man have=
 the
awareness =E2=80=98I am in space and time=E2=80=99. Really, we are not=
 in space, nor in
time. If we were bodies, then [and only then] would we be=
 in them.

314 We are not bodies, nor do we own them, since we never became=
 souls.
Space and time, just like all things, are created in us by the mind=
 because
of ignorance.

It may be asked when we shall be rid of this delusi=
on of the objective
reality of space and time. The answer given in the next=
 verse is from
Bhagavan, our Guru.

315 If the mind, by the quest of its so=
urce, attains peace in the supreme
state, then these two will be swallowed =
up by the real Self itself, along
with the ego and the world.

316 The whol=
e world, which is composed of causes and effects together with
space and ti=
me, is illusory. The real Self never undergoes change, whether
by space or =
by time, or by causality.

317 Since the one real Self [of all], which is e=
ver the same, never swerving
from its true nature, transcending time and de=
void of space, and hence
infinite, is experienced by the sages, it alone is=
 real; nothing else.

The three divisions of time, namely the past, the pre=
sent and the future,
are next dealt with and shown to be unreal.

318 Also =
the divisions of time, namely, past, present and future, are not at
all rea=
l. The past and the future are dependent upon the present, and are
themselv=
es present in their own times.

319 Thus all time is only present; men make=
 this division only by words; the
eternal reality is indeed the real Self a=
lone. Hence, it alone is present,
nothing else.

320 The aspirant must ther=
efore aim at the experience of the truth of that
Self by attaining the supr=
eme state. The discussion of the past and of the
future is declared to be l=
ike trying to count without knowledge of the
number =E2=80=98one=E2=80=99.
=

321 Only the number =E2=80=98one=E2=80=99 exists, and none else, because a=
ll numbers are
modifications of it. In the same way, the consciousness that=
 is the Self
alone exists, and the whole world is only that.

322 As one be=
comes able, by knowing the number =E2=80=98one=E2=80=99, to know all the
nu=
mbers, so, after knowing the truth of themselves, the sages come to know
th=
e truth of the world also.

323 The Guru says that having knowledge of anyt=
hing other than the Self,
without first knowing the Truth of oneself, is on=
ly ignorance. Everything
that one knows, without having a right awareness o=
f the Self, is a knowledge
that is contrary to truth.

324 When, by the que=
st of the Self, that Self is known, there remains
nothing else to be known.=
 To the sage all things shine only as the Self, and
hence the Self is well =
known as =E2=80=98the All=E2=80=99 [in the Vedantas].

325 Therefore Bhagav=
an Sri Ramana says that omniscience is only the state of
being the real Sel=
f. He also says that what is considered as omniscience by
the ignorant is o=
nly ignorance.

How the Self is =E2=80=98the All=E2=80=99 is next stated.

=
326 This world is not other than the body; this body is not distinct from
t=
he mind; the mind does not exist apart from the real Self; therefore that
S=
elf is all the world.

327 =E2=80=98How was I in my previous birth, and how=
 shall I be in the next birth?=E2=80=99
=E2=80=93 such enquiries are only [=
due to] ignorance, because the Self was never
born.

328 Thinking about the=
 totality and the distinct units [individuals] is a
pointless activity for =
seekers of deliverance. Only the enquiry as to the
source of him [the ego] =
who is interested in the totality and the units will
lead to deliverance.

=
329 =E2=80=98By whom, and how, was the world created in the beginning?=E2=
=80=99 =E2=80=98What is
maya?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98What is ignorance?=E2=80=99=
 =E2=80=98How did the individual soul come into being?=E2=80=99
Such pointl=
ess questions are posed by the deluded ones because they forget
the main th=
ing that needs to be enquired into.

The secret of creation is briefly stat=
ed next.
