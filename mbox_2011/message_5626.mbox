Namaste,

Only when the raw grains of scriptural guidelines are coo=
ked in the water of experience on the fire of wisdom does one get something=
 that can be digested. Some misconceptions are there in some sections of or=
thodox tradition. What you heard is not correct and go ahead with lighting =
the ghee lamp everyday.

Lakshmi, whether in the form of Dhana Lakshmi (wea=
lth) or Dhanya lakshmi (grains and food) or Vidya Lakshmi (knowledge), shou=
ld be shared with the world and put to good use. Then only Lakshmi will gro=
w. If one selfishly keeps one's wealth or food or knowledge to oneself and =
keeps it *captive*, Lakshmi will not grow. Instead, Lakshmi will leave one =
then.

Never keep Lakshmi that you get captive. Share Her with others and p=
ut Her to good use. Then She will be pleased and do good to you.

The princ=
iple you heard is based on a misconception on how to handle Lakshmi.

Best =
regards,
Narasimha
