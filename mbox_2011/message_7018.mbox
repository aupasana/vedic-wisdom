Resepected Narasimhaji

Why had you started this dicussion in Vedic Wisdom =
regarding Thakur and his children.Is it to prove the greatness of thakur an=
d his disciples ? If that is so let me say one thing ,still today in Bengal=
 it is strongly believed that if one keeps the picture of Thakur in ones ro=
om one is bound to be liberated.
Belur Math is still revered as an elite ti=
rtha sthan laden with the dust of the feet of  Sri Maa, Swami Vivekananda a=
nd all his brother disciples.
Regarding siddhis,spiritual callibre i think =
the likes of Swami Vivekananda ,Swami Brahmananda,Swami Abhedananda,Swami Y=
ogananda,Swami Turiyananda,Saint Nag Mahasay and all others are completely =
unfathomable.I tell this not by mere emotion but I came to know blessedly m=
any such events that is not well publicised but that occured during their t=
imes.
Such discussions are shocking and very much sensitive.Perhaps you wou=
ld never understand how much we Bengalis get hurt through them.We are not J=
naanis we are Bhaktas of very tender heart.Please don=E2=80=99t do this to =
us.
