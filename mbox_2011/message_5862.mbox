The body is fivefold in nature (the five elements), =
existing in the five,
depending on the six (tastes of food), connected with=
 the six qualities
(kama etc.,), seven Dhatus, three impurities, three Yoni=
s (of excretion) and
four kinds of food.

Why say =E2=80=98Fivefold in natu=
re ?=E2=80=99 The five elements Earth, Water, Fire, Wind
and Ether. In this=
 body, whatever is hard is of Earth, liquid is water, warm
is fire, whateve=
r moves about is air and space-enclosed is ether. The
function of the Earth=
 is to support, water is to consolidate (digestion
etc.,). Fire is to see, =
wind is for moving, Ether is to give space (for
vital functions).

The eyes=
 are used in seeing form, ears for sound, tongue for taste, the skin
and no=
se for touch and smell respectively; genital for pleasure, Apana is
for eva=
cuation (of bowels). The person cognises through the intellect, wills
with =
the mind and speaks with the tongue.

The six-fold support is the six taste=
s (of food): sweet, acid, salty,
pungent, bitter and astringent.

8. The em=
bryo lying (in the womb) for (a day) and night is a confused mass;
after se=
ven days it becomes a bubble; after a fortnight, a mass and in a
month, it =
hardens. In two months develops the region of the head; in three
months, th=
e feet; in the fourth, belly and hip; in the fifth, the backbone;
in the si=
xth, nose, eyes and ears; in the seventh the embryo quickens with
life and =
in the eighth month, it becomes complete.

9. By the dominance of the fathe=
r=E2=80=99s semen, the child becomes male; the
mother=E2=80=99s =E2=80=93 f=
emale. When equal, a eunuch. If, at the time of impregnation,
the parents a=
re agitated, the child will be blind, crippled, hunch-backed or
stunted in =
growth. If the couple have vital-air-trouble, the semen enters in
two parts=
 resulting in twins.

10. In the eighth month, in conjunction with the five=
 vital airs the Jiva
gets the capacity to know its past affairs (of past bi=
rths), conceives of
the imperishable Atman as Om, through perfect knowledge=
 and meditation.
Having known Om he sees in the body the eight Prakritis de=
rived from it the
five elements, mind, intellect and ego and the sixteen ch=
anges [see
Prasnopanishad].

11. The body becomes complete in the ninth mon=
th and remembers the past
birth. Actions done and not done flash to him and=
 he recognises the good and
bad nature of Karma.

19. Why is the body so ca=
lled ? It has three fires: the Kosthagni ripens all
that is eaten; the Dars=
anagni helps one see colour etc., the Jnanagni is the
mind which helps perf=
orm good and bad deeds.
