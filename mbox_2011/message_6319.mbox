The Sun of Dharma is Rising in America

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

"=
The Sun of Dharma once reigned over the entire earth, bathing all beings on=
 every continent in the living light of Truth. There was at one time no nat=
ion, people, city-state or tribe that did not have at least a basic underst=
anding of the Natural Way. The eternal Sun of Dharma, which is never destin=
ed to ever truly set, is arising again. It is arising - of all the most une=
xpected places - throughout the entire Western world. In our immediate futu=
re, all living beings will witness, and directly participate in, a Golden D=
awn of Dharma in the Western world, and specifically in America and Europe.=
 Dharma, being Sanatana (eternal), never disappears entirely, but merely re=
situates itself where it can be maximally appreciated, understood, and prac=
ticed with fidelity, dignity and devotion. We now see the very heart of Dha=
rma in the form of Yoga, meditation, Vedantic philosophy, and Ayurveda, bei=
ng increasingly practiced by multiple millions in the West today...."
