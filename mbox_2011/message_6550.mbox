It is said in the Isavasyopanishad, =E2=80=9COnly doing karma [i.e., one=E2=
=80=99s own duty], one should wish to live a hundred years.=E2=80=9D The li=
fe of man does not extend for more than a hundred years, so that he may tak=
e up the path of knowledge after performing karma for one hundred years. Th=
e hundred years are taken up by karma. Then, when will one find time for ac=
quiring knowledge before his death? The arguments of the karma-kandins are =
not sound. For there cannot be any motive or desire to act when there is th=
e knowledge of the highest truth. He does not find any use in the performan=
ce of karma. When one gets a desire to know the atman which is free from al=
l the faults of samsara, one does not find any benefit out of actions which=
 he has done or which he has to do. If you say that he does it because it i=
s so enjoined although he sees no good in it, we say it cannot be, for he h=
as known the atman which is beyond all injunctions. One who knows Brahman c=
annot be bound by injunctions and rules. Even the Veda is born of him, so h=
e cannot be commanded by the Veda to do any karma. None can be directed by =
his own words proceeding from his own knowledge. A wise master cannot be di=
rected by an ignorant servant.
