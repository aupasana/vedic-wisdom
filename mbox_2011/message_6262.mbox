Utpal, 

many thanks, i can see the courage and attitude which i need to de=
velop right now.

"If you are going through hell, keep going - makes sense
=
And once in a while try to be fearless. Problems ki to "AISI KI TAISI""

I =
appreciate this line, many time i get serious with life/sadhana, but ur thi=
s line clearly shows that the courageous/light hearted attitude one need to=
 keep. One should be sincere in life not serious.

thanks for your blessing=
s

regards
Priyank

there is no choice. If i may suggest, keep doing Homas (whether with right =

 rescue and keep trying for your Job as well as overcomming problems at Imm=
