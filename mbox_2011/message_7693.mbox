Namaste Narasimha,
Pranams.
I am resending this message, just in case you h=
ad missed the earlier
discussion thread. Thank you.
****
Re: On Deities and=
 Forms
Namaste Narasimha,
Pranaam.
Thank you for your kind sharing of thoug=
hts on this topic. I seek your
clarification on this point:
> (1) The rahas=
yas of Chandipath describes the Sarvasya Aadyaa (the >
Original Root of All=
) form of Mahalakshmi and also the 3 derived forms >
of Mahakali, Mahalaksh=
mi and Mahasaraswati (the two Mahalakshmi forms >
are different!). It does =
not specifically describe the form of "Chandi".
If this does not specifical=
ly describe the form of Chandi, why then, in
the Chandi Homam manual - the =
section on Pranaa Pratishthaapanaa of
Chandi, you had included the verses f=
rom the rahasyas of Chandipath?
Is there any other significance that I am m=
issing in my understanding?
Thank you.
Warmest regards..
