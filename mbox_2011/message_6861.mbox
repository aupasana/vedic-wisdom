Namaste,

I am graduate student, studying in US. It has been a long standin=
g wish of mine to do homam regularly. However there are some practical prob=
lems. 

1 Can I do a homam inside the house? I am wondering if the smoke wo=
uld raise the fire alarm etc. In summer, though it is terribly hot here, I =
can still afford to open the windows. In winter this is next to impossible.=
 I am not worried abt my home catching fire, but I am worried abt the fire =
safety alarm. The leasing office levies hefty fines for violating fire safe=
ty rules.

2 Do you know any place in US where I can find a small homa kund=
a and other necessary items? 

shubham bhavatu

Ramnath
