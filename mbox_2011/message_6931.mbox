Srini
First congratulations, and the true meaning of Brahmin is seeker of=
 truth. Everyone is born as a shudra, and a upanayanam ceremoney is perform=
ed to induct one in to a Brahmin, Kshartriya or a Vaisya. Those who wanted =
to follow shudra dharma were exempted from this. Though Manu had divided th=
e human raced based on certain duties, the real meaning has got lost in tod=
ay's world and has attained pure symbolism. You have in your own way starte=
d seeking truth and had made a great progress.
Best wishes to you on your s=
earch for truth.
 

Thanks and with best regards,
 
Lakshman
