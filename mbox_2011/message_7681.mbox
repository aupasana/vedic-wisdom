Hi Priyank,

This really is an interesting article. But there are still som=
e questions for me that I seem not to get any answers:-

1. Are the macro e=
vents in world history pre-determined ? Like world wars for example.....

2=
. We all know that Yugas are predetermined and the human intelligence (awar=
eness) goes down as we move from Satya Yuga to Kali Yuga...So the question =
is at what macro level are events predetermined over which Humans have no c=
ontrol.

3. There is a quote - "If at first you don't succeed, try, try aga=
in. Then quit. There's no point in being a damn fool about it.". Suppose on=
e wants to be a doctor (he has the vasana inclination) and he tries repeate=
dly to clear the entrance test and he fails. At what point of time should h=
e realise that he should stop attempting and look for an alternative profes=
sion..? Is his profession predetermined that he should not become a doctor,=
 but a chemist for example?

In my view the macro world events are pre-dete=
rmined while humans have a free will over micro events...Let me try a crude=
 analogy:- The shape of race track and wind conditions are pre-determined a=
nd the racer has no control over them (Macro events), while the obstacles (=
Micro events) one encounters are under control. In the sense that a stone i=
s easier to jump over but a huge boulder is difficult to jump over. But if =
one puts in sufficient effort it is still possible to jump over a huge boul=
der.

What is the reference point at which events are macro and micro is so=
mething I have not understood still.For eg: Can a huge boulder on the race =
track be a macro event or a micro event?

Regards
Ram

(A dialogue between His Holiness Shri Chandrashekhara=
 Bharati Mahaswami and a Disciple): [His Holiness was the Sringeri Mathadhi=
pati 1912-1954.]

H.H. : I hope you are pursuing your studies in the Vedant=
a as usual?
D. : Though not regularly, I do make some occasional study.
H.H=
. : In the course of your studies, you may have come across many doubts.
D.=
 : Yes, one doubt repeatedly comes up to my mind.
H.H. : What is it?
D. : I=
t is the problem of the eternal conflict between fate and free-will.
What a=
re their respective provinces and how can the conflict be avoided?
H.H. : I=
f presented in the way you have done it, the problem would baffle even the =
highest of thinkers.
D. : What is wrong with my presentation? I only stated=
 the problem and did not even explain how I find it to be a difficult one.
=
H.H. : Your difficulty arises in the very statement of the problem. D. : Ho=
w?
H.H. : A conflict arises only if there are two things. There can be no c=
onflict if there is only one thing.
D. : But here there are two things, fat=
e and free-will.
H.H. : Exacly. It is this assumption of yours that is resp=
onsible for your problem.
D. : It is not my assumption at all. How can I ig=
nore the fact that the two things exist as independent factors, whether I g=
rant their existence or not?
H.H. : That is where you are wrong again.
D. :=
 How?

H.H. : As a follower of our Sanatana Dharma, you must know that fate=
 is nothing extraneous to yourself, but only the sum total of the results o=
f your past actions. As God is but the dispenser of the fruits of actions, =
fate, representing those fruits, is not his creation but only yours. Free-w=
ill is what you exercise when you act now.

D. : Still I do not see how the=
y are not two distinct things.
H.H. : Have it this way. Fate is past karma;=
 free-will is present karma. Both are really one, that is, karma, though th=
ey may differ in the matter of time. There can be no conflict when they are=
 really one.

D. : But the difference in time is a vital difference which w=
e cannot possibly overlook.
H.H. : I do not want you to overlook it, but on=
ly to study it more deeply. The present is before you and, by the exercise =
of free-will, you can attempt to shape it. The past is past and is therefor=
e beyond your vision and is rightly called adrishta, the unseen. You cannot=
 reasonably attempt to find out the relative strength of two things unless =
both of them are before you. But, by our very definition, free-will, the pr=
esent karma, alone is before you and fate, the past karma, is invisible. 

=
Even if you see two wrestlers right in front of you, you cannot decide abou=
t their relative strength. For, one may have weight, the other agility; one=
 muscles and the other tenacity; one the benefit of
practice and the other =
coolness of judgment and so on. We can go on building arguments on argument=
s to conclude that a particular wrestler will be the winner.

But experienc=
e shows that each of these qualifications may fail at any time or may prove=
 to be a disqualification. The only practical method of determining their r=
elative strength will be to make them
wrestle.

While this is so, how do yo=
u expect to find by means of arguments a solution to the problem of the rel=
ative value of fate and free-will when the former by its very nature is uns=
een!

D. : Is there no way then of solving this problem?
H.H. : There is th=
is way. The wrestlers must fight with each other and prove which of them is=
 the stronger.

D. : In other words, the problem of conflict will get solve=
d only at the end of the conflict. But at that time the problem will have c=
eased to have any practical significance.
H.H. : Not only so, it will cease=
 to exist.
D. : That is, before the conflict begins, the problem is incapab=
le of solution; and, after the conflict ends, it is no longer necessary to =
find a solution.
H.H. : Just so. In either case, it is profitless to embark=
 on the enquiry as to the relative stregth of fate and free-will.

=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
A Guide
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
D. : Does Yor Holiness =
then mean to say that we must resign ourselves to fate?
H.H. : Certainly no=
t. On the other hand, you must devote yourself to free-will.

D. : How can =
that be?
H.H. : Fate, as I told you, is the resultant of the past exercise =
of your free-will. By exercising your free-will in the past, you brought on=
 the resultant fate.
By exercising your free-will in the present, I want yo=
u to wipe out your past record if it hurts you, or to add to it if you find=
 it enjoyable.
I any case. whether for acquiring more happiness or for redu=
cing misery. you have to exercise your free-will in the present.

D. : But =
the exercise of free-will however well-directed, very often fails to secure=
 the desired result, as fate steps in and nullifies the action of free-will=
.
H.H. : You are again ignoring our definition of fate. It is not an extran=
eous and a new thing which steps in to nullify your free-will. On the other=
 hand, it is already in yourself.

D. : It may be so, but its existence is =
felt only when it comes into conflict with free-will. How can we possibly w=
ipe out the past record when we do not know nor have the means of knowing w=
hat it is?
H.H. : Except to a very few highly advanced souls, the past cert=
ainly remains unknown. But even our ignorance of it is very often an advant=
age to us. For, if we happen to know all the results we have accumulated by=
 our actions in this and our past lives, we will be so much shocked as to g=
ive up in despair any attempt to overcome or mitigate them. Even in this li=
fe, forgetfulnes is a boon which the merciful God has been pleased to besto=
w on us, so that we may not be burdened at any moment with a recollection o=
f all that has happened in the past.

Similarly, the divine spark in us is =
ever bright with hope and makes it possible for us to confidently exercise =
our free-will. It is not for us to belittle the significance of these two b=
oons--
forgetfulness of the past and hope for the future.

D. : Our ignoran=
ce of the past may be useful in not deterring the exercise of the free-will=
, and hope may stimulate that exercise. All the same, it cannot be denied t=
hat fate very often does present a formidable obstacle in the way of such e=
xercise.

H.H. : It is not quite correct to say that fate places obstacles =
in the way of free-will. On the other hand, by seeming to oppose our effort=
s, it tells us what is the extent of free-will that is necessary now to
bea=
r fruit.

Ordinarily for the purpose of securing a single benefit, a partic=
ular activity is prescribed; but we do not know how intensively or how repe=
atedly that activity has to be pursued or pesisted in.

If we do not succed=
 at the very first attempt, we can easily deduce that in the past we have e=
xercised our free-will just in the opposite direction, that the resultant o=
f that past activity has first to be eliminated and that our present effort=
 must be proportionate to that past activity.

Thus, the obstacle which fat=
e seems to offer is just the gauge by which we have to guide our present ac=
tivities.

H.H. : The obstacle is seen only after the exercise of our free-=
will; how can that help us to guide our activities at the start?
H.H. : It =
need not guide us at the start. At the start, you must not be obsessed at a=
ll with the idea that there will be any obstacle in your way. Start with bo=
undless hope and with the rpesumption that there is nothing in the way of y=
our exercising the free-will.

If you do not succeed, tell yourself then th=
at there has been in the past a counter-influence brought on by yourself by=
 exercising your free-will in the other direction and, therefore, you must =
now exercise your free-will with re-doubled vogor and persistence to achiev=
e your object.

Tell yourself that, inasmuch as the seeming obstacle is of =
your own making, it is certainly within your competence to overcome it. If =
you do not succeed even after this renewed effort, there can be absolutely =
no justification for despair, for fate being but a creature of your free-wi=
ll can never be stronger than your free-will.

Your failure only means that=
 your present exercise of free-will is not sufficient to counteract the res=
ult of the past exercise of it.

In other words, there is no question of a =
relative proportion between fate and free-will as distinct factors in life.=
 The relative proportion is only as between the intensity of our past actio=
n and
the intensity of our present action.

D. : But even so, the relative =
intensity can be realised only at the end of our present effort in a partic=
ular direction. 
H.H. : It is always so in the case of everything which is =
adrishta or unseen. Take, for example, a nail driven into a wooden pillar. =
When you see it for the first time, you actually see, say, an inch of it
pr=
ojecting out of the pillar. The rest of it has gone into the wood and you c=
annot now see what exact length of the nail is imbedded in the wood. That l=
ength, therefore, is unseen or adrishta, so far as
you are concerned. Beaut=
ifully varnished as the pillar is, you do not know what is the composition =
of the wood in which the nail is driven. That also is unseen or adrishta.

=
Now, suppose you want to pull that nail out, can you tell me how many pulls=
 will be necessary and how powerful each pull has to be?

D. : How can I? T=
he number and the intensity of the pulls will depend upon the length which =
has gone into the wood.

H.H. : Certainly so. And the length which has gone=
 into the wood is not arbitrary, but depended upon the number of strokes wh=
ich drove it in and the intensity of each of such strokes and the resistanc=
e which the wood offered to them.
D. : It is so.
H.H. : The number and inte=
nsity of the pulls needed to take out the nail depend therefore upon the nu=
mber and intensity of the strokes which drove it in.
D. : Yes.
H.H. : But t=
he strokes that drove in the nail are now unseen and unseeable.
They relate=
 to the past and are adrishta.
D. : Yes.
H.H. : Do we stop from pulling out=
 the nail simply because we happen to be ignorant of the length of the nail=
 in the wood or of the number and intensity of the strokes which drove it i=
n? Or, do we persist in
pulling it out by increasing our effort?
D. : Certa=
inly, as practical men we adopt the latter course.
H.H. : Adopt the same co=
urse in every effort of yours. Exert yourself as much as you can. Your will=
 must succeed in the end.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D 
D. : But there certainly are many things wh=
ich are impossible to attain even after the utmost exertion.
H.H. : There y=
ou are mistaken. There is nothing which is really unattainable. A thing, ho=
wever, may be unattainable to us at the particular stage at which we are, o=
r with the qualifications that we
possess. The attainability or otherwise o=
f a particular thing is thus not an absolute characteristic of that thing b=
ut is relative and proportionate to our capacity to attain it.

D. : The su=
ccess or failure of an effort can be known definitely only at the end. How =
are we then to know beforehand whether with our present capacity we may or =
may not exert ourselves to attain a
particular object, and whether it is th=
e right kind of exertion for the attainment of that object?

H.H. : Your qu=
estion is certainly a pertinent one. The whole aim of our Dharma Shastras i=
s to give a detailed answer to your question. Religion does not fetter man'=
s free-will. It leaves him quite
free to act, but tells him at the same tim=
e what is good for him and what is not.
The resposibility is entirely and s=
olely his. He cannot escape it by blaming fate, for fate is of his own maki=
ng, nor by blaming God, for he is but the dispenser of fruits in accordance=
 with the merits of
actions. You are the master of your own destiny. It is =
for you to make it, to better it or to mar it. This is your privilege. This=
 is your responsibility.

D. : I quite realise this. But often it so happen=
s that I am not really master of myself. I know, for instance, quite well t=
hat a particular act is wrong; at the same time, I feel impelled to do it. =
Similarly,
I know that another act is right; at the same time, however, I f=
eel powerless to do it. It seems that there is some power which is able to =
control or defy my free-will. So long as that power is potent, how can I be=
 called the master of my own destiny? What is that power but fate?

H.H. : =
You are evidently confusing together two distinct things. Fate is a thing q=
uite different from the other one which you call a power. Suppose you handl=
e an instrument for the first time. You will do it
very clumsily and with g=
reat effort. The next time, however, you use it, you will do so less clumsi=
ly and with less effort. With repeated uses, you will have learnt to use it=
 easily and without any effort. That is, the facility and ease with which y=
ou use a particular thing increase with the number of times you use it.

Th=
e first time a man steals, he does so with great effort and much fear; the =
next time both his effort and fear are much less. As opportunities increase=
, stealing will become a normal habit with him and will require no effort a=
t all. This habit will generate in him a tendency to steal even when there =
is no  necessity to steal. It is this tendency which goes by the name vasan=
a. The power which makes you act as if against your will is only the vasana=
 which itself is of your own making. This is not fate.

The punishment or r=
eward, in the shape of pain or pleasure, which is the inevitable consequenc=
e of an act, good or bad, is alone the province of fate or destiny.

The va=
sana which the doing of an act leaves behind in the mind in the shape of a =
taste, a greater facility or a greater tendency for doing the same act once=
 again, is quite a different thing. It may be that the punishment or the re=
ward of the past act is, in ordinary circumstances, unavoidable, if there i=
s no counter-effort; but the vasana can be easily handled if only we exerci=
se our free-will correctly.

D. : But the number of vasanas or tendencies t=
hat rule our hearts are endless. How can we possibly control them?
H.H. : T=
he essential nature of a vasana is to seek expression in outward acts. This=
 characteristic is common to all vasanas, good and bad. The stream of vasan=
as, the vasana sarit, as it is called, has two
currents, the good and the b=
ad.

If you try to dam up the entire stream, there mey be danger. The Shast=
ras, therefore, do not ask you to attempt that. On the other hand, they ask=
 you to submit yourself to be led by the good vasana current and to resist =
being led away by the bad vasana current.

When you know that a particular =
vasana is rising up in your mind, you cannot possibly say that you are at i=
ts mercy. You have your wits about you and the responsibility of deciding w=
hether you will encourage it or not is entirely yours. The Shastras ennciat=
e in detail what vasanas are good and
have to be encouraged and what vasana=
s are bad and have to beovercome.

When, by dint of practice, you have made=
 all your vasanas good and practically eliminated the charge of any bad vas=
anas leading you astray, the Shastras take upon themselves the function of =
teaching you how to free your free-will even from the need of being led by =
good vasanas.

You will gradually be led on to a stage when your free-will =
be entirely free from any sort of coloring due to any vasanas. 

At that st=
age, your mind will be pure as crystal and all motive for particular action=
 will cease to be. Freedom from the results of particular actions is an ine=
vitable consequence. Both fate and vasana disappear. There is freedom for e=
ver more and that freedom is called Moksha.

(A dialogue between His Holiness Shri Chandrashekhara Bharati=
 Mahaswami and a Disciple): [His Holiness was the Sringeri Mathadhipati 191=
2-1954.]<br>
 <br>
H.H. : I hope you are pursuing your studies in the Vedan=
ta as usual?<br>
D. : Though not regularly, I do make some occasional study=
.<br>
H.H. : In the course of your studies, you may have come across many d=
oubts.<br>
D. : Yes, one doubt repeatedly comes up to my mind.<br>
H.H. : W=
hat is it?<br>
D. : It is the problem of the eternal conflict between fate =
and free-will.<br>
What are their respective provinces and how can the conf=
lict be avoided?<br>
H.H. : If presented in the way you have done it, the p=
roblem would baffle even the highest of thinkers.<br>
D. : What is wrong wi=
th my presentation? I only stated the problem and did not even explain how =
I find it to be a difficult one.<br>
H.H. : Your difficulty arises in the v=
ery statement of the problem. D. : How?<br>
H.H. : A conflict arises only i=
f there are two things. There can be no conflict if there is only one thing=
.<br>
D. : But here there are two things, fate and free-will.<br>
H.H. : Ex=
acly. It is this assumption of yours that is responsible for your problem.<=
br>
D. : It is not my assumption at all. How can I ignore the fact that the=
 two things exist as independent factors, whether I grant their existence o=
r not?<br>
H.H. : That is where you are wrong again.<br>
D. : How?<br>
<br>=

H.H. : As a follower of our Sanatana Dharma, you must know that fate is no=
thing extraneous to yourself, but only the sum total of the results of your=
 past actions. As God is but the dispenser of the fruits of actions, fate, =
representing those fruits, is not his creation but only yours. Free-will is=
 what you exercise when you act now.<br>
<br>
D. : Still I do not see how t=
hey are not two distinct things.<br>
H.H. : Have it this way. Fate is past =
karma; free-will is present karma. Both are really one, that is, karma, tho=
ugh they may differ in the matter of time. There can be no conflict when th=
ey are really one.<br>
<br>
D. : But the difference in time is a vital diff=
erence which we cannot possibly overlook.<br>
H.H. : I do not want you to o=
verlook it, but only to study it more deeply. The present is before you and=
, by the exercise of free-will, you can attempt to shape it. The past is pa=
st and is therefore beyond your vision and is rightly called adrishta, the =
unseen. You cannot reasonably attempt to find out the relative strength of =
two things unless both of them are before you. But, by our very definition,=
 free-will, the present karma, alone is before you and fate, the past karma=
, is invisible. <br>
<br>
Even if you see two wrestlers right in front of y=
ou, you cannot decide about their relative strength. For, one may have weig=
ht, the other agility; one muscles and the other tenacity; one the benefit =
of<br>
practice and the other coolness of judgment and so on. We can go on =
building arguments on arguments to conclude that a particular wrestler will=
 be the winner.<br>
<br>
But experience shows that each of these qualificat=
ions may fail at any time or may prove to be a disqualification. The only p=
ractical method of determining their relative strength will be to make them=
<br>
wrestle.<br>
<br>
While this is so, how do you expect to find by means=
 of arguments a solution to the problem of the relative value of fate and f=
ree-will when the former by its very nature is unseen!<br>
<br>
D. : Is the=
re no way then of solving this problem?<br>
H.H. : There is this way. The w=
restlers must fight with each other and prove which of them is the stronger=
.<br>
<br>
D. : In other words, the problem of conflict will get solved onl=
y at the end of the conflict. But at that time the problem will have ceased=
 to have any practical significance.<br>
H.H. : Not only so, it will cease =
to exist.<br>
D. : That is, before the conflict begins, the problem is inca=
pable of solution; and, after the conflict ends, it is no longer necessary =
to find a solution.<br>
H.H. : Just so. In either case, it is profitless to=
 embark on the enquiry as to the relative stregth of fate and free-will.<br=

A Guide<br>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br=
>
D. : Does Yor Holiness then mean to say that we must resign ourselves to =
fate?<br>
H.H. : Certainly not. On the other hand, you must devote yourself=
 to free-will.<br>
<br>
D. : How can that be?<br>
H.H. : Fate, as I told yo=
u, is the resultant of the past exercise of your free-will. By exercising y=
our free-will in the past, you brought on the resultant fate.<br>
By exerci=
sing your free-will in the present, I want you to wipe out your past record=
 if it hurts you, or to add to it if you find it enjoyable.<br>
I any case.=
 whether for acquiring more happiness or for reducing misery. you have to e=
xercise your free-will in the present.<br>
<br>
D. : But the exercise of fr=
ee-will however well-directed, very often fails to secure the desired resul=
t, as fate steps in and nullifies the action of free-will.<br>
H.H. : You a=
re again ignoring our definition of fate. It is not an extraneous and a new=
 thing which steps in to nullify your free-will. On the other hand, it is a=
lready in yourself.<br>
<br>
D. : It may be so, but its existence is felt o=
nly when it comes into conflict with free-will. How can we possibly wipe ou=
t the past record when we do not know nor have the means of knowing what it=
 is?<br>
H.H. : Except to a very few highly advanced souls, the past certai=
nly remains unknown. But even our ignorance of it is very often an advantag=
e to us. For, if we happen to know all the results we have accumulated by o=
ur actions in this and our past lives, we will be so much shocked as to giv=
e up in despair any attempt to overcome or mitigate them. Even in this life=
, forgetfulnes is a boon which the merciful God has been pleased to bestow =
on us, so that we may not be burdened at any moment with a recollection of =
all that has happened in the past.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the divine spark in =
us is ever bright with hope and makes it possible for us to confidently exe=
rcise our free-will. It is not for us to belittle the significance of these=
 two boons--<br>
forgetfulness of the past and hope for the future.<br>
<br=
>
D. : Our ignorance of the past may be useful in not deterring the exercis=
e of the free-will, and hope may stimulate that exercise. All the same, it =
cannot be denied that fate very often does present a formidable obstacle in=
 the way of such exercise.<br>
<br>
H.H. : It is not quite correct to say t=
hat fate places obstacles in the way of free-will. On the other hand, by se=
eming to oppose our efforts, it tells us what is the extent of free-will th=
at is necessary now to<br>
bear fruit.<br>
<br>
Ordinarily for the purpose =
of securing a single benefit, a particular activity is prescribed; but we d=
o not know how intensively or how repeatedly that activity has to be pursue=
d or pesisted in.<br>
<br>
If we do not succed at the very first attempt, w=
e can easily deduce that in the past we have exercised our free-will just i=
n the opposite direction, that the resultant of that past activity has firs=
t to be eliminated and that our present effort must be proportionate to tha=
t past activity.<br>
<br>
Thus, the obstacle which fate seems to offer is j=
ust the gauge by which we have to guide our present activities.<br>
<br>
H.=
H. : The obstacle is seen only after the exercise of our free-will; how can=
 that help us to guide our activities at the start?<br>
H.H. : It need not =
guide us at the start. At the start, you must not be obsessed at all with t=
he idea that there will be any obstacle in your way. Start with boundless h=
ope and with the rpesumption that there is nothing in the way of your exerc=
ising the free-will.<br>
<br>
If you do not succeed, tell yourself then tha=
t there has been in the past a counter-influence brought on by yourself by =
exercising your free-will in the other direction and, therefore, you must n=
ow exercise your free-will with re-doubled vogor and persistence to achieve=
 your object.<br>
<br>
Tell yourself that, inasmuch as the seeming obstacle=
 is of your own making, it is certainly within your competence to overcome =
it. If you do not succeed even after this renewed effort, there can be abso=
lutely no justification for despair, for fate being but a creature of your =
free-will can never be stronger than your free-will.<br>
<br>
Your failure =
only means that your present exercise of free-will is not sufficient to cou=
nteract the result of the past exercise of it.<br>
<br>
In other words, the=
re is no question of a relative proportion between fate and free-will as di=
stinct factors in life. The relative proportion is only as between the inte=
nsity of our past action and<br>
the intensity of our present action.<br>
<=
br>
D. : But even so, the relative intensity can be realised only at the en=
d of our present effort in a particular direction. <br>
H.H. : It is always=
 so in the case of everything which is adrishta or unseen. Take, for exampl=
e, a nail driven into a wooden pillar. When you see it for the first time, =
you actually see, say, an inch of it<br>
projecting out of the pillar. The =
rest of it has gone into the wood and you cannot now see what exact length =
of the nail is imbedded in the wood. That length, therefore, is unseen or a=
drishta, so far as<br>
you are concerned. Beautifully varnished as the pill=
ar is, you do not know what is the composition of the wood in which the nai=
l is driven. That also is unseen or adrishta.<br>
<br>
Now, suppose you wan=
t to pull that nail out, can you tell me how many pulls will be necessary a=
nd how powerful each pull has to be?<br>
<br>
D. : How can I? The number an=
d the intensity of the pulls will depend upon the length which has gone int=
o the wood.<br>
<br>
H.H. : Certainly so. And the length which has gone int=
o the wood is not arbitrary, but depended upon the number of strokes which =
drove it in and the intensity of each of such strokes and the resistance wh=
ich the wood offered to them.<br>
D. : It is so.<br>
H.H. : The number and =
intensity of the pulls needed to take out the nail depend therefore upon th=
e number and intensity of the strokes which drove it in.<br>
D. : Yes.<br>
=
H.H. : But the strokes that drove in the nail are now unseen and unseeable.=
<br>
They relate to the past and are adrishta.<br>
D. : Yes.<br>
H.H. : Do =
we stop from pulling out the nail simply because we happen to be ignorant o=
f the length of the nail in the wood or of the number and intensity of the =
strokes which drove it in? Or, do we persist in<br>
pulling it out by incre=
asing our effort?<br>
D. : Certainly, as practical men we adopt the latter =
course.<br>
H.H. : Adopt the same course in every effort of yours. Exert yo=
urself as much as you can. Your will must succeed in the end.<br>

D. : But there certainly are many things which are impossibl=
e to attain even after the utmost exertion.<br>
H.H. : There you are mistak=
en. There is nothing which is really unattainable. A thing, however, may be=
 unattainable to us at the particular stage at which we are, or with the qu=
alifications that we<br>
possess. The attainability or otherwise of a parti=
cular thing is thus not an absolute characteristic of that thing but is rel=
ative and proportionate to our capacity to attain it.<br>
<br>
D. : The suc=
cess or failure of an effort can be known definitely only at the end. How a=
re we then to know beforehand whether with our present capacity we may or m=
ay not exert ourselves to attain a<br>
particular object, and whether it is=
 the right kind of exertion for the attainment of that object?<br>
<br>
H.H=
. : Your question is certainly a pertinent one. The whole aim of our Dharma=
 Shastras is to give a detailed answer to your question. Religion does not =
fetter man's free-will. It leaves him quite<br>
free to act, but tells him =
at the same time what is good for him and what is not.<br>
The resposibilit=
y is entirely and solely his. He cannot escape it by blaming fate, for fate=
 is of his own making, nor by blaming God, for he is but the dispenser of f=
ruits in accordance with the merits of<br>
actions. You are the master of y=
our own destiny. It is for you to make it, to better it or to mar it. This =
is your privilege. This is your responsibility.<br>
<br>
D. : I quite reali=
se this. But often it so happens that I am not really master of myself. I k=
now, for instance, quite well that a particular act is wrong; at the same t=
ime, I feel impelled to do it. Similarly,<br>
I know that another act is ri=
ght; at the same time, however, I feel powerless to do it. It seems that th=
ere is some power which is able to control or defy my free-will. So long as=
 that power is potent, how can I be called the master of my own destiny? Wh=
at is that power but fate?<br>
<br>
H.H. : You are evidently confusing toge=
ther two distinct things. Fate is a thing quite different from the other on=
e which you call a power. Suppose you handle an instrument for the first ti=
me. You will do it<br>
very clumsily and with great effort. The next time, =
however, you use it, you will do so less clumsily and with less effort. Wit=
h repeated uses, you will have learnt to use it easily and without any effo=
rt. That is, the facility and ease with which you use a particular thing in=
crease with the number of times you use it.<br>
<br>
The first time a man s=
teals, he does so with great effort and much fear; the next time both his e=
ffort and fear are much less. As opportunities increase, stealing will beco=
me a normal habit with him and will require no effort at all. This habit wi=
ll generate in him a tendency to steal even when there is no  necessity to =
steal. It is this tendency which goes by the name vasana. The power which m=
akes you act as if against your will is only the vasana which itself is of =
your own making. This is not fate.<br>
<br>
The punishment or reward, in th=
e shape of pain or pleasure, which is the inevitable consequence of an act,=
 good or bad, is alone the province of fate or destiny.<br>
<br>
The vasana=
 which the doing of an act leaves behind in the mind in the shape of a tast=
e, a greater facility or a greater tendency for doing the same act once aga=
in, is quite a different thing. It may be that the punishment or the reward=
 of the past act is, in ordinary circumstances, unavoidable, if there is no=
 counter-effort; but the vasana can be easily handled if only we exercise o=
ur free-will correctly.<br>
<br>
D. : But the number of vasanas or tendenci=
es that rule our hearts are endless. How can we possibly control them?<br>
=
H.H. : The essential nature of a vasana is to seek expression in outward ac=
ts. This characteristic is common to all vasanas, good and bad. The stream =
of vasanas, the vasana sarit, as it is called, has two<br>
currents, the go=
od and the bad.<br>
<br>
If you try to dam up the entire stream, there mey =
be danger. The Shastras, therefore, do not ask you to attempt that. On the =
other hand, they ask you to submit yourself to be led by the good vasana cu=
rrent and to resist being led away by the bad vasana current.<br>
<br>
When=
 you know that a particular vasana is rising up in your mind, you cannot po=
ssibly say that you are at its mercy. You have your wits about you and the =
responsibility of deciding whether you will encourage it or not is entirely=
 yours. The Shastras ennciate in detail what vasanas are good and<br>
have =
to be encouraged and what vasanas are bad and have to beovercome.<br>
<br>
=
When, by dint of practice, you have made all your vasanas good and practica=
lly eliminated the charge of any bad vasanas leading you astray, the Shastr=
as take upon themselves the function of teaching you how to free your free-=
will even from the need of being led by good vasanas.<br>
<br>
You will gra=
dually be led on to a stage when your free-will be entirely free from any s=
ort of coloring due to any vasanas. <br>
<br>
At that stage, your mind will=
 be pure as crystal and all motive for particular action will cease to be. =
Freedom from the results of particular actions is an inevitable consequence=
. Both fate and vasana disappear. There is freedom for ever more and that f=
reedom is called Moksha.<br>
