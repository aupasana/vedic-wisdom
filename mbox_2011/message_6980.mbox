Hello Murahari ji,

Below is my understanding for the verse which arise out=
 of my half baked knowledge.

Lord says "Although i (nirakar parmatma or br=
ahm) am birthless and imperishable and lord of all living beings I appear i=
n this world by my own Maya"

Form and formless both exist. Form is simply =
manifestation of formless. 
All this world, which we perceive is manifestat=
ion of brahm. some call this manifestation as illusion and some say it as t=
ruth. difference is only in words. All this world is maya, the illusion.

Y=
ou already knew this. 

I believe that the Geeta is imparted by brahm, the =
formless, in form of lord krishna. When lord krishna says 'i' we should int=
erpret iv as brahm. Lord krishna Himself is manifestation (maya, form, illu=
sion - whatever name u use) of formless.

In simple words, par brahm is say=
ing that i am formless, but lord of this maya, i come in forms using my own=
 maya.

It is like a tailor making suits for people to attend a ceremony. a=
nd ultimately tailor also wears a self made suit and attends the same cerem=
ony. :)

Sorry if i confused insted of helping.
Sorry for mistakes.

Regard=
s

 because my understanding is as follows:
