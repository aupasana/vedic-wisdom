Can you imagine a greater karma-kandi, a follower of pravritti marga, than =
the great Mandana Misra? He was the greatest votary of karma. He argued wit=
h Sri Shankaracharya for days together on the point that sannyasa is not ne=
cessary. He wanted to establish that we can attain mukti or salvation by ka=
rma marga and that nivritti is not absolutely essential. But at last Sri Sh=
ankara defeated Mandana Misra and he also became one of the four disciples =
of Shankara. When such a mighty man became a sannyasi, are you not convince=
d that sannyasa is necessary?
