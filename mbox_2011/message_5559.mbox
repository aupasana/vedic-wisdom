 Vaikuntavasar was an old attendant of Bhagavan. He later served the Asrama=
m
as a Member of the Board of Trustees.

The following article written by h=
im entitled, =E2=80=98Bhagavan the Way=E2=80=99 appeared
in the April, 1977=
 issue of The Mountain Path.

It was only in 1940 that I came to Arunachala=
. Actually I ran away from my
house just eight days before my marriage was =
to take place.

As there were enough sadhus to serve the Maharshi and I did=
 not want to be
rejected,I refrained from approaching the Sarvadhikari, Nir=
anjanananda
Swami.I went to Palakothu where I befriended Somasundara Swami.=
 I
volunteered to sit and watch the dry fruits, nuts and other things expos=
ed
to sunlight. I did it with a plan. I knew Bhagavan was coming to Palakot=
hu
every afternoon. I spread the fruits very near where Bhagavan was passin=
g
by. I was thrilled to see Him notice my sitting there.

Thanks to my utte=
r dedication to this task, I was introduced to the
Sarvadhikari, with the u=
seful recommendatory words that I was a sincere man
devoid of family ties a=
nd perfectly dedicated to whatever work might be
entrusted to me. This was =
put to test by him by assigning to me varied types
of work, which included =
supervising the construction of the present hospital
building, purchase of =
bulls and cows, rice, dal, fire wood, etc. Whatever
the job, I used to repo=
rt everything to Bhagavan before undertaking it and
after completing it.

B=
hagavan particularly bestowed his special grace on those who undertook
serv=
ice of the Asramam. Not only on me, but on Ramaswami Pillai, who was
then g=
oing on cycle to town many times daily on Asramam work. Bhagavan used
to te=
ll him what had taken place during his absence.

Pleased with my work, the =
Sarvadhikari posted me in the Hall to attend on
Bhagavan. It so happened th=
at the chief attendant, so to say, Madhava
Swami,had then left the Asramam.=
 This responsible duty, for which I had been
longing all the time, devolved=
 on me by His grace.

Everything I did was done with care and dedication. F=
or instance, I used to
devote considerable time to wash the only two pieces=
 of cloth Bhagavan had
(loin cloth and a small towel),rinsing them many tim=
es in water, changing
the water every time. I wanted the clothes to be spot=
lessly clean.

Massaging His feet was another duty I welcomed. How fortunat=
e I was! I did
see, touch, talk and live with Him.

Once I was sleeping in =
front of His Hall on bare ground. Bhagavan noticed it
and asked me that nig=
ht: =E2=80=9CWhy do you sleep on the floor?=E2=80=9D His sympathetic
words =
were elixir to me. True, I had not thought of clothes or comforts. Yet,
the=
 very next morning,Krishnaswami, another attendant, of his own accord
bough=
t for me a long yellow bed sheet, though he had not heard of Bhagavan=E2=80=
=99s
enquiry the previous night.

Though I had been rendering personal serv=
ice to Bhagavan I often felt I had
not done enough. So I used to take a bro=
om and sweep the whole path up the
Hill, where Bhagavan walked twice daily.=


To illustrate Bhagavan=E2=80=99s sense of humour, I relate one incident: =
Once there
was a snake below my pillow; and as usual I went and reported it=
 to Bhagavan
immediately. Bhagavan laughingly remarked: =E2=80=9COh, it is =
quite all right. What
else can make a better bed for you?=E2=80=9D (Vaikunt=
avasar is one of the Names of
Lord Vishnu, whose bed is the
huge snake, Adi=
sesha).
