Dear Biswajit Sir...<br>

If you are seeking a short=
cut to success with the use of intoxicants please beware that you may find =
after too late that there are no shorcuts.  Besides no real 'vira' =
sadhak would pussy foot around in an internet group and ask how to have the=
 cake and eat it too. Why dont you just go out there and experiment with yo=
ur life and see what happens and come back here and tell us how it goes? Hm=
mmm?<br>


<br>
Many warm regards<br>
