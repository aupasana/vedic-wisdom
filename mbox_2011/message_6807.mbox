Namaste,

>>  Maa lakshmi and lord Vishnu are considered as rajasik deity. Lord 
>> Brahma and maa Sarasvati are considered as Sattavik.

Vishnu is pure sattwa. Creator Brahma OTOH is not saattwik as you say, 
but raajasik. Creation or any expansive process is raajasik, whereas 
sustaining an equilibrium in a stable manner is sattwa. Vishnu's 1000 
names includes "sattwavaan" and "saattwikaH".

Saptashati rahasya also describes how the original energy of the cosmos 
(Aadyaa Mahalakshmi) divided herself into 3 portions - Mahalakshmi, 
Mahasaraswati and MahaKali with sattwa, rajas and tamas.

>> As Brahma is considered as aim of sattvik methodologies

Brahman or Aatman or Self considered the ultimate aim is Nirguna, i.e. 
beyond gunas. That's different from Creator Brahma.

>> These ten mahavidiyas along with their consorts such as Shiva, 
>> Bhairava, Mahakala
>> are considered as the chief deity in various left handed literature.

Not all mahavidyas are worshipped in the left handed way. For example, 
Kamala (MahaLakshmi), Lalita Tripurasundari and Bhuvaneswari ARE 
worshipped using right handed tantra. Even Kali has forms (e.g. 
Bhadrakali) worshipped using right-handed tantra, though there exist 
forms worshipped using left-handed tantra.

*        *        *

Finally, one should realize that deities are made of very light/thin 
conditioning, compared to us. The tamas in a human being is far 
different from that as it applies to a deity. Ruthlessly killing a 
person is different from ruthlessly killing a weakness such as lust or 
anger. Even if borth require the same guna, the nature of the guna is 
different in both.

This is what I mentioned as the 3x3 matrix of gunas mentioned by 
Vasishtha in Yoga Vaasishtham to describe the difference between various 
deities, human beings and demons!

Anybody who thinks that Kaali or Taaraa or Chhinnamastaa or Shiva or 
Durga or Rudra are taamasik like "demons" is in terrible 
misunderstanding.

Best regards,
Narasimha
