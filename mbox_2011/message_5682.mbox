 INDRA APPROACHED AHALYA (wife of Gautama) taking the form of Gautama and
s=
he yielded without knowing that he was not her husband. Without
ascertainin=
g the truth, Gautama cursed her to become a stone. Angered
thereby Ahalya s=
aid, =E2=80=9COh,you fool of a Muni! Without enquiring into the
truth, you =
have cursed me and have not even stated when I shall be free from
the curse=
. Tell me, when will the curse end and how? Why not have some
consideration=
 for me and tell me at least that?=E2=80=9D

Gautama thereupon told her tha=
t she would be released from the curse at the
time of Rama avatar when the =
dust from Rama=E2=80=99s feet fell on her. Immediately
thereafter she becam=
e a stone.

Gautama left that place and tried to get into his daily rituals=
 but he could
not, for he had no peace of mind. He tried his level best but=
 could not
control his mind and became more and more troubled. On thinking =
deeply over
the matter, he realised that he had cursed his wife Ahalya with=
out proper
enquiry and also recollected that she had in turn cursed him by =
saying, =E2=80=9CYou
fool of a Muni!=E2=80=9D After all, she was also a gre=
at tapasvini (a female
ascetic). Hence those words which were unusual must =
have resulted in an
irrevocable curse on himself.

He therefore decided to =
seek the help of Iswara, by seeing his =E2=80=9CNataraja
Dance=E2=80=9D, in=
 order to get relieved of the curse.He therefore went to
Chidambaram. At th=
at place he heard an ethereal voice saying, =E2=80=9CI shall be
pleased to =
give you darsan of my Thandava dance in Trisulapura.=E2=80=9D Gautama
immed=
iately left that place and went on foot towards Trisulapura.

On nearing th=
e place, and at the mere sight of it, even from a distance, his
mind began =
to get clear. He stayed there for a very long time doing tapas.
At last Isw=
ara was pleased and gave him darsan of his =E2=80=9CNataraja Dance=E2=80=9D=
 in
the month of Dhanus when the Ardra star was predominant. It was at that=
 time
Gautama is reported to have lived under the tree and performed tapas.=
 After
seeing the dance of Iswara, Gautama worshipped Iswara, went to his o=
riginal
place and began to perform his rituals as usual.

Later on Ahalya b=
ecame purified by the dust of the feet of Sri Rama and
regained her normal =
form.

Devotee: =E2=80=9CThe statement that Ahalya turned into a stone appl=
ies only to her
mind and not to her body. Is that not so?=E2=80=9D

Bhagava=
n: =E2=80=9CThat is so. If it is not for the mind, could it be for the body=
?
It is only ordinary people that say her body turned into a stone and that=

Rama restored her to her original form by putting his foot on the stone. H=
ow
is that possible? It only means that the mind lost its awareness of the
=
Self, and unable to think of anything else, she became dull like a stone.

=
That dullness got relieved by the darsan of a great personage.As she hersel=
f
was a great tapasvini she could immediately become aware of the Self. She=

worshipped Sri Rama as the embodiment of the Self.This inner meaning could=

be found in the Ramayana. The moment Rama set his foot in Gautamasrama, th=
e
mind of Ahalya was restored to its original state, like the blossoming of=
 a
flower.=E2=80=9D
