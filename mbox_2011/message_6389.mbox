The word "Veda" means knowledge, or wis=

rma Pravartaka Acharya is the most authoritative, succinct and philosophica=
lly accurate account of Vedanta philosophy ever recorded.

cisely, is the meaning of your life and of the reality that you presently f=
ind yourself in, this talk is the conclusive and long-sought answer to your=
 search.
