Namaste

Many members have commented and given helpful suggestions.Just add=
ing to the suggestions.

1.Psychological ailments cannot be cured by Allopa=
thic medicines. All an allopathic medicine will do is produce the artificia=
l chemicals which mimic the brain chemicals and this in turns leads to an d=
ependency on the drug.

2.Homeopathy also might not be much useful in this =
case.Please see if you can visit an really good Ayurvedic physician or if y=
ou could visit Pune ( Pune Ayurvedic College which is very reputed ) .Ayurv=
edic consultations are available there.Also there are couple of good Ayurve=
dic hospitals in and around Delhi.Nowadays it has become an big business bu=
t with some research you will find an humane and affordable clinic.


3.Mem=
bers have talked about the Concept of Virodha Bhakti. Ravana and others wer=
e highly elevated spiritual souls ( Jaya and Vijaya ) in the last birth who=
 took this route to be close to God.Anger is one of the most intense emotio=
ns.Nobody can stay angry 24hrs....and if you can manage to even stay angry =
with god you will be the closest to God.An great southern saint " Ramadasu =
" wrote an bhajan in pain when he was being tortured in the dungeons ...the=
 emotion of the bhajan is that god is not helping him out ...he considers g=
od his very own and since his very own is not helping him out...he expresse=
s that anger towards him.

What you have right now is not Virodha Bhakti. I=
t can be mistaken that way. What you really need is an calm atmosphere with=
 good ayurvedic medicines and inner introspection.

Please do not worry abo=
ut Temples, Spirituality and meditation right now.None of those will work u=
ntill the very base ( your mind ) gets some peace. God does not want or nee=
d your fearful prayers....God is not an taskmaster sitting somewhere who de=
mands his share of prayers for whatever good or bad happening with your lif=
e.

God is also very much present in Nature.Since you seem to live in Himac=
hal pradesh ...I am sure you can take a few weekends off to go spend some p=
eaceful time with nature and slowly the external peace will stabilize your =
mind as well.

Also see if you can cut down completely on Chilli, Onions an=
d garlic and some of the chemical feedback will be cut down as well.
