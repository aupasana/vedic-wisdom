Namaste,

Please forgive me if I am hurting you in anyway by writing this m=
essage.

Be assured that I'll be not like myself to be even Last person to =
see you as a "Narasimha Baba" which is used in current times.

I am not for=
 praising you like a sycophant. I do not have any self interest in very rar=
ely praising you other than "Self" interest. I have praised you few times, =
disagreed with you few times and even got angry with you at times as well. =
But every time I was genuine at praise or criticism.

Yesterday's analogy o=
r precisely the explanation of analogy was extremely touching and i wrote w=
hat I felt inside in response to emotions generated by that. What i would l=
ike to change from my last post is this line - "One wave who has digested t=
he fact that He is a ocean". Yes that was an exaggeration. The thing which =
i am not sure of and i wrote without verification. I am sorry for that.

I =
understand and respect your zeal of resisting any attempt, Intentional or U=
nintentional, to glorify personalities and that is commendable. However, I =
request you to be little uncompromising towards the other side of the coin =
-Towards the feelings of others.

I repeat what i said earlier - I'll be no=
t like myself to be even Last person to see you as a "Narasimha Baba" and I=
'll try to resist "personality worship" (which in my opinion i am not doing=
 that)

I've started revisiting "Yoga Vaasishtham" and hopefully it'll set =
me right along with Agni if there are flaws in my approach.

Yours,

Utpal
