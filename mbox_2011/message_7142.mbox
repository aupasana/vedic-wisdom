Namaste Narsimha garu,

Is there any specific reason why many saints/yogis=
 prefer Himalayas  for meditation/Tapascharayas.why Himalayas are much cond=
ucive for sadhana than any other places in India/world. 
For e.g. Shankarac=
harya spent much time in Himalayas and his holy tomb is in kedarnath.Mahava=
thar Babaji seems to be still alive in Himalayas, Swami Rama spent much of =
his life ...
Heard that many yogis,Aghoras live most of the life in the cav=
es of himalayas.




Thank you,
srini.
