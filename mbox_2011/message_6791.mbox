Hi.

Following is breif of my situation

I was spiritually oriented from c=
hild hood itself but never believed in bhakthi and was only seeking knowled=
ge till last few months. My restlessness because of the knowledge increased=
 multifold and i started to goto shiva temples like parvathamalai, sathurag=
iri, Kollimalai in search of the next step. 
All these trips ended with eld=
erlies and ascetics(fake/original) telling me to atleast start doing small =
puja every morning to one deity.

I am living in Hosur (near bangalore). if=
 anyone in this forum can guide me into bhakthi or guide me in the directio=
n of a guru, i hope that will help me a lot.

Also as of now all i can do i=
s meditation for a period of say 10 to 15 mins. so please guide accordingly=
.

Thilak
