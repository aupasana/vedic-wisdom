Thank you for admitting, and welcoming me to this group. I am a mature male=
 with a keen and enduring interest in eastern esoteric wisdom and practice.=
 I have to admit that I was primarily drawn to the group because of my enqu=
ires into the practice of homa or hawan.
Here's hoping that everyone benefi=
ts from the sharing of the great heritage of vedic wisdom.
