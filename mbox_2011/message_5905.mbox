Bhakti as a Social Force

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya


"Bhakti, or si=
ngle minded devotional meditation upon Bhagavan (God), is not a hindrance t=
o practical social and political action in the world. On the contrary, bhak=
ti has been, by its very inherent nature, a powerful and dynamic social for=
ce in the past. Bhakti is an unparalleled motivating force that has induced=
 revolutionary and meaningful change. It will also serve as the driving spi=
ritual force that will revive and strengthen Dharma well into the 21st Cent=
ury.

Bhakti can be the only motivational force strong enough to ensure the=
 degree of self-sacrifice necessary to create true leadership. It is not en=
ough to identify yourself as a "Hindu activist" merely because you find San=
atana Dharma interesting, inspiring, a cool culture that shouldn't disappea=
r, or just because you somehow think it's your ethnic heritage. Such trivia=
l concerns are not enough to promote effective action. The only way a Hindu=
 leader will be truly effective is if he/she has had a direct vision of God=
 in his/her heart so powerful that they see it as their own personal servic=
e to Bhavagan to teach others how to love Him. Any lesser motivation only l=
eads to the invisible chains of ego. Only when we have leaders who are on f=
ire with devotion (bhakti) to God will Dharma be saved.

My message to the =
Hindu community is this: if you want to see an empowered and fearless Hindu=
 leadership arise to lead Dharma into the Twenty-First Century, then YOU mu=
st become the leaders you seek. And you must do so, not out of a craving fo=
r money, fame, or power, but as a devotional offering of your life humbly s=
urrendered at the divine feet of Bhagavan - the Sweet Absolute...."
