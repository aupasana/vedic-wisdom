Namaste,

Obviously, Swami Vivekananda is a man of intellectual brilliance and 
spiritual experience. Though what he says below is wise, it is not 
complete.

*        *        *

While selfishness is bad and selflessness is good, things are not so 
simple in real life. Suppose I have 1,000 dollars. Suppose a library 
wants that money to buy some books. Suppose a temple wants that money to 
buy some materials for pooja. Suppose a relative wants it to buy 
something. Suppose an orphanage wants it to sustain their activities? 
Suppose I can buy for myself a computer as my old computer is on the 
verge of breaking down. What is the right action?

Dharma or the righteous course is personal and changes from person to 
person. Taking care of the physical body that we occupy (and use for a 
few decades) and its needs, is also our dharma. Helping family, 
relatives and friends is also our dharma. Helping other people that we 
come across is also our dharma. Helping the society at large is also our 
dharma. Helping the nation we live in is also our dharma. Helping the 
world and the universe is also our dharma. Sometimes (many times), 
dharma towards different entities may clash. In such an event, finding 
out which is the higher dharma is not trivial.

In some cases, pursuing a lower dharma and ignoring a higher dharma 
(e.g. taking care of one's own physical well-being instead of serving 
some people) may be better and may enable a much higher dharma later on 
(e.g. being able later to serve many many more people).

The purer one is, the clearer is one's vision of one's dharma. An impure 
person sees the world through the color of one's mental conditioning and 
sees one's dharma incorrectly. As one disahcarges more and more of one's 
dharma, as one increases surrender to god and detachment to the results 
of actions, as one's ego effaces more and more, one becomes purer and 
the conditioning reduces. One's dharma becomes clearer.

Best regards,
Narasimha
