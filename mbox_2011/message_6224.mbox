Namaste
Meditation is an exclusively persopnal practice.Only you can tell w=
hether you are in deep trance or sound sleep.
One thing for sure after prop=
er meditation you will have a feeling never experienced before and it is no=
t slight or little .You can surely recognise it BUT after sleep or things l=
ike that NOTHING NEW.
