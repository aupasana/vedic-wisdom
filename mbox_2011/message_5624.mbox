Namaste Sir,
 
> I am not a Brahmin by birth.
 
If braahmanas were made by birth alone, Valmiki and Vishwamitra would not even be braahmanas, let alone be Maharshis! Braahmana is not made by birth but by samskaras, attitude and conduct. Today's caste system is a very bad replica of varnashrama dharma of yore. Most people who call themselves braahmanas today are NOT braahmanas. Very few true braahmanas exist today and some of them are not braahmanas by standard definition of birth family and surname!
 
When Krishna says that Vedic knowledge can be taught and rituals can be performed for others, ONLY by braahmanas, he means a braahmana by conduct. He clarifies further by describing the value system and conduct of a braahmana.
 
*        *        *
 
Swami Vivekananda was fond the story of Satyakama from Chandogyopanishad. When Satyakama went to Maharshi Goutama to learn Veda, maharshi asked him who his father was and what his gotra was. He replied that he was born when his mother Jabala was working as a servant maid in many houses and she did not know who the father of her child was. So he did not know his father and his gotra. Impressed, Maharshi Goutama declared that one committed to truth and honesty MUST be a braahmana irrespective of parentage and accepted to teach him Veda! Varna is decided by the samskaras and conduct and not by birth.
 
*        *        *
 
Teaching Vedic knowledge and performing rituals for others are two braahminical karmas that can never be sold as per Lord Krishna. One engaging in these activities can only take what is voluntarily given, and live meagrely within that. If that is not enough and one needs more money, Lord Krishna said that a braahmana can use the vaisya profession in addition and buy and sell *material* things to sustain oneself. But he did not suggest selling Vedic knowledge and rituals.
 
If you are selling other material things (e.g. your software knowledge or any material goods), that is fine. As long as you do not sell Jyotish knowledge or ritual performance, you are doing fine with that divine knowledge. In fact, based on what you said, you are more of a braahmana than many people who call themselves braahmanas. Forget about your birth and keep doing what you are doing.
 
*        *        *
 
In fact, a lot of non-braahmanas (by samskaras and conduct and NOT by surname) are flourishing in the fields of Jyotish and rituals today due to shortage of true braahmanas (by samskaras and conduct and NOT by surname), though they are breaking Lord Krishna's guidelines. The situation can be remedied only if more people start following Lord Krishna's words and transform into true braahmanas engaging in Vedic knowledge. If you do that, you will slowly get the blessings of rishis and become better at Jyotish and rituals. If your samskaras impel you in that direction, start walking irrespective of your surname and what family you were born in. Who knows, you may be a true braahmana in the making.
 
*        *        *
 
Bottomline: Your birth caste does NOT matter. You are doing a much better job of following Lord Krishna's guidelines on the conduct of braahmanas than many people and keep going without any self-doubts! I am sorry if I created any confusion for you.
 
Best regards,
Narasimha
