THE SWAMI             A Sadhaka  should  first learn  about the
spiritual p=
ath from some great soul, then follow it methodically.If  he
does it
      =
                                 haphazard, he cannot achieve much
success.=
Again if he gives it up, he will have to put  forth double the 
usual effor=
t to
                                       gain the desired result. But no=

endeavour is  lost. Lust, anger, greed,  gradually  go  away from him
who =
leads the
                                       spiritual   life.
        =
                               Your mind is  now covered over by
Rajas  (ac=
tivity) and Tamas(inertia). It must be made pure and subtle,
and raised
   =
                                    to  the  state  of  
Sattwa(illuminatio=
n).  Then you will  find pleasure in religious
practices and will  also fee=
l  inclined to
                                       devote  more and  mor=
e time to
them.Later on, when the mind  attains perfect  purity, you will
n=
aturally devote
                                       yourself  to spiritu=
al  culture.
The mind is at present on the  gross plane. Consequently it  l=
eans 
toward  gross things.
                                       But  whe=
n  it   becomes awakened,
it  inclines naturally toward the   spiritual.Whe=
n it  grows subtler,
its  capacity also                                    =
   increases  and
the aspirant is  able  to understand within a short time =
the truths
about God.
