Let the Churches preach doctrines, theories, philosophies to their heart's =
content, but when it comes to worship, the real practical part of religion,=
 it should be as Jesus says, 'When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and=
 when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret.'
