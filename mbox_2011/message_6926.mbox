My mail=C2=A0can send a wrong message to people that homam can harm.=
 The hard work that has been put to spread homams I don't want to come on t=

=C2=A0
=C2=A0Homams have changed me internally and the perspecti=

y homam and consider one of the luckiest beings to have been introduced to =
such a beautiful ritual. 
After doing homam and praying God for so long I h=
ave belittled myself by not trusting him. Apologies to the god for the same=
.

PVR garu,I will try to send in my video when possible. I really a=

If one is ex=
periencing material setbacks while doing homam, there are a few possibiliti=
es:
=C2=A0
(1) Very likely, one is carrying really serious karmas and was d=
estined to experience the setbacks during that period anyway. Homam (or oth=
er sadhana) made it better, though one has no way of confirming it.
=C2=A0
=
(2) One is using some wrong materials, e.g. black pepper, mustard seeds, ch=
illies etc. It could also be correct materials, but with corrption, e.g. so=
me sesame seeds or grains with dirt in them, coconut/wood with insects in t=
hem, etc. If one is doing a sattwik homam for spiritual progress, these thi=
ngs are tolerated. But, if one is doing with some desires and expectations =
(conscious/sub-conscious), then material errors can have material consequen=
ces. This is why I keep emphasizing on devotion, surrender etc. With surren=
der and devotion, material errors lose their significance.
=C2=A0
(3) Deity=
 is coming close to a person and testing the person's faith thoroughly. If =
this is the case, there can be serious problems, but the person's life is t=
ransformed after the person succeeds in keeping the faith.
=C2=A0
If one ca=
nnot withstand the testing, one can consider a different deity. As pointed =
out earlier and below, Ganapathi homam is one ritual that balances the mate=
rial and spiritual needs. One makes spiritual progress without destabilizin=
g the material life. For most people, Ganapathi homam is appropriate for at=
least a few months in the beginning.

=C2=A0=C2=A0 Hi Priy=
a, 

Note - giving my 2 cents since similar thing happened to me also. I am=
 also waiting PVRs reply. In any case take his words as final words. 

Simi=
lar kind of unfortunate thing happened to me also after doing 21 vishnu sah=
astranaam homam. 

I strongly believe that getting inspired by PVR we have =
in a way jump started the spiritual side by doing homams. (They are powerfu=
l) PVR had already lot of sadhana (i believe for 4-5yrs) before he met his =
guru and started with homams. 

Noone knows the exact theory and i beleive =
that such things are not in ones chart also. Even i was worried like you to=
 get my chart analysed and know the reason but 3-4 astrologers couldnt tell=
 me the reason. i came to understand that chart is a map not a territory. 
=

PVR also has mentioned that its better if people do Ganapti homam for firs=
t 2-3 months. I will request PVR to add this information in each and every =
manual and also to suggest some non homam sadhana of ganapati so that peopl=
e who are eager to start their journey can have a beautiful start to their =
sadhana. 

Priya, you can stop the homams and get confortable and confident=
 first. Dont attach any guilt to not doing homams. No god is out there to p=
unish you, its just that karmas are extremely complex. Its better to start =
with ganapati to remove all obstacles first. 

I can strongly suggest few g=
anapati sadhana. 

1. Ganapati Homam 
(This is no doubt very powerful and i=
 suggest this one for everyone but for al those who for any reason cant do =
homam, please start sincerely with some non-homam sadhana) 

2. Ganapati ta=
rpan 
Use ganapati mool mantra 444 times for 40 days. (takes around 40min) =

ॐ श्रीं ह्री&#=
2306; क्लीं ग्लौæ=
6; गं गणपतये वर=
 वरद सर्वजनं &#=
2350;े वशमानय स्ë=
7;ाहा॥ add "tarpayami" after swaha 
http://gurujiam=
rita.tripod.com/mahaganapathy_tarpanam.htm

3. Variations in Ganapti tarpan=
 
a. Instead of turmeric mound in the sadhana listed above you can keep gan=
apti yantra also. 
b. I simply chooze to visualise ganapati and either i vi=
sualise washing his feet or simple focusing on mantra. 
c. As PVR has said =
many times before that sincerity and devotion are the key and not the techn=
icalities. 

4. I am on 30th day of this ganapti tarpan sadhana and i can v=
ouch for a wonderful clarity and good results.
