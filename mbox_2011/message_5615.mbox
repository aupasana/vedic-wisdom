 Translation by BonGiovanni

1.2. Union is restraining the thought-streams =
natural to the mind.

1.3. Then the seer dwells in his own nature.

1.12. T=
hese thought-streams are controlled by practice and non-attachment.

1.15. =
Desirelessness towards the seen and the unseen gives the consciousness
of m=
astery.

1.27. God's voice is Om.

1.28. The repetition of Om should be mad=
e with an understanding of its
meaning.

1.30. Disease, inertia, doubt, lac=
k of enthusiasm, laziness, sensuality,
mind-wandering, missing the point, i=
nstability- these distractions of the
mind are the obstacles.

Part Two on =
Spiritual Disciplines

2.7 Attachment is that magnetic pattern which cluste=
rs in pleasure and pulls
one towards such experience.

2.20 The indweller i=
s pure consciousness only, which though pure, sees
through the mind and is =
identified by ego as being only the mind.

2.26 The continuous practice of =
discrimination is the means of attaining
liberation.

2.30 Self-restraint i=
n actions includes abstention from violence, from
falsehoods, from stealing=
, from sexual engagements, and from acceptance of
gifts.

2.32 The fixed ob=
servances are cleanliness, contentment, austerity, study
and persevering de=
votion to God.

2.34 Improper thoughts and emotions such as those of violen=
ce- whether done,
caused to be done, or even approved of- indeed, any thoug=
ht originating in
desire, anger or delusion, whether mild medium or intense=
- do all result in
endless pain and misery. Overcome such distractions by p=
ondering on the
opposites.

2.37 All jewels approach him who is confirmed i=
n honesty.

2.38 When one is confirmed in celibacy, spiritual vigor is gain=
ed.

2.39 When one is confirmed in non-possessiveness, the knowledge of the=
 why
and how of existence is attained.

2.40 From purity follows a withdraw=
al from enchantment over one's own body
as well as a cessation of desire fo=
r physical contact with others.

2.41 As a result of contentment there is p=
urity of mind, one-pointedness,
control of the senses, and fitness for the =
vision of the self.

2.42 Supreme happiness is gained via contentment.

2.5=
4 When the mind maintains awareness, yet does not mingle with the senses,
n=
or the senses with sense impressions, then self-awareness blossoms.

2.55 I=
n this way comes mastery over the senses.

Part Three on Divine Powers

3.1=
 One-pointedness is steadfastness of the mind.

3.2 Unbroken continuation o=
f that mental ability is meditation.

3.3 That same meditation when there i=
s only consciousness of the object of
meditation and not of the mind is rea=
lization.

Part Four on Realizations

4.4 Created minds arise from egoism a=
lone.

4.27 Distractions arise from habitual thought patterns when practice=
 is
intermittent.

4.34 When the attributes cease mutative association with=
 awarenessness, they
resolve into dormancy in Nature, and the indweller shi=
nes forth as pure
consciousness. This is absolute freedom.
