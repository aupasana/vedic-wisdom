f all the enlighten masters of past like RamaKrishana parmahansa, Raman Mah=
arshi, Sri Arbindo, Osho =85, present masters like Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Sr=
i Jaggi Vasudeve =85 and the future masters. The TRUTH is timeless.

What i=
s GURU ?

Is inner guiding force OR external being?

Is the one who is avai=
lable to clear all your doubts and help you navigate your Sansara's trouble=
s OR the one who is enlighten and has millions of follower and not accessib=
le?

Is the one who has/had GURU and have reverence toward him OR the one w=
ho don't have GURU ?

One should have only ONE GURU or have many GURU like =
Guru Datatraya ?

What is Shishya ?

r OR one which keep his own Intelligence Independence?

It is said that GUR=
U choose the Shishya, but how does one prepare himself to be worthy of a GU=
RU ?

Please, share your thoughts.

May GURU tattva guide us all.

Regards.=

Mihir
