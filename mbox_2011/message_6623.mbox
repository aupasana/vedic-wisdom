Namaste friends,

sparked' 
> or
> associated with such 'inner help'

Of course, some times a=
re more conducive to actually accepting the inner 
guidance and taking the =
right path and some times are less conducive. 
Planets do have some control=
. But, my point is that astrology as we know 
is unreliable and one is bett=
er off just surrendering to god. There is 
something called free will and i=
t can be used to surrender to god and 
pray sincerely.

*        *        *=


Reminds me of an incident. A gentleman had a high flying career during 
d=
ot com bubble, but was struggling for a few years. He was from a 
distingui=
shed lineage of learned brahmins. I saw the horoscope and 
suggested Lakshm=
i homam everyday with Sri Sooktam 16 times with only 
ghee as the aahuti. I=
 said the remedy will help a lot, but the next 2 
years were very problemat=
ic and I wasn't sure how much progress could be 
made. But I said things wo=
uld be better after 2 years. I told him to try 
it nevertheless.

He mispla=
ced the paper on which he wrote all this down and forgot about 
this comple=
tely. He continued to struggle for 2 years. About 26 months 
later, his wif=
e was cleaning the house and found this paper. She gave it 
to him. He sudd=
enly got inspired and started homam. Within a month, he 
got a job and his =
wife too got a job without really trying.

In the end, one's well-being is =
in one's hands. Others can try to 
motivate, but nothing happens without th=
e internal trigger. Moreover, 
doing a remedy with a reasonable attitude ta=
kes some preparation and 
maturing (in the case below, this person was reas=
onably mature to start 
with and reading vedic-wisdom messages added to it)=
. Force does not work 
in these matters. Make things available, put out som=
e inspirational 
material and leave it to the person.

*        *        *
=

> I know you are a very busy professional and perhaps have your own
> spir=
itual path and activities to follow

Yes, I am busy professional in high te=
ch and have my own spiritual 
sadhana too. But this karma - sharings in Jyo=
tish and spirituality - is 
a *part* of my spiritual sadhana. It is my offe=
ring to Lord. One must 
share with the world the good things one has access=
 to.

I was touched when I heard about an old priest. Someone from Vizag to=
ok 
a copy of our Mahaganapathi homam manual when they visited Boston and 
=
gave it to a local priest who is around 75 years old. He apparently 
liked =
it, made 200 copies, distributed at a Vizag temple and told people 
to do h=
omam themselves using the manual. This is a priest whose 
livelihood can be=
 affected if people do homam by themselves. Yet, he was 
unselfish and real=
ized the power of enabling people on a mass scale and 
what it can do to in=
dividuals and to society in general.

Those who like the free resources sho=
uld feel free to spread the word. 
But do NOT expect anything in return - p=
raise or acknowledgment. Do not 
even expect that the person listens and st=
arts doing homam. Be prepared 
for the effort to go waste and yet put in th=
e best effort. Act like the 
most passionate person, but be prepared for an=
y result of the action - 
favorable or unfavorable! THAT is detached action=
 or nishkama karma.

*        *        *

I'll club the reply to one more m=
ail:

> Congrats. He could be lucky but one must not forget that all prayer=
s 
> are not always answered.

All sincere and humble prayers are of course=
 always answered. 
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, "you go one step towards g=
od and god will 
come 3 steps towards you".

The only tricky thing is that =
it may take some time - god waits till the 
person first becomes worthy of =
being given something. Surrender and keep 
doing the remedy with *faith*. F=
aith, humility and surrender are the 
keys.

Also, sometimes god may not gi=
ve what you asked for, but what he gives 
is always better for you. Bottoml=
ine is this: If you have a problem, 
take it up with god. Do it with faith,=
 humility and surrender. Fire can 
be a very effective medium to god. More =
effective than anything else.

Best regards,
Narasimha
