Hello AS,=C2=A0

Just say Viswanath, No need of Respected or Sir.

So from =
the below mail. What I understood is that!! Every time, when you are done w=
ith a task, you want to go to temple. So after going to temple. What you do=
 there ? What kind of prayer you do ? what do you like about temple ? I may=
 not be able to help you medically here. I can only suggest you to come out=
 of the certain thoughts and look the temple or GOD.

After completing a ta=
sk if you want to go to temple and surrender your success or failure to GOD=
. That is the best thing that you are following. =C2=A0

Instead of going t=
o temple for every simple task. try to extend you time period and set a spe=
cific time to go to temple every day. Say for example If you have a habit o=
f going to Gym every morning. your brain is trained to go to gym every morn=
ing. once you go there you will never think of that again in you day.=C2=A0=


Try to train your brain in a way that, for all the tasks that I do today,=
 I will go to temple in the evening or in the morning, a specific time.=C2=
=A0

And when ever you get a thought of going to temple. Think that you are=
 going in the evening any way.

And one more thing, think =C2=A0this way wh=
en you are brain is telling you to go to temple every time. There is some t=
hing that you have to do to temples. Some thing Good. And Good is always re=
minding you that.

If you are=C2=A0financially good, try to donate money or=
 =C2=A0try to do some kind of help at the temple like cleaning or helping p=
riest to get some stuff.=C2=A0

Don't think God is making you to hate him. =
Actually he want you do something good to temples which you took it in a di=
fferent way.=C2=A0

Hope this helps you. I apologize, if I miss understood =
you.=C2=A0

Thanks
Viswanath


=C2=A0

=C2=A0 

Respected (Viswanath=
) Sir
Thank you very much for your reply. But I want to tell you that I hat=
e God because one part of my brain always tells me from behind to go to a c=
ertain temple on accomplishing some task.And then I counter that thought sa=
ying that I will not go to temple even if my work gets done. This way whole=
 of my energy is exhausted in getting these obsessive thoughts and counteri=
ng them. I hate god because he forces me to do so.I was a very religious gi=
rl even since by childhood.
But now I cant see him.
Thanks
AS
