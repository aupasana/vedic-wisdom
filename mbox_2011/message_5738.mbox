Hi, 
I am thinking of starting a saptashati study yahoo group. Is anybody i=
nterested?
Hopefully we could go deep into the text and try to understand t=
he esoteric meanings, possibly tantra associated with verses, chapters etc,=
 etc...
Narasimhaji would you be able to contribute your thoughts as well?
