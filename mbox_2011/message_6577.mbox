Does Narasimha's recent post really conflict with the "sannyasa path"?
Is =
there one single sannyasa path, and do Swami Sivananda's writings
define it=
? Or is Swami Sivananda expounding upon one particular aspect
of one kind o=
f sannyasa to a particular target group with particular
tendencies in order=
 to effect a particular response? Are we to take
every single word from eve=
ry single swami to be literally and
universally applicable? If so, every si=
ngle Swami has suddenly become
a Rishi.

For most people, sannyasa is a mer=
e samkalpa, and is only the
beginning of a journey. It is not required for =
success, nor does it
guarantee success. That still doesn't take away from t=
he importance of
sannyasa. It is an important tool, but it is not the only =
one.
