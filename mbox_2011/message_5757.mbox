Namaste Sir,

Yes, you can offer them to Mars. Some people also offer whole=
 toor dal 
for Mars (small pigeon peas).

*        *        *

This reminds=
 me of one incident. In my daily Chandi homam, one of the 
standard substan=
ces I offer is dried Tulsi (holy basil) leaves, bought 
at a local Indian s=
tore. Though Tulasi is dear to Vishnu, She is said to 
be disliked by Ganes=
ha (there is a Puranic story for that). So, Tulasi 
leaves are nishiddha (p=
rohibited) as an offering to Ganesha. I usually 
stick to all the rules I a=
m aware of. So I offer Tulasi only to the 
Mother and never to Ganesha.

On=
e Friday during last navaratris, I took a day off from work and spent 
it i=
n a special sadhana. I spent from early morning till 2 pm doing 
homam to L=
akshmi and Narayana with continuous repetition of Narayana 
Hridayam and La=
kshmi Hridayam and then spent the rest of the day 
chanting the same pair o=
f stotras over and over again. In the beginning 
of the day, when I was mak=
ing offerings to Ganesha in fire, I put Tulasi 
leaves in fire unconsciousl=
y (they were next to me and I grabbed them 
without thinking). After making=
 the offering, I realized my mistake, and 
mentally apologized. But I got a=
 clear sense that there was nothing 
wrong or nothing to worry. Moreover, I=
 had my best experience ever 
during homam, on that day.

*        *       =
 *

Do the sadhana with a simple, innocent and pure heart, without expectin=
g 
any selfish results. Then, whatever you do, whether granted by 
scriptur=
es or prohibited, will become a pure offering to the Lord. The 
physical ma=
terials we offer to Lord are just a proxy and the real 
offering is our att=
itude and thoughts that accompany them. Of course, 
follow the rules when y=
ou can, but do not worry too much about the 
proxy. Worry about the real of=
fering instead!

*        *        *

If one thinks and analyzes too much, =
the onus is on that person to 
analyze correctly and come to the right conc=
lusion. If one is too 
knowledgeable, the onus is on that person to apply t=
he knowledge.

One who is not that knowledgeable and does not think much an=
d simply 
does sadhana with a simple and innocent attitude and a sense of 
=
surrender is blessed. The onus is on guru and Lord to make that person 
cro=
ss the ocean of samsara.

Best regards,
Narasimha
