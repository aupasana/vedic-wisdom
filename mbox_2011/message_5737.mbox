Namaste,

I never said our ancestors did anything "foolishly". I was only saying 
that most people today cannot replicate what the ancestors did/meant and 
hence I suggest not wasting time. Let me clarify using an analogy.

Suppose someone eats a raw gooseberry every morning for health benefits. 
Suppose a copycat having no gooseberries eats a candy gooseberry made of 
sugar syrup and green color. The copycat is obviously not going to get 
any health benefit from that candy gooseberry. If that person gets too 
technical and asks about how much the gooseberry should weigh, what 
should be the radius, how exactly it should be eaten etc, I may say that 
it does not matter and just eat it however you want and wait for the day 
you get access to a real raw gooseberry. That does not amount to calling 
the original gooseberry eater foolish!

"Scientific" is a word that is understood in a very narrow sense today. 
Science as we understand now-a-days is limited to the material world and 
objects in it. But, spiritual sadhana, on the other hand, is not limited 
to the material world. So the science that governs spiritual sadhana is 
not limited to the material world.

Just as one not having access to a telescope cannot do visual 
experiments related to observing and measuring planets and stars, 
similarly one unable to perceive one's own subtle body cannot do real 
anganyas (i.e. place syllables in various places in it). Of course, just 
to get practice or just for fun, one can pretend to look through a toy 
telescope and pretend that one is seeing so and so star or planet. 
Similarly, one can touch the tips of the corresponding fingers and say 
the syllable and pretend that the syllable has been placed there.

If one follows yama and niyama, if one removes all conditioning using 
whatever sadhana one follows, if one achieves an equanimous mind that is 
established in Truth, then one's mind itself is a powerful instrument 
that can helps one master spiritual science. On the other hand, if one's 
mind is colored by dense conditioning and is vibrating to the tune of 
apparent material reality, then one is lacking the scientific instrument 
for making accurate observations and measurements in the spiritual 
realm.

Best regards,
Narasimha

they had a scientific approach,
only the scientific approach has disappeared
so I do not agree with you
if you can define homa scientifically then you have to define anganyas

Namaste,

As I said before, the nyaasa people do today is merely a formality. 
Nyasa literally means placement. You *place* certain sound combinations 
in certain chakras (energy centers) in various body parts (e.g. tips of 
ring fingers, tips of little fingers, heart, top of head, between eyes 
etc).

If you touch a body part in a particular way and say the sound, will 
that really *place* that sound in that chakra? Will that chakra vibrate 
with that sound then? Of course, not.

Those who have been taught a procedure by somebody can follow what they 
are taught. Those who do not know need not worry.

Just as the streets and surroundings of your house may automatically be 
repaired if the Prime Minister of India decides to visit your house, 
various chakras in your subtle body will automatically vibrate with the 
correct sounds if the deity decides to express to you in some form or 
the other.

Building devotion and surrender is far more important and useful than to 
focus on technicalities and try to master them.

Best regards,
Narasimha
