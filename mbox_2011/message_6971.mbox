Namaste Balaji,

I have been doing Sapthasati for a four years now though n=
ot counting because personally I don't believe in counting and proclaiming =
it. Divine Mother will only offer a smile at our ignorance though will stil=
l acknowledge.

Coming to initiation, don't break your head about rituals a=
s in Kali Yuga, the best option is to be sincere and regular but with SUCHI=
( Cleanliness). Bathe well, put on clean clothes and follow what I have att=
ached.

Trust Maa completely as she knows your past lives(All the skulls in=
 her throat are representing you past lives) and knows your karmic debt too=
.

Buy the compact disc of "Prakash Koushik" for Devi Mahatmyam and follow =
the pattern indicated in the document.

If you cannot do any chanting on so=
me days, atleast do Kunjika Stotram once as it gives you full result and is=
 very powerful.

When you fear the world and its misdeeds, chant DEVI KAVAC=
HAM" which will protect you from everything. My personal take on mantras ar=
e that "Devi Mantras" are the most potent and are high voltage for obvious =
reasons as she is the manifest form of Lord Shiva who is always in Unmanife=
st form and in deep meditation. You will be shocked to know that the kavach=
am protects the devotee from bomb blasts too as it is stated in it.

Devi A=
tharvaseersham is a part of the sapthasati which can be done thrice a day a=
nd it does indicate that MAA stays with you/ around you with you and protec=
ts your pysche.

If you want to chant the "Navarna Mantra", you would need =
the initiation as it needs so unless you are already initiated into Gayathr=
i. People who are already initiated into Gayathri are authorized to do it r=
ight away as stated in Mantra Shastra. Again, no racist remark here but jus=
t an FYI.

Narasimhaji has made a wonderful document on Chandi Homa which c=
an be followed later.

Please note that your tiny steps towards evolution a=
re being watched by Divine Mother as your own mother in the kitchen watches=
 you in the verandah with a side glance. There is no doubt about it that Sh=
e is VERY KIND and knows the best for you.

I wish Maa bless you with Lot o=
f LOVE.

Jagadambaarpanamastu.

Srikanth

 [vedic-wisdom] Query Regarding Durga Sapthashati







=C2=A0



    
 =
     
      
      Namaste Narasimhaji,
This is my first post, I'm a silent=
 member of Vedic =C2=A0Wisdom, i read all the posts and thankful to all the=
 members of this group.
I have a query regarding reading Durga sapthashati.=
=C2=A0


My query is i have a desire to read durga sapthashati, this has be=
en there since more than a year or two. I got the book last year, but i sti=
ll haven't started reading.
The reason being i've come across all your post=
s and people responding to your posts, i.e whether a person who has not bee=
n initiated could read or should not read. I'm not able to conclude, even n=
ow i'm reading the post and text by Dr. Sathya Prakash Choudhary, but still=
 unable to conclude.


I've read that people should be very careful while r=
eading Durga Sapthashati, i don't know to what extent and what could be the=
 consequences
I do read Aditya Hrudayam, Srisuktham, Vishnu Sahasranamam, L=
alitha Sahasranamam, Lalitha Trishati. I don't know how i started reading, =
no body guided me or initiated me how to read but i read it easily, wheneve=
r i do prayer i ask for for well being of all the people i know, sometimes =
just blessings and sometimes i don't even ask anything.


I try to follow r=
eading for one deity=C2=A0continuously=C2=A0for N number of days, then star=
t reading for other deities and follow the same rule.
About me: I'm a bache=
lor aged about 28

My questions
1. Should i start reading Durga Sapthashati=
.2. If so what are the do's and don'ts .=C2=A0

Finally the process to read=
, i read the book and as per it, it is

=E2=80=A2 Kavacham=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 A=
rgala Stotra=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Keelakam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Navakshari japam=C2=A0
=

=E2=80=A2 Ratri Suktam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Devi Mahatmyam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Navaks=
hari mantra japam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Devi Suktam=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Rahasya trayam=
=C2=A0=E2=80=A2 Kshama Prarthan
Does it require the above process to be fol=
lowed strictly to read single adhyaya per day or it's ok to just read the c=
hapter without above process.=C2=A0

Or in other ways what all should be re=
ad if i read a single chapter a day.
Apart from these questions can a perso=
n read Laitha Sahasranaama / Trishati after reading Vishnu Sahasranama or v=
ice versa.


Best Wishes,Balaji
