Dear Rajarshi, 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I completely agree with you that Chandipath i=
s a wonderful sadhana and I am stating this with personal experience. Aroun=
d Navaratri this year I have completed a 108 times recitation of chandipath=
 over two/three months and that was indeed one of the best periods of my li=
fe so far. Although there is nothing that manifested in terms of material b=
enefits, my overall mood was pretty elevated/calm most of the time. After t=
hat, however I am not able to practise it so much and I don't enjoy that sa=
me bliss anymore. But whenever I do Chandipath, that day in general my ment=
al state is pretty calm. However, it is a tough sadhana to do everyday. The=
 Path alone takes around an hour to recite, that too if you superfast, whic=
h you are not supposed to, according to the book. If you recite at comforta=
ble speed, it takes around 1 hour 20 minutes just for the 13 chapters. Add =
the kavacham, argala, keelaka, ratrisuktam, artharvaseersham before and dev=
i sooktam, three
 rahasyams, kshama prathana and siddha kunjika strotram yo=
u are taking 2 to 2.5 hours. For me that seems impossible on a daily basis.=
 So, I=C2=A0have tried to do 2/3 chapters a day for daily practise but that=
 does not give me the same bliss that I enjoy when I do the whole thing. So=
, I don't know how to practise this regularly on a permanent basis. Any inp=
uts from you?
=C2=A0

Th=

Strength, courage, confidence, devotion, kn=
owledge, application of special knowledge, authority (if one so desires it)=
, power, wisdom, spiritual experiences, liberation, enlightenment etc - eve=
rything comes from this one text. It is a whole package.=C2=A0


Eventually=
 you get what you crave for deep down. It is not too difficult to master th=

 practicing the text and in 3 months you can read it whole.


Best of luck.=



-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi


PS: A small word of caution. Maybe not relevan=
t right now, but if ever by Her will you become an accomplished Chandi sadh=
aka in future then this will be of help. Don't ask for anything when doing =
Her worship is an ideal situation. If you pray simply as you pray in any te=
mple, then too there is not a problem. Praying with humility is never a pro=
blem. BUT if ever you try out kriyas with Chandi or do the Chandipath to ge=
t xyz results in abc timeframe, (specially during complex forms of worship =
of Chandi like those involving charnel grounds), then be sure that you know=
 the precise and exact procedures. There are no half measures in those. Nis=
hkama worship in complex methods is fine, but desire for material results w=
ithout the knowledge of the procedures during complex rituals in begging fo=
