Knowing the True Guru

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya


aum ajnana-timira=
ndhasya jnananjana-salakaya
caksur unmilitam yena tasmai sri-gurave namah

=
"I offer my respectful obeisances unto my auspicious spiritual master, who =
has opened my eyes, which were blinded by the darkness of ignorance, with t=
he torchlight of knowledge."  


A true guru is not to be known merely by h=
ow charismatic he may seem to be, or by how much time he spent in an ashram=
 in India, or by his proud claims of instant enlightenment, or by whether h=
e can conjure showy 'miracles' for a gullible audience, or by his false cla=
ims to be the latest 'avatar', or merely because he has a book on the best =
sellers list, or by how many pseudo-spiritual clich=E9s he can utter in one=
 sitting, or by how seemingly otherworldly he is photographed grinning towa=
rd the heavens, or by how many millions of followers he may claim to have.
=

A true guru, a sadguru, is known by his unwavering courage to reveal to yo=
u the uncompromising Truth. He is known by his unfathomable gravity, by his=
 oceanic depth of wisdom derived directly from his intimate knowledge of th=
e Vedic scriptures, and by his unshakable serenity and peace. He is reveale=
d by the steel-like determination he has to save the entire world at any an=
d all cost to himself. 

The true guru is the humblest of sages, yet the st=
rongest of leaders. The true guru will guide you to transcend your illusory=
 ego, and to realize your eternal self. The true guru is directly empowered=
 by the very shakti of God to deliver liberation unto you, and to swing ope=
n before you the very gates of Vaikuntha, the Realm of God. Narada, Patanja=
li, Vyasa, Jesus, Buddha, Ramanuja, Chaitanya, Prabhupada - these were exam=
ples of true gurus.

Allow just such a true guru to enter your life today. =
Fall at his feet with humility, serve him sincerely, listen to his instruct=
ions with eagerness, and then emulate the actions of such an exalted being =
in your own life, and you will know liberation.
