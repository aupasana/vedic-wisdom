Shankara is of the opinion that it is foolish to cite instances of Janaka a=
nd others who did not take sannyasa but possessed Brahmajnana. Such instanc=
es are quoted by householders who are unwilling to leave their attachments,=
 for there is no reason why they should stick to household life after attai=
ning knowledge. For knowledge by its very nature is against all senses of w=
orldly duty and activity.

The sannyasin can find adequate leisure and free=
dom from the distractions of life. Renunciation is desirable even to those =
who have not attained jnana. Only the sannyasin can devote the whole time f=
or meditation. Householders cannot give themselves up completely for medita=
tion. The very word =E2=80=9Chousehold=E2=80=9D signifies pravritti which i=
s concerned with the world of appearance.
