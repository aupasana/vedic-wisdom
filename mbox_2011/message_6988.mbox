Namaste,

Thank you Girish Ji and Srikanth Ji. And especially Vedic Wisdom =
group for
providing a platform for discussions.

The world is filled with i=
llusion, putting a person in confused state most
of the times.  And of cour=
se without guidance or wiser decisions who could
cross this ocean of illusi=
on.

Extremely thankful for the guidance which has cleared my doubts and fe=
ar :)

regards,
Balaji
