All this universe was in Brahman, and it was, as it were, projected out of =
Him, and has been moving on, to go back to the source from which it was pro=
jected, like the electricity which comes out of the dynamo, completes the c=
ircuit, and returns to it. The same is the case with the soul. Projected fr=
om Brahman, it passed through all sorts of vegetable and animal forms, and =
at last it is in man, and man is the nearest approach to Brahman. To go bac=
k to Brahman from which we have been projected is the great struggle of lif=
e.
