Respected Narsimha guruji ,
Thank you very much for creating tarpan manual.=
 I did tarpan yestarday and had a little doubt. In pitri tarpan it has been=
 mentioned as " salilam jal" should it be read as "satilam jal" as we are a=
dding til in the jal?
The mantras given in Geeta Press Book are somewhat di=
fficult, so thank you once again for creating a simple easy to follow manua=
l.
With regards,
Madhusudan
