THE SWAMI               Do you know why I ask you seriously, all of you,
t=

to the
Lord?When we were of your age,

                                    =
   Thakur(Sri Ramakrishna) used to
push us and make us do our

            =
                           spiritual practices.In boyhood the
mind remains =
like plastic clay.

                                       It receives an i=
ndelible
impression from whatever it comes in con-

                       =
                tact with.So long as clay remains
soft,you can give it any =
shape

                                       you like.But when the clay is=

burned,this cannot be done.Your

                                       mi=
nd now is like unburnt clay.It
can be moulded in any way you

             =
                          want.It is still pure and
untainted,so it can be =
directed very easily

                                       toward God.If =
the mind is kept
wholly occupied with thoughts of

                        =
               the Lord from this  time on,no
foreign thought can disturb i=
