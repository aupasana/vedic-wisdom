 In rich men's  houses they keep a Darwan(porter) whose duty is to prevent =
 thieves,  cows, sheep,  etc.,from  entering the compound.The 
mind is man'=
s  Darwan. The stronger the mind becomes, the better. Mind has also been co=
mpared to  a restive horse. Such  a horse  generally takes  the  rider  alo=
ng  the  wrong path.Only he who can hold a tight rein and check the horse c=
an go the right way.Struggle, struggle on! What are you doing?Is everything=
 achieved by the mere wearing of the Gerua cloth(ochre-coloured cloth of th=
e Sannyasin) or by renunciation of hearth and home?  What have you realised=
? Time is flying.Do not waste a single  moment.You will be able to work har=
d only another three or four years at the most.Afterwards both body and min=
d will become weak and infirm and you will not be able to do anything.What =
can be achieved without diligence?
