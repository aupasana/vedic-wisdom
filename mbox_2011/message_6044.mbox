 I have chiefly performed Maha-Ganapati Homas as well as Chandi homas and I=

y, it is all about attraction/liking for a particular deity. It is my perso=

evata or Ugra-Soumya in external Nature) to which one feels most attracted =
and then forget about the rest. It would be a destabilizing effect on mind =
of a person to start judging and relating day to day experiences with homam=
. The chosen deity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or Krishna or Shiva or Ha=
numan or any other deity. Once person starts surrendering to the chosen dei=
ty, one is in safe hands. Even if things starts going wrong, one need not d=
espair and should keep faith till it is impossible because if God exist, th=

er we have families to look after or not.

He is capable of everything. If one has a great liking for him, one can kee=
p on performing his homam without need of switching. Actually to switch fro=
m Maha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is NOT changing of Levels (especi=
ally from Lower to upper) which some may think.
