Respected Sir,

I have some queries about homam. Please spare some time to =
answer. 

1) Can we give aahutis to Maharishi Parashara while doing homam f=
or Shri Krishna? If yes, please give mantra to be used and how and when dur=
ing homam we can do this

2) Recently it dawned to me that we should thank =
to navagraha deities for all the work they have been doing for us and we sh=
ould thank them for showing all us the path in their own way. Can we do thi=
s through homam? If yes please give a manual for Navagraha homam. Or better=
 if we can use Kuja/shani homam as a basic and make some changes in them. I=
n this case, please tell the changes.

Or can we give ahutis to Navagraha w=
hile doing Krishna homam? if yes please give mantras to be used and how and=
 when we can do this

I shall be thankful to you

Regards
