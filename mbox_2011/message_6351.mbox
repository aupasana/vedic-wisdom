Namaste Narasimha,

1. 
Thankyou for making a bold statement like this. Com=
ming from your experience of almost 2 decades at the highest level, it sets=
 somethings very clear.

you wrote following 2 lines
"what decides the natu=
re of one's worship is not just the name used for the deity and the prayer =
used, but also the intention and attitude."
"The vibrations created in the =
consciousness are a function of which deity/prayer is used and with which i=
ntention/attitude."

First line says that we control the intention and atti=
tude and choice of diety.
Second line says that our own consciousness is/be=
comes a function of diety/prayer and intention/attitude.

from my limited u=
nderstanding It means it is/becomes a closed loop. we cant clearly say who =
chooses whome. are we just mere puppets or is there a choice we have?


* *=
 *

2. 
Now that you have made clear that Ishta devata and perfect devotion=
 is the best remedy for all afflictions (short term/longterm).

- What are =
the thing we can/should learn from our kundali?
- What are the best questio=
ns to ask to an astrologer?
- What is the proper approach/perspective going=
 for kundali reading?
- Is there anything substantial we can learn form our=
 kundali apart form asking quickfix for our karmas and asking for money/pos=
ition/future?
- What we can learn form this map? because this certainly isn=
t the territory itself, or is it in territory in terms of consciousness?


=
* * * 

3. Some places i have read that a kundali does predict future lifet=
imes also. 

- Do we live one lifetime at a time with some free will or man=
y lifetimes are set with limited free will

* * *

4. Your car dent example=
 is very clear. in light of this the question seems silly. 

I guess this i=
s the nature of knowledge/perspective itself. once you know the higher trut=
h, the lower one automatically drops away. strange is the play of the consc=
iousness!!!


regards
Priyank
