Namaste Everyone,

I COMPLETELY understand the wisdom of being devoted sole=
ly to the Ishta and not necessarily using astrology to cobble together a sp=
iritual practice.  However, in my case I consider Sri Hanuman to be the for=
m of the Divine that I am most devoted to.  Right now in my life I am in Ve=
nus dasha and I have a lot of 'Venus type' problems (btw my Venus is 'combu=
st' and only at 0 degrees in Aq.)  I feel as if I continue to worship Sri H=
anuman (Mars?) and not do mantra for Shukra it would be like directing too =
much energy to one place and not enough energy where it is needed.

Am I mi=
ssing the point?

D Raj
