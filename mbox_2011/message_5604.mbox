Air element Disturbed-Narasimha Ji's Kalahasti 
observation

   
Narasimha =
Ji

I was just amazed at some of the prescient observations you had made la=
st year 
about change coming to the world with the news of the Kalahasti do=
me collapsing. 
You had foreseen that this indicates a disturbance in the a=
ir element of the 
world and that changes would be coming.

Within months o=
f that BP spill happenned in the gulf coast of Usa impacting many 
lifeform=
s.

Lately these news articles came out unrelated to that incident.Thousand=
s and 
Thousands of birds are dropping dead at various places over the worl=
d.This is no 
conspiracy theory and is being covered by major news outlets.=
So far science is 
attempting some explanations with new year firework and =
cold temp theories but 
they do not seem convincing enough.

Your observati=
ons were spot on and probably this is a indication of times to 
come. 


Fe=
w links below for the interested

Total Count

3000 Birds fell from the sky=
 in Arkansas
500 Birds fell three days later in Louisiana
100 Birds fell de=
ad a few days later in Sweden
1000 Birds dead today again falling from the =
sky in Italy

In addition to thousands of Fish have died in various states =
mysteriously.
