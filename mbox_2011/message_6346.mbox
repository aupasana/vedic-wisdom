Namaste Narasimha, 

Notes to myself for generating devotion
(correct me if=
 I am wrong)

1. Bring god, Reverence, devotion in every aspect of daily li=
fe. 
2. Treat and see everything as god and actively develop the devotion f=
or God, in form of that moment/thing/object/people. 

3. Maybe add a short =
mantra "narayan-narayan" here and there in whole day when you come across t=
hat devotional moment. This mantra will help tie the whole perspective to t=
he mantra itself. (Correct me if I am wrong)
4. Develop perception, awarene=
ss =96 devotion, surrender will automatically come.

One more aspect that y=
ou mentioned before in other post, also mentioned in gospel of ramakrishan.=
 
5. Ultimately one has to merge his sense of "i-ness" with god, but you do=
 need to keep your "I-ness" to function in this world. The best way to do t=
hat is to see yourself as loving caretaker/servant of your lord. This way t=
his "I-ness" looses the ego and brings in devotion.

Yesterday I d=
id read that proper method is to read NH-LH-NH, and I wasted good 3-4 hrs y=
est deciding what should I do, I couldn't decide, got frustrated and I left=
 it there. 
((2 things did flash in my mind which I recall now 
1. If you w=
ant to read daily add the beej mantra (mukha, pada, etc) of LH at the end. =
 
2. Read LH in English, understanding the meaning on Friday night, 
I thou=
ght what a silly thought to read NH in Sanskrit daily and LH in English on =
Friday night))

Today When I finished simple narayan homam with 108 "on nam=
o narayanye" there was a strong urge to pick and simply read it form NH vin=
iyog (not the LNH viniyog at starting) till shloka 27. After 
This reading =
in homam it somehow didn't even cross my mind till I saw your note that LH =
is supposed to follow.

Now that you brought it up, I felt like checking th=
e viniyog part of each. I am surprised to see the difference in the name of=
 sages and devata

1. Narayan Laxmi Hrudaya
Asya Lakshmi Narayana Hrudaya s=
tothra maha manthrasya,
Bharghavan rishi,
Anushtup Chanda,
Lakshmi Narayano=
 devatha.
Narayana preethyartham jape viniyoga

2. Narayan Hrudaya
Asya Nar=
ayana Hrudaya stothra maha manthrasya,
Brahma rishi,
Anushtup Chanda,
Naray=
ano devatha.
Narayana preethyartham jape viniyoga

3. Laxmi Hrudaya
Hari Om=
, Asya sri aadhyadhi sri Maha Lakshmi hrudaya stotra maha manthrasya,
Bharg=
hava Rishi, anushtubadhi Chanda,
Aadhyadhi Sri Maha Lakshmi prasada sidhyar=
the jape viniyoga

I am again in a dilemma, Will appreciate if you can figu=
re out what it says in phalashruti in shlok 27 onwards of NH. Let me know i=
f you feel I should not read it separately.


* * * 

I am kind of surprise=
d and inspired that you did sadhana with LNH and got such intense results. =
I have read all of your posts for last 3yrs in this group and I dont think =
you ever mentioned LNH or this result. 

Its inspiring and humbling to see =
the sadhana, attitude and results. My regards to the devi within you.

Now =
that I have switched to simpler 108 "on namo narayanaye" homam, I am able t=
o connect to fire in a much bigger way. I can vouch for what you wrote 

"W=
hen one does homam with a prayer one has a deep connection to, when one is =
able to identify with (or relate to) the prayer, when one brings feeling to=
 one's prayer, and when one is focused very well and has a good level of de=
votion, anything is possible with fire!"


regards
priyank
