two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the chhandas a=
nd changes the meaning also. You may still experience something when medita=
ting on the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra to the fullest=
 with that pronunciation.
>  
> Akshara means "unperished". Vowels (swaras)=
 are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant wi=
thout a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an aksh=
ara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce "t" as is (without adding a=
ny sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the listener cannot deci=
pher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.
>  
> In "prachoday=
aat", the whole sound "yaat" is one akshara. Because "t" has no praana by i=
tself, it simply joins to the akshara "yaa" (which has the vowel "aa" as it=
s praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhandas, "yaat" is consider=
ed one letter (one guru). When you pronounce "yaat" correctly, it is diffic=
ult for the listener to know for sure whether you said "yaat" or "yaak" or =
"yaan". It is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. T=
he "t" at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound without praana=
. So it tough to hear clearly.

 (like "u" or "a" or "o" or "i" or some other vowel sound in between them) =
so that the "t" sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It suddenl=

cher started pronouncing "yaat" as "yaatu" so that "t" gets a praana of its=
elf and becomes very clear to hear, so that his students would not get conf=
used when learning. Probably the students thought the mantra was "yaatu" (i=
nstead of "yaat") and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that be=
came a standard practice after a couple of centuries.
>

e the English word "path", you do not change it to "paaththu". You say "th"=
 at the end of "path" as a consonant and leave it there. You don't force an=
 vowel sound to be added at the end. The same thing holds for "t" in "prach=
odayaat".

 consonants applies to all consonants and not just "t", though "t" is more =

here also, people normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end=
 up changing the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. Th=

 Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly=
 will be the odd person out.
>

e sankalpa before many poojas, people say "dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturv=

d money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment)". M=
ost people end up pronouncing "dharmaartha kaama moksha" as "dharmaardha ka=
ama moksha". It means "half of dharma, kaama and moksha". Even "siddhardham=
" means "half attainment" and "purushaardha" means "half a human". Mis-pron=
unciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by=
 many many trained priests!
