Sannyasa and Vedanta of some kind always go hand in hand. One does not beco=
me complete without the other. Wherever there is real sannyasa there is pra=
ctical Vedanta. Wherever there is practical Vedanta there must be sannyasa =
of the highest type. Sannyasa without Vedanta or parabhakti becomes fruitle=
ss. Vedanta without sannyasa becomes a mere intellectualism. When sannyasa =
and Vedanta melt into one there crops up a sage of supreme wisdom. Sannyasa=
 empties the individual of the ego and the negative phenomena, and Vedanta =
fills it with positive truth. Sannyasa without Vedanta remains empty, and d=
oes not serve its purpose. Even so, Vedanta without sannyasa becomes essenc=
eless, and loses its meaning. Vedanta cannot be grasped without emptying th=
e ego through sannyasa and sannyasa becomes a waste without getting at the =
supreme ideal through Vedanta.
