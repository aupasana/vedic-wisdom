In my opinion, celibacy is of utmost importance...Unfortunately like any o=
ther thing over coming the lust is the biggest challenge of all..lust seems=
 to be subsided but can revert back from any stage ..irrespective of any st=
age the sadhaka is in (unless somebody has become a jeevan mukta)...this is=
 because sexual energy is root and primal energy and the same is manifested=
 as different things at different level..at a lower level it is represented=
 as physical pleasure..and at the higher levels its the same represented as=
 love towards the supreme..
CheersKK

Namaste Biswajit,

                  

Celibacy i=

 vasanas are burnt up by tapas.Concentrate on sadhana/tapas.
