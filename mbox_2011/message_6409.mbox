Om Sham Shanaishcharaaya Namah !

31st May/1st June (2011) is SHANI DEV Jay=
anti (Vaishakh Amaavasyaa). Incidentally, Saturn is very very Slow in space=
. Infact, it is just 12 days away from becoming direct.

Hence, It occours =
to me that it has to be an extremely potential time to do spiritual activti=
es. Homam, Japam, Pranaayam, meditation, reading of scriptures, Bhajans etc=
... (May not be good time for purchasing a TV set...:-)

It should be a ver=
y good Muhurt as well to start a spiritual effort(s) for consistancy and pa=
tient hardwork as well as long lasting positive effects.

1stly its an Amaa=
vasya, 2ndly It is a Shani Jayanti, 3rd Shani is almost Stationary (Sthira)=
 and Last but not the least, eclipse also happening.

Cold (Shani-like) Reg=
ards,

Utpal
