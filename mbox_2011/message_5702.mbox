Respected Narasimha Ji,

I agree with you.

It has been about 125 years sin=
ce Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansa died. As per his statement He must have been=
 born somewhere and may be he is working somewhere for welfare of mankind. =
Most probably in a different way he did in his previous birth.

Obviously h=
e will never claim that he is reincarnation of Ramakrishna Paramhansa. Peop=
le like me may never be able to know about who is reincarnation of Ramakris=
hna and we can just make "wild guesses". 

May be, we soon start seeing him=
 on News channels or may be we already have started doing so. As current ti=
me is of IT and information spread like fire now a days. Any marvelous work=
 he may be doing, or he will do, will surely make waves.

We all will like =
to know about your personal opinion about this. What do you think that he h=
as taken birth or have yet to take birth?

I usually think that may be Mani=
sh Ji, and you can be part of his Group. Well, for a stupid person like me,=
 It is another 'wild Guess'  :)

Kind Regards
