 Sanskrit

  
Dear Chaitanya,

Make every effort to attend classes in perso=
n. It will be much more effective 
than anything you can do by yourself. 

=
There are several options for self-study:
(a) The first level of Samskrita =
Bharati classes is available as a DVD set. 
These classes are suppossed to =
be interactive. Pretend that the DVD instructors 
are in front of you, and =
talk to the televsion. Really.
(b) Samskita Bharati (and many other organiz=
ations) have correspondence courses 
available.
(c) Rashtriya Samskrita Sam=
sthan has published a good "Teach Yourself Sanskrit" 
series (diikShA book =
series).

Make every effort to speak in sanskrit. If you and your friends (=
or family) 
can't attend classes, then try to speak in sanskrit to each oth=
er when you meet. 
It will accelerate your sanskrit learning significantly.=


sasneham,
 
   ajit
