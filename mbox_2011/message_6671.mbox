I did not understand your problem. Is that your problem with going to templ=
e or hating the god. It doesn't mean you love god if you go to temple or yo=
u hate him if you don't.=A0

There are types of Bhakthis or prayers humans =
offer to god. Yours is the most beautiful kind of prayer. praying the god o=
ut of fear and hatred.

There are people who did the same, say for example =
Ravana, Hiranyakasyapa. Marrecha from Ramayana has also same kind of proble=
m. Interesting part is GOD didn't do any thing to them until they crossed t=
heir limits.

They all hate the god. Just believe in one thing, when it com=
es to god. What ever you feel about GOD. it doesn't change how god sees you=
.

If you can not see you in the form he is in temples, See him in the form=
 you like. For example, if you like parents start praying to them daily ima=
gining them as God you want to pray.=A0

If I have to go in details, If you=
 want to pray to Siva today, Start seeing you father as Shiva and start see=
ing you mother as parvathi.=A0
I do the same, I pray Lord Lakshmi Devi who =
looks exactly like mother.=A0

you dont have to feel wrong for hating god. =
The more you hate the god the more you become close to god. you dont believ=
e me. There are three stories in puranas which say that Lord Vishnu mention=
s the same fact.

I apologies if I have mentioned any thing wrong and hope =
this helps you

Thanks
Viswanath
