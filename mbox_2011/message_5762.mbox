    <d=

      <p>Namaste Sir,<br>
<br>
Yes, you can offer them to=
 Mars. Some people also offer whole toor dal <br>
for Mars (small pigeon pe=
as).<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
This reminds me of one incident.=
 In my daily Chandi homam, one of the <br>
standard substances I offer is d=
ried Tulsi (holy basil) leaves, bought <br>
at a local Indian store. Though=
 Tulasi is dear to Vishnu, She is said to <br>
be disliked by Ganesha (ther=
e is a Puranic story for that). So, Tulasi <br>
leaves are nishiddha (prohi=
bited) as an offering to Ganesha. I usually <br>
stick to all the rules I a=
m aware of. So I offer Tulasi only to the <br>
Mother and never to Ganesha.=
<br>
<br>
One Friday during last navaratris, I took a day off from work and=
 spent <br>
it in a special sadhana. I spent from early morning till 2 pm d=
oing <br>
homam to Lakshmi and Narayana with continuous repetition of Naray=
ana <br>
Hridayam and Lakshmi Hridayam and then spent the rest of the day <=
br>
chanting the same pair of stotras over and over again. In the beginning=
 <br>
of the day, when I was making offerings to Ganesha in fire, I put Tul=
asi <br>
leaves in fire unconsciously (they were next to me and I grabbed t=
hem <br>
without thinking). After making the offering, I realized my mistak=
e, and <br>
mentally apologized. But I got a clear sense that there was not=
hing <br>
wrong or nothing to worry. Moreover, I had my best experience eve=
r <br>
during homam, on that day.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
Do =
the sadhana with a simple, innocent and pure heart, without expecting <br>
=
any selfish results. Then, whatever you do, whether granted by <br>
scriptu=
res or prohibited, will become a pure offering to the Lord. The <br>
physic=
al materials we offer to Lord are just a proxy and the real <br>
offering i=
s our attitude and thoughts that accompany them. Of course, <br>
follow the=
 rules when you can, but do not worry too much about the <br>
proxy. Worry =
about the real offering instead!<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
If o=
ne thinks and analyzes too much, the onus is on that person to <br>
analyze=
 correctly and come to the right conclusion. If one is too <br>
knowledgeab=
le, the onus is on that person to apply the knowledge.<br>
<br>
One who is =
not that knowledgeable and does not think much and simply <br>
does sadhana=
 with a simple and innocent attitude and a sense of <br>
surrender is bless=
ed. The onus is on guru and Lord to make that person <br>
cross the ocean o=
f samsara.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
