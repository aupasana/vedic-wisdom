Vimalananda's thoughts from Aghora-2 (Chapter name- Sadhana)

[
"People fre=
quently come and tell me, 'I am getting less and less peace the more i repe=
at my mantra.' Whenever troubles increase like that during sadhana you can =
be sure that you are getting closer to your deity. You can not realize your=
 deity until your consciousness becomes clear and clean, for which you have=
 to burn off all your bad karmas. As you become firmer in your sadhana, mor=
e and more of your bad karmas from this life and from thousands of previous=
 lives are liberated from your casual body. You are bound to be affected by=
 this - every one likes to spend and no one likes to pay the bills - but do=
n't let that stop you. continue on, continue until you achieve; then you wi=
ll understand that it was 100% worth it.

"This is Kaliyuga, though, and as=
 soon as most people start getting this negative effect from the removal of=
 their bad karmas they think that it is somehow the fault of the mantra and=
 they quit their practice altogether, just at the point they should be doin=
g it more vigorously. Is it any surprise that they never get any results fr=
om their sadhana?"
