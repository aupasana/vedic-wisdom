After every happiness comes misery; they may be far apart or near. The more=
 advanced the soul, the more quickly does one follow the other. What we wan=
t is neither happiness nor misery. Both make us forget our true nature; bot=
h are chains, one iron, one gold; behind both is the Atman, who knows neith=
er happiness nor misery.
