 Namaste Shri Narasimha.

Your way of explaining subtle vedic concepts usin=
g practical simple examples is excellent. For instance, recently elsewhere =
you explained a difficult thing using the example of various components of =
a Computer. Can you please explain the subtle existence of various Gods and=
 Godesses? While some say they are feverish human imagination, Sri Aurobind=
o writes that Gods are real, perhaps more real than us humans with a differ=
ence, they have enormous Power and influence over the workings of the Unive=
rse, and they can be cajoled, placated,forced or get punished etc.Please en=
lighten us in your own way.

Regards,

J. Koperumcholan
