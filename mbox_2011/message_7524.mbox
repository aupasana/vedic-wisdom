Respected Mr. PVR Narasimha Rao,
Namaste.

Thank you very much. I will stud=
y, contemplate and meditate on this further. Would there be an online Engli=
sh version of Yoga Vasishtham that you may recommend.

One curiosity - what=
 does the "(for now)" in the last line of your message below suggest. This =
last line was a little difficult to comprehend. How can a human soul take a=
 birth directly in Kali-yuga for the first time?

Some village pandits clai=
m that they have the power to deliver a departed soul from taking an animal=
 birth. Is/was this ever possible -even by elevated Sages/Brahmins of the y=
ester-years?

Sir, I appreciate that you may have a very busy schedule so p=
lease respond at your convenience. Many thanks.

Best Regards,
Mahesh
