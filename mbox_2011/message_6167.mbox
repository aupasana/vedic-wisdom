should be "ti". Transliteration schemes allow "t" to represent "T" sound li=

=C2=A0 



Namaste Nagaraj Ji,

Let us try to correct our pronunciatio=
ns if there are flaws as well as understanding of correct-Incorrect.

***
I=
 wish to take one Alphabet which has made me wonder for a long time but i n=
ever tried to seriously find out.

The Alphabet is "Shree" or "Sree" in Dev=
anagari script of Sanskrit. There are many who say it as "Shree" and still =
many who call it as "Sree".

***
one more alphabet which is "Ti" or "Thi" w=
hich comes at the end in "Ganapati". Now which is correct one? is it "Thi" =
or "Ti". As i know that Sanskrit has different alphabets for "Ta" & "Tha". =
So one should say Ganapati or Ganapathi?

Which is the most correct pronunc=
iation? Any knowledge from any learned one.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 I have gone thru this and my observations are exactly like Shri Narasimha'=
s! You might be pronouncing with proper vowel endings but surely you are an=
 exception. Most North Indian people I know, do not put the vowel endings, =
esp. when the words end with "a". And South Indians do not put a "aa" eithe=
r. It is only when south indians, speak in English and they have to refer t=
o the names "rama" and "Shiva" or "Atma", they say that as "Raamaa", "Shiva=
a" or "Aatmaa" because that is how all "a" ending English nouns end!

 for them "Ramacharita Manasa" is more important than even Valmiki's Ramaya=
na. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also without proper vowel endings. However, I=

 In the recent times I was pondering about how north Indians speak Hindi, w=
here they reduce most of the words to "Halanthas", like "Shiv", "Ram", "Kri=
shn" and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a con=
sonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by
 the Vowel. But for =
whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry that h=
abit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the North India=
n bhajan singers (I don't know the name) singing Adi Sankara's Bhaja Govind=
am as "Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE", which soun=
ded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj Bha=
sha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them "Ramacharita Manasa" is more=
 important than even Valmiki's Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also wit=
hout proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that appr=
oach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like "Sri Gurucharana<BR>> Saroj=
a<BR>> > > raja" should be pronounced exactly like that and not li=
ke "Sri Gurucharan saroj raj". You may shed more light on this aspect as we=

ake the "t" sound at the end of the words like "prachodayaat", "ava purasta=

with that pronunciation.<BR>> > > > <BR>> > > > Aks=
hara means "unperished". Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an =
akshara. If you have just a
 consonant without a vowel after it, then it ha=

you pronounce "t" as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot susta=
in the sound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. =
It has no life force.<BR>> > > > <BR>> > > > In "pr=
achodayaat", the whole sound "yaat" is one akshara. Because "t" has no praa=
na by itself, it simply joins to the akshara "yaa" (which has the vowel "aa=
" as its praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhandas, "yaat" is c=
onsidered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce "yaat" correctly, it is=
 difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you said "yaat" or "ya=
ak" or "yaan". It is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise diffi=
cult. The "t" at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound without=
 praana. So it tough to hear clearly.<BR>> > > > <BR>> > =

 people add some vowel to it (like "u" or "a" or "o" o=

a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his students wou=
