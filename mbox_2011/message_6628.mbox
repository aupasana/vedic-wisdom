Dear sir,
namskar
There was a time when I didnt use to have my meals before=
 thanking god. I used to remember god 24 hors a day. But in 1990 I started =
fearing god and now I hate him so much so that I destroyed my home made tem=
ple and his posters. why i did so the reason is as below:
I am suffering fr=
om ocd (Obsessive compulsive disorder) since 1990. My problem is that whene=
ver I am doing some work some part of my mind says that if this work gets d=
one I will go to temple but it is not me and I counter this thought by sayi=
ng that I will not go to temple. But at the completion of the work I am com=
pelled to go to temple. The problem is that I have to go to temple compulsi=
vely and many times again and again. Also the temple which comes to my thou=
ghts has to be visited to satisfy my compulsion. Even a simple thought that=
 if my son answers the question I will go to temple. I am not even able to =
teach him. I cant cross the road where there is a temple. How can I avoid t=
hat. There are temples all around the world. Please help me out. For past 1=
0 yrs I am taking allopathy medicine. For past 7 months I am taking homeopa=
thy also. But sometimes it goes out of control. Please guide me how can I s=
top hating GOD. 
Regards
