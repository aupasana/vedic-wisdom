Dear Narasimhaji,

In the tarpana can we include the=
 following people ?

Employers, Bosses, Employees, Servants, Neighbours,  C=
ountrymen and foreigners?
Also lets say if are having some issues with Govt=
 Offices (very frequent in India), Can we do tarpana to them so we clean an=
y negative karma we have with them?. 

If I can what would be the particula=
r sanskrit names to use?.

Also I heard someone say that Tarpana can be per=
formed facing each of the 8 directions?. Please tell your views.

Warm Rega=
rds,
Sanjay P
