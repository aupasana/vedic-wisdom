Don't say: "Karma, Karma. My Karma has brought me like this". Exert. Exert.=
 Do Purushartha (deliberate and conscious action). Do Tapas (austerities). =
Concentrate. Purify. Meditate. Don't become a fatalist. Don't yield to iner=
tia. Don't bleat like a lamb. Roar Om Om Om like a lion of Vedanta. See how=
 Markandeya, who was destined to die at his sixteenth year, became a Chiran=
jeevi-an immortal boy of sixteen years on account of his Tapas. Also note h=
ow Savitri by her Tapas brought back to life her dead husband; how Benjamin=
 Franklin and the late Sri T. Muthusami lyer of the Madras Bench, elevated =
themselves. Remember, my dear Niranjan, that man is master of his destiny. =
Viswamitra Rishi, who was a Kshatriya Raja (king), became a Brahma Rishi, l=
ike Vasishta and even created a third world for Trisanku by his power of Ta=
pas. Rogue Ratnakar became the sage Valmiki through Tapas. Rogues, Jagai an=
d Madhai of Bengal, became highly developed saints. They became the discipl=
es of Gouranga. What others have done, you can also do. There is no doubt o=
f this. You can also do wonders and miracles if you apply yourself to spiri=
tual Sadhana, Tapas and meditation.
