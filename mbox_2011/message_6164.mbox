Namaste Nagaraj Ji,

Let us try to correct our pronunciations if there are =
flaws as well as understanding of correct-Incorrect.

***
I wish to take on=
e Alphabet which has made me wonder for a long time but i never tried to se=
riously find out.

The Alphabet is "Shree" or "Sree" in Devanagari script o=
f Sanskrit. There are many who say it as "Shree" and still many who call it=
 as "Sree".

***
one more alphabet which is "Ti" or "Thi" which comes at th=
e end in "Ganapati". Now which is correct one? is it "Thi" or "Ti". As i kn=
ow that Sanskrit has different alphabets for "Ta" & "Tha". So one should sa=
y Ganapati or Ganapathi?


Which is the most correct pronunciation? Any kno=
wledge from any learned one.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 "yaat" or "yaak" or "yaan". It is possible if one listens carefully, but o=

 sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.
