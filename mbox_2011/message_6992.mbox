Don't worry about it. If someone is discouraged from doing homam b=
ased on your 
mail, Mother must have a reason to discourage that person. Th=
ere is no point in 
thinking too much about things that cannot be figured o=
ut by thinking.
 
Also, all these cases will help us refine the documents f=
or the benefit of 
others to come.
 
If one has cancer and one starts chemo=
therapy in early stages, it works well. If 
cancer is in advanced stages, o=
ne may not respond to chemotherapy at all. 
Similarly, one with too heavy k=
armas that are ripe for fructification may 
experience them despite homam o=
r any other sadhana. But one whose bad karmas are 
not in an advanced stage=
 of ripening may escape their fruits with sadhana. This 
is likely the issu=
e, but we'll try to figure out if there is something else.

Actually, take nobody's words as "final words". Only god=
 can have the final 
words. 

  
*        *        * 
  
If one is experien=
cing material setbacks while doing homam, there are a few 
possibilities: 
=

  
(1) Very likely, one is carrying really serious karmas and was destined=
 to 
experience the setbacks during that period anyway. Homam (or other sad=
hana) made 
it better, though one has no way of confirming it. 

  
(2) One=
 is using some wrong materials, e.g. black pepper, mustard seeds, 
chillies=
 etc. It could also be correct materials, but with corrption, e.g. some 
se=
same seeds or grains with dirt in them, coconut/wood with insects in them, =

etc. If one is doing a sattwik homam for spiritual progress, these things =
are 
tolerated. But, if one is doing with some desires and expectations 
(c=
onscious/sub-conscious), then material errors can have material consequence=
s. 
This is why I keep emphasizing on devotion, surrender etc. With surrend=
er and 
devotion, material errors lose their significance. 

  
(3) Deity i=
s coming close to a person and testing the person's faith thoroughly. 
If t=
his is the case, there can be serious problems, but the person's life is 
t=
ransformed after the person succeeds in keeping the faith. 

  
If one cann=
ot withstand the testing, one can consider a different deity. As 
pointed o=
ut earlier and below, Ganapathi homam is one ritual that balances the 
mate=
rial and spiritual needs. One makes spiritual progress without destabilizin=
g 
the material life. For most people, Ganapathi homam is appropriate for a=
tleast a 
few months in the beginning. 

  
*        *        * 
  
Unforty=
unately, one cannot tell exactly what is going on. Just to be sure, send 
m=
e a private mail with the list of materials you are offering. Also, if some=
one 
can videotape the homam that you do and you can mail me the video, I c=
an take a 
look at it and see if there is any gross procedural error.

    Hi Priya, 

Note - givi=
ng my 2 cents since similar thing happened to me also. I am also 
waiting P=
VRs reply. In any case take his words as final words. 


Similar kind of un=
fortunate thing happened to me also after doing 21 vishnu 
sahastranaam hom=
am. 


I strongly believe that getting inspired by PVR we have in a way jum=
p started 
the spiritual side by doing homams. (They are powerful) PVR had =
already lot of 
sadhana (i believe for 4-5yrs) before he met his guru and s=
tarted with homams. 


Noone knows the exact theory and i beleive that such=
 things are not in ones 
chart also. Even i was worried like you to get my =
chart analysed and know the 
reason but 3-4 astrologers couldnt tell me the=
 reason. i came to understand that 
chart is a map not a territory. 


PVR =
also has mentioned that its better if people do Ganapti homam for first 2-3=
 
months. I will request PVR to add this information in each and every manu=
al and 
also to suggest some non homam sadhana of ganapati so that people w=
ho are eager 
to start their journey can have a beautiful start to their sa=
dhana. 


Priya, you can stop the homams and get confortable and confident =
first. Dont 
attach any guilt to not doing homams. No god is out there to p=
unish you, its 
just that karmas are extremely complex. Its better to start=
 with ganapati to 
remove all obstacles first. 


I can strongly suggest fe=
w ganapati sadhana. 

1. Ganapati Homam 
(This is no doubt very powerful an=
d i suggest this one for everyone but for al 
those who for any reason cant=
 do homam, please start sincerely with some 
non-homam sadhana) 


2. Ganap=
ati tarpan 
Use ganapati mool mantra 444 times for 40 days. (takes around 4=
0min)

3. Variations in Ga=

a. Instead of turmeric mound in the sadhana listed above you =
can keep ganapti

b. I simply chooze to visualise ganapati a=

c. =
As PVR has said many times before that sincerity and devotion are the key a=

4. I am on 30th day of this ganapti tarpan s=
