Dear list - I have done my first chandi homam at home today, technically no=
t the first; but the first I have done on my own from the homam manual :-)
=

The introductory part took just less than an hour; the main part almost 2 =
hours 30 mins, the poornahuti, etc 30 more mins; so overall 4 hours.

The o=
nly miss has been, that I missed to offer any bigger naivEdyam than what I =
offer every day; every day I offer sugar crystals. 

On that note, last wee=
k, when I was watching sundara kAnda videos of Sh Chaganti where he mention=
s any sloka in any of the purAnAs that ends with "ha" has deeper meanings a=
nd should be read slowly to understand it. There is one in the eighth chapt=
er, would love the deeper insights to that, if any of you know.

regards
