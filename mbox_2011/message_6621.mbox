The famous disciples of Shankara, Sureswaracharya, Padmapada, Hastamalaka a=
nd Trotaka became the disseminators of upanishadic and Vedantic knowledge a=
ll over the four quarters of Hindustan! Glory to all of them! Among the lat=
er sannyasins, Sage Vidyaranya ranks the foremost. He kept up the light of =
Advaita even in the midst of political bloodshed and suffering in the count=
ry. Next to Shankara and his direct disciples, none is so famous in the his=
tory of sannyasa and Vedanta as Swami Vidyaranya, the disciple of Swami Sha=
nkarananda. The commentary on the Bhagavad Gita written by Shankarananda is=
 a boon to the sannyasins. It is specially meant for the sannyasins. It is =
purely a sannyasic interpretation of the Gita.
