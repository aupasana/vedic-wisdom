Dear Sir,

i very glad to read what u have writtien.

my daughter name is J=
ayashree. She is born in Singapore on 29/09/2009 at
1.45am (singapore time)=
.


Like you said i dislike the idea of blowing of the candles..but sadly i=
 was
forced to blow off the candle on her 1st bday which we did in a lavish=
 way,
But i dont think so i gonna practice this for the sake of other races=
.

 i remember i attend a friend bday.  they made the child to blow the can=
dles
but then beside the cake they lit up a candle n they nvr blow it.   i =
was
thinking is this a new way to please other races and also dont let go o=
f our
belief. do u think its a right think to do?

Mr sreenivas and you hav=
e been talking abt Tithi.  can you please enlighten
me abt what is Tithi?  =
And yes i am intrested to know the procedure of
invoking a fire for my chil=
d.


All this years, i have visited temple, pray for all well beings and re=
cited
sm god songs and faithfully take part in all important occasions such=
 as
vinaygar churthi, adi,  krisna jayaanthi etc.

but now i could like to =
go further...and learn more..so that i can teach my
child too.

anyway i ha=
ve attached my daughter's pic.  Juz for sharing my happines with
you guys.
