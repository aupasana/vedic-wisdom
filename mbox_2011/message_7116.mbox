 What remains to be done by the man who is pure awareness and has abandoned=

everything that can be expressed in words from the highest heaven to the
e=
arth itself? 18.69

The pure man who has experienced the Indescribable atta=
ins peace by virtue
of his very nature, realising that all this is nothing =
but illusion, and
that nothing is. 18.70

There are no rules, dispassion, r=
enunciation, or meditation for one who is
pure receptivity by nature, and a=
dmits no knowable form of being. 18.71

For him who shines with the radianc=
e of Infinity and is not subject to
natural causality there is neither bond=
age, liberation, pleasure, nor pain.
18.72

Pure illusion reigns in samsara=
 which will continue until self-realisation,
but the enlightened man lives =
in the beauty of freedom from me and mine,
from the sense of responsibility=
 and from any attachment. 18.73

For the seer who knows himself as imperish=
able and beyond pain there is
neither knowledge, a world, nor the sense tha=
t I am the body or the body
mine. 18.74

No sooner does a man of low intell=
igence give up activities like the
elimination of thought than he falls int=
o mind racing and chatter. 18.75

A fool does not get rid of his stupidity =
even on hearing the truth. He may
appear outwardly free from imaginations, =
but inside he is still hankering
after the senses. 18.76

Though in the eye=
s of the world he is active, the man who has shed action
through knowledge =
finds no means of doing or speaking anything. 18.77

For the wise man who i=
s always unchanging and fearless there is neither
darkness nor light nor de=
struction nor anything. 18.78

There is neither fortitude, prudence, nor co=
urage for the yogi whose nature
is beyond description and free of individua=
lity. 18.79

There is neither heaven nor hell nor even liberation during li=
fe. In a
nutshell, in the sight of the seer nothing exists at all. 18.80

H=
e neither longs for possessions nor grieves at their absence. The calm mind=

of the sage is full of the nectar of immortality. 18.81

The dispassionate=
 man does not praise the good or blame the wicked. Content
and equal in pai=
n and pleasure, he sees nothing that needs doing. 18.82

The wise man is no=
t averse to samsara, nor does he seek to know himself.
Free from pleasure a=
nd impatience, he is not dead and he is not alive. 18.83

The wise man exce=
ls by being free from anticipation, without attachment to
such things as ch=
ildren or wives, free from desire for the senses,and not
even concerned abo=
ut his own body. 18.84

The wise man, who lives on whatever happens to come=
 to him, roams wherever
he pleases, and sleeps wherever the sun happens to =
set, is at peace
everywhere. 18.85

Whether his body rises or falls, the gr=
eat-souled one gives it no thought,
having forgotten all about samsara in c=
oming to rest on the ground of his
true nature. 18.86

The wise man has the=
 joy of being complete in himself and without
possessions, acting as he ple=
ases, free from duality and rid of doubts, and
without attachment to any cr=
eature. 18.87

The wise man excels in being without the sense of "me". Eart=
h, a stone, or
gold are the same to him. The knots of his heart have been r=
ent asunder, and
he is freed from greed and blindness. 18.88

Who can compa=
re with that contented, liberated soul who pays no regard to
anything and h=
as no desire left in his heart? 18.89

Who but the upright man without desi=
re knows without knowing, sees without
seeing, and speaks without speaking?=
 18.90

Beggar or king, he excels who is without desire, and whose opinion =
of things
is rid of "good" and "bad." 18.91

There is neither dissolute beh=
aviour nor virtue, nor even discrimination of
the truth for the sage who ha=
s reached the goal and is the very embodiment
of guileless sincerity. 18.92=


That which is experienced within by one who is desireless and free from
p=
ain, and content to rest in himself -- how could it be described, and of
wh=
om? 18.93

The wise man who is contented in all circumstances is not asleep=
 even in
deep sleep, nor sleeping in a dream, nor waking when he is awake. =
18.94

The seer is without thoughts even when thinking, without senses amon=
g the
senses, without understanding even in understanding, and without a se=
nse of
responsibility even in the ego. 18.95

Neither happy nor unhappy, ne=
ither detached nor attached, neither seeking
liberation nor liberated, he i=
s neither something nor nothing. 18.96

Not distracted in distraction, in m=
ental stillness not poised, in stupidity
not stupid, that blessed one is no=
t even wise in his wisdom. 18.97

The liberated man is self-possessed in al=
l circumstances and free from the
idea of "done" and "still to do." He is t=
he same wherever he is and without
greed. He does not dwell on what he has =
done or not done. 18.98

He is not pleased when praised nor upset when blam=
ed. He is not afraid of
death nor attached to life. 18.99

A man at peace d=
oes not run off to popular resorts or to the forest.
Whatever and wherever,=
 he remains the same. 18.100

Using the tweezers of the know=
ledge of the truth I have managed to extract
the painful thorn of endless o=
pinions from the recesses of my heart. 19.1

For me, established in my own =
glory, there are no religious obligations,
sensuality, possessions, philoso=
phy, duality, or even nonduality. 19.2

For me established in my own glory,=
 there is no past, future, or present.
There is no space or even eternity. =
19.3

For me established in my own glory, there is no self or non-self, no =
good or
evil, no thought or even absence of thought. 19.4

For me establish=
ed in my own glory, there is no dreaming or deep sleep, no
waking nor fourt=
h state beyond them, and certainly no fear. 19.5

For me established in my =
own glory, there is nothing far away and nothing
near, nothing within or wi=
thout, nothing large and nothing small. 19.6

For me established in my own =
glory, there is no life or death, no worlds or
things of this world, no dis=
traction and no stillness of mind. 19.7

For me remaining in myself, there =
is no need for talk of the three goals of
life, of yoga or of knowledge. 19=

Janaka said:

In my unblemished nature there are no elements, no body,=
 no faculties, no
mind. There is no void and no despair. 20.1

For me, free=
 from the sense of dualism, there are no scriptures, no
self-knowledge, no =
mind free from an object, no satisfaction and no freedom
from desire. 20.2
=

There is no knowledge or ignorance, no "me," "this," or "mine," no bondage=
,
no liberation, and no property of self-nature. 20.3

For him who is alway=
s free from individual characteristics there is no
antecedent causal action=
, no liberation during life, and no fulfilment at
death. 20.4

For me, free=
 from individuality, there is no doer and no reaper of the
consequences, no=
 cessation of action, no arising of thought, no immediate
object, and no id=
ea of results. 20.5

There is no world, no seeker for liberation, no yogi, =
no seer, no one bound
and no one liberated. I remain in my own nondual natu=
re. 20.6

There is no emanation or return, no goal, means, seeker or achiev=
ement. I
remain in my own nondual nature. 20.7

For me who am forever unble=
mished, there is no assessor, no standard,
nothing to assess, and no assess=
ment. 20.8

For me who am forever actionless, there is no distraction or on=
e-pointedness
of mind, no lack of understanding, no stupidity, no joy and n=
o sorrow. 20.9

For me who am always free from deliberations there is neith=
er conventional
truth nor absolute truth, no happiness and no suffering. 20=
.10

For me who am forever pure there is no illusion, no samsara, no attach=
ment
or detachment, no living organism, and no God. 20.11

For me who am fo=
rever unmovable and indivisible, established in myself,
there is no activit=
y or inactivity, no liberation and no bondage. 20.12

For me who am blessed=
 and without limitation, there is no initiation or
scripture, no disciple o=
r teacher, and no goal of human life. 20.13

There is no being or non-being=
, no unity or dualism. What more is there to
say? There is nothing outside =
of me. 20.14
