Narasimha Ji

I was just amazed at some of the prescient observations you h=
ad made last year about change coming to the world with the news of the Kal=
ahasti dome collapsing. You had foreseen that this indicates a disturbance =
in the air element of the world and that changes would be coming.

Within m=
onths of that BP spill happenned in the gulf coast of Usa impacting many li=
feforms.

Lately these news articles came out unrelated to that incident.Th=
ousands and Thousands of birds are dropping dead at various places over the=
 world.This is no conspiracy theory and is being covered by major news outl=
ets.So far science is attempting some explanations with new year firework a=
nd cold temp theories but they do not seem convincing enough.

Your observa=
tions were spot on and probably this is a indication of times to come.
