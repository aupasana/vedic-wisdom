Namaste Sri PVR Garu, 
=C2=A0
as always your posts are something I take ver=
y seriously, as many people in this forum do! However, I have some question=
s and comments. 
=C2=A0
1. While I have no doubt about your point that cast=
es are portable and not determined by birth is a very valid one and hard to=
 argue about, example of Vishwamitra is a far better one than that of Valmi=
ki! The reason being, as Sri Chaganti Koteshwara Rao, an eminent scholar in=
 his 42 day Ramayana Pravachanam says, Valmiki is not a tribal by birth but=
 he is Son of Prachetana, a brahmin of Bharadwajasa Gotra and his name was =
Agni Sarma! How he became a hunter and eventually became a great sage is a =
different story but I believed that he=C2=A0was not a sudra by birth, based=
 on his lectures. 
=C2=A0
2. Also he goes on to say that his Disciple Bhara=
dwaja is not the same as the Bharadwaja of Saptarishi set! Agni Sarma himse=
lf (Valmiki's original name) is of Bharadwajasa Gotra, according to him! It=
 is quite possible that even in olden days, different people shared the sam=
e name! I would like to hear your views on this. 
=C2=A0
I am completely in=
 agreement that homam is a very powerful sadhana and ever since I started d=
oing it daily ( from the last fifteen days), I can see that my confidence i=
n handling everything has increased manifold! I am just doing Ganapathi hom=
am along with Sandhya vandanam and I find this practise a pretty beautiful =
one. But I am not able to control my anger at all! I am very short tempered=
 person and cannot tolerate delays and keep yelling at my kids and wife a l=
ot! I am not seeing that homam is helping me there, but I just enjoy the ri=
tual itself and keep thinking that my clarity is increasing because of this=
. I had quite a few material setbacks but keep thing that my bad karma is g=
etting burnt and never doubted the positive effects of homam for a minute! =
Please let me know if my thinking is right!

Namaste Srini=
vas,
=C2=A0
I am glad you are doing homam and overcame drinking, smoking et=
c. It is very inspiring and can inspire others too to overcome weaknesses. =
Overcoming external weaknesses such as drinking, smoking, drugs etc and int=
ernal weaknesses such as lust, anger, jealosy etc, is the true sign of one'=
s progress with a sadhana. You are definitely on the right path and keep go=
ing!
=C2=A0
As Vimalananda says, nature conspires to help one who truly wan=
ts to learn and do a sadhana!

=C2=A0
As some people =
have already pointed out, one's varna is decided by one's aptitude and atti=
tude. Valmiki must've been a great brahmin in previous lives, but some karm=
as made him take birth as a shoodra and eventually his original samskaras t=
ook over and he became a brahmin, a rishi and a maharshi. He even taught br=
ahma jnana to Bharadwaja, one of the saptarshis!
=C2=A0
Similarly, if one i=
s drawn to fire, does homam over a period of time and overcomes some weakne=
sses, obviously strong samskaras are present from previous lives. If they a=
re allowed to dominate, one will make progress. One becomes a true brahmana=
 with sadhana. As one realizes true knowledge internally, one may even beco=
me worthy of teaching spiritual knowledge to others, including brahmanas by=
 birth!

Not only non-brahmins from India, but =
people not born in India/Hinduism are doing homam regularly. Some of them a=
re (will be) making great progess too. As a result, a strong Brahmin (true!=
) class will be established across the world and that will increase dharma =
on earth.
=C2=A0
Just yesterday night, one Russian origin CS professor from=
 Canada who was in Boston as a visiting scholar at MIT came to my house and=
 learned homam. He did Ganapathi homam at my house with my help and plans t=
o do it in Canada. He has Jupiter in Pisces in 12th house and I got a nice =
feeling when he was doing homam. There were also several good omens, making=
 me think he is relatively well-prepared for sadhana.

=
This homam movement is in nascent stages yet. Once a critical mass of sadha=
kas accumulates and people start making progress, it will spread like a wil=
dfire. There is no hurry and there is need to feel pressure, for these thin=
gs happen due to the will of higher beings. We are all merely instruments.
=
=C2=A0
I tend to think that there are blessings of some great saints/yogis =
behind this. When we did Shata Chandi homam at Chennai in March 2006, we ca=
sually selected a muhurta for the sankalpa of the week-long ritual, so that=
 maha-poornahuti happens on an Ashtami day. It was during this week that Ma=
nish received a command from the divine Mother to spread homam. When I and =
Manish took the sankalpa at the temple on the first day, it was Ramakrishna=
 Paramahamsa's lunar birthday and it was within 5 min from the exact time w=
hen the angle between Sun and Moon matched that at his birth. When I starte=
d daily homam about 5-6 months later, as a precursor to publishing the manu=
als a few months later, there was another coincidence. It was exactly 120 l=
unar years since Ramakrishna left his physical body. Moreover, I had a visi=
on of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa a day before Manish had the vision of divine =
Mother, during that week of Shata Chandi at the Kali temple in Chennai. I
 =
am not attached to forms and I rarely get visions.
=C2=A0
Several months be=
fore that, in late 2005, I had an interesting dream that actually felt real=
 (i.e. not like a dream). In the dream, there was a strong and pleasant naa=
d (buzz) that used to accompany my Kundalini rises through sushumna during =
those days. It was dark and there was a huge fire. I was sitting in front o=
f the fire. A person with a powerful persona, whom I had never seen before,=
 sat in front of me. He was teaching me some yoga involving fire and what y=
oga means etc. He taught several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed in=
to Manish. Then shakti came down, naad stopped, "dream" ended, and I was aw=
are of my body lying on bed. The face of the person I saw was vivid in my m=
ind. I did not know who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish a week or =
two later. He said he did not know who it was, but asked me a week later to=
 check out the photo of a specific yogi. When I did a search on the interne=
t, I found a photo (apparently the only photo
 available of that yogi). It =
looked very close to what I saw in my dream, except that the person in my d=
ream seemed like a slightly younger version of that photo. This was a famou=
s yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never seen his phot=
o before that or read much about that lineage or their teachings, his comin=
g in my dream was strange. Also, teaching me some yoga involving fire was s=
trange, because homam movement did not start then and I was not thinking of=
 fire or fire ritual at all.
=C2=A0
There are some signs like this, which m=
ake me think that we are being used as instruments in a big "project" desig=
ned by some great yogis in higher realms. It seems to me like this project =
has an important purpose and will help MANY people in their quest for god, =
in the coming decades and centuries.

There are many more to list.. I am (we are) really blessed t=

Thank you,

e angle between Sun and Moon matched that at his birth. When I started dail=
y homam about 5-6 months later, as a precursor to publishing the manuals a =
few months later, there was another coincidence. It was exactly 120 lunar y=
ears since Ramakrishna left his physical body. Moreover, I had a vision of =
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa a day before Manish had the vision of divine Mother=
, during that
 week of Shata Chandi at the Kali temple in Chennai. I am not=
 attached to forms and I rarely get visions.</FONT></DIV>

re that, in late 2005, I had an interesting dream that actually felt real (=
i.e. not like a dream). In the dream, there was a strong and pleasant naad =
(buzz) that used to accompany my Kundalini rises through sushumna during th=
ose days. It was dark and there was a huge fire. I was sitting in front of =
the fire. A person with a powerful persona, whom I had never seen before, s=
at in front of me. He was teaching me some yoga involving fire and what yog=
a means etc. He taught several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed into=
 Manish. Then shakti came down, naad stopped, "dream" ended, and I was awar=
e of my body lying on bed. The face of the person I saw was vivid in my min=
d. I did not know who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish a week or tw=
o later. He said he did not know who it was, but asked me a week later to c=
heck out the photo of a specific yogi. When I did a search on the
 internet=
, I found a photo (apparently the only photo available of that yogi). It lo=
oked very close to what I saw in my dream, except that the person in my dre=
am seemed like a slightly younger version of that photo. This was a famous =
yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never seen his photo =
before that or read much about that lineage or their teachings, his coming =
in my dream was strange. Also, teaching me some yoga involving fire was str=
ange, because homam movement did not start then and I was not thinking of f=
ire or fire ritual at all.</FONT></DIV>
