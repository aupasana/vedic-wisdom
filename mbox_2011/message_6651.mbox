Namaste,

Thank you for framing your answer that way.  It's sad in a way...=
when I was a teenager and then into my 20's I trusted in God (in the form o=
f Sri Hanuman) to "take care of everything" and I always seemed to go smoot=
hly thru life, even in difficult times.  I'm not sure why - there is no log=
ical reason, but in my 30's and now in my 40's it seems like I have less an=
d less faith.  I wonder if I could go back and re-instill the simple faith =
of my youth...

D Raj
