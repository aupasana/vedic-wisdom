Dear Sri Narasimhagaru, 
=C2=A0
This is an important topic and you took up =
something which is really useful to all of us. I have already implemented s=
ome of the recommendations you made, most importantly the mantra "Gananam T=
va Ganapatim HAVAMAHE" from your jyotish lectures back in 2004/2005! 
=C2=
=A0
In the recent times I was pondering about how north Indians speak Hindi=
, where they reduce most of the words to "Halanthas", like "Shiv", "Ram", "=
Krishn" and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a =
consonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by the Vowel. But fo=
r whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry that=
 habit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the North Ind=
ian bhajan singers (I don't know the name) singing Adi Sankara's Bhaja Govi=
ndam as "Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE", which so=
unded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj B=
hasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them "Ramacharita Manasa" is mo=
re important than even Valmiki's Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also w=
ithout proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that ap=
proach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like "Sri Gurucharana Saroja
 raj=
a" should be pronounced exactly like that and not like "Sri Gurucharan saro=
j raj". You may shed more light on this aspect as well.

akshara. If you change it into "yaattu" or "yaatu" by adding a vowel sound =

kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce "t" a=
s is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and th=
e listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life forc=
e.

t" has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara "yaa" (which has=

s, "yaat" is considered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce "yaat" co=
rrectly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you said=
 "yaat" or "yaak" or "yaan". It is possible if one listens carefully, but o=
therwise difficult. The "t" at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient=
 sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.

. Probably, that became a standard practice after a couple of centuries.

You don't force an vowel sound to be added at the end. The same thing holds=
 for "t" in "prachodayaat".

That is also wrong.

ha" (as in "kathaa" =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as "dha" =
(as in "dhana" =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of th=

(fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment)". Most people end u=
