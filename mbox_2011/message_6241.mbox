 537 The power there is in the silence of the Guru is immeasurable. Hence,
=
teaching by silence is the highest there is. In this way alone does the
asp=
irant=E2=80=99s mind obtain peace.

There is the question about initiation.=
 What is true initiation?

538 It is said that initiation is of three forms=
, namely, looking, thinking
and touching with the hand. But the highest ini=
tiation consists of the Guru
remaining in the supreme silence. So says our =
Guru.

The supreme state is called silence.

539 Because that state is taug=
ht by silence, and also because it is attained
by remaining in silence, it =
is called silence. The sage is in silence
always, even when he speaks.

The=
 last statement is difficult to understand. It will be better understood
wh=
en Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching about the natural state (sahaja samadhi) is
=
explained.
This enlightenment is the subject of many questions. One of thes=
e is, =E2=80=98Will
it remain permanent, or will it be lost later?=E2=80=99=


540 That eternal state is ever shining by the light of the sun of
conscio=
usness, the real Self. After realising it, there is no possibility of
swerv=
ing from that natural state of the Self due to forgetfulness.

The reason i=
s that when right awareness dawns by following the direct path,
the ego and=
 mind merge and are once and for all lost in that Self. It is
otherwise whe=
n some sort of bliss is experienced as a result of yoga. Yoga
by itself doe=
s not lead up to egolessness.

Does the world survive after the egolessness=
 is established?

541 The statement of the vedantic text that the Self swal=
lows up the moving
and the unmoving, means that the world, which is only da=
rkness, is consumed
by the effulgence of that Self.

The Upanishads thus cl=
early state that the world, being only darkness,
cannot possibly survive in=
 the presence of the light of right awareness.

The very same truth has bee=
n expressed by Bhagavan in the first verse of his
Arunachala Pancharatnam, =
which is paraphrased here.

542 The essential nature of the Self has been s=
ung by Guru Bhagavan in the
following words: =E2=80=98The Supreme Self, nam=
ed Arunachalesa [The Lord of
Arunachala], shines alone without a second, ha=
ving swallowed this
solid-seeming universe by his own consciousness-light.=
=E2=80=99

This confirms the statement that creation is composed of darknes=
s
(ignorance) alone, and has no substantial reality even now, when ignoranc=
e
and ego are rampant.

An inaccuracy of statement that is unavoidably made=
 is corrected.

543 The statement that the Self, by attaining oneness with =
Brahman, becomes
freed from the bondage of samsara is not true, because the=
 Self never fell
from its true state.

544 Just as white cloth does not acq=
uire a new whiteness, whiteness being
its nature, so the Self does not beco=
me Brahman because the Self is
eternally Brahman by nature.

It is said tha=
t for creating the world Brahman itself became the Self when
entering the c=
reated bodies. This only means that the Self is never other
than Brahman.
C=
ertain expressions, freely used to designate the sage, are next critically
=
viewed.

545 Two names are commonly in use to designate the sage, namely =
=E2=80=98Knower of
Brahman=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Knower of the Self=E2=80=
=99. Since the sage is himself Brahman, as
well as the Self, how can they b=
ecome known to the sage?

Neither of the two, which are identical with each=
 other, can become the
object of knowledge. The Self, as the eternal subjec=
t, is not an object to
be known, and Brahman is therefore not an object. Th=
e unknowability of
Brahman is due to its being the Self. So the terms, take=
n literally, are
inapplicable. What then are their proper meanings?

546 To=
 be free of the notion =E2=80=98I am not Brahman=E2=80=99 is itself the kno=
wing of
Brahman. Freedom from the notion that anything not the Self is the =
Self is
the correct knowing of the Self.

The reason is given next.

547 Wh=
en, by making the quest of one=E2=80=99s Self, one becomes consumed, like
f=
ood, by that supreme one, how can anyone survive as separate from it and
st=
ill be called a sage.
The use of some word or other to designate one that h=
as found the Self after
sadhana is necessary and inevitable. But since in t=
his case the success of
the quest involves the loss of the unreal individua=
lity of the seeker,
practically all the words available are objectionable a=
s implying something
not true.

Another reason, shown next, is that the sta=
te is advaitic.

548 How can one, after experiencing the truth of non-duali=
ty [in that
supreme state], remain separate from the Supreme Being? For tha=
t state has
been styled, by Sri Krishna, himself, the supreme one, as merge=
r into
Brahman.

By this merger there is the loss of individuality.

549 In=
 the sacred lore the sage is described in the same terms that Brahman
itsel=
f is described. Since the true nature of Brahman is pure, supreme
conscious=
ness, the true nature of the sage is not different.

This is what Bhagavan =
has to say on this point:

550 =E2=80=98Since no one has two selves, it fol=
lows that the sayings =E2=80=9CI know
myself=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CI do not=
 know myself=E2=80=9D are both ridiculously nonsensical. The
Self never bec=
omes an object to be known.=E2=80=99 Such is the statement made by the
most=
 holy one [Sri Ramana].

It may be asked why that state is one of non-duali=
ty. The answer is the
following.

551 This state of being one=E2=80=99s own=
 true Self, freed from all limiting
superimpositions, is called the state o=
f non-duality, because in that state
the supreme sole reality, the infinite=
 Brahman, is not other than that Self.

An incidental question is whether t=
he state of non-duality came into
existence for the first time at the end o=
f the quest, or had been existing
all along?

552 The state of the non-dual=
, real Self, experienced by the sage who
attains the supreme state, is not =
the fruit of the practice of sadhana. It
is the eternal nature of that Self=
.

The following view, held by some, is next stated and discussed.

553 Som=
e say that this duality will remain real as long as one is engaged in
pract=
ising sadhana, but that when the goal is reached, non-duality will come
int=
o being by the extinction of the duality.

These thinkers seek to reconcile=
 the dvaitic and advaitic teachings.

554 These men do not know the truth o=
f the transcendental state beyond time,
in which the world has not come int=
o being. Non-duality has neither
beginning nor end. Duality, with space and=
 time, is unreal, always.

Here, the whole discussion about the world and t=
he teaching of non-becoming
are relevant, and also the discussion whether b=
ondage is real, which comes
later.

What then is the use of the sadhana?

5=
55 In the sacred lore it is said, =E2=80=98By the extinction of ego there i=
s, for
the aspirant to deliverance, cessation of his delusion=E2=80=99. Wha=
t is real cannot
be destroyed by right awareness, nor will anything unreal =
shine as real in
the supreme state.
The extreme doctrine of the dvaitins is=
 next stated and refuted.

556 The conclusion [of the dvaitins] that this d=
uality is always real, that
it will not cease to exist even when right awar=
eness dawns, and that
non-duality will never be achieved, is much farther a=
way for the aspirant
[than the one stated before].

What Bhagavan says on t=
his point is next set forth.

557 Both when it is being sought by the quest=
 =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 and when it is
realised, the Self is non-dual =
and ever real, just as the tenth man was
there all along, even when he was =
being sought.

The reference here is to a parable of the loss and the findi=
ng of the tenth
man in a party of ten. The ten, while travelling, crossed a=
 river and then,
one by one, they counted the members to see whether all ha=
d safely crossed
over. But as each one counted only the others, leaving him=
self out, they
believed that one, the tenth man, was lost. They were bewail=
ing the loss
when a passer-by saw them and asked them the cause of their so=
rrow. When he
was told, he counted them and found all the ten were there. H=
e convinced
them of this truth by making them count the blows he would give=
 all of them.
There were ten blows and this convinced the men.

558 Those w=
ho have understood, as taught in Mandukya, the truth of the
non-becoming of=
 the supreme reality, will not be perplexed by these theories
of the ignora=
nt, because they are firmly convinced of the true nature of the
Supreme Bei=
ng.
563 Since the real Self is all that is, when that Self is won, nothing
=
remains for the sage to be won. Hence, in the sacred lore the sage is as on=
e
who has attained and enjoyed all objects of desire and is, therefore,
des=
ireless, just like God Himself.
It must be remembered that God is really im=
personal, as Brahman, so that the
personal God is only a modification of it=
.

564 Viveka Chudamani asks, =E2=80=98How can one who has experienced the =
truth of his
own Self identify with his body and suffer from desiring objec=
ts? Who is
there left to desire?=E2=80=99 This revelation shows that for th=
e sage desires do
not arise.

565 Only that man has desires who identifies =
himself with the body.But the
sage has become free from the thought =E2=80=
=98I am the body=E2=80=99. The sage looks upon
his own body as if it were t=
he body of another.

The first sentence in the above is a quotation from th=
e Viveka Chudamani.
Another powerful reason is that the sage is by nature e=
ternally happy with
the bliss of the real Self. This has been stated and ex=
plained before.

But the bliss of the sage does not cause bondage, as is sh=
own next.

566 In the supreme state there is no tasting of bliss, for there=
 the sense
of being happy or miserable cannot arise. Since in that state th=
ere are no
pairs of opposites, the bliss of the sage has no similarities to=
 the
pleasures and miseries of samsara.

The explanation is that while, in =
samsara, pleasures are from external
objects, in the natural state the blis=
s is the very nature of the Self, who
is identical with Parabrahman.

This =
difference is related to another, which is dealt with next.
