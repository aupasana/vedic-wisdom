In Aghora book 2, Vimalananda says chanting for spiritual progress during e=
clipse is 1000 times powerful.
Imagine getting 1000 times bonus for a limit=
ed period, I would definitely invest during such a window.

Vimalananda ten=
ds to exaggerate sometimes, but whatever be the case, the additional benefi=
t of chanting during this period cannot be ruled out.

June 15 lunar eclips=
e lasts from 11:32 pm to 2:32 am
Having food well in advance of that window=
 will help to get all of body's fire into bhootagni to focus and digest God=
 during this window

Regards,
Srikanth
