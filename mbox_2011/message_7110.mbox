Aurobindo put it beautifully

" Maya is real, because it is the Self's expe=
rience of the Self".

The word Maya carries with it a devastating simplicit=
y of nullification.

To the dreamer the dream is real. Only when he wakes t=
o the Waking state, he calls it a dream. Similarly Rishies when they rise t=
o the Fourth, the Transcendental Consciousness, become aware that Jagrat wa=
s as real as the dream.

   =
 
  Namaste,

  I am cc'ing the reply to vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, without r=
evealing your 
  identity.

  I (@homam108) tweeted on twitter a few days b=
ack:

  >> Jagat isnt mithya. Brahman is satya & jagat 2 is satya.
  >> Nei=
ther mirror nor ur image in it r "illusions". They r "real". But 
  >> ur t=
hinking 1/2
  >> that ur image in mirror is ur extension is an illusion.
  =
>> Excitement/sadness abt things happenin 2 d mirror image is an 
  >> illu=
sion.2/2

  The following question was asked by private email:

  > Can you=
 please clarify the concept of satya & non-mithya in light of
  > Vasishtha=
's words in Yoga Vasishtha (2.3.11 - 2.3.18)?

  * * *

  Obviously my twee=
ts were from a limited context. To say that jagat is 
  satya is, strictly =
speaking, against scripture. When my mind making 
  these statements and yo=
ur mind trying to absorb them are part of this 
  jagat, what is the point =
in declaring that jagat is mithya, even if that 
  were true? It sends the =
message "all this is an illusion and so whatever 
  I do does not matter". =
Instead, my message is "this is not an illusion 
  and real. But you are co=
rrupting the reality with illusions. Weed out 
  the illusions." Once someo=
ne actually starts to weed out all obvious 
  illusions, eventually one rea=
lizes that everything other than 
  unconditioned Self is an illusion anywa=
y.

  * * *

  So I took the approach of accepting that the world is a real=
ity and then 
  rejecting things that can be deduced to be illusions.

  Fo=
r example, let me assume that "I, Narasimha Rao, an individual being 
  in =
this world" is not an illusion and a valid and true entity. I can 
  first =
accept it to be real and then start analyzing various extensions 
  of that=
 entity. For example, people's views on this entity are formed 
  based on =
an impression/reflection of this entity in their minds, which 
  is influen=
ced by this entity to some extent, but not fully. Just as my 
  reflection =
in different mirrors may look different based on the colors, 
  dust, refra=
ctive properties etc of the mirrors etc, my reflection in 
  different mind=
s may be different. Just as I cannot think that my 
  reflections in all mi=
rrors around me are extensions of myself and start 
  celebrating or ruing =
anything happeneing to those reflections, so should 
  I not think that my =
reflections in the minds of people around me are 
  extensions of myself an=
d start celebrating or ruing anything happening 
  to those reflections!

 =
 Thus, I can reject a lot of notions that I may tend to hang on to, as an 
=
  illusion. This is what I am saying above. I may not be an illusion, a 
  =
mirror (mind of someone) may not be an illusion, my image in the mirror 
  =
(that person's notion of who I am) may not be an illusion, BUT my 
  thinki=
ng that my image in the mirror is an extension of my personality 
  is an i=
llusion.

  Similarly, we build complicated structures in our own minds reg=
arding 
  various external objects our senses perceive. When senses perceiv=
e those 
  objects, mind thinks of a notional being that is far more compli=
cated 
  than the objective reality represented by it! It is influenced by =
many 
  notions arising in our conditioning and not just based on the concr=
ete 
  objective reality. Again, such notions can be identified and rejecte=
d as 
  illusions.

  As you identify and reject each layer of obvious illu=
sion about your 
  sense of who you are, who/what you are dealing with, you=
 eventually 
  realize unconditioned Self. Until then, "jaganmithya" is a m=
eaningless 
  and also perhaps a dangerous notion.

  Best regards,
  Naras=
