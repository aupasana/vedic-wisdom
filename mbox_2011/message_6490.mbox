This is the gist of all worship =E2=80" to be pure and to do good to others=
. He who sees Shiva in the poor, in the weak, and in the diseased, really w=
orships Shiva; and if he sees Shiva only in the image, his worship is but p=
reliminary. He who has served and helped one poor man seeing Shiva in him, =
without thinking of his caste, or creed, or race, or anything, with him Shi=
va is more pleased than with the man who sees Him only in temples.
