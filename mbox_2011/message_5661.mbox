Overcoming Depression with Meditation

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

"D=
epression is itself only a direct symptomatic manifestation of the radical =
secularization of human society. Previous to secular modernity, depression =
was a much less prevalent phenomenon. And when it was experienced, the reas=
ons were more clearly environmental and causal than they are now. In the pa=
st, depression was directly associated with a specific event or occurrence =
in the person's life that directly caused the depression. Today, however, a=
n increasing number of depressed persons are experiencing more generalized =
depression, a type of general existential angst, the exact cause of which i=
s difficult for them to pinpoint. Some of the leading causes of depression =
today include a sense of meaninglessness; consuming and generalized fear; s=
piritual crises, and the high degrees of stress and anxiety that has become=
 accepted as normal in modern, radically secularized, everyday life. The ul=
timate cure for society's present crisis of depression and meaninglessness =
is to re-embrace a life of meaning, a life of Dharma...."
