sAdar praNAm

I tend to perform short homam at a balcony, and even those are
gradually becoming "smokeless". In lieu of a proper kundam I use a
stainless steel pot as a support for a stainless bowl, and this
particular arrangement proved to be just right viz the smoke problem.
Let me elaborate: the bowl's bottom is not laying on a surface,
instead ti is supported by the bowl's rim, being inserted into a pot,
and hence the bottom gets very hot resulting in better combustion and
less smoke. (at the same time the pot does not get too hot)

The other smoke-free detail is keeping a fuel supply to a minimum,
including the ghee and grains. As a result you get a nice flame and
less smoke. I know, it is difficult not to throw too much, but
practice calms your passion.

Nowadays I get nice and uniform flames, very small amount of smoke and
only a very small amount of cinder at the end of a procedure.

If only my Sanskrit improved that much :lol:
