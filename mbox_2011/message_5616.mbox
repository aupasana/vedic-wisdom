Namaste,

"Such is the pow=
er of Gyaneshwar Maharaj who moulds the consciousness of all who 
go there.=
"

The begger could speak out such a high practical knowledge is very refre=
shing 
but there was the other begger who still looked to be money minded a=
nd suggested 
to beg on Abhangas.

There must be some eligibility to benefi=
t from Sant Gnyaneshwar's grace even 
people living in Alandi around his sa=
madhi sthana. i am sure not everyone would 
think like the begger-saint the=
re.

best regards,
