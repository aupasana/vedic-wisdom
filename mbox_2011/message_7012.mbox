Respected Narasimhaji*

To Yogananda, he said there would be
one more birth=
 and he would be free forever after that.*

As far as I know Swami Yoganand=
a or Yogin Maharaj was the first disciple if
Sri Maa.
Sri Maa had told one =
disciple after Swami Yogananda's passing away that
Thakur had told her Swam=
iji belonged to an amsa of Arjun and she also told
he gave up his life so e=
arly(he was the first among Thakur's sannyasi
disciples to leave the mortal=
 frame) due to the terrible penances he
practiced that took a heavy toll on=
 his physical frame.
This is mentoned in Sri Sri Mayer Katha bengali editio=
n Part 2.
Can you please mention Narasimhaji from where you read the above.=
part.?
Just wanted to know.Nothing otherwise.

      <p>Nama=
ste friends,<br>
<br>
There was a long friendly ;-) exchange between Rajars=
hi and me on Friday <br>
(July 29) on twitter on measuring spiritual calibe=
r. This came from the <br>
context of Rajarshi's comments on the "=
maturity" & "errors" of <br>
Ramakrishna's disciples=
 (regarding their attitude towards Tantra). He <br>
compared them with Vima=
lananda and said their spiritual caliber was of <br>
the scale of 2, while =
Vimalananda's was 2 power 16. He also talked about <br>
the hierarchy o=
f spiritual caliber mentioned by V. I want to share 2 <br>
cents of musings=
 on that.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------<br>
Measuring Spiritual =
Caliber<br>
<br>
Rajarshi, here are a few comments on your statements a cou=
ple of days <br>
back on Twitter comparing spiritual caliber. We can't =
even compare <br>
flowers like hibiscus, rose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus=
 etc & say <br>
which is a better flower. They have different propertie=
s like color, <br>
size, shape, number of petals, type/intensity of smell e=
tc. Relative <br>
values depend on the purpose and they cannot be quantifie=
d universally. <br>
How can any sane person then say that spiritual caliber=
 of different <br>
people can be compared and quanitified? The field of dua=
lity has <br>
infinite variety and the [self-]control of a yogi has infinit=
e aspects <br>
to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual caliber of a person=
 as one <br>
number and compare them.<br>
<br>
Before one even attempts to =
understand Vimalananda's order (Paramahamsa <br>
< Siddha < Natha=
 < Rishi), please note that different hierarchies exist <br>
in scriptur=
es for deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities <br>
where Vishnu=
 is supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where <br>
Shiva is supre=
me. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is <br>
supreme. And =
so on. None of them is absolute. All of them are relative <br>
and for spec=
ific purposes, i.e. from a specific perspective. There are <br>
people who =
take them as absolute and argue that so and so thing taught <br>
by Vishnu =
is superior to so and so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we <br>
know that =
none of the hierarchies is absolute.<br>
<br>
One who has the nerve to thin=
k that one can compare the wisdom of <br>
Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana =
Maharshi, mad devotion of Ramakrishna <br>
Paramahamsa, detached activism o=
f Vivekananda, compassion of Shirdi Sai, <br>
spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khe=
pa, inner clarity of Lahiri Mahashaya, <br>
detachment of Trilinga Swami, p=
urity of Tukaram, humility of Eknath <br>
Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera B=
ai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc, <br>
is a fool of the highest order. =
They can be compared from specific <br>
limited perspectives. In one thing,=
 Tukaram may be superior to all, in <br>
another Jnaneshwar, in another Tri=
linga, in another Ramakrishna, and so <br>
on. You cannot compare in absolu=
te terms. You should not even try to. <br>
You should just appreciate them =
individually and aspire to be like any <br>
of them that you like the most.=
<br>
<br>
Vimalananda's list may be correct from specific perspective. =
More <br>
importantly, his words should make one realize that there is alwa=
ys <br>
scope for further self-control (and the resulting mastery over the =
field <br>
of duality) while one is still embodied. One should never rest a=
nd <br>
aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel and startin=
g to <br>
judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making statements=
 like <br>
"Vimalananda is heavier than all RK's discples put togt=
r" and thinking <br>
that something is absolute truth because Vimalana=
nda is assumed to have <br>
said that (vs someone "lower than him"=
;) is unwise.<br>
<br>
Even if Vimalananda's hierarchy is absolute and =
universal, don't assume <br>
that you can judge the stature of each yog=
i accurately. Because <br>
Ramakrishna was popularly known as a Paramahamsa=
, is he a Paramahamsa as <br>
per Vimalananda's classification or a sid=
dha or a natha or even a rishi? <br>
Or may be a deity? My friend, don'=
t assume you know for sure!!! Based on <br>
the details we know, can we be =
absolutely sure of even Vimalananda's <br>
stature based on his own cla=
ssification?<br>
<br>
You said "Approximating 2 equal to each disciple=
s of ramakrishna. 2exp16 <br>
=3D say Vimalananda. Basic?" You probabl=
y made this statement based on <br>
what you read and heard of Vimalananda.=
 For the sake of argument, it is <br>
not even 100% clear whether he was a =
real person or an imagined <br>
character. Svoboda intentionally (and very =
wisely!) left the latter <br>
option open in the preface of his Aghora book=
!<br>
<br>
If we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use=
 a <br>
simpler definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure o=
f <br>
one's "spiritual caliber", Ramakrishna's disciples=
 fare quite well. RK <br>
told Abhedananda that it was going to be his last=
 birth. Others would be <br>
back, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda,=
 he said there would be <br>
one more birth and he would be free forever af=
ter that. Vimalananda, on <br>
the other hand, had atleast one more birth c=
learly as he said a body was <br>
waiting for him. That way, forget about &=
quot;RK's discples put togtr", just <br>
Abhedananda alone is supe=
rior to Vimalananda!<br>
<br>
Again, please note that this is just one defi=
nition. One can have many <br>
definitions. The key is not to jump to unwis=
e conclusions on any <br>
hierarchies and say that "X is weightier tha=
n Y and so what he said must <br>
be more correct".<br>
<br>
People wi=
th lopsided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledge <br>
to be =
absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people <br>
are d=
oing the same now with "modern scriptures" such as the Aghora <br=
>
books. Don't fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or as <=
br>
absolute. Written words are always relative and never absolute. <br>
Di=
scriminate relative knowledge using intellect at first and hopefully <br>
u=
sing experencial realization later on.<br>
<br>
More importantly, while we =
are still searching for "maturity", we should <br>
not commit the=
 "error" of making negative judgmental comments of greats <br>
wh=
o did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more than us.<br>
