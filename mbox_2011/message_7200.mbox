Dear Thalli,
Glad to see your mail.
It is never good to blow off the light.=
 Even when the light before God is 
finished, we will only say it has gone =
Up Hill.But never say ended. So you can 
tell others who are used to blow o=
ff lights, that light is an indication of 
energy spread from the Lord to u=
s, in the same way we get energy from the SUN to 
the entire world. Hence w=
e should never put it off. It does not signify the 
years passed by this bi=
rthday.We do not want to wipe off the past life. But we 
want to review wha=
t we were before and what positive amends do we now add to the 
present new=
 year. it is not hurting any one race or religion, but we need to 
explain =
relevant information so as to make them understand the science behind. 
We =
do not want to convince them to do like what we do. But just accept what we=
 
do in our home as not hurting them.

So what you suggested may not be tho=
ught off as an alternative.We can never 
start afresh every year by ignorin=
g all we have done in the past continuously.

I shall try to tell you the T=
ithi and star.
In Nirayana system, the birth chart is drawn for the date, t=
ime and place of 
birth details. it gives the placement of all planets and =
what are called houses. 
The relative positioning and aspects between the p=
lanets indicate the video of 
our life. This is because one is destined to =
take birth on a designed day, time 
and place and also to a particular pare=
nts, so that he will have the life 
blended with awards and rewards, happin=
ess, punishments, sufferings etc  based 
on the sum total of all the good a=
nd bad deeds done by him in the entire past 
life in so many thousands of l=
ives, taken together and brought forward in every 
birth.
However, if one c=
hooses to better his life, one can clue from his astrological 
chart and am=
end his activities, make use of good traits offered by the planets, 
taking=
 care in worse situations. care means living in a system of rules and 
regu=
lations. We tend to suffer mainly because of unruly acts, unlimited 
activi=
ty, laziness, selfishness, and hurried doings and short cut doings. This 
i=
ndiscipline the planet SATURN does not allow.o it gives a check b way of an=
 
obstacle or punishment. Bur we fail to understand this good work and try =
to 
continue our mistakes with out getting transformed.

So Birth Tithi in =
this chart is the placement of SUN and Moon, i.e. the 
difference between t=
he longitudes of Sun and Moon gives the Tithi. Star or 
Nakshatra is the lo=
ngitude of MOON alone. Hence Tithi is reflected by the two 
important plane=
ts Sun and Moon.
You need to possess little Astro knowledge to further appr=
eciate this.

I shall provide the MANTRAS that give the blessings I referre=
d earlier.
Let us not be afraid of others when we want to go by a path of D=
HRMA with well 
established Rules and Regulations and also Advises.
You can=
 plan to celebrate the Birthday on 29th September, so that that will 
estab=
lish her date of birth for record too in photographs, Videos and news.

You=
 need not subscribe to what ever told by me. Have your own discretion and a=
ct 
in a convinced and bold manner.
Love and Blessings from Uncle KBKM.

<div style=3D"FONT-SIZE:14pt;COLOR:bla=

ff any light, but only make fire/light and spread light.</div>

<div style=3D"FONT-SIZE:14pt;CO=

ndles and then  blow them off. But lighten 9 candles or lights with gi=
ngelly oil or cow ghee and cotton threads.This signifies starting of 9th ye=
ar and inviting light and energy for the new year.</div>
