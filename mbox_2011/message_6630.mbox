Namaste! You can find the nitya homam(aupasanam and other homams) in the n=
itya karma puja paddhati or nityahnikam published by (among others) Gita Pr=
ess Gorakhpur, R S Vadiyar and Sons Palakkad there are also others, but not=
 all of them have this component. These books are extensive in terms of sta=
ting all karma to be done right from waking up and doing 'kara darsanam'. I=
ncidentally, householders are also supposed to do daily  homa with havishya=
nnam/grains(boiled) OR unhusked grain.  

Normally, metal is valued in the =
order of gold>silver>copper>bronze>Bell metal>brass>steel/iron. Panchaloha =
and ashtadhatu are used for some specific purposes, not generally available=
 so I am not putting it here.
