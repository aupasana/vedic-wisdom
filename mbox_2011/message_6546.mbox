Becoming one with the devas in heaven is not the highest endeavor of man he=
re. There is something beyond karma, higher than the transitory earthly lif=
e, higher than the heavenly enjoyment. Even the devas are subject to the mi=
sery of samsara and they are not immortal in the real sense. The srutis dec=
lare that Brahman alone is above samsara, above hunger and thirst, etc.
