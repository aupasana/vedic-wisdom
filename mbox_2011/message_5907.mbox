Be not afraid of anything. You will do marvellous work. The moment you fear=
, you are nobody. It is fear that is the great cause of misery in the world=
. It is fear that is the greatest of all superstitions. It is fear that is =
the cause of our woes, and it is fearlessness that brings heaven even in a =
moment. Therefore, ?Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.
