namaste,

> Lastly, I did not find any homam manual that goes along with sandhya vandanam ! Someone I respect, mentioned of AupAsana homam ...


In the past, I have asked exactly the same question.

If you are not already doing sandhyAvandana and aupAsana (and are
doing homa), don't worry about it. Just skip this mail altogether. If
you are doing sandhyAvandana, don't want to stop doing it (because of
the guilt factor), and want to better integrate it with homa, this
mail may be of some limited value. I have studied several
sandhyAvandana, aupAsana and homa manuals.

Many traditions split sandhyAvandana into two parts: (a) purificatory
rites and (b) gAyatri-japa. If you want to integrate with homa, do
homa between parts (a) and (b). The first part, with the mArjana etc
hardly takes 1-2 minutes. After that, do the homa. After the purnahuti
etc, you can do the second part of sandhyAvandana (gayatri japa)
starting with the AvAhana. Spend as much time in this meditation as
you can. Then, you can do the upasthAna etc, which will add another 2
minutes or so. Consider skipping all the elaborate nyAsas, and the
repeated prAnAyAmas.

Really speaking, everything important is already there in the homa
manual. From the "full sandhyAvandana" procedure, you can pull in a
few veda mantras if you choose to. But, it really isn't necessary.

If you look at aupAsana procedures, you will find that Narasimha's
manual is more elaborate than the aupAsana. Homa is basically a
superset of aupAsana. Where the manual differs, it is more relevant
for our modern lifestyle, and you don't need to add anything to it.
Frankly, I basically follow Narasimha's manual, but say "aupAsana" in
the sankalpa. They are that similar. The fire in which you do
"upAsana" is "aupAsana".

bhavadiiyaH,
