 Creative happiness is for all and not for the few alone. You may express i=
t
in one way and I in another, but it is for all. Creative happiness has no=

value on the market; it is not a commodity to be sold to the highest bidde=
r,
but it is the one thing that can be for all. (p.2)

After all, to be ope=
n to the source of all happiness is the highest
religion; but to realize th=
is happiness, you must give right attention to
it, as you do to business. T=
he teacher=E2=80=99s profession is not a mere routine
job, but the expressi=
on of beauty and joy, which cannot be measured in terms
of achievement and =
success.

Conflict exists when there is no integration between challenge an=
d response.
This conflict is the result of our conditioning. Conditioning i=
s attachment:
attachment to work, to tradition, to property, to people, to =
ideas, and so
on. If there were no attachment, would there be conditioning?=
 Of course not.
So why are we attached? I am attached to my country because=
 through
identification with it I become somebody. I identify myself with m=
y work,
and the work becomes important. I am my family, my property; I am a=
ttached
to them. The object of attachment offers me the means of escape fro=
m my own
emptiness. Attachment is escape, and it is escape that strengthens=

conditioning. If I am attached to you, it is because you have become the
m=
eans of escape from myself; therefore you are very important to me and I
mu=
st possess you, hold on to you. You become the conditioning factor, and
esc=
ape is the conditioning. If we can be aware of our escapes, we can then
per=
ceive the factors, the influences that make for conditioning. (p.5)

There =
are escapes at all the levels of our being. You escape through work,
anothe=
r through drink, another through religious ceremonies, another through
know=
ledge, another through God, and still another is addicted to amusement.
All=
 escapes are the same, there is no superior or inferior escape. God and
dri=
nk are on the same level as long as they are escapes from what we are.
When=
 we are aware of our escapes, only then can we know of our conditioning.
(p=
.5-6)

To cultivate detachment is another form of escape, of isolation; it =
is
attachment to an abstraction, to an ideal called detachment.

Thinking a=
bout the problem is escape from the problem; for thinking is the
problem, a=
nd the only problem. The mind, unwilling to be what it is, fearful
of what =
it is, seeks these various escapes, and the way of escape is
thought. As lo=
ng as there is thinking, there must be escapes, attachments,
which only str=
engthen conditioning. (p.6-7)

Freedom from conditioning comes with the fre=
edom from thinking. When the
mind is utterly still, only then is there free=
dom for the real to be.

Love is a strange thing; as long as thought is wov=
en through it, it is not
love. When you think of someone you love, that per=
son becomes the symbol of
pleasant sensations, memories, images; but that i=
s not love. Thought is
sensation, and sensation is not love. The very proce=
ss of thinking is the
denial of love. Love is the flame without the smoke o=
f thought, of jealousy,
of antagonism, of usage, which are things of the mi=
nd.

We move from one substitution to another, but essentially, all substit=
utions
are the same, though verbally they may appear to be dissimilar. So y=
ou are
caught in the net of your own thought.

Revolution based an idea, ho=
wever logical and in accordance with historical
evidence, cannot bring abou=
t equality. The very function of idea is to
separate people. Belief, religi=
ous or political, sets man against man.
So-called
religions have divided pe=
ople, and still do. Organized belief, which is
called religion, is, like an=
y other ideology, a thing of the mind and
therefore separative. (p.16-17)

=
Actually, there is inequality at all the levels of existence. One has
capac=
ity, and another has not; one leads, and another follows; one is dull,
and =
another is sensitive, alert , adaptable; one paints or writes, and
another =
digs; one is a scientist, and another a sweeper. Inequality is a
fact, and =
no revolution can do away with it. (p.17)

How necessary it is for the mind=
 to purge itself of all thought, to be
constantly empty, not made empty, bu=
t simply empty; to die to all thought,
to all of yesterday=E2=80=99s memori=
es, and to the coming hour! It is simple to die,
and it is hard to continue=
; for continuity is effort to be or not to be.
Effort is desire, and desire=
 can die only when the mind ceases to acquire. How
simple it is just to liv=
e! But it is not stagnation. There is great
happiness in not wanting, in no=
t being something, in not going somewhere.
When the mind purges itself of a=
ll thought, only then is there the silence
of creation.

You have tried to =
gain satisfaction from everything you have come in contact
with; and when y=
ou have thoroughly used it, naturally you get bored with it.
Every acquisit=
ion is a form of boredom, weariness. We want a change of toys;
as soon as w=
e lose interest in one, we turn to another, and there is always
a new toy t=
o turn to. We turn to something in order to acquire; there is
acquisition i=
n pleasure, in knowledge, in fame, in power, in efficiency, in
having a fam=
ily, and so on. When there is nothing further to acquire in one
religion, i=
n one saviour, we lose interest and turn to another. Some go to
sleep in an=
 organization and never wake up, and those who do wake up put
themselves to=
 sleep again by joining another. This acquisitive movement is
called expans=
ion of thought, progress!

The nature of the mind is to acquire, to absorb,=
 is it not? Or rather, the
pattern it has created for itself is one of gath=
ering in; and in that very
activity the mind is preparing its own weariness=
, boredom. Interest,
curiosity, is the beginning of acquisition, which soon=
 becomes boredom; and
the urge to be free from boredom is another form of p=
ossession. So the mind
goes from boredom to interest to boredom again, till=
 it is utterly weary;
and these successive waves of interest and weariness =
are regarded as
existence. (p.22)

To find God, you try to subdue the mind.=
 But is calmness of mind a way to
God? Is calmness the coin which will open=
 the gates of heaven? You want to
buy your way to God, to truth, or what na=
me you will. Can you buy the
eternal through virtue, through renunciation, =
through mortification? We
think that if we do certain things, practise virt=
ue, pursue chastity,
withdraw from the world, we shall be able to measure t=
he measureless; so
it=E2=80=99s just a bargain, isn=E2=80=99t it? Your =E2=
=80=98virtue=E2=80=99 is a means to an end. (p.24)

Understanding comes wit=
h the ending of the thought-process, in the interval
between two thoughts. =
You say the mind must be still, and yet you desire it
to function. If we ca=
n be simple in watchfulness, we shall understand; but
our approach is so co=
mplex that it prevents understanding. Surely we are not
concerned with disc=
ipline, control, suppression, resistance, but with the
process and the endi=
ng of thought itself. What do we mean when we say that
the mind wanders? Si=
mply that thought is everlastingly enticed from one
attraction to another, =
from one association to another, and is in constant
agitation. Is it possib=
le for thought to come to an end? (p.25-26)

The mind is not quiet when it =
is disciplined, controlled and checked; such a
mind is a dead mind, it is i=
solating itself through various forms of
resistance, and so it inevitably c=
reates misery for itself and for others.
(p.31-32)

Our acquisitions are a =
means of covering up our own emptiness; our minds are
like hollow drums, be=
aten upon by every passing hand and making a lot of
noise. This is our life=
, the conflict of never-satisfying escapes and
mounting misery. It is stran=
ge how we are never alone, never strictly alone.
We are always with somethi=
ng, with a problem, with a book, with a person;
and when we are alone, our =
thoughts are with us. To be alone, naked, is
essential. All escapes, all ga=
therings, all effort to be or not to be, must
cease; and then only is there=
 the aloneness that can receive the alone, the
measureless.

Is devotion th=
e worship of an image, of a person, of a symbol? Has reality
any symbol? Ca=
n a symbol ever represent truth? Is not the symbol static, and
can a static=
 thing ever represent that which is living? Is your picture you?

Let us se=
e what we mean by devotion. You spend several hours a day in what
you call =
the love, the contemplation of God. Is that devotion? The man who
gives his=
 life to social betterment is devoted to his work; and the general,
whose j=
ob is to plan destruction, is also devoted to his work. Is that
devotion? I=
f I may say so, you spend your time being intoxicated by the
image or idea =
of God, and others do the same thing in a different way. Is
there a fundame=
ntal distinction between the two? Is it devotion that has an
object?

The w=
orshipper is the worshipped. To worship another is to worship oneself;
the =
images, the symbol, is a projection of oneself. After all, your idol,
your =
book, your prayer, is the reflection of your background; it is your
creatio=
n, though it be made by another. You choose according to your
gratification=
; your choice is your prejudice. Your image is your intoxicant,
and it is c=
arved out of your own memory; you are worshipping yourself
through the imag=
e created by your own thought. Your devotion is the love of
yourself, it is=
 the reflection of your mind. Such devotion is a form of
self-deception tha=
t only leads to sorrow and to isolation, which is death.

The understanding=
 of =E2=80=98what is=E2=80=99 does not depend upon thought, for thought
its=
elf is an escape. To think about the problem is not to understand it. It
is=
 only when the mind is silent that the truth of =E2=80=98what is=E2=80=99 u=
nfolds.

Awareness of the ways of desire is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge =
is the
beginning of meditation. (p.66-67)

Every individual and group is af=
ter power: power for oneself, for the party,
or the ideology. The party and=
 the ideology are an extension of oneself. The
ascetic seeks power through =
abnegation, and so does the mother through her
child. There is the power of=
 efficiency with its ruthlessness, and the power
of the machine in the hand=
s of a few; there is the domination of one
individual by another, the explo=
itation of the stupid by the clever, the
power of money, the power of name =
and word, and the power of mind over
matter. We all want some kind of power=
, whether over ourselves or over
others. This urge to power brings a kind o=
f happiness, a gratification that
is not too transient. The power of renunc=
iation is as the power of wealth.
It is the craving for gratification, for =
happiness, that drives us to seek
power. And how easily we are satisfied! T=
he ease of achieving some form of
satisfaction blinds us. All gratification=
 is blinding. (p.68)

The world is the projection of yourself. The world ca=
nnot be transformed
till you are. Happiness is in transformation and not in=
 acquisition.

Only a happy man can bring about a new social order; but he =
is not happy who
is identified with an ideology or a belief, or who is lost=
 in any social or
individual activity. Happiness is not an end in itself. I=
t comes with the
understanding of =E2=80=98what is=E2=80=99. Only when the =
mind is free from its own
projections can there be happiness. Happiness tha=
t is bought is merely
gratification; happiness through action, through powe=
r, is only sensation;
and as sensation soon withers, there is craving for m=
ore and more. As long
as the more is a means to happiness, the end is alway=
s dissatisfaction,
conflict and misery. Happiness is not a remembrance; it =
is that state which
comes into being with truth, ever new, never continuous=
. (p.71)

Even in complete isolation you are in contact with your thoughts,=
 with
yourself. (p.75)

Silence comes with the absence of desire. Desire is=
 swift, cunning and deep.
Remembrance shuts off the sweep of silence, and a=
 mind that is caught in
experience cannot be silent. Time, the movement of =
yesterday flowing into
to-day and to-morrow, is not silence. With the cessa=
tion of this movement
there is silence, and only then can that which is unn=
amable come into being.
(p.77)

Stillness of the mind cannot be induced, it=
 cannot be brought about through
any practice or discipline. If the mind is=
 made still, then whatever comes
into it is only a self-projection, the res=
ponse of memory. With the
understanding of its conditioning, with the choic=
eless awareness of its own
responses as thought and feeling, tranquillity c=
omes to the mind. This
breaking of the chain of karma is not a matter of ti=
me; for through time,
the timeless is not. (p.80-81)

To understand the min=
d is to be aware of desire and fear. (p.84)

Without understanding yourself=
, whatever you do will inevitably bring about
confusion and sorrow.

Only b=
y understanding the false as the false is there freedom from it. Be
passive=
ly watchful of your habitual responses; simply be aware of them
without res=
istance; passively watch them as you would watch a child, without
the pleas=
ure or distance of identification. Passive watchfulness itself is
freedom f=
rom defence, from closing the door. To be vulnerable is to live,
and to wit=
hdraw is to die. (p.90)

e same thing in a different way. Is there a fundamental distinction between=
 the two? Is it devotion that has an object?<br>

hip oneself; the images, the symbol, is a projection of oneself. After all,=
 your idol, your book, your prayer, is the reflection of your background; i=

cording to your gratification; your choice is your prejudice. Your image is=
 your intoxicant, and it is carved out of your own memory; you are worshipp=
ing yourself through the image created by your own thought. Your devotion i=
s the love of yourself, it is the reflection of your mind. Such devotion is=
 a form of self-deception that only leads to sorrow and to isolation, which=
 is death.<br>

an extension of oneself. The ascetic seeks power through abnegation, and so=
 does the mother through her child. There is the power of efficiency with i=
ts ruthlessness, and the power of the machine in the hands of a few; there =
is the domination of one individual by another, the exploitation of the stu=
pid by the clever, the power of money, the power of name and word, and the =
power of mind over matter. We all want some kind of power, whether over our=
selves or over others. This urge to power brings a kind of happiness, a gra=
tification that is not too transient. The power of renunciation is as the p=
ower of wealth. It is the craving for gratification, for happiness, that dr=
ives us to seek power. And how easily we are satisfied! The ease of achievi=
ng some form of satisfaction blinds us. All gratification is blinding. (p.6=
