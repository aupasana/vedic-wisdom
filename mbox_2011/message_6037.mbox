He records a dream after his illness

I came to a small wayside chapel,and =
I went in. To my surprise there was no image of the Virgin on the altar, an=
d no crucifix either, but only a wonderful flower arrangement. But then I s=
aw that on the floor in front  of the altar, facing me, sat a yogi=E2=80"in=
 lotus posture, in deep meditation. When I looked at him more closely, I re=
alized that he had my face. I started in profound fright, and awoke with th=
e thought: =E2=80=98Aha, so he is the one who is meditating me. He has a dr=
eam and I am it=E2=80=99
