Thanks for your suggestion. There is a powerful exhaust fan in my kitchen. =
It is 
important for me to start this in a small way....and soon there may =
be a 
blessing so that I can find a nice place to do homa. Internal control=

easy in a hectic life...so we need these aids.

Some people are doing homam in apartments using only copra. =

Excellent description of the process. What do you recommend for people try=

I've=

Dear Utpal, 
=C2=A0 
Rajarshi is correct. It is=
 very very difficult to burn a watery coconut with 
just copra. You need wo=
od. You should stick to half/whole dry coconuts instead 
of watery coconuts=
. 

=C2=A0 
I also use the same kind shown by Rajarshi ( http://goo.gl/U7vz=
W). Though it is 
possible to offer the green ones ( http://goo.gl/2LMio), =
it will take a lot more 
time (or a much bigger fire) to burn it fully. 

=
=C2=A0 
I arrange two logs in parallel, separated by an inch or so, within =
my homa 
kundam. I place the coconut in the middle, on top of them. I offer=
 it at the end 
of offerings to Ganapathi, kind of like a poornaahuti to Ga=
napathi (I say "OM 
gaM gaNapataye namaH, pUrNa phalaM samarpayaami", i.e. =
I offer a whole fruit). 
Then I proceed to invoke Chandi in the fire. By th=
e time Chandi is invoked, the 
coconut fully cathes fire and there is a rea=
lly big fire. Then I start making 
offerings with Chandipath (sesame seeds,=
 ghee etc). The way I arrange the two 
logs, they touch the firepit walls a=
t the edges of the logs only and they do not 
touch the bottom surface of t=
he pit that contains burning materials (e.g. sesame 
seeds, murmura, nuts, =
copra pieces etc). So, except the edges, the logs are 
effectively suspende=
d in air a little height above the burning materials. That 
helps things bu=
rn nicely, with a big fire. The coconut also burns fast and with 
a big fir=
e. 

=C2=A0 
By the time I am in the middle of the second chapter, the bott=
om of the coconut 
starts to crack. If I keep it a little more time, it wil=
l break and coconut 
water will fall in fire. Before that happens, I turn t=
he coconut around so that 
the weaker (cracked) side faces up. This way, wa=
ter spills in fire rarely. 
Usually most of the water just evaporates and o=
nly small amounts spill into 
fire. IF a lot of water falls in fire, just p=
our some drops of ghee and sprinke 
sesame seeds to increase the fire again=
. By the time I finish 13 chapters 
(sometimes even earlier), the coconut i=
s reduced to ashes. At the end, I offer a 
dry coconut as poornaahuti and m=
editate peacefully. Dry coconut burns fully by 
itself, once it catches fir=
e. 

=C2=A0 
I experimented with various whole fresh fruits, but coconut is=
 the best. 
=C2=A0 
In general, one simple thumbrule is that materials need=
 oxygen supply to burn 
well. So, if wood and coconut are exposed to oxygen=
 (air) from as many sides as 
possible, they will burn well and with a big =
fire. 

=C2=A0 
This is just for giving some ideas to some people who may b=
e doing homam with a 
big fire.

I remembe=

Sometime as alternative, i offer Whole Dry=

#000000 size=3D2>I arrange two logs in parallel, separated by an inch or so=
, within my homa kundam. I place the coconut in the middle, on top of them.=
 I offer it at the end of offerings to Ganapathi, kind of like a poornaahut=
i to Ganapathi (I say "OM gaM gaNapataye namaH, pUrNa phalaM samarpayaami",=
 i.e. I offer a whole fruit). Then I proceed to invoke Chandi in the fire. =
By the time Chandi is invoked, the coconut fully cathes fire and there is a=
 really big fire. Then I start making offerings with Chandipath (sesame see=
ds, ghee etc). The way I arrange the two logs, they touch the firepit walls=
 at the edges of the logs only and they do not touch the bottom surface of =
the pit that contains burning materials (e.g. sesame seeds, murmura, nuts, =
copra pieces etc). So, except the edges, the logs are effectively suspended=
 in air a little height above the burning materials. That helps things burn=
 nicely, with a big fire. The
 coconut also burns fast and with a big fire.=

er spills in fire rarely. Usually most of the water just evaporates and onl=
y small amounts spill into fire. IF a lot of water falls in fire, just pour=
 some drops of ghee and sprinke sesame seeds to increase the fire again. By=
 the time I finish 13 chapters (sometimes even earlier), the coconut is red=
uced to ashes. At the end, I offer a dry coconut as poornaahuti and meditat=
e peacefully. Dry coconut burns fully by itself, once it catches fire. </FO=

 the coconut - at different intervals - so that the coconut eventually catc=
