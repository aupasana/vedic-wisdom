Namaste:

<div><br></div>
<div>To summarize:</=
div></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Candle Light: In the case of a candle the f=
uel is generally paraffin wax (which is a by-product of petroleum), which i=
s primarily tama-raja predominant and hence it emits tama and raja-tama fre=
quencies. As a result, it also attracts similar frequencies from the enviro=
nment. This does not have a beneficial effect on the immediate environment =
and is least conducive to attract any divine principle.</div>


<div><br></=
div>
<div>Ghee: Clarified butter has a predominance of the sattva component=
 in it and hence the flame generated by burning it emits sattvik frequencie=
s. Due to the predominance of sattva component in the flame, it attracts an=
d emits divine consciousness and one gets the experience of purity in the e=
nvironment.</div>


<div><br></div>
<div>Sesame seed oil: The frequencies e=
mitted would have been a combination of sattva and raja frequencies.</div>
