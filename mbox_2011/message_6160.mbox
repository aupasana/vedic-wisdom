Sri Utpalji, 
=C2=A0
I have gone thru this and my observations are exactly =
like Shri Narasimha's! You might be pronouncing with proper vowel endings b=
ut surely you are an exception. Most North Indian people I know, do not put=
 the vowel endings, esp. when the words end with "a". And South Indians do =
not put a "aa" either. It is only when south indians, speak in English and =
they have to refer to the names "rama" and "Shiva" or "Atma", they say that=
 as "Raamaa", "Shivaa" or "Aatmaa" because that is how all "a" ending Engli=
sh nouns end! 
=C2=A0
If you want to compare these, listen to 
=C2=A0
1. Ha=
numan Chalisa recordings by MS Subbulakshmi and Hari Om Sharan and 
=C2=A0
=
2. Bhajagovindam by MS Subbulakshmi and Purushottam Jalota
=C2=A0
all of th=
em are available on youtube. 
=C2=A0
The first one is by the great Tulasida=
s in avadhi and the second one by Adi Sankara in Sanskrit. You will notice =
what I am trying to convey! 
=C2=A0
By the way, it is interesting to note y=
our Yendian! I am yet to notice a south indian who says Indian, like that! =

 Most south Indians pronounce this as "dha" (as in "dhana" =3D money). In T=
elugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks very similar an=
d just one dot in the middle is different. It is possible that some people =
started mispronouncing this sound because of their inability to see the dot=
 and others started following. Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream=
 and one pronouncing correctly will be the odd person out.

t is not English. We never have two different symbols for the same sound or=
 two different sounds for the same symbol. The letters "tha" and "dha" are =
different and their sounds are different too. Pronounce "t" (as in "tanu" =
=3D body or "taamra" =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to get "th" (as i=
n "kathaa" =3D story).

say "dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham". This =
means "for attaining the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharm=
a (fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) a=
nd moksha (developing detachment)". Most people end up pronouncing "dharmaa=
rtha kaama moksha" as "dharmaardha kaama moksha". It means "half of dharma,=
 kaama and moksha". Even "siddhardham" means "half attainment" and "purusha=
ardha" means "half a human". Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mi=
stake and I have seen it committed by many many trained priests!

"t" gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his stu=
dents would not get confused when learning. Probably the students thought t=
he mantra was "yaatu" (instead of "yaat") and got used to that mis-pronunci=
ation. Probably, that became a standard practice after a couple of centurie=
s.<BR>> > <BR>> > If you pronounce the English word "path", you=
 do not change it to "paaththu". You say "th" at the end of "path" as a con=
sonant and leave it there. You don't force an vowel sound to be added at th=
e end. The same thing holds for "t" in "prachodayaat".<BR>> > <BR>>=
; > * * *<BR>> > <BR>> > What I said about words ending in c=
onsonants applies to all consonants and not just "t", though "t" is more co=
mmonly encountered. There can be words that end in "n" or "k" etc also. The=
re also, people normally add an artificial vowel sound
 at the end and end =
up changing the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. Tha=
t is also wrong.<BR>> > <BR>> > * * *<BR>> > <BR>> >=
; One more common mistake is the sound "tha" (as in "kathaa" =3D story). Mo=
st south Indians pronounce this as "dha" (as in "dhana" =3D money). In Telu=
gu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks very similar and j=
ust one dot in the middle is different. It is possible that some people sta=
rted mispronouncing this sound because of their inability to see the dot an=
d others started following. Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream an=
d one pronouncing correctly will be the odd person out.<BR>> > <BR>&g=
t; > Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols for th=
e same sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The letters "tha"=
 and "dha" are different and their sounds are different too. Pronounce "t" =
(as in "tanu" =3D body or "taamra" =3D copper) with a
 stress/aspiration to=
 get "th" (as in "kathaa" =3D story).<BR>> > <BR>> > In the san=
kalpa before many poojas, people say "dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha =
purushaartha siddhyartham". This means "for attaining the purusharthas (pur=
poses of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (work and mon=
ey), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment)". Most p=
eople end up pronouncing "dharmaartha kaama moksha" as "dharmaardha kaama m=
oksha". It means "half of dharma, kaama and moksha". Even "siddhardham" mea=
ns "half attainment" and "purushaardha" means "half a human". Mis-pronuncia=
tion in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by many=
 many trained priests!<BR>> > <BR>> > When you read Vaidika/Taa=
ntrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the difference between "tha" and=
 "dha" and learn to pronounce them differently. When you see "tha" or "dha"=
 in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure
 that you are not confusing t=
ha for dha.<BR>> > <BR>> > * * *<BR>> > <BR>> > The=
re are several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in =
the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly i=
n the next few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.<BR>> > <BR>&=
gt; > Please give me your consideration and take my input into considera=
tion in altering your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you don't=
 find any sense in what I am saying or want to continue as taught by your g=
urus, I can understand that. I am not here to change everybody's pronunciat=
ion. But, because She inspired me to share my thoughts with the world, I am=
 guessing that there are SOME who are destined to change their pronunciatio=
n based on my views. That is why I am writing these mails.<BR>> > <BR=
