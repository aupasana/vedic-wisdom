Freedom is the one goal of nature, sentient or insentient; and consciously =
or unconsciously everything is struggling towards that goal. The freedom wh=
ich the saint seeks is very different from that which the robber seeks; the=
 freedom loved by the saint leads him to the enjoyment of infinite, unspeak=
able bliss, while that on which the robber has set his heart only forges ot=
her bonds for his soul.
