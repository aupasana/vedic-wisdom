   The undescribable suprem=
e consciousness is far more useless to talk about than its fragments born o=
f and as a result of first instance of ignorance. The first fragments are o=
nly slightly separated from the supreme consciousness, thus, the 27 deities=
 of the Nakshatras, has been talked about and worshipped in the Vedas more =
than the supreme consciosuness which cannot be described and discussed in a=
ny meaningful way anyways, except for the purposes of idling and endless ph=
ilosophizing.

> whole, not divided into parts.
   Certainly, the sage is in sup=
reme state of consciousness, because his consciousness is no more accessibl=
e to any of his follower's petty ignorant minds and souls anymore, as it ha=
s always existed as it is.
   Sadly, though, like master like follower cann=
ot be applied to the Sage in his supreme state of consciousness, so the fol=
lowers keep repeating like their master that everybody else is ignorant.
  =
 On a positive note, that leaves a lot of room for us ignorant people , to =
worship god in one of his 27 manifestations mentioned in Vedas and do away =
with Vedanta completely.

   How fortunate are we ? While no body alive can=
 extend the knowledge conveyed in Vedas because they are not written by hum=
an-beings like the Sage himself, there is no end to Vedanta which sees all =
sorts of additions, versions and interpretations of experiential knowledge.=
 Thankfully, all the boring vedantists have left the world without trying t=
o manipulate Vedas so that we may peacefully and practically follow Vedas.

Aryama
