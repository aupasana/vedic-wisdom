The Kumaras were initiated by Lord Shiva, in the form of Dakshinamurti, int=
o the mysteries of Brahmajnana, through silence and Chinmudra. Dakshinamurt=
i sat under a banyan tree and taught them jnana by silence. They imbibed wi=
sdom through silence and got rid of their doubts.

Dattatreya is the father=
 of all men of renunciation. We are all the children of Dattatreya. Adorati=
ons to Him at all times! Dattatreya=E2=80=99s Avadhuta Gita and his instruc=
tions to king Yadu mark out his Supreme wisdom of Brahman. He lived in Brah=
man and he breathed Brahman. It is rare to find a sage like Dattatreya.
