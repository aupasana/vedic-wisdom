Why do you roll on in this miserable samsara? Are you not ashamed? If you h=
ave real manliness, you must break the chains of earthly bondage, the bonda=
ge of birth and death, old age and disease, hunger and thirst! That is cour=
age! That is heroism! That is manliness! Do not be cowards, start now! Figh=
t for the sake of that state of absolute freedom or kaivalya-mukti!
