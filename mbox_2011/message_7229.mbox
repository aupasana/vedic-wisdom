y. We have set up the pooja sthaan in one of the rooms. My question is abou=

 sthaan (as while praying to Lord Ganesha I am tempted to look at/face all =
the different forms in the pooja pedestal and hence I am not able to mainta=
in focus) Could you please suggest if it is fine to do this (that is have o=
nly one form in the pooja sthaan)? What should we do with the remaining ido=
ls/forms of the same deity? Is it ok to donate them at a nearby temple or i=
mmerse them in a nearby river/ocean?
