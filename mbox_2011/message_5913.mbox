And so, I did not know that the Holy Mother was the Divine Mother herself.A=
nd so, one day, Swami Saradananda was in meditation.I thought this day, I a=
m going to ask Swami Saradananda something.Because, I became close to Swami=
 Saradananda and became his ,called, private secretary.I have seen when Swa=
mi Saradananda will give instruction,
he will.....there is a method there,y=
ou have to do this first, then the second, then third, and then fourth.And =
so, after his meditation, I approached, bowed down to him, touched his feet=
,
"Maharaj I have got a  question.Holy Mother just gave me a mantra, and di=
d not even say you have to repeat 108 times.But I see, that in my writing l=
etters for you that there is a method there, there is a system, there is on=
e step and next, like that.Would you kindly add something to what Holy Moth=
er has given?"

"That means you're the greatest fool!Do you know who Holy M=
other is?
She is called Jagatjanani,Universal Mother.What she has given you=
 is the last word of spiritual life.You repeat that mantra and cling to the=
 feet of the Mother in your meditation,and all things will come to pass."
