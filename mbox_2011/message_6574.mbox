I think there is no conflict between gyana and karma. Though sanyasa can 
f=
aciliate teh knowing of truth but there is not one path to truth. Different=
 
people, different ways according to their temperament. 


I think it is t=
he perception ..when there is a perception that we are not the 
doers there=
 is action without attachment. When there is action without 
attachment(whe=
n i clearly know i am not doing it there can be no attachment) 
there is no=
 karma. All gyana should lead one to see this error in 
perception(through =
insight). It does not matter the path we chose to get this 
understanding. =



That is how I think about this

ns of <BR>> contemporary Vedic knowledge. I found the same thinking at W=
AVES (World <BR>> Association of Vedic Studies) conference in Aug 2010. =
Some Vedic <BR>> scholars talk about vedanta and knowledge. Some talk ab=
out karma and <BR>> actions/rituals. They think that those are two oppos=
ing paths.<BR>> <BR>> Vasishtha very clearly said at the beginning of=
 "Yoga Vaasishtham" that <BR>> the bird of individual self flies into th=
e sky of undivided and infinite
 <BR>> consciousness, by flapping the tw=
o wings of karma and gyaana. A bird <BR>> cannot fly with just one wing.=
<BR>> <BR>> Knowledge without action to rid oneself of the blocking c=
onditioning <BR>> cannot free one. Without actions, knowledge remains me=
rely intellectual. <BR>> Only with repeated actions does knowledge get i=
ngrained in one's <BR>> consciousness so deeply that all of one's instin=
cts, thoughts and deeds <BR>> are shaped by that correct knowledge (inst=
ead of underlying <BR>> conditioning). Just "knowing" intellectually tha=
t a movie is not real <BR>> and there is no need to take what happens on=
 the screen seriously is not <BR>> enough to stop you from getting start=

tice a lot before that knowledge becomes <BR>> natural and permanent and=
 you stop getting startled.<BR>> <BR>> Similarly, actionss without kn=
owledge are useless too.
 One keeps <BR>> performing actions forever the=
n. One watching a movie 1000 times without <BR>> the knowledge that it i=
s unreal and should not be taken seriously will <BR>> get startled each =
time and enjoy the experience.<BR>> <BR>> In http://tinyurl.com/homam=
why document (from WAVES 2010 conference), I <BR>> gave an analogy. Supp=
ose one needs to walk to the top of a mountain. One <BR>> with gyaana bu=
t no karma is like a person standing at the base and <BR>> staring at th=
e pinnacle. He knows where to go, but he will remain at the <BR>> base f=
orever. One with karma but no gyaana is like a person going around <BR>>=
 the mountain forever. One balancing karma and gyana, i.e. engaging in <BR>=

s <BR>> like a person climbing the mountain and watching the top from ti=

 Perform the best action within your capability to fulfil those <BR>&g=

t is not correct to <BR>> think that external sannyasa
 is a must for Se=

you have take sannyasa.<BR>> <BR>> In fact, there is an interesting s=
tory given by Vasishtha in that <BR>> Vedanta epic. See the story of Chu=
dala and Sikhidhwaja. King Sikhidhwaja <BR>> leaves his wife and kingdom=
, becomes an ascetic, lives in a small hut in <BR>> a forest for a few d=
ecades and spends all his time in meditation. Wife <BR>> Chudala rules k=

; <BR>> :-) If one can find some focus despire the distractions, one pro=
gresses <BR>> faster. If one has no jnana and mind tends to get distract=
ed, then <BR>> sannyasa may not help that much. Merely having more free =
time will not <BR>> allow one to focus on god. One will get all kinds of=
 thoughts when <BR>> meditating.<BR>> <BR>> For example, we see sa=
nnyasins getting caught engaging in sexual <BR>> scandals and political =
scandals now-a-days. We see sannyasins fighting <BR>> among themselves c=
heaply, to become the heads of their mathas <BR>> (monasteries). We see =
sannyasins trying to raise their profile among <BR>> devotees and politi=
cians or to get better TRPs on TV. We see sannyasins <BR>> running after=
 siddhis and talking about siddhis like a
 child may talk <BR>> about ch=
ocolates. We see sannyasins trying to raise a lot of money for <BR>> the=
ir mathas and resorting to cheap gimmicks for it. When people not <BR>> =
ready for sannyasa and having dense conditioning take up sannyasa to <BR>&g=
t; have more "leisure" or escape from "the distractions of life", this is <=
BR>> what happens!<BR>> <BR>> Remain in the material world and do =
sadhana. Develop detachment from <BR>> body and individual needs, compas=
sion to others, dispassion and <BR>> detachment in actions, surrender to=
 the Lord and the ability to engage <BR>> in powerful actions while bein=
g absolutely prepared for any end result. <BR>> As you make progress, pe=
rhaps oneday you will be ready for sannyasa and <BR>> it will just happe=
n. Or perhaps you will become realized even without <BR>> sannyasa. In e=
ither case, the end goal is internal detachment and <BR>> self-realizati=
