Dear Nagraj

Namaskar ! I always make the yantras=
 myself. I have got 6x6 copper plates made and I use the machine which can =
write on utensils, the one used for writing names on steel utensils. You ca=
n get it for around 300 rupees in Delhi. It works fine with copper plate an=
d with a little practice u would be able to make a perfect yantra.

Gaurav

On the topic of Yantras, I have a few questions. Is there a =
way we can create our own yantras? Are people aware of any writing instrume=
nts on copper plates that we, as end users can use, instead of going to a s=
pecial store? The reason I ask this is, people sell all kinds of yantras th=
ese days, in yantra factories and sell them on internet, which in past Shri=
 Narasimha mentioned. And he did dismiss them as not too useful things for =
sadhana. In this group, all of us do involve in some kind of sadhana with a=
 sincere approach, in my opinion. So, in my opinion if we can create our ow=
n yantras, that would be a lot better than any ready made stuff available o=
n the net.

Namaste KK,

Robert S=

Namaste,

Fig-1 shown in Homam Manual (which is to be drawn at the base=
