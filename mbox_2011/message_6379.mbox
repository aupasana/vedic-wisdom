Dear Prasad,

> Validation is important on the path of spiritual practice.

Since the goal is inner transformation, look for inner validation. Pick a
reasonable goal, and work on one of your six internal enemies like anger.
Examine your mind each and every day. See if you truly lived, laughed and
loved without any expectations or attachments.
