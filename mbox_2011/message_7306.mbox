Interpretatio=
n -   Agni was invoked to come here to the sacrifice site
along with the pi=
tru devataas in riks 10.015.09 and 10.015.10, and here
is the place where t=
he actual request of carrying the oblations is being
made since agni is "ka=
vya-vaahana", the oblations that are offered to
pitru devataas via agni are=
 called kavyaM, and the oblations offered
directly to pitru devataas are ca=
lled svadha and a ceremony where svadha
is offered to pitru devataas is ter=
med shraaddha. scriptures specify
such ceremonies (shraaddha) to be perform=
ed at some prescribed times,
but a general/daily offerings (with some excep=
tions to avoid on certain
days) are also prescribed in scriptures and dharm=
a shaastraas which
usually involve offering water (named tarpaNa) to pitru =
devataas as a
reverential homage to them so that they are satiated and get =
liberated
(ref: 10.015.01 - udiirataamavara utparaasa unmadhyamaaH pitaraH)=
. Agni
here is being requested to convey the offering to pitru devataas in
=
kayva form, we do not know who all pitru devataas that we are karmically
in=
debted to but agni knows all of them since agni is also known as
jaatavedaH=
 - jaatam sarvam jagad vetti iti jaatavedaaH[the one who knows
all the crea=
ted ones in universe is jaatavedaa].    jaataveda - Rig Veda
in 6.15.13 say=
s agni is jaataveda because "vishvaa veda janimaa
jaatavedaaH[knowing all c=
reated things and creatures]" and also in the
same rik agni is said to be "=
devaanaam uta yo martyaanaaM yajihThaH sa
prayajataam[Most skillful worship=
per amidst Gods and mortals, may he
begin the sacrifice]".   Hence we are a=
ppeasing and requesting by
adressing agni as O, jaatavedaH - please convey =
all the oblations to
pitru devataas in-spite of we not knowing them all (th=
e pitru devataas).
  Agni is said to render the oblations fragrant, fragran=
t to make them
auspicious. Also pitru devataas consume offerings by smell, =
hence they
could have been made/asked to make the offerings fragrant by agn=
i.
  having requested agni to carry the oblations[kavyaM] to pitru devataas=
,
and assuming the kavyam is consumed by pitru devataas along with
svadha(w=
hich is offered directly) - we are expressing our gratitude and
thankfulnes=
s to agni by requesting agni to consume the oblation by him
as well, this i=
s analogous to athithi-satkaara where we attend to all
guests and offer our=
 servings to them, in a similar fashion agni is also
offered[prayataa - see=
