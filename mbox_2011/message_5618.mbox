Is not the posting of the Patanjali Yoga Sutras a gift?

   Namaste Prashanth:

Good to see that you are actively sending mails agai=
n :) Missed your daily Ramana's email for a while. It was like a daily less=
on to me :)


Everytime when I read these Sutras, I get a feeling of clear =
understanding, and it still continues like that.
"Self-restraint in actions=
 includes abstention from violence, from falsehoods, from stealing, from se=
xual engagements, and from acceptance of gifts."


Why is acceptance of gif=
ts is such a bad thing ? What about giving gifts ? If accepting gifts is un=
desirable, then giving gifts should also be undesirable??
I request members=
 to share their thoughts.=C2=A0

Translation by BonGiovanni

1.2. Union is restr=
aining the thought-streams natural to the mind.

1.3. Then the seer dwells =
in his own nature.





1.12. These=C2=A0thought-streams are controlled by =
practice and non-attachment.

1.15. Desirelessness towards the seen and the=
 unseen gives the consciousness of mastery.





1.27. God's voice is Om.

=
1.28. The repetition of Om should be made with an understanding of its mean=
ing.

1.30. Disease, inertia, doubt, lack of enthusiasm, laziness, sensuali=
ty, mind-wandering, missing the point, instability- these distractions of t=
he mind are the obstacles.





Part Two on Spiritual Disciplines

2.7 Atta=
chment is that magnetic pattern which clusters in pleasure and pulls one to=
wards such experience.

2.20 The indweller is pure consciousness only, whic=
h though pure, sees through the mind and is identified by ego as being only=
 the mind.





2.26 The continuous practice of discrimination is the means=
 of attaining liberation.

2.30 Self-restraint in actions includes abstenti=
on from violence, from falsehoods, from stealing, from sexual engagements, =
and from acceptance of gifts.





2.32 The fixed observances are cleanline=
ss, contentment, austerity, study and persevering devotion to God.

2.34 Im=
proper thoughts and emotions such as those of violence- whether done, cause=
d to be done, or even approved of- indeed, any thought originating in desir=
e, anger or delusion, whether mild medium or intense- do all result in endl=
ess pain and misery. Overcome such distractions by pondering on the opposit=
es.





2.37 All jewels approach him who is confirmed in honesty.

2.38 Wh=
en one is confirmed in celibacy, spiritual vigor is gained.

2.39 When one =
is confirmed in non-possessiveness, the knowledge of the why and how of exi=
stence is attained.





2.40 From purity follows a withdrawal from enchant=
ment over one's own body as well as a cessation of desire for physical cont=
act with others.

2.41 As a result of contentment there is purity of mind, =
one-pointedness, control of the senses, and fitness for the vision of the s=
elf.





2.42 Supreme happiness is gained via contentment.

2.54 When the =
mind maintains awareness, yet does not mingle with the senses, nor the sens=
es with sense impressions, then self-awareness blossoms.





2.55 In this =
way comes mastery over the senses.

Part Three on Divine Powers

3.1 One-po=
intedness is steadfastness of the mind.

3.2 Unbroken continuation of that =
mental ability is meditation.





3.3 That same meditation when there is o=
nly consciousness of the object of meditation and not of the mind is realiz=
ation.

Part Four on Realizations





4.4 Created minds arise from egoism =
alone.

4.27 Distractions arise from habitual thought patterns when practic=
e is intermittent.


4.34 When the attributes cease mutative association wi=
th awarenessness, they resolve into dormancy in Nature, and the indweller s=
hines forth as pure consciousness. This is absolute freedom.
