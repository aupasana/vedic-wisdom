Chandra Prakash ji 

Thank you for posting an gem of an interview.Utpal ji =
thanks for that wonderful emotional mail .

Swami Chinmayananda is one of t=
hose rare individuals who falls in the same category of an Aurobindo or Viv=
ekananda. All of them never minced words and had a very clear idea of dharm=
a vs ahimsa and other puzzles. Narasimha ji had a beautiful mail sometime a=
go describing dharma ,it need not be a absence of fighting quality,when don=
e with a sense of purpose driven as an instrument in the hands of the mothe=
r goddess like a shivaji would it is still dharma.Swami Chinmayananda is an=
 perfect example to illustrate this. 

Anywaz Swami Chinmayananda saw the p=
artition of India at very close quarters and provided much needed critical =
leadership to the masses.Swamiji was also one of the founders of the Vishwa=
 Hindu Parishad ( One can view this event through biased lenses but the fac=
t remains the organization did a lot of good and still does ) 

Also their =
current Chinmaya mission does some amazing work both in the east and west.U=
nlike some other so called modern day gurus, swamiji never wastes any words=
 spinning melodramatic paragraphs and is precise to the point.

Regards
Vem=
parla Ram Kishore
