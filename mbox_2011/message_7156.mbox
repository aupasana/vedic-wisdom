Dear Shri Narasimha Ji,
  Namaskar, I was planning to do pitri tarpan today=
 accordingly to kind instructions for pitri tarpan set up by you. However t=
here are some restrictions on days to avoid doing this. I checked and today=
 was one of those nishedha days (sunday with moon in magha nakshatra). I wo=
uld like to know the reasons (astrological or vedic ) and reasoning behind =
it. 
Also, thank you very much to illuminate the world little by little. 

=
Regards
Kshroum
