 330 There is no creation apart from seeing; seeing and creation are one an=
d
the same. And because that seeing is due to ignorance, to cease seeing is=

the truth of the dissolution [of the world].

Maya is next explained.

331=
 It is the might of the Supreme Being, called maya, which takes the form
of=
 sense perceptions and thereby creates this varied world, which the
deluded=
 ones are persuaded is real.

Ignorance of the individual is related to the=
 power of illusion that belongs
to the Supreme Being. There is no other exp=
lanation of creation.

It is next shown that engaging in these enquiries po=
stpones the main thing,
the quest of the real Self, which is the principal =
thing to be engaged in.

322 Enquiring into unrealities, taking them to be =
real, leads to forgetting
the real [Self]. And there is no death other than=
 this forgetting, because
in this way the Self is almost lost to the seeker=
.

The urgency of seeking the Self is next pointed out.

333 If the aspiran=
t knows the Self in this [very] life, then and only then,
for him the real =
is real. If in this life he fails to know the Self, for him
the real [Self]=
 remains concealed by the unreal.

334 Therefore the aspirant, being firmly=
 convinced that space and time are
unreal, should give up the whole world a=
nd seek to know the substratum, the
Self, through the quest of his own true=
 nature.

The next topic dealt with is the duality of free will and fate.

=
335 Only he that thinks =E2=80=98I am the doer of actions and the recipient=
 of the
fruits of actions=E2=80=99 takes the distinction between the intell=
ect [will] and
fate as real. But the Self is neither the doer nor the recip=
ient of the
fruits of actions.

336 When the fruit of action is pleasant, m=
an thinks that will is stronger
than fate. But when the fruit of action is =
otherwise, he thinks that fate is
stronger.

That this difference is unreal=
 is then shown.

337 Fate is only action done before, and all action is don=
e by the will.
Hence the pair of will and fate is only unreal. How can thei=
r antagonism be
real?

338 Since the root of [both] will and fate is the eg=
o, this pair will cease
to appear when the ego dies in the pursuit of the q=
uest of the real Self.
[Hence,] the sage is not aware of the distinction be=
tween free will and
fate.

339 The sage, who is mind-free and hence free fr=
om attachments, and without
a [personal] will, does not become a doer of ac=
tions, nor does he reap the
fruits of actions. Therefore, he is not aware o=
f the distinction between
free will and fate.

340 Even in the case of an i=
gnorant one, the real Self is ever enlightened,
and hence does not engage i=
n actions, nor suffer delusion. But in its
presence the intellect becomes e=
ndowed with consciousness and is active
according to the qualities that dom=
inate it.

This is important. The real Self remains unaffected, being ever-=
free. It is
only the mind (or intellect) that is ignorant and bound.

341 T=
herefore the aspirant must cease from thoughts of the worldly life and
stri=
ve to become aware of the truth of the Self, which is the same as
Brahman, =
by means of the quest of that Self.

Then the truth about the individual so=
ul, which is called the jiva, is
discussed.

342 It is in the seer of the w=
orld, called the jiva, that the truth of the
world lies [because] when it a=
rises, the world also appears, and when it
goes into latency, the world als=
o does the same.

343 Therefore the sage, knowing the truth of the ego by t=
he direct
experience of the real Self, becomes aware of the truth of the wo=
rld. The
rest, being overwhelmed by the belief that the body is the Self, e=
ntertain a
false view of the world.

344 The soul is the primary form of ig=
norance. It is the sprout that grows
into the poison-tree of worldly life. =
All this world is only its expanded
form. The state of deliverance is just =
its final extinction.

345 The sage Buddha taught this truth; also the grea=
t teacher Sankara taught
the same; our own Guru also tells us the same; and=
 this is also the essence
of the Vedantas.

346 The soul, who is seer of th=
e world, is never known apart from his
spectacle, the world. There is no so=
ul in the state of deep sleep. Hence,
like his spectacle [the world], he al=
so is only a mental creation.

347 The soul is always known along with the =
body. Even when the body dies,
one does not leave it without taking hold of=
 another body.

348 Since thus the soul is not separable from the body, he =
is only part and
parcel of the world. But unenlightened men, who are discip=
les of
unenlightened gurus, ascribe immortality to this same [mythical] per=
son.

349 Assuming, without enquiry, that this soul is the owner of the bod=
y and
the real Self, they ascribe to that Self the qualities of worldliness=
 and
all else, which pertain only to this soul.

350 From this error arises=
 various creeds concerning the real Self, which
transcends all the creeds. =
Believing it to be bound, they follow various
paths of yoga to free it from=
 bondage!

351 The doing of actions, the reaping of their fruits, ownership=
 of the body
and the like, as well as worldliness, are the attributes of th=
e soul. They
are not attributes of the real Self, which is only pure consci=
ousness, and
is unrelated [to the world].

352 He that is, alas, persuaded =
that he is a soul has not eliminated the
notion that the body is himself, [=
because] for him who does not know [by
actual experience] that he is only c=
onsciousness, the belief in identity
with the body is inescapable.

353 Sin=
ce the blissful Self is experienced by all in the state of deep
sleep, the =
intelligent man is able to find out, by his subtle intellect,
that the Self=
 is other than the body.

354 Because of this the sensible man, when he eng=
ages in discrimination,
does not accept the notion that the Self is the bod=
y. But all the same,
because he has not attained awareness of the truth of =
the real Self, he
again confounds the Self with the body.

355 So long as t=
he sense of being a soul does not cease, the sense, =E2=80=98I am
the body=
=E2=80=99 does not become extinct. But it will be extinguished by attaining=

the supreme state, wherein the transcendent nature of the Self is
experien=
ced.

356 Only he is free from the notion, =E2=80=98I am the soul=E2=80=99,=
 by becoming aware of
his real Self as the Supreme Being, the one without a=
 second. He is also
free from the false notion =E2=80=98I am the body.=E2=
=80=99

357 The sadhaka must [therefore] understand that the Self is not th=
e body,
not the mind and not the soul, and thereafter, by following the pat=
h taught
by Ramana, strive to become aware [by experience] of the Self as p=
ure
consciousness.

358 If the truth of the soul is investigated with the p=
ure mind, in the
light of the teachings of the sages, it will be easily see=
n that this soul
exists because of the ignorance [of the true Self], and [h=
ence] does not
really exist at all.

359 Some think that there are two selv=
es, making a distinction between the
self that is the soul, and the Self th=
at is the Supreme Being. And they say
that the Supreme Being is the Self of=
 the soul, and the soul is the body of
the Supreme Being.

360 The selfhood=
 of the soul is unsteady and uncertain. The real Self is
only the Supreme B=
eing and nothing else. It has been clearly stated by our
Guru that the one =
called the soul is unreal, and that the Supreme Being
alone is the real Sel=
f.

361 The term =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99 implies unreality; the term =E2=80=
=98supreme=E2=80=99 implies reality.
The sadhaka, thus knowing that the sou=
l is unreal, should strive to get rid
of the notion, =E2=80=98I am the soul=
=E2=80=99.

362 [Also,] revelation says that the Supreme Being itself enter=
ed into the
bodies in the form of the soul. Hence, it is clear to us that t=
he soul is
not a distinct entity apart from the Supreme Being.

363 The sou=
l appears and vanishes; the real Self neither comes into being
nor vanishes=
. The souls are many, [but] the Supreme Being is only one. This
being so, h=
ow can the soul be the real Self?

364 The [real] Self, being real in its o=
wn right as pure consciousness, does
not become lost in deep sleep. But the=
 soul, being an outcome of ignorance,
and [hence] not real in its own right=
, goes into latency in deep sleep.

365 That Supreme Being, which is experi=
enced by all alike as pure happiness
in deep sleep, and which is the sole s=
urvivor in the supreme state, as the
one without a second, is the real Self=
.

366 The Self is declared to be the true meaning of the term =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99, because it
shines uninterruptedly both in the state of deep slee=
p in which the ego [the
soul] is latent, and in the supreme state in which =
the ego is dead once and
for all.

367 That one, which is Brahman, is itsel=
f ever shining as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 inside the
Heart as the Self. But, be=
cause of delusion, man confounds him with this
soul, who is only co-extensi=
ve with the body.

368 The ignorance does not hinder the awareness of =E2=
=80=98I am=E2=80=99. It hinders only
the awareness, =E2=80=98I am pure cons=
ciousness=E2=80=99. Every one is aware of his own
existence. But no one is =
aware of himself as distinct from the veiling
sheaths.

369 That Self which=
 is [only] consciousness, does not arise as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. The
inert =
body does not say =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. But between the two there arises som=
eone, who
is unreal, as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, having the size of the body.

=
370 By joining together the consciousness of the real Self, which has the
f=
orm of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, with the inert body, there arises the sense =E2=
=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99.
This sense is itself the soul.

371 Since it =
is believed to be real by confounding the body and the real
Self as one, th=
is soul, a false appearance due to ignorance, has the name,
=E2=80=98The kn=
ot binding together consciousness and the inert [body]=E2=80=99.

372 But t=
here never was a real joining of the real Self with the inert body,
nor did=
 anyone having the name =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99 really come into existence; =
nor did
=E2=80=98the All=E2=80=99 become changed into a soul.
