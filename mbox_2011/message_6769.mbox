O devis of the world! Should you not strive for the higher, the grand, the =
sublime, the only real life in the soul? Is it sufficient if you are satisf=
ied with the petty material necessities of life on earth? Do you remember w=
hat Maitreyi said to Yajnavalkya? =E2=80=9CWhat shall I do with that wealth=
 of this whole world if thereby I would not become immortal?=E2=80=9D said =
she to her husband. How many of the ladies of this world will be bold enoug=
h to assert this wise saying of the upanishadic ideal of a woman?
