The issue of "Arrangement" for a Homa is almost for everybody and i have al=
so gone trough it for quite sometime. I would like to suggest from my own m=
ethod which may help you bring down 20 minutes to 10Min.

1) First of all, =
It is advisable to avoid Aluminum Foil. Aluminum foil cutting for correct s=
ize and then adjusting on Homa kundam takes a good amount of time. I did it=
 for some 6 months initially and then there was a Message from Narasimha th=
at it is better to avoid Aluminum foil because Aluminum being a relatively =
modern metal and may carry Rahu's predominance. I stopped foil since then..=
.

2) No need to wash Homa Kundam every day. I do it once in a month or so.=
 Let it be black and dark.
 
If the above 2 points are observed, it can sav=
e some 5 to 7 minutes easily.

Now, one can do following arrangements previ=
ous nights (the people who do Homa in the morning)

-Empty the Homa Kundam =
and keep it clean (Tissue papers are very handy for this) and ready for nex=
t morning
- Keep the Dry Coconut pieces or Wood ready.
- Keep the Lamp read=
y with Wick
- Keep Camphor, Rice mixed with ghee and turmeric, Flowers,  et=
c... ready. (I do not use flowers any more. Use Akshatas mixed with Turmeri=
c as flowers..Bhagwan ko bolta hun BhavnaO ko Samjho! Phul ki jagape Chawal=
 se kaam chalalo:-)

So when I get ready for Homam, I just have to fill up =
the copper tumbler with water and heat up the ghee and few other such activ=
ities which takes around 5to7 Minutes in total.

Before i forget i must rem=
ind that there is no need to keep the Darbha in 4 directions every time. On=
e can keep those Darbhas at the same place as many days as possible.


Plea=
se ignore this Fool if the post did not make much sense.
Yours,

HavanOtpal=
