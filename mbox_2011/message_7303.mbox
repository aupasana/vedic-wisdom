      <p>Dear Narasimha,<br>
<br>
Our family sastrigal i=
s from Chennai. He taught me performing amavasai tarpanam. His instructions=
 are exactly the same as mentioned by Hiramalini S. He advised that THE SES=
AME SEEDS SHOULD NOT GERMINATE AND HENCE THROW THEM AWAY IN KITCHEN SINK WH=
ICH WILL END UP ULTIMATELY INTO FLOWING WATER. He advised throwing Pavitra =
and Tarbha into Trash so that no one incidentally does not walk on them.<br=
>


<br>
I also remember that Seasome seeds water was thrown in the first 1=
5 days and they germinated. He took those germinated leaves and offered the=
m in the homam. <br>
<br>
I look forward for your advice.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<=
