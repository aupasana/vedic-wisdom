Hello - Do we need to wipe the dust off the dry twigs before we offer them =
in homam ? I generally buy them in pooja stores, tear open the polythene wr=
ap if it is wrapper and just offer the same; sometimes I see they are mildl=
y dusty.

Also, between murmura and white til which is preferable for sAtvi=
k style of hOmam ?

regards
rAma
