Non-injuring has to be attained by him who would be free. No one is more po=
werful than he who has attained perfect non-injuring. No one could fight, n=
o one could quarrel, in his presence. Yes, his very presence, and nothing e=
lse, means peace, means love wherever he may be. Nobody could be angry or f=
ight in his presence. Even the animals, ferocious animals, would be peacefu=
l before him.
