Hi friends,

Probably I am asking a very basic question but I need to clari=
fy few doubts. Which is a better way to chant mantras. is chanting loudly (=
i've heard that mantras have sound energy) better than silently chanting th=
e mantra in the mind or is it the other way round? I like to silently chant=
 and meditate as I live with few other people and don't want to disturb oth=
ers who are not into meditation and spirituality. Kindly clarify.

Pramod
