ssion, self analysis, indecision, self healing, lacks courage, confidence, =
Laziness, High ego from before only.

For some specific questions i have al=
ready posted in Vedics astrolgy forum.

 last one year by PVR and his guidance.

I will appreciate if someone can s=
hare his experience with the homam, how has homam changed your life and Wha=
t all good it brought in your life.

ms of insecurity with future and cant muster courage to do homam with right=
 attitude.
