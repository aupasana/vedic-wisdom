Whether dualistic, qualified monistic, or monistic, they all firmly believe=
 that everything is in the soul itself; it has only to come out and manifes=
t itself. Therefore, this shraddha is what I want, and what all of us here =
want, this faith in ourselves, and before you is the great task to get that=
 faith. Give up the awful disease that is creeping, into our national blood=
, that idea of ridiculing everything, that loss of seriousness. Give that u=
p. Be strong and have this shraddha, and everything else is bound to follow=
.
