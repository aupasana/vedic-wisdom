Girish Ji

This question has been debated for quite some time in academic c=
ircles and also by historians and is also one of the cornerstone arguements=
 against the Aryan Invasion theory or for the AIT. This period of history i=
s very murky since it has its basis in the Sindhu Saraswati Civiization ( I=
 will not call it the Harappa Mohenjedaro civilization ) . The AIT proponen=
ts claim Brahmi owes its origins to the phoenician and Aramaic scripts of t=
he middle east and was carried by the invaders into India.

(There are simi=
larities but they were carried from India to the other world as Subhash Kak=
 and other researchers have shown ) 

The Anti AIT research shows it could =
have originated from the Sindhu Saraswati script which has not been deciphe=
red fully.  I strongly beleive the AIT is a huge theory foisted upon the hi=
ndus to discredit the value of the vedas and modern gene tracing research d=
one by Stephen Oppenheimer and others who collected of millions of gene sam=
ples to study this actually discredits the AIT.

The beauty of Sanskrit was=
 it being a oral living language rather than a written language and one of =
the many reasons could be the proper intonation and pronounciation emphasis=
 and also this gave it the ability to survive multiple invasions!!!! A lang=
uage that is not written anywhere will still stay alive even after the book=
s are burnt.

The atharva veda talks about Mandalas and the Yantras emerged=
 only later in the Tantra period ( 5th Century B.C) by the time Brahmi had =
emerged.I am not entirely sure of the above but other members can comment.
