Respected members,
1)In one of the messages I have come across that the alu=
minium foil should be avoided. While in the procedure given for hamam the h=
oma kund for better cleaning can be covered by aluminium foil. I am confuse=
d whether to use aluminium foil or not.
2)I have been doing homam after reg=
ular pooja. Can I do shodachopchar pooja before homam and keep the idol on =
the back side ( east of homa kund,- my deoghar is raised so that the idol o=
g ganapati is slightly above homam kunda)of homa kunda. And then follow the=
 regular procedure of homam. 
3)Beetal nut as poornahuti does not burn comp=
letely, so a piece of coconut is okay?
With regards,
madhusudan
