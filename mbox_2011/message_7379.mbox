Nama=
ste!
I am a rather 'heart driven' person; so I get very carried away by emo=
tion and use the tharpana op to not just say thrupyatha, but also kritajnat=
ha and aparaadhaan kshamaswa and a great big we-love-you to our dear depart=
ed pet parrot and our dear departed pet dog...I pour the water for all the =
same way- over thumb and over the web tween thumb n forefinger. Learned rea=
ders may please correct if something needs correction.

You do get nice dre=
ams and nice mental visions of some kith n kin; all in all it leaves you fe=
eling good.So dont worry too much about whats real and unreal; anyway all o=
f life is supposed to be a dream - in the waking state and in sleep.. As lo=
ng as your heart feels good its okay, is my humble opinion.

I use the whit=
e sesame seeds and pour them with shraddha into the sink; I hope the shradd=
ha will compensate for not pouring them into river/sea .. But what i unders=
tood from the correspondence of more learned and experienced people at vedi=
c wisdom is that its important that you take pains to pour the seeds into f=
lowing water and ensure they dont sprout; something like doing duty without=
 attachment so that u dont incur karma???

Finally I offer the water to eve=
ry soul gone by, for they are all divya athma swaroopalaara in the precious=
 name of my Guru-God, Who to me is Paramathma swaroopa, and of Whom all who=
 ever were, are and will be, are an inseparable part... By this time I am g=
enerally too overwhelmed with love and gratitude and a sense of oneness to =
chant anything properly !! Not much of a proper tharpana! But thats all am =
able to do ! I feel very happy though at the end of it all ; hope all the s=
ouls remembered feel that way too.. !!!

dunno if this helped you or if i j=
ust confused you even more ! But our learned readers may have some answers =
and i look fwd to hearing from them; and that includes Narasimhagaru=C2=A0 =
... once again Narasimhagaaru, thankyou so much for being there for all of =
us..


And once again, all at vedic-wisdom, thankyou so much for getting me=
 started on tharpana; it has added so much value to my life !
