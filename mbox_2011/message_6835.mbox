Namaste Shris,

Thanks for the pointers, i do have a very close friend in 
SanskritBharathi who are very active.

But pardon my insistence, is there some sort of book that i can take as 
a self study guide so to speak and progress from there? Maybe 
SanskritBharathi's course material is the answer maybe not. The only 
thing is i doubt i can attend the classes regularly especially if they 
are in person.

Thanks again,

Chaitanya
