Sadhana for Forty Days

by Swami Sivananda

You will have to do Japa of Ram=
a Mantra one lakh and twenty-five thousand times in the following manner fo=
r 40 days, at the rate of 3000 daily. During the last five days do 4000 dai=
ly. Get up at 4.00 a.m. Write down in a thin paper Rama Nama 3000 times. Th=
en cut the paper into small pieces. Each piece will contain one Rama Nama. =
Then roll it with a small ball of Atta (wheat flour paste). Writing will ta=
ke two or three hours according to your strength and capacity. Then you wil=
l have to cut one by one. You will have to do the whole process by sitting =
on one Asana. If you will find it difficult to sit on one Asana you can hav=
e change of Asana. But you should not leave your seat. Some use a special i=
nk made up of saffron, musk, camphor, etc., and a special writing pen made =
up of sharp pointed thin Tulasi stick. You can use ordinary ink and pen if =
you cannot get the above special ink and special pen. You will have to do A=
nushthana on the bank of the Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Kaveri or Narmada, at=
 Rishikesh, Varanasi, Haridwar or Prayag. You can do it at home, if you fin=
d it difficult to come to these places. Take milk and fruit or Phalahar dur=
ing these days. Throw the ball in the Ganga or any river for fishes. You wi=
ll develop wonderful patience. You will get divine grace.

Study the whole =
Ramayana 108 times with purity and concentration. This can be done in three=
 years if you can devote three hours daily. You can go through the whole bo=
ok three times in a month. You will acquire Siddhis. You will have Darshan =
of Lord Rama.
