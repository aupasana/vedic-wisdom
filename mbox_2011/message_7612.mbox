Namaste, 

Few doubts as i am about to start LNH recitations for lunar ecli=
pse.

Well this is the first time i am gogin to do prolonged recitation, so=
 lots of questions, please pardon.

1. Do i have to read nyaas/dhyan with e=
very recitation of LNH? both LH n NH have different nyaas/dhyan?
2. Daily i=
 read VS n L108 names as regular practice, can i read them after each LNH r=
ecitation or just once at the end?
3. Also daily i read namah to the satyan=
arayan parivar devata, mentioned by PVR long back in this forum. Do i read =
this also after every recitation?
4. VS has its own viniyog, nyaas and dhya=
n. do i read this as main strotra i am reading is LNH?
5. Is there any laxm=
i narayan mantra? i heard "om shreem kleem lakshmi narayanaye namah"

appre=
ciate all the guidance.

regards
priyank
