 447 Through the destruction of maya the aspirant for deliverance becomes
e=
stablished in his true state. Even the sage does not know its true nature
b=
ecause it perishes when looked at.

This is the meaning of a verse from the=
 Yoga Vasishta. Strictly speaking,
maya is the totality of samsara, consist=
ing of the ignorance, which is the
ego-sense, and its expanded form, the mi=
nd and its creation, the universe.
These do not survive in the true state o=
f the real Self.

448 The Supreme Being did not become mind, neither did it=
 become the world.
It remains unswerving from its true nature as pure, unmo=
dified,
consciousness, transcending time, space and the rest.

449 The worl=
d did not come into being, nor is it going to be destroyed. No
one called =
=E2=80=98the individual self=E2=80=99 was really born. There is no one in
b=
ondage, no one who has become free, nor is there any spiritual seeker. This=

is the most excellent truth that has been clarified.

This is the truth of=
 non-becoming, demonstrated by the sage Gaudapadacharya,
in his Mandukya Ka=
rikas, which is strictly in agreement with the experience
of all the sages.=
 This is further explained.

450 Just as the supporting screen is not affec=
ted by the series of pictures
passing over it, so the Supreme Being is not =
affected, even while the cinema
of the world is being seen.

This is what B=
hagavan says at the very beginning of Ulladu Narpadu (Forty
Verses), where =
he employs the simile of the cinema show. The show begins
with a lighted sc=
reen. On this is projected a series of pictures passing at
great speed, so =
that the pictures are not seen separately. The screen does
not become wet b=
y the appearance of water, nor is it burned by an appearance
of fire. At th=
e end of the show the lighted screen alone remains. Such is
the world-show.=
 The lighted screen represents the real Self, which is both
reality and con=
sciousness.

451 This truth of non-becoming has been unmistakably stated ma=
ny times by
the great Guru Sankaracharya. Also, Sri Ramana, the Guru, has s=
tated this
truth clearly in a variety of ways for the benefit of aspirants.=


452 Indeed it has been said by him that the so-called fourth state is alo=
ne
real, and that the other three [the states of waking, dream and dreamles=
s
sleep] are always unreal. Also, it has been declared by him that the real=
 is
always only one, and that multiplicity is always unreal.

This has been=
 set forth in detail in the very beginning. The truth of
non-becoming is im=
plicit in these teachings.

453 =E2=80=98There is nothing real apart from y=
ou. You are one alone, transcending
time, space and so on. Throw off the de=
lusion of ignorance and remain at
peace.=E2=80=99 Thus did he teach the sta=
te of true being, the Self.

454 =E2=80=98In truth the creatures are not in=
 me; all this is only my maya=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 thus
did Bhagavan Krishna =
himself tell the truth of the non-becoming of the real
Self in the Gita.

4=
55 =E2=80=98The supreme reality, without losing its fullness of being, by i=
ts own
maya, became this complete universe. To the sage it appears only as
=
fullness.=E2=80=99 Thus the Upanishad has stated the truth on non-becoming.=


Now are given the five verses of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Tamil Ekatma Panchaka=
m.

456 When, forgetting the Self, one thinks that the body is oneself and =
goes
through innumerable births and in the end remembers and becomes the Se=
lf,
know this is only like awakening from a dream wherein one has wandered =
all
over the world.

In a dream one may go on a world-tour and in the dream=
 itself return home
and lie down in one=E2=80=99s own bed; but when one awa=
kes one knows that it was all
a dream. In the same way all of one=E2=80=99s=
 samsaric reincarnations are only a
long-drawn out dream, at the end of whi=
ch only the Self remains, unaffected
by all this. There is a difference her=
e, because it was not the Self that
dreamed, but only the ego-mind.

In the=
 second verse the quest of =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 is ridiculed, logica=
lly enough.

457 One ever is the Self. To ask oneself =E2=80=98Who and wher=
eabouts am I?=E2=80=99 is like
the drunken man enquiring, =E2=80=98Who am I=
?=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Where am I?=E2=80=99

Here the difference is that t=
he drunken man puts the question to others, but
the sadhaka puts the questi=
on to his own ignorant, false self. The real Self
remains unaffected all th=
e time.

458 The body is within the Self. And yet one thinks one is inside =
the inert
body, like some spectator who supposes that the screen on which t=
he film is
thrown is within the picture.

Herein the relation of supporter =
and the supported is turned topsy-turvy.

459 Does the ornament of gold exi=
st apart from the gold? Can the body exist
apart from the Self? The ignoran=
t one thinks =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. The
enlightened one knows =E2=
=80=98I am the Self=E2=80=99.

Here the truth is that the one Self is the s=
ubstratum of all appearances.
This has been explained before. In the true s=
tate there is no
superimposition, only the substratum remains, but it is no=
 longer a
substratum.

460 The Self alone, the sole reality, exists forever=
. If of yore the first
of teachers revealed it through unbroken silence, sa=
y, who can reveal it in
spoken words?

So this is the rationale of the sile=
nt teaching by God as Dakshinamurti, the
first Guru. Rightly to teach the S=
elf is to be perfectly quiet. That is
teaching by being only the Self, with=
out ego and without mind. He who
likewise remains as the Self, mind-free an=
d egoless, understands this silent
teaching.

Thus the truth of non-becomin=
g is confirmed.

The knowledge thus far imparted is only preparatory to the=
 teaching of the
means of obtaining the right awareness. It is not itself t=
hat awareness.

461 Even though the truth of the Self has been stated in ma=
ny ways, it
remains untold, because it can be known only by actual experien=
ce. For the
aspirant to deliverance, that experiential awareness of the Sel=
f is
prevented by the mind, and its firmly established conviction, =E2=80=
=98I am the
body=E2=80=99.

462 Those minds that have been purified from wo=
rldly attachments immediately
get firmly established in the natural state o=
f the real Self merely by
listening to this truth. Others need to go throug=
h some excellent process
for the extinction of the ego sense.

463 =E2=80=
=98One should seek the Self, which is pure and free from sorrow, with a
fir=
m resolve to know it. This is the way to peace.=E2=80=99 In such terms do t=
he
ancient revelation and the Guru describe the direct path for the experie=
nce
of the truth of the real Self.

464 The =E2=80=98resolve to know=E2=80=
=99 mentioned here is the firm intention to win the
experience of one=E2=80=
=99s own Self. Only by having such an intention can the
aspirant turn his m=
ind inwards in the quest for his own Self.

465 In the ancient revelation i=
t is mentioned that the dwelling place of the
supreme one is named the Hear=
t. Since he himself [the supreme one] is all
there is, how can the Heart be=
 designated as his dwelling place?

The explanation follows.

466 The real =
Heart is just consciousness in its native purity. The Self is
also that con=
sciousness. So, it follows that the Self is itself the Heart,
and all creat=
ion is established in it.

467 The sages and the Vedanta teach that the one=
 who really has no dwelling
place has a dwelling place called the Heart ins=
ide the body in order to
cause the inward-turning of the mind in the quest.=


The necessity of this inward turning is then shown.

468 The organs of pe=
rception are always turned outwards, and this is the
reason why the Self is=
 covered over by the world. There is only one means to
uncover it: the aspi=
rant turning within in a quest for the Self.

This is the meaning of an upa=
nishadic verse.

469 The experience of the sages has shown the difference b=
etween bondage and
deliverance. The bound one suffers from the arising of t=
he ego sense,
whereas the ego sense does not arise in the case of the one w=
ho is free.

470 Though the great being, the Self, is ever present, dearly =
beloved and of
great effulgence, it is as if its effulgence is dimmed by th=
e evil one, the
ego, so that it does not shine sufficiently enough to be re=
cognised.

471 Ignorance is the awareness that consists of the experience =
=E2=80=98I am the
body=E2=80=99. How can this experiential awareness be a d=
efinitive knowledge, since
it is without the experiential awareness, =E2=80=
=98I am the pure consciousness?=E2=80=99

Because ignorance, which is itsel=
f bondage, consists in an experiential
awareness, even though wrong, it can=
 be extinguished only by the right
awareness, which is also an experience. =
Mere inferential knowledge, usually
called knowledge of something absent =
=E2=80=93 parokshajnanam =E2=80=93 is wholly
ineffectual for winning delive=
rance. The sadhana as taught by Bhagavan is
the direct path to that experie=
nce. This sadhana will now be explained.

472 The thought that arises in th=
e form =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 is itself the form
in which the indi=
vidual soul is experienced. The aspirant must seek the
source wherefrom it =
arises, after separating from it the fraction of it that
is real.

473 This=
 individual is not altogether unreal. He is not so in the same sense
as the=
 barren woman=E2=80=99s son is unreal. The real Self is present as the
subs=
tratum on which the sense of an individual soul is superimposed, and
hence,=
 even though unreal, he is taken to be real.

This distinction is very impo=
rtant, as it will be seen. Everyone knows that
there is no barren woman=E2=
=80=99s son, mare=E2=80=99s horn, and so on, because these
notions have no =
substratum.

On the other hand, the rope-snake, the silver in the mother-of=
-pearl, etc.,
are capable of being imagined to be seen, because these have =
a substratum,
as explained before. So the individual soul comes to be taken=
 as existing,
though he really does not exist, as taught before.

The quest=
ion then is what is the substratum on which the appearance of an
individual=
 soul is superimposed. This and other pertinent questions are
answered in t=
he verses that follow.

474 The real element of the soul, the =E2=80=98I=E2=
=80=99, is consciousness, the nature of
the real Self. By taking hold of th=
is real element, the seeker of
deliverance is enabled to engage in the ques=
t of the Self.

475-7 Give up the element of unreality of this soul, the bo=
dy and all the
rest of it, and fix the mind on the consciousness of the Sel=
f that has the
form of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. This is extremely subtle, like =
a ray of the real Self. The
seeker should then dive into the Heart, seeking=
 the place of birth of this
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-sense by asking the questio=
n =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98Whence is this =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=
=9D?=E2=80=99 This
is the way a dog rejoins his master, seeking him by foll=
owing his scent. It
is like a diver diving into water to recover something =
that has fallen
there. This is the way to attain one=E2=80=99s own real sta=
te.

478 If during this quest of one=E2=80=99s own Self, the mind turns out=
wards, due to
attachment to sense objects, the seeker should turn it inward=
s again by
merging the world in the Self.

This is explained next.

479 =E2=
=80=98Just as waves, foam, etc., are only the ocean, and as the dream-world=

is only the seer of the dream, and nothing else, so the whole world is onl=
y
myself and nothing else.=E2=80=99 This view is the merging of the world i=
n the Self.

480 If during the quest of one=E2=80=99s own Self the mind tur=
ns outwards on account
of its attachment to objects of perception, the seek=
er should turn it
inwards again. He should bring the mind back again and ag=
ain and re-engage
it in the quest. There must be a resolve to become aware =
of the truth of
oneself by means of the question, =E2=80=98Who is he that h=
as this attachment to
objects of perception?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=99 Thus the Upanishad has stated the truth on non-becoming.<br>

<br>471 Ignorance is the awareness that consists of the ex=
perience =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. How can this experiential awarene=
ss be a definitive knowledge, since it is without the experiential awarenes=
s, =E2=80=98I am the pure consciousness?=E2=80=99<br>

<br>Because ignoranc=
e, which is itself bondage, consists in an experiential awareness, even tho=
ugh wrong, it can be extinguished only by the right awareness, which is als=
o an experience. Mere inferential knowledge, usually called knowledge of so=
mething absent =E2=80=93 parokshajnanam =E2=80=93 is wholly ineffectual for=
 winning deliverance. The sadhana as taught by Bhagavan is the direct path =
to that experience. This sadhana will now be explained.<br>

<br><span styl=
e=3D"font-weight:bold">472 The thought that arises in the form =E2=80=98I a=
m the body=E2=80=99 is itself the form in which the individual soul is expe=
rienced. The aspirant must seek the source wherefrom it arises, after separ=
ating from it the fraction of it that is real.</span><br>

<br>473 This ind=
ividual is not altogether unreal. He is not so in the same sense as the bar=
ren woman=E2=80=99s son is unreal. The real Self is present as the substrat=
um on which the sense of an individual soul is superimposed, and hence, eve=
n though unreal, he is taken to be real.<br>

<br>This distinction is very =
important, as it will be seen. Everyone knows that there is no barren woman=
=E2=80=99s son, mare=E2=80=99s horn, and so on, because these notions have =
no substratum.=C2=A0<br><br>On the other hand, the rope-snake, the silver i=
n the mother-of-pearl, etc., are capable of being imagined to be seen, beca=
use these have a substratum, as explained before. So the individual soul co=
mes to be taken as existing, though he really does not exist, as taught bef=
ore.<br>

<br>The question then is what is the substratum on which the appe=
arance of an individual soul is superimposed. This and other pertinent ques=
tions are answered in the verses that follow.<br><br>474 The real element o=
f the soul, the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, is consciousness, the nature of the re=
al Self. By taking hold of this real element, the seeker of deliverance is =
enabled to engage in the quest of the Self.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-we=
ight:bold">475-7 Give up the element of unreality of this soul, the body an=
d all the rest of it, and fix the mind on the consciousness of the Self tha=
t has the form of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. This is extremely subtle, like a ray=
 of the real Self. The seeker should then dive into the Heart, seeking the =
place of birth of this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-sense by asking the question =E2=
=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98Whence is this =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D?=E2=
=80=99 This is the way a dog rejoins his master, seeking him by following h=
is scent. It is like a diver diving into water to recover something that ha=
s fallen there. This is the way to attain one=E2=80=99s own real state.</sp=

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">478 If during this quest of o=
ne=E2=80=99s own Self, the mind turns outwards, due to attachment to sense =
objects, the seeker should turn it inwards again by merging the world in th=
e Self.</span><br>

<br>This is explained next.<br><br>479 =E2=80=98Just as=
 waves, foam, etc., are only the ocean, and as the dream-world is only the =
seer of the dream, and nothing else, so the whole world is only myself and =
nothing else.=E2=80=99 This view is the merging of the world in the Self.<b=
