Namaste PVR ji,

Just today i did a homam with Narayan hrudayam for first t=
ime, i didnt know meaning or essense of it. at the back of my mind there wa=
s strong urge to know the essense of naryana. I also consciously asked Nara=
yan that i dont know if you(narayan) like this text or not, so let me know.=
 Just now when i saw your post i was overwhelmed with joy to see his/her gr=
ace in action.

After reading this post of yours i know the essense of nara=
yan and the fact that he loves Narayan hrudayam. 
- In this situation i can=
t help questioning whether i am doing homam/puja/devotion or he is getting =
it all done.


Form your post I can see clearly the limitations of our cond=
itioning. the need for both theoretical understanding and surrender is also=
 aptly summarized by you. 


Question
- How does one directly generate imme=
nse love/devotion/surrender? it will be nice if you can share your learning=
 on this.


regards
Priyank
