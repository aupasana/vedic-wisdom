Namaste Narasimhaji,

This is my first post, I'm a silent member of Vedic  =
Wisdom, i read all the
posts and thankful to all the members of this group.=


I have a query regarding reading Durga sapthashati.

My query is i have a=
 desire to read durga sapthashati, this has been there
since more than a ye=
ar or two. I got the book last year, but i still haven't
started reading.

=
The reason being i've come across all your posts and people responding to
y=
our posts, i.e whether a person who has not been initiated could read or
sh=
ould not read. I'm not able to conclude, even now i'm reading the post and
=
text by Dr. Sathya Prakash Choudhary, but still unable to conclude.

I've r=
ead that people should be very careful while reading Durga
Sapthashati, i d=
on't know to what extent and what could be the consequences

I do read Adit=
ya Hrudayam, Srisuktham, Vishnu Sahasranamam, Lalitha
Sahasranamam, Lalitha=
 Trishati. I don't know how i started reading, no body
guided me or initiat=
ed me how to read but i read it easily, whenever i do
prayer i ask for for =
well being of all the people i know, sometimes just
blessings and sometimes=
 i don't even ask anything.

I try to follow reading for one deity continuo=
usly for N number of days,
then start reading for other deities and follow =
the same rule.

*About me: I'm a bachelor aged about 28*

My questions

1. =
Should i start reading Durga Sapthashati.
2. If so what are the do's and do=
n'ts .

Finally the process to read, i read the book and as per it, it is

=

=95 Kavacham
=95 Argala Stotra
=95 Keelakam
=95 Navakshari japam
=95 Ratri=
 Suktam
=95 Devi Mahatmyam
=95 Navakshari mantra japam
=95 Devi Suktam
=95 =
Rahasya trayam
=95 Kshama Prarthan

Does it require the above process to be=
 followed strictly to read single
adhyaya per day or it's ok to just read t=
he chapter without above process.
Or in other ways what all should be read =
if i read a single chapter a day.

Apart from these questions can a person =
read Laitha Sahasranaama / Trishati
after reading Vishnu Sahasranama or vic=
e versa.

Best Wishes,
Balaji
