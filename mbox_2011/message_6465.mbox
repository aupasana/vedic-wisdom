Namaste all,

I am a beginner in sadhana/prayer and hence have limited unde=
rstanding on many aspects. i am summarising what i have understood/ felt so=
 far.

All the good stuff is summary of narasimha's advice and all the wron=
g/limited notions are mine. 

Will appreciate if anyone feels i need to foc=
us/ understand more on any aspect. 


* * * 

Continuing on the lines of wh=
at Narasimha has written many times that planets are aspects of our own con=
sciousness. hence their combination will give us our own personal blend of =
gunas (satvik, rajasik and tamasik). 

Ideally we should increase our satvi=
ktta so that it guides us automatically (like in the 3 thief story of ramak=
rishna).

Now for a person who is bogged down with issues internal or exter=
nal is bascially because of tamasic guna itself. Rajasic will give you more=
 attachment. Satavik will give you right direction.

In my opinion it becom=
es imperative for anyone to achieve this internal harmony asap so that the =
true sadhana can start. 

* * *

Ultimately all this doesnt matter if you h=
ave crossed a certain threshold within when you have generated a strong rel=
ationship with a diety. It has to be strong relationship for which you will=
 have to do sadhana. At that time that Diety fills the space of your consci=
ousness and at that time all the other centers of consciousness (planets/gu=
nas) will be all in harmony.

* * * 

now the important question for me is =
how to reach that threshold point where your gunas/planets/consciousness ge=
ts balanced/harmonised.
now most of the people. 

Ans a - Do homam daily fo=
r your ishta diety, thats the most powerful way.


Ans b- (In case you are =
not able to homam)
Following is my based on my limited understanding

1. Ch=
oose one isht dev and chant his mantras as much as possible. 
2. Chant om a=
im hrim shrim atleast 108 times twice daily(this will balance the 3 gunas d=
irectly)
3. Add navarna mantra 108 times twice daily so that the tamasic gu=
na gets balanced asap.

* * *

The most important thing remains the develop=
ment of Devotion/Bhav and 
seeing/feeling ur ishta devata in everything aro=
und.


all comments/pointers welcome 

regards
priyank
