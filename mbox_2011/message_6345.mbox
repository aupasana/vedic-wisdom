Respected PVR, 

I think you will be the best person to throw some light on=
 following


1. Seeing one kundali, suppose there is a particular strong ne=
gative aspect, lets say xxx planet and the deity related to that is YYY, Wh=
at is better for him praying to YYY or some other Diety which he feels more=
 inclined to?

Is duality stronger than the non-dual aspect? In other words=
 Should a problem addressed specifically or devotion to any god covers all.=



2. Rammana, Vivekananda, Ramkrishna all suffered from cancer, 
I am 100%=
 sure they could have cured themselves, then why they didn't?


3. Praying,=
 spirituality does heal and help a lot of issues, but in the case of great =
masters like above I think they went through more suffering than normal in =
their general life. Whats the background behind this?

regards
Priyank
