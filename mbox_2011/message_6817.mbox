Respected Narasimhaji & Members,
=A0To clarify in the beginning with deep r=
espect to all : I have no intention of fuelling the current discussion on B=
hagwaan Shiva.
My request is to invite your views and others about the appa=
rent contradictions in the portrayal of Bhagwaan Shiva :
=A0
For example - =
he is considered Smashhanwasi=A0 or Kailaaspati (desolate and uninviting pl=
aces) yet is the shelter of one of the most beautiful celestial object visi=
ble from earth=A0(Moon) and one of the most purifying waterbody for Hindus =
(Bhaagirathi-Gangaa).
Without elaborating such contradictions -jsut wish to=
 state that he is=A0'Ajanmaa' yet=A0a symbol of fertility and parallelly pi=
ctured as the most ascetic of ascetics=A0!!! He is also worshipped as 
Natr=
aaj- the patron of Performing arts and is also an object of worship for see=
kers of Sciences.
I refer here the book : Tao of Physics by renowned partic=
le physicist Fritjof Kapra.
=A0
My request to learned members is to elabora=
te on the mixing of Dravidian and Aryan Symbolism in Bhagwaan Shiva's portr=
ayal in traditional mindset.
I have read long time back that when Aryan's c=
ame to Bhaarat(India) they had altered this chracterization of Bhagwaan Shi=
va to erase the Dravid culture and worship practices but could not succeed =
completely in changing the Snake worship and Shiva Puja traditions.
What I =
had read years back may also be a biased version-hence this request.
=A0
Ap=
ologies for any transgressions in writing this lines -as this may be result=
 of my own ignorance and I bow to all seekers.
=A0
Namaskkaram,
amit=A0=A0=
=A0

Namaste,

>>=A0 Maa lakshmi and lord Vishnu are cons=
idered as rajasik deity. Lord 
>> Brahma and maa Sarasvati are considered a=
s Sattavik.

Vishnu is pure sattwa. Creator Brahma OTOH is not saattwik as =
you say, 
but raajasik. Creation or any expansive process is raajasik, wher=
eas 
sustaining an equilibrium in a stable manner is sattwa. Vishnu's 1000 =

names includes "sattwavaan" and "saattwikaH".

Saptashati rahasya also des=
cribes how the original energy of the cosmos 
(Aadyaa Mahalakshmi) divided =
herself into 3 portions - Mahalakshmi, 
Mahasaraswati and MahaKali with sat=
twa, rajas and tamas.

>> As Brahma is considered as aim of sattvik methodo=
logies

Brahman or Aatman or Self considered the ultimate aim is Nirguna, i=
.e. 
beyond gunas. That's different from Creator Brahma.

>> These ten maha=
vidiyas along with their consorts such as Shiva, 
>> Bhairava, Mahakala
>> =
are considered as the chief deity in various left handed literature.

Not a=
ll mahavidyas are worshipped in the left handed way. For example, 
Kamala (=
MahaLakshmi), Lalita Tripurasundari and Bhuvaneswari ARE 
worshipped using =
right handed tantra. Even Kali has forms (e.g. 
Bhadrakali) worshipped usin=
g right-handed tantra, though there exist 
forms worshipped using left-hand=
ed tantra.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

Finally, one should realiz=
e that deities are made of very light/thin 
conditioning, compared to us. T=
he tamas in a human being is far 
different from that as it applies to a de=
ity. Ruthlessly killing a 
person is different from ruthlessly killing a we=
akness such as lust or 
anger. Even if borth require the same guna, the nat=
ure of the guna is 
different in both.

This is what I mentioned as the 3x3=
 matrix of gunas mentioned by 
Vasishtha in Yoga Vaasishtham to describe th=
e difference between various 
deities, human beings and demons!

Anybody wh=
o thinks that Kaali or Taaraa or Chhinnamastaa or Shiva or 
Durga or Rudra =
are taamasik like "demons" is in terrible 
misunderstanding.

Best regards,=

Narasimha

V>
<DIV> To clarify in the beginning with deep respect to all : I have=
 no intention of fuelling the current discussion on Bhagwaan Shiva.</DIV>
<=
DIV>My request is to invite your views and others about the apparent contra=
dictions in the portrayal of Bhagwaan Shiva :</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=
For example - he is considered Smashhanwasi  or Kailaaspati (desolate =
and uninviting places) yet is the shelter of one of the most beautiful cele=
stial object visible from earth (Moon) and one of the most purifying w=
aterbody for Hindus (Bhaagirathi-Gangaa).</DIV>
<DIV>Without elaborating su=
ch contradictions -jsut wish to state that he is 'Ajanmaa' yet a =
symbol of fertility and parallelly pictured as the most ascetic of ascetics=
 !!! He is also worshipped as </DIV>
<DIV>Natraaj- the patron of Perfo=
rming arts and is also an object of worship for seekers of Sciences.</DIV>
=
<DIV>I refer here the book : Tao of Physics by renowned particle physicist =
Fritjof Kapra.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>My request to learned members i=
s to elaborate on the mixing of Dravidian and Aryan Symbolism in Bhagwaan S=
hiva's portrayal in traditional mindset.</DIV>
<DIV>I have read long time b=
ack that when Aryan's came to Bhaarat(India) they had altered this chracter=
ization of Bhagwaan Shiva to erase the Dravid culture and worship practices=
 but could not succeed completely in changing the Snake worship and Shiva P=
uja traditions.</DIV>
<DIV>What I had read years back may also be a biased =
version-hence this request.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Apologies for any =
transgressions in writing this lines -as this may be result of my own ignor=
ance and I bow to all seekers.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
