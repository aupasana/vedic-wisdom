Namaste Narasimha Rao Ji,

I realise that you have made it clear several ti=
mes before in this group that 
the art of achieving specific goals from sad=
hana is practically lost. I know 
someone whose daughter is suffering from =
mental disorder/depression. She 
has=A0generally had a weak mind but the si=
tuation right now is quite bad.
Time and again it has been emphasized that =
homa helps overcome/destroy previous 
bad karmas and such mental conditions=
 are nothing but a result of previous bad 
karmas. If homa is to be perform=
ed, for which deity would you recommend in this 
situation? Just to let you=
 know, their favorite deity is Ganapati, so I am 
thinking Ganapati homa sh=
ould be enough but your opinion in this matter would be 
nice.

Thanks,
Bhu=
pendra
