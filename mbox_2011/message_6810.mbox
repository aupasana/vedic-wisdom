Sannyasa is the fourth ashrama of life. It is, in other words, the upanisha=
dic life. It is the life of renunciation. It is the last of the four ashram=
as. In none of these stages should a person grasp at the duties of the othe=
r three. He should stick to the dharma of his own particular ashrama.

=E2=
=80=9CAhimsa paramo dharmah=E2=80=9D cannot be strictly practiced by househ=
olders. It can be practiced by sannyasins who tread the nivritti marga.Real=
 sannyasins do not defend themselves even when their lives are in danger, b=
ecause, they know that existence is in reality changeless. A sannyasin is o=
ne who has no body, and who identifies himself with Brahman or the atman.
