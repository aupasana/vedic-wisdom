Thankyou for this info.

Since have no knowledge of astrology so would like=
 to know if the effect is only in the region it occurs or for full earth.

The solar eclise of 24 is visible from high latitudes in the Southern Hemi=

 New Zealand.

And also the Lunar eclipse of 10 dec is not full in both Ind=
ia n US
