namaste,

o offer.


Another related question that I haven't heard on this forum is "=
how to
make ghee". I'm guessing that most people either buy ghee, or melt i=
t
on a stove. There is another option that I use -- a small crock pot.

Mat=
erials:
(a) Glass jar that will fit a standard 16oz block of butter e.g.
"P=
resso Storage Jars, 2.5 liters".
(b) A small crock pot that will fit the gl=
ass jar e.g. "Little Dipper
Warmer Crock Pot".
(c) butter e.g. individually=
 wrapped 16 oz bricks.


All you have to do is unwrap 1 or 2 of the 16 oz b=
ricks of butter and
put it in the glass jar. Put the jar in the crock pot a=
nd cover it. In
the morning (i.e. 4-6 hours later), you'll have ghee with s=
ome curds
at the bottom. You can carefully pour out the ghee into another v=
essel
and throw out the curds at the bottom with very little waste. There i=
s
no need for a strainer or anything else if you are careful.

The glass bo=
ttle and relatively low heat make it easy to clean up.
Since the ghee has b=
een slowly melted over a period of time, it
retains the heat for much longe=
r when compared to microwaving it. If
you have left over ghee, you can simp=
ly put it in any glass bottle
that will fit in the crock pot, and then reme=
lt it overnight for the
next morning.

This is the simplest, cleanest, chea=
pest solution that I've come
across. If there are any other methods, please=
 share ...
