=C2=A0 
For the last 3 days I have =
been doing the same, never used aluminium foil and am not planning to use a=
lso. But still, today being a working day, I put some time limit and was no=
t too convinced with the way the homam went today. The dry coconuts were no=
t catching fire (unlike the twigs I used the last 2 days) and the fire went=
 off twice before I put camphor to reignite. 
Anyways, I am planning to do =
the homam in the weekends only unless I get to know how I can manage sandhy=
avandanam along with homam ! 
Previously I was able to do Gayatri mantra an=
d HareKrsna mahamantra in 90 mins or 100 mins and that was all completely m=
antras.
Then, I started sandhya vandanam along with Harekrsna mahamantra an=
d my mahamantra numbers came down to accommodate the rituals of sandhya van=
danam.
Today (unliked the weekend where I took more than 2 hours), I realiz=
ed neither I have done sandhya vandanam properly nor the homam properly to =
accommodate both of them. Not sure if I should do daily homam if the main p=
art of the prayers go in worrying about the agni in the kundam !

My rantin=
g aside, do we need to further dry the dry coconuts; not sure why the small=
 1x1 pieces did not burn well. The final poornahuti has burnt well with hal=
f dry coconut. I use good amount of ghee and I am not sure if that much is =
needed as most of it simply flows down.

Lastly, I tried in some shops yes'=
day and everyone is selling iron homa kundam only and they reply back that =
copper is not used !!

Thanks Ajit for your responses again.

Thanks VPatha=
k.

regards
rAma
