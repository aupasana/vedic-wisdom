Namaste,

While doing homam , i keep moving the copra pieces so that they c=
atch fire properly and pieces do not remains unburnt. In the past twice or =
thrice, 1 or 2 pieces fell out of the homam kund while i was moving them. I=
 picked them up and again kept in the kund. Is this correct  or we should d=
iscard those pieces which fall out.

Regards
Jitender
