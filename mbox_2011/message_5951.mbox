Thankyou so much for providing excellent guideline and remin=
ding that "above all, attitude of surrender is the main thing"

somewhere that the havan samagri contains the flower and spices which are d=
ear to the planets. Ofcourse it depends on the brand of havan samagri. not =
sure about this though

Akshay
