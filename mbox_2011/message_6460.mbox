What do scriptures say about sannyasa?

The Narayana Upanishad says: =E2=80=
=9CNot by works, not by progeny, not by wealth, but by renunciation alone i=
s immortality attained!=E2=80=9D 

=E2=80=9CThere is no hope of immortality=
 through wealth,=E2=80=9D said Yajnavalkya to Maitreyi.

Manu says in his S=
mriti: =E2=80=9COf all Dharmas, ethics and morals, the knowledge of the Sel=
f is the highest duty of man. That is the foremost of all sciences, for thr=
ough that one attains immortality. After ten births one gets the knowledge =
of the Veda, after hundred births one gets good character and conduct. Afte=
r thousand births one gets the knowledge of Yoga, but only after a crore of=
 births one gets the love for sannyasa: In this Dharma called nivritti, the=
 fruit is called Final Emancipation. That knower of Brahman who gives fearl=
essness to all creatures and takes sannyasa, attains the world of light and=
 splendor. He who gives fearlessness to all creatures, attains fearlessness=
 in the end.=E2=80=9D
