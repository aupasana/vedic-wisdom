Indeed this is a unique case. My view is that people are people. They could=
 be good or bad, based on their own conditioning from various lives and sam=
skaras. But islam as a religion spreads venom, in general. I have read Qura=
n and able to say this some=C2=A0amount of conviction. It is, as someone ri=
ghtly said, a terror manual. Nothing less. As Utpal rightly says, he is a v=
edic muslim, not a real muslim.

Namaste,

This is a unique case from Muslim community because the =
person actually handled the pressure from his own community. If such truly =
"Vedic" Muslims are bold enough to assert themselves overcoming almost insu=
rmountable opposition from their community, real positive change will be vi=
sible.

Best Regards,

Utpal
