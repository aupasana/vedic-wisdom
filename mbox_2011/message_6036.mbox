This is the one cause of misery: we are attached; we are being caught. Ther=
efore says the Gita: Work constantly; work, but be not attached; be not cau=
ght. Reserve unto yourself the power of detaching yourself from everything,=
 however beloved, however much the soul might yearn for it, however great t=
he pangs of misery you feel if you are going to leave it; still, reserve th=
e power of leaving it whenever you want.
