Dear Lakshman,

I am attaching a document that will show the pattern. Please be aware that I
typed this ...  i.e. it may contain typos. In addition, the swaras that
precede swaha need to be checked carefully by an expert. I have purposefully
omitted "gum / gush" markings in the mantras.

Important disclaimer: I'm sending this document, with some hesitation, based
on the guidance of elders. Rudra is a fierce deity. Doing homam with these
mantras will test the performer severely. Many of us are unlikely to be able
to withstand the testing. Please think twice about performing rudra homa.
Then think again.

sashenam,

   ajit
