No Utpalji,

I was not offended by "Yendian!!", I too know we all ha=

Namaste Nagaraj ji,

"Yendian..." was a light hearted comment=
 which i think did not go well with you. I am sorry for that.

Actually due=
 to my good experience i know what are the peculiarities in the pronunciati=
on of people from various states which are Gujaratis, Marathis, Uttarprades=
hiya, Punjabis,Tamilian, Andhraites,Keralites, Oriya and Bengolis.

>Most N=
orth Indian people I know, do not put the vowel endings, esp. >when the wor=
ds end with "a"

This is generally true.

I would not comment on other thin=
gs you mentioned because there is a danger of getting in to wrong track but=
 one thing for sure that be whatever Indian (south-north-east-west), everyo=
ne has their peculiarities and flaws of pronunciations.

Best Regards,

Utp=
al

In "prachodayaat", the sound "yaat" as one letter/syllable/akshara. If you =

gt; Take the "t" sound at the end of the words like "prachodayaat", "ava pu=
rastaat", "sahasrapaat" etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound=
 incorrectly. They change "t" to something like "tu" or "ttu" or "ti" or "t=
ti". There is a reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a =
corruption nevertheless.<BR>> > > <BR>> > > In "prachoday=
aat", the sound "yaat" as one letter/syllable/akshara. If you change it int=
o "yaattu" or "yaatu" by adding a vowel sound at the end, it becomes two ak=

that pronunciation.<BR>> > > <BR>> > >
 Akshara means "un=
perished". Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If yo=
u have just a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It=
 is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce "=
t" as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound an=
d the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life =
force.<BR>> > > <BR>> > > In "prachodayaat", the whole so=
und "yaat" is one akshara. Because "t" has no praana by itself, it simply j=
oins to the akshara "yaa" (which has the vowel "aa" as its praana) and beco=
mes part of that akshara. In chhandas, "yaat" is considered one letter (one=
 guru). When you pronounce "yaat" correctly, it is difficult for the listen=
er to know for sure whether you said "yaat" or "yaak" or "yaan". It is poss=
ible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The "t" at the end =
is a very quick and abrupt transient sound without
 praana. So it tough to =

e more common mistake is the sound "tha" (as in "kathaa" =3D story). Most s=
outh Indians pronounce this as "dha" (as in "dhana" =3D money). In Telugu a=

one dot in the middle is different. It is possible that some people started=
 mispronouncing this sound because of their inability to see the dot and ot=

ha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing deta=
