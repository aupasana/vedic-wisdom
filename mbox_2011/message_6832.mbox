Subject: Recommendations for learning Sanskrit

Pranams All,

Can anyone please let me know what would be an ideal starting point for 
learning Sanskrit? Especially given the Karmakandas and other scriptures 
in view.

It should be enough to understand the root meaning of the shlokas and 
enough knowledge to know the places where more information could be 
found out about the derivation of meanings etc.

Any pointers about the same would be highly appreciated.

Thanks a lot !

Chaitanya
