Respected Narasimha ji,
=A0 We have a desire to perform Ganapati Homam in g=
roup. I am using your manual and doing homam for myself. Others in my apart=
ment have taken interest and want to join me during one of the Navaratri da=
ys starting from Vinayaka Chavithi.
=A0 You have told earlier (somebody que=
ried about involving the spouse and children) that only the person invoking=
 the god should offer Aahutis in the fire, and others can recite and watch.=
 Naturally, those who are watching / reciting would have a desire to offer =
something in the fire. Else they feel incomplete. How can I involve the oth=
ers in the fire ritual without creating a complicated karma for myself.=A0
=
=A0 Learned members can also advise me, if Narasimha ji had already answere=
d this earlier. Thanks in advance, best regards,=A0
"Happy Krishna Ashtami"=

Acharyulu
