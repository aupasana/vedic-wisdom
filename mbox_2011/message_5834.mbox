We are all apt to think too highly of ourselves. Our duties are determined =
by our deserts to a much larger extent than we are willing to grant. Compet=
ition rouses envy, and it kills the kindliness of the heart. To the grumble=
r all duties are distasteful; nothing will ever satisfy him, and his whole =
life is doomed to prove a failure. Let us work on, doing as we go whatever =
happens to be our duty, and being ever ready to put our shoulders to the wh=
eel. Then surely shall we see the Light!
