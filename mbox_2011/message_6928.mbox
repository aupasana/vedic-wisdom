Hi:

I am a non Brahmin, fortunately I came across Homam manuals/videos in =
internet. And had a thought in mind `Can I perform". By that time I was in =
use of  alcoholic drinks and smoking. Since I had a strong desire of perfor=
ming homam,=85. My  gurus started-off transforming me. Let me put step by s=
tep of Guru Krupas below:


=95	I use to booze& smoke daily- since I had th=
e desire of performing homam, I was able to quit abruptly even without the =
feeling of having it later again, whereas earlier I couldn't even get into =
sleep without boozing  =96 Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

=95	I was =
transferred to  another location of my Company in Chennai, Where my train c=
ommuting has increased an hour. I got a good chance to read/byheart homam m=
antras - Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

=95	I am quite novice of San=
skrit mantras =96day by day  I became thorough and understood the logic in =
byhearting mantras before I started homam.Very Initially I use to refer man=
ual at some areas while performing homam, Sooner my proficiency increased- =
Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

=95	I use to worried about Ghee and i=
t's quality, Suddenly one day I saw a women in my apartment selling pure CO=
W GHEE, She gives me cow  ghee less than the cost of gingely oil .- Don't y=
ou think this is Guru Krupa ?

=95	I use to worried about Samidhas,Cow dung=
 and dry coconuts etc.. =96 I found a very nice shop near to my place where=
 they sell all ayurvedic herbs and homam items for a cheaper price (even Po=
wder of all herbs used for homam, Wick made by lotus etc..)- Don't you thin=
k this is Guru Krupa ?

=95	I use to worried about tying up the dharbha as =
Pavitram =96 I found an old bramhin near by my house who has tied 100 pavit=
rams for me at once- Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

There are many m=
ore to list.. I am (we are) really blessed to have have gurus like Narshima=
 &Manish. I sincerely thank Gurus Narahima and Manish for helping us in spi=
ritual progress. We wish them all the success in their future endeavors.

Thank you,
Srini.
