 Use measured words in talking. Do not talk much. Try to finish a
conversat=
ion within a few minutes. Understand the nature of the man rightly.
When he=
 enters your office or house for an interview, speak politely and
with grea=
t respect for the man. Then send him away immediately and conserve
your ene=
rgy.

Do not indulge in long unnecessary talks and discussions. Man is a so=
cial
animal. He is prone to much talking. He is very garrulous. This talkat=
ive
habit is ingrained in him and he is much troubled when he cannot get an=
y
company. He does not want to go in for seclusion.

The observance of maun=
a (silence) is death and capital punishment for him.
Ladies are still more =
garrulous. They always create some kind of unnecessary
quarrels in the hous=
e.

I always prescribe the practice of mauna for one and all, as this helps=
 in
the preservation of energy, development of will and enjoyment of peace.=
 All
sorts of quarrels, misunderstandings, anger, etc., can be easily avoid=
ed by
mauna for two hours daily and for six hours on Sundays, and for a ful=
l week
on long holidays.

Even during other periods talk very few words. Wh=
en you speak, speak gently
and sweetly. During mauna you must live alone. D=
o not mix with other people.
Do not even express your ideas with gestures.
=

The other channel by which energy is wasted, is the mind. This wastage is
=
due to loose thinking, worrying, anger and fear. Just as energy is wasted i=
n
too much talk, so also energy is wasted in loose thinking.

If this menta=
l energy is conserved, you will have at your disposal a
tremendous store of=
 energy. This you can utilise for various other purposes
and sadhana (spiri=
tual practice). If this energy is conserved you will feel
that you are very=
 powerful. You will feel no exhaustion even if you turn out
tremendous work=
.

To do this you have to watch your thoughts very carefully, by introspect=
ion
and meditation. You will have to divert the mental energy to useful
thi=
nking. There will be some struggle in the beginning. But after some time
th=
e mind will naturally think of auspicious and useful items.
