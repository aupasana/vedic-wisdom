Respected Narasimha Ji,

Namaste

> Why is it important anyway? 

I agree w=
ith you Sir. Curiosity is also a facet of human mind. For starters like us =
it is good to be curious about good things rather than material things. Alt=
hough at advance stage such curiosities are also a hurdle. I agree that we =
should concentrate on our saadhna instead of thinking about radical things.=


> This may just be your ego at work.

Yes sir, it is most probably. I thi=
nk I need more introspection to know/search about more demons inside me. an=
d pray to Lord Krishna for help in killing them. Such demons arise in me fr=
om time to time. In one form or other. But with grace of Lord Krishna eithe=
r they are killed or run away for some time.

But for us, it hardly matters=
 that whether you are part of their group or not. Because either way, you h=
ad changed our lives to great extent. And we are highly thankful to you tel=
ling us that 'there is gold in the box' and for telling us 'how to get the =
key'.

> we should first get used to recognizing them.

Recognizing such de=
mons is infact difficult part in this process. If we really have wish to ki=
ll them, it is comparatively easy. Shumbha and Nishumbha indeed exist in us=
 in many many different forms. They are asuras with mayavi powers which hel=
p them change their outlook frequently. And this makes more difficult to re=
cognise them. And they are clever enough to take shape of forms which we tr=
ain our mind to accept as 'good'. Which further confuse us. God help us rec=
ognize them by throwing some light inside us by one means or other and then=
 sending us needed weapons to kill them by parcel through one messenger or =
other. Saadhak should be thankful to God for help in recognizing the demons=
 and for the weapons he send through messenger, as well as to the messenger=
.  

Please forgive me for mistakes.

Kind Regards
