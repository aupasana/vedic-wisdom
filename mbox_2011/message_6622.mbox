Q                              If the Sadhaka gets a little  taste of
Anan=
da(Divine bliss), he is very
                          much encouraged to p=
roceed on his spiritual
path.Is this not so?


THE SWAMI        True.But in=
 the higher spiritual state there is 
neither bliss nor

                  =
                sorrow, pain nor pleasure,existence nor
non-existence.The A=
nanda

                                  that you speak of is only a help d=
uring
the period of Sadhana. The

                                  boat st=
ands in need of a favourable
wind so long as it has not reached

          =
                        its destination. But when it has once
reached it th=
ere is no need for

                                  wind, whether favoura=
ble or
unfavourable.Ananda helps the aspirant

                            =
      in his onward course like the
favourable wind.

                     =
             Knowledge, the object known and the
knower, all three lose

  =
                                themselves in the Absolute; so much
only ha=
ve the Scriptures been

                                  able to say. But =
what takes place after
this,none has the power to

                        =
          describe.One has to realise it for
oneself through spiritual prac=
tice.

                                  How wonderful is Infinite Existenc=
e
where there is neither want nor

                                  fear.T=
he very thought of it elevates
the soul.There are some spiritual

         =
                         men who realise the Absolute(Nitya) as
distinct fr=
om the

                                  Relative(Lila,Divine Sport).Other=
s look
upon both of these as one

                                  and the=
 same.There is yet another state
of spiritual experience,which

           =
                       is beyond both Absolute and Relative.
