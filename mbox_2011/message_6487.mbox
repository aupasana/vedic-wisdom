Thanks for offer. More than the ingredients, such a ritual itself needs to =
be authenticated by someone who can see/touch the subtle side. The whole ri=
tual could be benefit of the universe rather than individual as in Athirath=
ram etc, but also the point is some of these yajna's if wrongly done is sup=
posed to have repercussions. Let us see.

Regards
Shashi
