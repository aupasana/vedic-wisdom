 Vedanta shows that everything that is joyful in this life is but a particl=
e of that real joy, because that is the only joy there is. Every moment we =
are enjoying the absolute bliss, though covered up, misunderstood and caric=
atured. Wherever there is any blessing, blissfulness, or joy, even the joy =
of the thief in stealing, it is that Absolute Bliss coming out, only it has=
