Glory of Sannyasa

The glory of sannyasa is indescribable,
Yajnavalkya emb=
raced sannyasa!
Shankara embraced sannyasa!
Ramakrishna, Mandana Misra, too=
.
Even Europeans are sannyasins;
Mr. Nixon and Dr. Alexander also;
And seve=
ral others, too, have taken to sannyasa!
Even some great men of India
Have =
not understood
The glory of sannyasa.
It is a great pity indeed!
Let them h=
ave their own way;
But we are the children
Of the great four Kumaras,
Datta=
treya and Shankara!
O ye aspirants bold,
Who are equipped with the four,
Wh=
o have nivritti-tendencies,
Come, quick! Be quick!
Waste not life any more!=
