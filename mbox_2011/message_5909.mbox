 22nd October, 1947

Bhagavan=E2=80=99s body has become much reduced of lat=
e and some of the devotees
have been saying that it is due to his not takin=
g enough of nourishing food.
Having heard this a Bengali lady brought some =
pieces of guava sprinkled with
salt and chilly powder, and said beseechingl=
y, =E2=80=9CBhagavan, you are getting
very thin; it is good to eat fruit li=
ke this. Please accept my humble
offering.=E2=80=9D

Bhagavan said with a s=
mile, =E2=80=9CWho is it that is thinner? You or I?=E2=80=9D

She said it w=
as Bhagavan.

Bhagavan: =E2=80=9CThat is nice. Who exactly has grown thin w=
ill be known if the
weight is taken. If you like, you may eat those fruits =
every day yourself.
Why this for me? It is all right; you have brought them=
 to day, but please
do not bring them again.=E2=80=9D

So saying, Bhagavan =
took a few pieces and said to his attendants, =E2=80=9CSee how
lean she is!=
 Please give her several of these pieces and distribute the rest
to the oth=
ers.=E2=80=9D

One of those who could venture to talk to Bhagavan more free=
ly said,
=E2=80=9CBhagavan, you have recently very much reduced the amount =
of food you take
daily. It=E2=80=99s not good.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9COho!=E2=
=80=9D said Bhagavan. =E2=80=9CWho told you that? I am taking whatever I re=
quire.
What good would there be in my taking more food and getting fat? By =
getting
fat, do you know how many ailments one suffers? The more you eat, t=
he
greater will grow the strength of the ailment. If you eat just what is
n=
ecessary, ailments will be avoided.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWhy have you given u=
p taking even pepper-water and buttermilk?=E2=80=9D said
another devotee.

=
=E2=80=9CYou enquire why?=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan. =E2=80=9CIf you observe w=
hat is being done when
the meals are served, you yourself will understand. =
Buttermilk is brought
into the dining hall in big buckets with large ladles=
. When taking out the
buttermilk for serving me, the ladle is full, but whe=
n the same is served to
the very next person, the ladle is only half full. =
When I saw that, I got
disgusted and felt that I myself should not take any=
 more than half a
ladleful.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWhy not at least take fruit =
juice?=E2=80=9D said the devotee.

=E2=80=9CSo this has started again!=E2=
=80=9D said Bhagavan. =E2=80=9CEveryone says the same thing.
How will all t=
hat be possible for me?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWhat do you mean, Bhagavan? We g=
et quite a lot of fruit. Why say that it is
impossible? You yourself have s=
tated that what is offered voluntarily can be
accepted.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9C=
So that is it!=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan. =E2=80=9CIf I did say that such offe=
rings could be
accepted, did that mean that the people around could be igno=
red?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CTrue,=E2=80=9D said the devotee, =E2=80=9Cbut quite=
 a lot of fruit is received; it can be
distributed to the others too.=E2=80=
=9D

=E2=80=9CAll is very well,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan, =E2=80=9Cbut where =
have we the wherewithal to
give them all? The fruit is shown here to the Sw=
ami as an offering, a
naivedya, and then taken away. It is kept locked in t=
he store room. The keys
are in the charge of the store-keeper. Who will go =
and ask him? In the same
way, the various articles here are in the custody =
of someone or other; I
have none. This is the result of being a spiritual
p=
receptor!=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan smiling.

It seems that some fifteen days =
back, someone brought some green pepper.
Bhagavan had that pepper, some myr=
obalams, acetic acid, salt and other
ingredients mixed,ground and made into=
 little pills.Today Sivanandan came in
to enquire whether he could get the =
pills for Bhagavan, as they are supposed
to be good against phlegm and Bhag=
avan had been using them now and then
during the cold weather.

As Sivanand=
an had not enquired about them all these fifteen days and is
doing it only =
now, Bhagavan said with a laugh,=E2=80=9CI see, you have now
remembered abo=
ut them. Yes, yes, you have been waiting to see whether I
would ask for the=
m, and thereby test me. Were I to ask, you would say, =E2=80=98What
is this=
? Swami has begun to ask about everything and is worrying us=E2=80=99. What=

am I to do? They feel that if they but salute me once, I should thereafter=

do everything they want. People say that spiritual preceptorship
(swamitva=
m), is a matter for happiness.But see, this is what it is to be a
spiritual=
 preceptor.Would it not be good if a book is written on spiritual
preceptor=
ship?=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CBhagavan is saying something unusual,=E2=80=9D sai=
d a devotee.

Bhagavan replying with a smile, said, =E2=80=9CWhat is there =
unusual about it? It is
all true. =E2=80=98Swami is seated on a sofa with a=
 soft mattress spread on it. What
is there for him to worry about?=E2=80=99=
 That is what people think. But do they
know about our troubles? That is wh=
y I say that it would be good for a big
book to be written on spiritual pre=
ceptorship.

If all the things that have happened here during the last year=
s had been
written in the form of a book, it would be as big as the Mahabha=
ratham!
Anyone who cares to write it, may do so even now!=E2=80=9D he said.=


=E2=80=9CWho would write all that?=E2=80=9D said a devotee.

=E2=80=9CWhy=
 not?=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan. =E2=80=9CIf a book recording these events is =
written, all
people will then know that spiritual preceptorship consists in=
 saying, =E2=80=98Yes,
yes,=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98All right, all right=E2=
=80=99. What is the difficulty in writing about
it?=E2=80=9D

So saying, Bh=
agavan looked at me and with a laugh said, =E2=80=9CWhy? If you like,
you c=
an write it!=E2=80=9D
