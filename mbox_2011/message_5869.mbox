 In August 1943, I shifted my residence from the town to a house in Raju
Ch=
ettiar=E2=80=99s compound in Ramana Nagar.After coming to Tiruvannamalai, I=
 got
into the habit of taking coffee in the mornings. At the new house, mil=
k was
being supplied very late; sometimes as late as even 8 or 9 a.m.

As I=
 had no work to do till then, I was going to the Ashram in the early
mornin=
g hours. A lady devotee who is rather egoistic, was coming there
earlier st=
ill. There used to be two or three ladies also with her.

While I was sitti=
ng somewhere near the back door of the dining hall, they
were sitting right=
 in front of the main door which was facing the bathroom
of Bhagavan. Accor=
ding to the existing practice, the bell for the breakfast
used to be rung a=
s Bhagavan came out of the bathroom and he went direct into
the dining hall=
.

Bhagavan expressed several times his embarrassment about his going in fo=
r
breakfast while some devotees were waiting just opposite to him without
h=
aving had their breakfast: =E2=80=9CLook at that. While all those are stand=
ing
there with empty stomachs, not having even their morning coffee I feel
=
awkwardin going in and eating sumptuously.=E2=80=9D

No serious notice was =
taken of his remarks. One day, after having his
breakfast he was going out =
to the hill when he happened to notice me
standing at the back door. Grieve=
d at it he remarked, =E2=80=9CSee. Nagamma also is
standing there.

She doe=
s not eat anything in the nights. She looks tired. She is not able to
have =
her morning coffee because the milkman comes late. How could I eat
heartily=
 leaving all these people hungry? What to do?=E2=80=9D It seems he had
rema=
rked thus twice or thrice.

A few days later Ramakrishnaswami, Bhagavan=E2=
=80=99s attendant, told me about this.
=E2=80=9CAyyo! If only I had known t=
hat this would cause some pain and embarrassment
to Bhagavan,I would never =
have come that side,=E2=80=9D I said, and stopped going to
that side from t=
hat day onwards. I went to the Ashram only after Bhagavan
returned from his=
 morning walk on the hill.

Ramakrishnaswami appears to have informed Bhaga=
van about this, and so
Bhagavan is reported to have said, =E2=80=9COho! I s=
ee.You have told Nagamma, all
right. But tell the other ladies and see what=
 happens.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CWhy not? I shall
tell them and see that they he=
ed my words,=E2=80=9D he said confidently.

Accordingly he spoke to them th=
e next day. Are they the people to care for
him? Instead, they remonstrated=
 with him saying, =E2=80=9CMind your business. What
do you lose if we stand=
 here? We have not come here for your coffee. This is
all your fabrication.=


Bhagavan will not say anything like that.=E2=80=9D When Bhagavan came to =
know about
this, he had a hearty laugh. He said, =E2=80=9CSo you have had i=
t. You said that
they would heed your words.

Are these people like Nagamma=
 to take it in the right spirit? If you say
anything further, they will sta=
te that Bhagavan himself had permitted them
to stand there.

Supposing you =
say Bhagavan never permitted this, they will say he gave the
permission not=
 verbally but in silence. If that too is disbelieved,they will
say Bhagavan=
 told them so in a dream. What can you do then? That is how they
behave,=E2=
=80=9D said Bhagavan.
