Thank you, Anandaji!

I have some vata disorder and also can't really fast.=
 In this case it is not clear what could be done in order to minimize adver=
se results of eating during eclipses. I already don't feel good. Do you hav=
e any idea?

Also if you (or anybody else from this group) might provide an=
y links to authoritative texts discussing the problem (for example the abov=
ementioned Aghora book of Vimalananda), it would be very helpful.

Regards,=

Maneesha
