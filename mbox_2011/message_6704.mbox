Namaste

Just adding some thoughts .I am sure Narasimha Ji will have the be=
st answer . Vimalananda in the Aghora series points out that each one of us=
 has an limited Bhutagni+ Jatharagni combination. The sum total is constant=
.If one wishes to take up serious sadhana he will have to choose the middle=
 path with respect to food and reduce the quantity to being not too less no=
r too heavy. If the fire is the stomach spends a lot of time digesting larg=
e quantities of food it will not be effectively used by the brain in digest=
ing the spiritual food.

Lord Krishna in the Gita says.

Chapter 6 Verse 16=


"There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogÄ«, O Arjuna, if one =
eats too much or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough"=



This is also the reason for fasting on Ekadashi days/Shani Pradosham day=
s and using the day for total meditation.Also probably this is the reason N=
arasimha ji has asked one to maintain preferabbly an empty stomach atleast =
2 hrs before the homa in the manual.Many other meditation techniques like S=
udarshana Kriya ( AOL) ,Shambhavi Mahamudra ( Isha) also require not to hav=
e eaten 3 hrs before the Kriya.

Vemparla Ram Kishore
