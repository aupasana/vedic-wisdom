Hi:

I am a non Brahmin, fortunately I came across Homam manuals/vide=
os in internet. And had a thought in mind `Can I perform". By that time I w=
as in use of alcoholic drinks and smoking. Since I had a strong desire of p=
erforming homam,=E2=80=A6. My gurus started-off transforming me. Let me put=
 step by step of Guru Krupas below:

=E2=80=A2 I use to booze& smoke daily-=
 since I had the desire of performing homam, I was able to quit abruptly ev=
en without the feeling of having it later again, whereas earlier I couldn't=
 even get into sleep without boozing =E2=80=93 Don't you think this is Guru=
 Krupa ?

=E2=80=A2 I was transferred to another location of my Company in =
Chennai, Where my train commuting has increased an hour. I got a good chanc=
e to read/byheart homam mantras - Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

=E2=
=80=A2 I am quite novice of Sanskrit mantras =E2=80=93day by day I became t=
horough and understood the logic in byhearting mantras before I started hom=
am.Very Initially I use to refer manual at some areas while performing homa=
m, Sooner my proficiency increased- Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

=
=E2=80=A2 I use to worried about Ghee and it's quality, Suddenly one day I =
saw a women in my apartment selling pure COW GHEE, She gives me cow ghee le=
ss than the cost of gingely oil .- Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

=
=E2=80=A2 I use to worried about Samidhas,Cow dung and dry coconuts etc.. =
=E2=80=93 I found a very nice shop near to my place where they sell all ayu=
rvedic herbs and homam items for a cheaper price (even Powder of all herbs =
used for homam, Wick made by lotus etc..)- Don't you think this is Guru Kru=
pa ?

=E2=80=A2 I use to worried about tying up the dharbha as Pavitram =E2=
=80=93 I found an old bramhin near by my house who has tied 100 pavitrams f=
or me at once- Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

There are many more to=
 list.. I am (we are) really blessed to have have gurus like Narshima &Mani=
sh. I sincerely thank Gurus Narahima and Manish for helping us in spiritual=
 progress. We wish them all the success in their future endeavors.

Thank y=
ou,
Srini.
