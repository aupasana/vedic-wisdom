The names of Sulabha and Gargi are too famous to need elaborate explanation=
. We hear of the glorious sannyasini Sulabha, the wandering mendicant, the =
knower of Brahman, conversing with King Janaka of Videha. This is described=
 in the mokshadharma-parva of the Mahabharata. She gives Janaka profound kn=
owledge of the Reality, explains to him the nature of existence and walks a=
way unconcerned with matters of the world. It is told that Sulabha, the dan=
di-sannyasini, was highly devoted to the religion of final emancipation. Sh=
e wanted to test Janaka whether he was emancipated or not. She finds countl=
ess faults in Janaka and tells him that he is only a lip Vedantin, that he =
is not emancipated, that his emancipation is only a talk, and that he has n=
ot renounced attachment. She illumined Janaka with supreme wisdom and left =
his palace.

The questions put by Gargi to Sage Yajnavalkya in the court of=
 Janaka mark her out as an ideal sannyasini. =E2=80=9CIf he will answer me =
these questions, not even one among you will surpass him in discussions abo=
ut Brahman,=E2=80=9D said Gargi to the learned sages assembled in the court=
 of Janaka. How bold should a woman be to question a Brahmajnani like Yajna=
valkya! Is this not a sign of absolute renunciation?
