Thanks Gurudev, for your kind correction, yes, you are right, I checked, co=
mpositions are not technically limericks as they are not with 5 anapestic l=
ines with a rhyme scheme aabba  found in a limerick. 

Gurur Brhama Gurur V=
isnu, Gurur Devo Maheshwara
Guru Saksat par Brahma Tasmev sri gurve namah

A real master (Guru) would never say that he is a Master.
