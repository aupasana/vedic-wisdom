 An atheist says that there is no God. But that knower who knows the
non-ex=
istence of
God is Brahman.

A Sunyavadin says that there is only Sunya (voi=
d). But that knower who knows
the Sunya is Brahman (God).

Who sees the def=
ects in the Sun =E2=80=94whether it shines brightly or whether it is
obscur=
ed by clouds? It is the eye. Who sees the defects in the eye whether
there =
is cataract or not? It is the Buddhi (intellect). Who sees the defects
in t=
he Buddhi whether there is confusion or clarity? Who illuminates the
Buddhi=
? It is Aham (infinite =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D). This =E2=80=9CAham=E2=80=9D is=
 Kutastha or Atma or
Brahman,illuminator of everything.

As a punishment fo=
r a certain crime you would rather prefer to have your
hands cut off than t=
he eyes removed. This indicates obviously that the
Indriya is closer to you=
 and dearer also than the external instruments.
Instead of sentence for dea=
th you would rather prefer to have your two eyes
removed. This shows that l=
ife is dearer and closer to you than the Indriya.
When you suffer from a se=
rious, protracted ailment, you wish to give up your
life also, to get happi=
ness. This shows that the Self or Atma is dearer than
life or Prana.

Man g=
enerally argues at the time of his death, =E2=80=9CI have undergone many
mi=
series,troubles and difficulties in this life. I have done various good
act=
s. They may not go in vain. After all, is it for this one life alone I
have=
 laboured so much? This cannot be. I must be immortal.=E2=80=9D He invents =
the
theory of Immortality. Even commonsense will tell everybody that there =
must
be an immortal Atma.

You had been a child playing in your mother=E2=
=80=99s lap. Then you grew up into a
school-going boy. Then you became a si=
ghing lover in adolescence. Then you
reached adult manhood. Lastly you beca=
me a veteran with grey hairs. You have
had a variety of experiences.There m=
ust be an unchanging Self as a Sakshi to
witness these changing experiences=
. Otherwise these experiences are
impossible. That unchanging Self is Brahm=
an. It is the substratum for all
these changing experiences of life. An inv=
ariable Self must link
continuously the varying childhood, boyhood, manhood=
 and old age.

A spermatozoon, which is a millionth part of a drop of semen=
, and an ovum
from the ovary joined together give rise to the formation of =
this body. What
a great mystery! That subtle power which is the source for =
this semen and
ovarian product, that subtle essence which sustains all thes=
e,is thy own
Self. That is Truth. That is Soul. Thou art That. realise this=
 and free
yourself from the cage of bone and flesh.

The growth of the body=
 with several limbs, organs, etc., from a tiny peck of
semen, bespeaks the =
omnipotence of the Lord.

In the embryonic stage when the child dwells in t=
he womb of the mother there
is no difference between a male and a female ch=
ild up to a certain stage.
Both the male and female genital organs are deve=
loped from the same Wolffian
body which contains the female (ovarian) as we=
ll as the male (testicular)
tissue. By some unknown process of growth one o=
f the tissues preponderates
and the distinguishing characteristics of sex a=
re developed by about the
third month. The testicles are in the abdomen of =
the male child. They
descend into the scrotal bag by about the seventh mont=
h.What a great wonder!
The Lord only, who is the source of all beings and t=
he ruler of all
creatures,knows Himself by Himself.

Just as one thread pen=
etrates all flowers in a garland, so also one Self
penetrates all these liv=
ing beings. He is hidden in all beings and forms,
like oil in seed, butter =
in milk, mind in brain,Prana in the body, fetus in
the womb, sun behind the=
 clouds, fire in wood, vapour in the atmosphere,salt
in water, scent in flo=
wers, sound in the gramophone-records, gold in quartz,
microbes in blood.

=
Just as the light is the same in bulbs of different colours, even so the
bo=
dies and mental Bhavanas (attitudes) are different, but Atma is one in all
=
beings.

Just as the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears to be=
 many, so
also the Atman appears to be many when reflected through various =
minds in
various bodies.

Just as fire blazes forth when the ash above it i=
s removed, Brahman shines
forth when the veil of ignorance, which conceals =
It, is removed. Just as
butter is perceived when milk is converted into cur=
d and churned, so also
Brahman is perceived through the churning of meditat=
ion.

Just as hunger, thirst, pain, taste, etc., have to be experienced, bu=
t
cannot be seen by the fleshy eyes,even so Brahman has to be experienced
t=
hrough deep meditation and Samadhi. Just as the tiny bacilli that produce
c=
holera, typhoid, etc. cannot be seen by the naked eye, but can be seen with=

the help of a microscope, so also Brahman cannot be seen by the physical
e=
yes but can be seen through the eye of intuition.
