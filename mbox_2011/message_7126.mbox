Hello --

I found this answer from http://www.scribd.com/doc/52835282/31/Ho=
ma-Kunda-Effects

Q. You have mentioned somewhere that Manishji was inspire=
d from Mother to startHomam daily. I would like to know whether it was for =
Maha Ganapati Homam too or onlyChandi Homam?
A.
The instruction was to spre=
ad homam and create a community of sadhakas across the world whoworship var=
ious deities in fire. It can be any deities.

While this is what I see  in =
almost all the homam manuals.

-----

My spiritual master Dr Manish Pandit =
hails from Pune, India and lives in Manchester, UK. The idea of spreading h=
omam in the world was revealed to him in a dream a few years ago. He saw ei=
ght elevated beings in a dream. They transported him across blue skies to C=
hennai, India, where he was shown the big fire that was to be lighted in fu=
ture.

-----------

My understanding was Manish ji was preparing for sAdhak=
as who will start with their deities and move up to Chandi homam to be done=
 at a time in future (the big fire being lighted). That is one of the reaso=
ns, I started to do Chandi homam in the weekends; else I would stick to my =
deity LordKrsna all the time. 

Sh Narasimha or someone - Could one of you =
please confirm this again ?

regards
rAma
