>                      Namaste Priyank,1. Perfect devotion to any one form of god is enough to take care of all aspects of one's life. Though different forms work differently in the short run (though they lead to the same thing in the long run), choosing forms based on horoscope is not foolproof. I have studied various classics and modern works on astrology and know the subject as thoroughly as anybody on earth today. I can declare confidently that astrology is not reliable for deciding the deities to worship.Also, what decides the nature of one's worship is not just the name used for the deity and the prayer used, but also the intention and attitude. The vibrations created in the consciousness are a function of which deity/prayer is used and with which intention/attitude.2. Suppose there is a dent on the side of my car that makes it a little difficult to close the door. If I do not care about how good my car looks and the little difficulty in closing the door, I may not want to spend money and get it repaired. I can use that money for something better.For someone like Ramana Maharshi or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, body is just as external as a car. One who identifies mainly with the body will be so concerned with bodily problems, but not one whose identification with the body is bare minimum.3. As we pray, god gives what we seek. He also creates situations that make us wonder if we are seeking the right things. We can improve in what we seek. As we evolve, we may seek something better and god may eventually give it too.Parents may give a small child a toy. They may give an older child a book to read. They may give an even older child some work to do.In fact, an adult son may work and bring money to buy toys for the smaller children. Some saints take on suffering so that some other people are spared of the suffering as they embark on their spiritual journey.Best regards,Narasimha------------------------------------------------------------------- Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,"Do It Yourself" ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings Twitter ID: @homam108------------------------------------------------------------------- On Wed, May 18, 2011 at 10:19 PM, priyank_priyank wrote:
