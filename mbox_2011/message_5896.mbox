>From chapter "Who am I?" (Page 139) from the book =E2=80=9CGanapati=E2=80=
=9D by Prof.
Grimes:

Once many years ago, I had a "chance" meeting with an=
 Indian saint. He
asked, in broken English, "Been India?" Since I had been =
in India for a
number of years, the best, most easily demonstrable answer w=
as to wobble my
head in the characteristic side to side manner known to mos=
t Indians. The
moment he saw that "wobble", he got a big grin on his face, =
entered the
room, and closed the door behind him.

He asked me, "Who you?" =
Having lived in India and being used to this type of
English and being youn=
g and polite I began to answer him, "I am John
Grimes," but just as I reach=
ed the G of Grimes, he said "Bas, family name,
who you?" (Bas is Hindi for =
"stop, enough.")

Again, since I have lived in India and studied Indian tho=
ught, I very
confidently and boldly began to reply, "I am the immortal Atma=
n," but just
as I reached the A of Atman, again he stopped me with another =
"Bas, book
name, who you?" With the first "stop", he wiped out my physical =
body. With
the second "stop", he wiped out my entire mental universe.

What=
 was left? With two small words, he had succeded in conveying to me that
I =
was neither my physical body nor my mental knowledge. How to answer him?
So=
 I said, "I do not know." Quick as a wink, he responded, "Find out."

I rep=
lied, "How?" He responded, "Not how, find out." Again I asked, "How?"
He wa=
s holding a handkerchief in his hand and he opened his fingers and let
the =
handkerchief drop to the ground and as it fell he said, "Let go." Again
I a=
sked, "How [to let go]?" He responded, "Not how, let go." And then he
turne=
d and left the room.

Almost twenty years passed before I learned that this=
 monk supposedly did
not speak English. How interesting! A person who did n=
ot speak English
magnificently managed to teach the Vedantic truth that one=
 is neither one's
body not one's thoughts, all in two words, As if that was=
 not enough, he
proceeded to teach me how to "find out who I really am" wit=
h another two
words ("let go").

We all know how to let go, we do it every =
night when we go to sleep. We
never ask our mother, "Mom, how do I go to sl=
eep?" We just "let go" and
sleep came. However, we become confused, disturb=
ed, when someone asks us to
"let go" of out preconceived notions as to who =
we are. Like this, we look
for a technique in order to meditate or to find =
an answer to the question,
Who am I?
