 SEE GOD IN ALL

Sri Ramakrishna -- I have now come to a stage of realizati=
on in which I see
that God is walking in every human form and manifesting H=
imself alike
through the sage and the sinner, the virtuous and the vicious.=
 Therefore
when I meet different people I say to myself, "God in the form o=
f the saint,
God in the form of the sinner, God in the form of the righteou=
s, God in the
form of the unrighteous."

Holy Mother -- If you want peace o=
f mind, do not find fault with others.
Rather see your own faults. Learn to=
 make the whole world your own. No one
is a stranger, my child; the whole w=
orld is your own.

Swami Vivekananda -- This is the gist of all worship -- =
to be pure and to do
good to others. He who sees Siva in the poor, in the w=
eak, and in the
diseased, really worships Siva, and if he sees Siva only in=
 the image, his
worship is but preliminary. He who has served and helped on=
e poor man seeing
Siva in him, without thinking of his cast, creed, or race=
, or anything, with
him Siva is more pleased than with the man who sees Him=
 only in temples.

Buddha -- Goodwill toward all beings is the true religio=
n; cherish in your
hearts boundless goodwill to all that lives.

Guru Nanak=
 -- God is one, but He has innumerable forms. He is the Creator of
all and =
He Himself takes the human form.

Jesus Christ -- But I say unto you, love =
your enemies, bless them that curse
you, do good to them that hate you, and=
 pray for them which despitefully use
you, and persecute you. That you may =
be the children of your Father which is
in heaven; for he makes his sun to =
rise on the evil and on the good, and
sends rain on the just and on the unj=
ust.

Judaism -- You shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you sha=
ll
reason with your neighbor, lest you bear in sin because of him. You shal=
l
not take vengeance or bear any grudge against the sons of your own people=
,
but you shall love your neighbor as yourself.

Krishna -- He who sees the=
 Supreme Lord abiding alike in all beings, and not
perishing when they peri=
sh - verily, he alone sees.

Mohammed -- All God=E2=80=99s creatures are Hi=
s family; and he is the most beloved
of God who tries to do most good to Go=
d=E2=80=99s creatures.

Native American -- Every dawn as it comes is a holy=
 event, and every day is
holy, for the light comes from your Father, Wakan-=
Tanka; and also always
remember that the two-leggeds and all other peoples =
who stand upon this
earth are sacred and should be treated as such.

Rama -=
- It is the shadow of the Paramatman that you see reflected in all the
livi=
ng beings as the Jivatman. Don=E2=80=99t you see the great sky reflected in=
 each
and every lake or river?

Sankara -- Vishnu alone it is who dwells in=
 you, in me, in everything; Empty
of meaning is your wrath, and the impatie=
nce you reveal. Seeing yourself in
everyone, have done with all diversity.
=

Vedas -- The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all
=
beings; for that reason he does not hate anyone.

Zoroaster -- Forget self =
and identify Ahura Mazda in every being and in
everything.


GOD IS WITHIN =
YOU

Sri Ramakrishna -- Do you know what I see? I see Him as all. Men and o=
ther
creatures appear to me only as hollow forms, moving their heads and ha=
nds
and feet, but within is the Lord Himself.

Holy Mother -- When one real=
izes God, He grants knowledge and illumination
from within; one knows it on=
eself. In the fullness of one=E2=80=99s spiritual
realization one will find=
 that He who resides in one=E2=80=99s heart, resides in the
hearts of other=
s as well - the oppressed, the persecuted, the untouchable,
and the outcast=
.

Swami Vivekananda -- It is impossible to find God outside of ourselves. =
Our
own souls contribute all of the divinity that is outside of us. We are =
the
greatest temple. The objectification is only a faint imitation of what =
we
see within ourselves.

Buddha -- The subject on which I meditate is trut=
h. The practice to which I
devote myself is the truth. The topic of my conv=
ersation is truth. My
thoughts are always in truth. For lo! my self has bec=
ome the truth.

Guru Nanak -- As fragrance abides in the flower,
As the ref=
lection is within the mirror,
So doth thy Lord abide within thee,
Why searc=
h Him without?

Jesus Christ -- Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingd=
om of God was
coming, he answered them, "The kingdom of God is not coming w=
ith signs to be
observed; nor will they say, =E2=80=98Lo, here it is!=E2=80=
=99 or =E2=80=98There!=E2=80=99 for behold, the
kingdom of God is within yo=
u."

Judaism -- Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right =
spirit
within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not the holy=
 Spirit
from me.

Krishna -- I am the Self, O Gudekesa, seated in the heart=
s of all creatures.
I am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all bein=
gs.

Mohammed -- He who knows his own self, knows God.

Native American -- =
The first peace, which is most important, is that which
comes within the so=
uls of men when they realize their relationship, their
oneness, with the un=
iverse and all its Powers, and when they realize that at
the center of the =
universe dwells Wakan-Tanka, and that this center is
really everywhere, it =
is within each of us. This is the real Peace, and the
others are but reflec=
tions of this. The second peace is that which is made
between two individua=
ls, and the third is that which is made between two
nations. But above all =
you should understand that there can never be peace
between nations until t=
here is first known that true peace which, as I have
often said, is within =
the souls of men.

Rama -- Think that you are Parabrahman, you have no atta=
chment, you are
all-knowing and you are pure. Always feel like this and est=
ablish your
oneness with the Paramatman and derive bliss within yourself wi=
thout caring
to know what is outside of you.

Sankara -- Cherish your Guru=
=E2=80=99s lotus feet and free yourself without delay
from the enslavement =
to this world. Curb your senses and your mind and see
the Lord within your =
heart.

Vedas -- There is one Supreme Ruler, the inmost Self of all beings,=
 who
makes His one form manifold. Eternal happiness belongs to the wise, wh=
o
perceive Him within themselves - not to others.

Zoroaster -- One need no=
t scale the heights of the heavens nor travel along
the highways of the wor=
ld to find Ahura Mazda. With purity of mind and
holiness of heart one can f=
ind Him in one=E2=80=99s own heart.


PERSEVERE IN YOUR SEARCH FOR GOD

Sri=
 Ramakrishna -- There are pearls in the deep sea, but one must hazard all
t=
o find them. If diving once does not bring you pearls, you need not
therefo=
re conclude that the sea is without them. Dive again and again. You
are sur=
e to be rewarded in the end. So is it with the finding of the Lord in
this =
world. If your first attempt proves fruitless, do not lose heart.
Persevere=
 in your efforts. You are sure to realize Him at last.

Holy Mother -- Cont=
inue to pray without losing heart. Everything will happen
in time.

Swami V=
ivekananda -- To succeed, you must have tremendous perseverance,
tremendous=
 will. "I will drink the ocean," says the persevering soul, "at my
will mou=
ntains will crumble up." Have that sort of energy, that sort of
will, work =
hard, and you will reach the goal.

Buddha -- Search with sincerity and per=
severe in your search. In the end you
will find the Truth.

Guru Nanak -- D=
well on Him day after day, That thou mergest imperceptibly in
His Name.

Je=
sus Christ -- And he told them a parable, to the effect that they ought
alw=
ays to pray and not lose heart. He said, "In a certain city there was a
jud=
ge who neither feared God nor regarded man; and there was a widow in that
c=
ity who kept coming to him and saying, =E2=80=98Vindicate me against my adv=
ersary.=E2=80=99
For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, =
=E2=80=98Though I neither
fear God nor regard man, yet because the widow bo=
thers me, I will vindicate
her, or she will wear me out by her continual co=
ming=E2=80=99."

Judaism -- Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel=
 of the wicked,
nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of s=
coffers; but his
delight is the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditate=
s day and night.
He is like a tree planted by streams of water, that yields=
 its fruit in its
season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does=
, he prospers.

Krishna -- I am easy of access to that ever steadfast yogi =
who, O Partha,
constantly meditates on Me and gives no thought to anything =
else.

Mohammed -- Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.

Native Ame=
rican -- It may be that we shall receive no vision or message from
the Grea=
t Spirit the first time that we lament [cry for a vision], yet we
may try m=
any times, for we should remember that Wakan-Tanka is always
anxious to aid=
 those who seek Him with a pure heart. But of course much
depends on the na=
ture of the person who cries for a vision, and upon the
degree to which he =
has purified and prepared himself.

Rama -- Keeping company with My devotee=
s, always serving Me and My Bhaktas,
fasting on Ekadasi, celebrating the fe=
stivals connected with Me, hearing,
reading and expounding My glories, wors=
hipping Me with continuous devotion,
and singing of My excellences: If one =
follows these precepts daily, one gets
pure devotion.

Sankara -- The Atman=
 that is Absolute Existence and Knowledge, can not be
realized without cons=
tant practice. So one seeking Knowledge should meditate
upon Brahman for th=
e attainment of the desired goal.

Vedas -- This Atman, resplendent and pur=
e, whom the sinless sannyasins
behold residing within the body, is attained=
 by unceasing practice of
truthfulness, austerity, right knowledge, and con=
tinence.

Zoroaster -- Exert ceaselessly for the Glory of Ahura Mazda and f=
or the good
of the Universe.


TRUST COMPLETELY IN GOD

Sri Ramakrishna -- =
What are you to do when you are placed in the world? Give
up everything to =
Him, resign yourself to Him, and there will be no more
trouble for you. The=
n you will come to know that everything is done by His
will.

Holy Mother -=
- If anyone surrenders himself totally at his feet, the Master
will see tha=
t everything is set right.

Swami Vivekananda -- Stand up for God; let the =
world go.

Buddha -- Surrender the grasping disposition of your selfishness=
, and you
will attain to that sinless calm state of mind which conveys perf=
ect peace,
goodness, and wisdom.

Guru Nanak -- He who gives himself up to =
His supreme will, wins the goal. No
other action counts in achieving this e=
nd.

Jesus Christ -- Therefore do not be anxious, saying, =E2=80=98What sha=
ll we eat?=E2=80=99
or, =E2=80=98What shall we drink?=E2=80=99 or, =E2=80=
=98What shall we wear?=E2=80=99 For the Gentiles seek
all these things; and=
 your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But
seek first his king=
dom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be
yours as well.

Ju=
daism -- The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want; he makes me lie down
in=
 green pastures. He leads me beside still waters; he restores my soul. He
l=
eads me in paths of righteousness for his names sake.
Even though I walk th=
rough the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no
evil; for thou art with =
me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

Krishna -- Fixing your heart o=
n Me, you will overcome every difficulty by My
grace; but if from self-conc=
eit you do not listen to Me, you shall perish
utterly.

Mohammed -- If you =
rely upon God as He ought to be relied upon, He will
provide you as He prov=
ides the birds: they go out empty and hungry in the
morning and come back b=
ig-bellied at eventide.

Native American -- All things give thanks to You, =
O Wakan-Tanka, who are
merciful, and who help us all. We ask all this of Yo=
u because we know that
You are the only One, and that You have power over a=
ll things!

Rama -- Do not be overjoyed if you get a fortune, neither shoul=
d you be
dejected if you lose it. Your mind should be well balanced. I, Ram=
a, am the
life of all souls. Your mind should be fixed on Me alone.

Sankar=
a -- I know no Mantra, Yantra, or Stotra; I know no invocation or
contempla=
tion; I know no stories in your praise; I know not Mudras, not even
how to =
cry out; I simply know that to run to you, Mother, destroys all
distress.

=
Vedas -- Children pursue outer pleasures and fall into the net of widesprea=
d
death; but calm souls, having known what is unshakable Immortality, do no=
t
covet any uncertain thing in this world.

Zoroaster -- Trust in God and d=
o the Right.


LOVE OF GOD IS ESSENTIAL

Sri Ramakrishna -- Unalloyed love =
of God is the essential thing. All else is
unreal.

Holy Mother -- One=E2=
=80=99s love of God depends entirely upon one=E2=80=99s inner feelings.
Lov=
e of God is the essential thing.

Swami Vivekananda -- Giving up all other =
thoughts, with the whole mind day
and night worship God. Thus being worship=
ped day and night, He reveals
himself and makes His worshippers feel His pr=
esence.

Buddha -- That which is most needed is a loving heart.

Guru Nanak=
 -- God is not pleased by obstinate penance nor by many religious
garbs. He=
 who fashioned the vessel of the body and poured into it, His
ambrosial gif=
ts, will only be satisfied with man=E2=80=99s love and service.

Jesus Chri=
st -- "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?" And he
said to =
him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with
all yo=
ur soul, and with all your mind. This is the great and first
commandment."
=

Judaism -- Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shal=
l
love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and w=
ith
all your might.

Krishna -- But the great-souled men, O Partha, who are=
 endowed with the
divine nature, worship Me with undisturbed minds, knowing=
 that I am
immutable and the origin of all beings. Ever glorifying Me, alwa=
ys striving
with self-control, remaining firm in their vows, bowing before =
Me, they
worship Me with love and unwavering steadiness.

Mohammed -- Whoev=
er loves to meet God, God loves to meet him.

Native American -- Wakan-Tank=
a, help us to walk the sacred path of life
without difficulty, with our min=
ds and hearts continually fixed on You!

Rama -- Devotion is the only thing=
 that is essential to worship Me. It is
impossible for a person to see Me b=
y the merit of sacrifice, austerity,
charity, or by the study of Vedas or b=
y performing the scriptural rites, if
he is devoid of devotion to Me.

Sank=
ara -- Among things conducive to liberation, devotion alone holds the
supre=
me place. The seeking after one=E2=80=99s real nature is designated as
devo=
tion.

Vedas -- Under a golden brilliance the face of Truth lies hidden. Do=
 Thou, O
Protector, withdraw this cover, that I, devoted to Truth alone, ma=
y realize
it.

Zoroaster -- As the Fire on the censer consumes sandalwood s=
o let the Fire
burning within you consume your heart with love for Ahura Ma=
zda.

<br>Zoroaster -- One need not scale the he=

i Ramakrishna -- There are pearls in the deep sea, but one must hazard all =
to find them. If diving once does not bring you pearls, you need not theref=
ore conclude that the sea is without them. Dive again and again. You are su=
re to be rewarded in the end. So is it with the finding of the Lord in this=
 world. If your first attempt proves fruitless, do not lose heart. Persever=

<br>Hol=
y Mother -- Continue to pray without losing heart. Everything will happen i=
n time.<br><br>Swami Vivekananda -- To succeed, you must have tremendous pe=

 And he told them a parable, to the effect that they ought always to pray a=

either feared God nor regarded man; and there was a widow in that city who =
kept coming to him and saying, =E2=80=98Vindicate me against my adversary.=
=E2=80=99 For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, =E2=80=
=98Though I neither fear God nor regard man, yet because the widow bothers =
me, I will vindicate her, or she will wear me out by her continual coming=
=E2=80=99."<br>

<br>Judaism -- Blessed is the man who walks not in th=
e counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the =
seat of scoffers; but his delight is the law of the Lord, and on his law he=
 meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, th=
at yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all tha=
t he does, he prospers.<br>

<br>Krishna -- I am easy of access to that eve=
r steadfast yogi who, O Partha, constantly meditates on Me and gives no tho=
ught to anything else.<br><br>Mohammed -- Seek knowledge from the cradle to=
 the grave.<br><br>Native American -- It may be that we shall receive no vi=
sion or message from the Great Spirit the first time that we lament [cry fo=
r a vision], yet we may try many times, for we should remember that Wakan-T=
anka is always anxious to aid those who seek Him with a pure heart. But of =
course much depends on the nature of the person who cries for a vision, and=
 upon the degree to which he has purified and prepared himself.<br>

<br>Ra=
ma -- Keeping company with My devotees, always serving Me and My Bhaktas, f=
asting on Ekadasi, celebrating the festivals connected with Me, hearing, re=
ading and expounding My glories, worshipping Me with continuous devotion, a=
nd singing of My excellences: If one follows these precepts daily, one gets=
 pure devotion.<br>

<br>Sankara -- The Atman that is Absolute Existence an=

Knowledge should meditate upon Brahman for the attainment of the desired go=

<br>Judaism -- T=
