Om Gam Ganapataye NamaH,

On 25th Novemeber, besides, being Amavasya and ec=
lipse, i found Chandra in Vrishcika aspected by Ketu. Vrischika is 8th Rash=
i (Sadhana) of Kalapurusha which has combination of 4 planets.

I would rec=
ommend to start on Amavasya, exactly during period of eclipse if you wish t=
o progress spiritually. However, do not worry if you miss that because i be=
lieve firmly that The Moment you Start Homam, Time becomes auspiscious.

Ap=
ology for giving some Astrological combinations as it was required in the c=
ontext.

Best of Luck!
