Namaste Utpal-ji and Nagaraj garu,

 i had this confusion from the day i go=
t to know how to write my name in
english, it is written correctly in telug=
u/hindi but the whole confusion
arises the moment i write that in english, =
it is written as sarma in english
but pronounced as sharma in telugu and hi=
ndi, because it is written as sarma
in English some tend to pronounce that =
as sarma instead of sharma.... (exact
confusion as of siva and shiva).

 i =
explain my non-patient friends that a "h" is dropped after "s" in telugu
to=
 conserve energy while writing but it should be pronounced as sharma , but
=
to any serious and patient listeners i explain it as below (please note all=

this is just my  opinion) --


 The three "shSh's" are classified as below=
 according to the place they
originate (in vaikhari of course) -

  *Palata=
l/taalavya* (originated when middle part of tounge is raised
against the mi=
ddle part of roof of mouth while pronouncing an s) - written
in ITRANS as::=
sh examples::shiva/sharma/session - there is no real english
equivalent let=
ter for this

  *Cerebral/muurdhanya* (originated when tip of the tounge tr=
ies to contact
the roof of the mouth while pronouncing s) - written in ITRA=
NS as ::Sh, shh,
Z, S  examples::riShi/Shall/Ship =E2=80=93 equivalent to s=
h in english

  *Dental/dantya* (originated when tip of the tounge tries to=

contact/contacts the upper teeth as exactly in s) - written in ITRANS as::=
s
examples::sarasvathi/sindhu/same  - equivalent to s in english


  Since =
there is no exact equivalent of palatal sh in english some people
(especial=
ly from south) write the palatal sh as s in English (like siva) and
most (f=
rom north) use sh (like shiva), either the case shiva/siva is written
corre=
ctly in respective languages with a palatal sh, IMO both are correct as
lon=
g as one does not alter pronunciation (but that alteration can happen due
c=
ourse of time when we forget the basics of grammar, and/or forget the
basic=
s pronunciation from our mother languages if an Indian, and also
because of=
 natural language corruptions =E2=80=93 some parts of AP pronounce shiva
as=
 siva which is not correct according to me)...


  Please refer to CHART-LI=
NE V in
http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/52/4V/524V0401.htm, the sec=
ond
column is dental s, the third one is palatal sh, and the fourth one is
=
cerebral Sh/shh).


 Learned ones please pardon and correct me if i am out =
of senses here - i
will correct my mistakes as a sushiShya =E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=
=81=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF (su=C5=9Bi=E1=B9=A3ya)


 =
 Thanks and Regards,

  sarma/sharma (but not Sharma)

<p>My views are based on Devanagari script in wh=

<p>***<br>First let me take GANA=

<p><font color=3D"#0000ff"><fon=
t color=3D"#000000">In Sanskrit language which is always found witten in De=
vanagari script, Ta & Tha are different consonants and obviously their =
pronunciation is different. and as Ganapati is always=C2=A0*found* written =

t;MaTI" or "BhranTI" or "SaTI" etc... to pronounce=
 as "Thi"=C2=A0in Ganapati is definately=C2=A0Incorrect.</font></=

<p>Good th=
at you=C2=A0came out with this point. that was also my one of the pending p=
oint w.r.t ponunciation.</p>
<p>Here i disgree. In My opinion, "<stron=
g><font color=3D"#00007f">SH</font>i</strong>va" is=C2=A0correct Pronu=
nciation where as "<strong>Si</strong>va" is incorrect one.</p>
<=
p>i just finished reading Durga SaptaShati. Take "SaptaShloki Durga&qu=
ot;.=C2=A0 It Starts with "SHIV uvaach". It does not mention &quo=
t;SIVA uvaach".=C2=A0 in the same 7 verses, we have "...SHUbham d=
adaSI". now it is vey clear that SH in Shubham AND SI in dadasi are di=
ffeent consonants and should have diffent sound assigned. so for correct re=
ading, SHUbham should be pronounced as SHu as in SHobha and dadaSI should b=
e pronounced as Si as in ManaSi, VaranaSi etc...</p>

<p>Take one more exam=
ple. "<strong>SH</strong>ive <strong>Sa</strong>rvartha <strong>Sa</st=
rong>dhike..." Consonant in SHive and Sarvarth are different. hence SH=
ive is correct in the first word and it is incorrect to pronounce it as SIv=
e.</p>

 indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a consonant cannot exist b=

quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj Bhasha =
and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them "Ramacharita Manasa" i=
s more important than even Valmiki's Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadh=
i also without proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that,=
 that approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like "Sri Gurucharan=

t everything. Having devotion and the spirit of surrender to god is even mo=
re important. However, pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct p=
ronunciation is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Ve=
da mantra can stop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In =

 very few who can actually "experience" a mantra.<br>

If you do not think that correct pronunciation is important or if you disag=
ree with my assessment of the errors or if you do not want to change your p=
ronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On the other hand,=
 if you are open to changing your pronunciation, please give a consideratio=
n to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find them appropriate.<br>

you change it into "yaattu" or "yaatu" by adding a vowe=

;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you have j=
ust a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is ksha=
ra and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce "t&q=
uot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound =
and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no lif=
e force.<br>
> > > > > <br>> > > > > In "=
;prachodayaat", the whole sound "yaat" is one akshara. Becau=
se "t" has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara &q=
uot;yaa" (which has the vowel "aa" as its praana) and become=
s part of that akshara. In chhandas, "yaat" is considered one let=
ter (one guru). When you pronounce "yaat" correctly, it is diffic=
ult for the listener to know for sure whether you said "yaat" or =
"yaak" or "yaan". It is possible if one listens careful=
ly, but otherwise difficult. The "t" at the end is a very quick a=
nd abrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.<br>

 some vowel to it (like "u" or "a" or "o" or =
"i" or some other vowel sound in between them) so that the "=
