Dear Utpal,

I ment this coconut: http://goo.gl/U7vzW

Not the green color=
ed ones :http://goo.gl/2LMio


If you are doing only with dry copras, then =
burning a full water-filled coconut is very, very difficult. You need some =
wood. I used to put at least 8-10 bundles of samidha sticks (each bundle ha=
ving around 15-20 sticks of 6 inchs length) along with the coconut - at dif=
ferent intervals - so that the coconut eventually catche fire. 

In case th=
e coconut does not burn completely, it should be burnt off in the next homa=
 done by the same person. Ideally it should be burnt off in the same homa, =
if not, then make sure that you do the next homa as soon as possible.
