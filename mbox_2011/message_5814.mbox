Om Namo Narayan...
When I read Shrimad bhagawad few month back, I read that=
 Pranayaam can be achieved in 30 days. very simple or preliminary sign of p=
ranayaam achievement is 1) Sweet tone of talk 2) extreme quickness in worki=
ng or walking 3) good level of concentration 4) Arguing convincingly . thes=
e are beginners sign. Does any know any one who has practiced and achieve t=
his? If it can be done in 30 days why do we(atleast I) have so much problem=
 achieving it? That is supposedly first step!!! Does any Guru have complete=
 knoledge of it?
