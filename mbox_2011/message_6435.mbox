Namaste narasimha, 


Does make sense to read 10 strotras for 5-6 dieties d=
aily. Which is better addressing problem/trait/duality directly or Devotion=
 to ishta devata?

* * *

Of late doing khadagamala strotra, i felt and rea=
lized different kind of energy. I can say for sure that each strotra carrie=
s different energy. 

Earlier in your post to someone you had suggested Dur=
ga strotra for rahu, as rahu is tamsic planet. To practically experience an=
d experiment on this i got my chart analyzed my a astrologer, to know the r=
emedies specific for me.

He said there are some major faults/trends. He as=
ked me to stop my other strotras as they dont direct address my problem. He=
 asked me read Aditya hrudayam, Sri rudram daily. I tried this and it does =
help. I feel that addressing problem directly/precisely has faster effect.

My question is my regular practice includes Ganapati atharvshirsham, Vishn=
u sahastranaam, Narayan kavachh, Khadagmala, Navgrah strotra. 
I dotn want =
to leave this, but at same time the the problems have piled up which i want=
 to solve. 

* * * 

Will appreciate if you can suggest the remedy for My c=
