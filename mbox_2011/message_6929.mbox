alcoholic drinks and smoking=
. Since I had a strong desire of performing homam,=E2=80=A6. 
My gurus star=

below:

=E2=80=A2 I use to booze& smoke daily- since I had the desire of performing=
 homam, I was 
able to quit abruptly even without the feeling of having it =
later again, whereas 
earlier I couldn't even get into sleep without boozin=

Guru Krupa ?

=E2=80=A2 I was transfer=

commuting=
 has increased an hour. I got a good chance to read/byheart homam 
mantras =

krit mantras =E2=80=93day by day I became thorough and 
understood the logi=
c in byhearting mantras before I started homam.Very Initially 
I use to ref=
er manual at some areas while performing homam, Sooner my 
proficiency incr=

=E2=80=A2 I use to worried abo=
ut Ghee and it's quality, Suddenly one day I saw a women 
in my apartment s=
elling pure COW GHEE, She gives me cow ghee less than the cost 
of gingely =
oil .- Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

=E2=80=A2 I use to worried abo=
ut Samidhas,Cow dung and dry coconuts etc.. =E2=80=93 I found a 
very nice =
shop near to my place where they sell all ayurvedic herbs and homam 
items =
for a cheaper price (even Powder of all herbs used for homam, Wick made by =

lotus etc..)- Don't you think this is Guru Krupa ?

all the success in their future 
endeavors.
