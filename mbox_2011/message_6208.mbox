The miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only. Until man'=
s nature changes, these physical needs will arise, and miseries will always=
 be felt, and no amount of physical help will cure them completely. The onl=
y solution of this problem is to make mankind pure. Ignorance is the mother=
 of all the evil and all the misery we see. Let men have light, let them be=
 pure and spiritually strong and educated, then alone will misery cease in =
the world, not before.
