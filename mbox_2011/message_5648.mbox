Vashat, Vaushat etc are like swaha, swadha etc- used at different times. Do=
 not look for meaning in these individual words or phrases. 

I have explai=
ned what the intention is. None of this is asking for power. Indeed there i=
s no power in the universe which is outside oneself- again this is a simpli=
fication.

Dont get lost in the forest of intellectual understanding. Pract=
ice.....intellectual understanding by itself is useless( just as knowing ho=
w an internal combustion engine works does not make one the owner of a car)=
.

These words may not be packaged as well as they can be- its a bit late a=
nd the flowery speech part has gone to sleep :-)
