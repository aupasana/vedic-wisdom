Shri Ananda Ji,

I understand that Agni is a carrier of information (subtle=
st possible one) to the system(read as god/the other/etc) so i guess subtle=
 variations would occur based on the combinations of thoughts/intents and m=
aterials used.  How many variations  - possibly infinite.

Thanks & Regards=


Sridhar
