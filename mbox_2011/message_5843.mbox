 Servers in the kitchen usually devote special attention to Bhagavan by
ser=
ving him something more than they serve to others. He notes such undue
disc=
rimination and tries to dissuade them.

Once post master Raja Iyer did so a=
nd Bhagavan looked at him disapprovingly
but did not say anything at that t=
ime; and so Raja Iyer was continuing the
practice off and on.

One night pa=
lpayasam (milk pudding) was prepared and Chinnaswami finding it
particularl=
y delicious, appeared to have hinted to Raja to serve a little
more than us=
ual to Bhagavan. So Raja served a little more. Bhagavan could
not tolerate =
it and burst out, =E2=80=9CThere! Again the same nonsense.

The same monkey=
 tricks. Why do you serve me more than what you serve
others? When
it comes=
 to serving Bhagavan,the ladle is immersed fully while it is
immersed only =
half when it is served to others. How often have I told you
not to do so? N=
o one listens to my words.

When the ladle is in his hands the server think=
s he is as powerful as the
District Collector and thinks he can do anything=
 without fear. He is the one
who serves and we are the people to eat whatev=
er he serves. His hand is
above and ours is below.

We must act as he pleas=
es and eat as he decides and then lie low.=E2=80=9D And
Bhagavan went on ta=
lking in that strain, severely rebuking all the people
concerned.
