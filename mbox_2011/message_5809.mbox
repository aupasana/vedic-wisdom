=C2=A0 
Namaste Priya ji,

Shri=
 Atul's message is very wise. I suggest some what similar line of thinking.=


It is quite possible that you are living out, in dreams, Unpleasant effec=
ts of 
some bad past Karmas. It actually may be better as its happening in =
the dream 
and hopefully not in actual life.

I too have had gone through s=
imilar situation some time back. What i did was not 
to discuss with anybod=
y and just forgot those dreams. Fortunately it was quite 
easy for me to fo=
rget those bad dreams i had. Best would be to pray and put your 
case in fr=
ont of Homa Agni and the invoked deity. Dreams ki hi aahuti de do! 
Bhsma h=
o jayenge!

Best Regards,

Utpal
