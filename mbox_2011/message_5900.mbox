Respected Sir,

Thanks for sharing this article. Indeed it is very helpful.=
 
I will like to share couple of quotes from sources I regard a lot. with a=
 hope these can provide some food for thought.

1) "Attachment even to your=
 own sadhna can slow you down in your progress. Remember, aim of sadhna is =
to remove attachments and getting attached to your own sadhna is just contr=
ary. True sadhna will make you more and more child-like. Like a child you w=
ill become more and more carefree, joyful, easy going and passionate. If yo=
ur sadhna is not doing this to you, means you need to make some more change=
s in your attitude"

2) "First step toward God, first ever step in sadhna, =
even before Yama and Niyama is to become honest. become honest to yourself.=
 Become honest enough to accept your own shortcomings and mistakes. If you =
are not honest withyour self, many early years of your sadhna will make you=
 honest with yourself and after that only you will start experiencing resul=
ts of sadhna. So be honest enough to accept and courageous enough to change=
. This will save many many years of your sadhna."

With the grace of Lord K=
rishna
Deep Regards
