We can see that all the difference between man and man is owing to the exis=
tence or non-existence of faith in himself. Faith in ourselves will do ever=
ything. I have experienced it in my own life, and am still doing so, and as=
 I grow older that faith is becoming stronger and stronger. He is an atheis=
t who does not believe in himself. The old religions said that he was an at=
heist who did not believe in God. The new religion says that he is an athei=
st who does not believe in himself. But it is not selfish faith, because th=
e Vedanta, again, is the doctrine of Oneness. It means faith in all, becaus=
e you are all.
