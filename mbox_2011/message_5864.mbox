Dear Utpal,

Glad that you liked this interview.

I have not read any of Sw=
amiji's work, (not surprising given my level of 
ignorance!), but this is a=
 gem of an interview. If you, or anyone else on the 
forum has read any of =
his writings and would like to recommend something, I 
would appreciate it.=


One of the questions (among many) I have after reading this interview and=
 
reflecting a little bit, is related to these quotes.

"Any intelligent, r=
ational man is an atheist. Until, of course he is initiated 
into religion.=
"

"You are a Hindu - and yet you have the right to say you don't believe!"=


So who is a Hindu? and what does it mean to be initiated into a religion =
(as 
related to Hinduism). At one end is this thought expressed above and a=
t the 
other end is this notion that to be a Hindu, you have to believe in =
the Vedas 
(which, ironically, most people cannot read and those who can, c=
annot 
understand!)

warm regards,
Chandraprakash

Namaste Chandra Prakash,
Thank=
 you!
How true:
[
Yoga and bhog. It is not in the physical body; it is not =
in the place where you 
are staying; nor in the clothes you are wearing. It=
 is in the mental attitude. 
Coated, booted, suited with beedi in hand, you=
 can still be a yogi. A man who 
has got jatadhari - which is only vibhuti =
all over and nothing but a lengot - 
can be the greatest of bhogis. Isn't i=
t? It's not the physical appearance; it's 
the mental attitude.
]
Warm Rega=
rds,
Utpal
