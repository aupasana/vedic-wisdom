Hiramalini ji,
I'll answer the 1st part of your question - Can women do t=
arpanam? What a coincidence that you ask the very question I asked myself f=
ew months ago...I'm speaking from my personal experience and will defer to =
Narasimhaji for the final answer.

I wear rudhraksha & some months later af=
ter wearing the rudhrakshas, while praying, I had asked God for guidance=85=
.I remembered listening to stories of Sage Agastiar while growing up & had =
thought," I have no one to guide me, I don't know the path to moksha or wha=
tever-is-the-highest-truth=85.I've had enough of ridicule from my family fo=
r my beliefs.... So, just so that I don't waste anymore of my energy in jus=
tifying my beliefs, I seek guidance from Sage Agastiar=85At least scripture=
s say that he was a great sage & if anyone needs to argue, they can argue w=
ith the scriptures"=85=85So mentally, I would pray to Sage Agastiar and say=
 "I don't know the mantras, puja methods etc to pray to you=85.All that I k=
now, is your name and that's all I can chant=85and I would chant his name 9=
 times=85"=85Few months later, my family took part in Dattatreya abishekam =
at the St. Louis Hindu temple in MO and still few months later, I landed up=
 on Dr. Pillai's website and him being Sage Agastiar in an earlier lifetime=
 [according to the ancient naadi leaves], kind-of-agreed with my earlier re=
quest-for-guidance=85

Earlier during this year, I had again & again come a=
cross articles on Dr. Pillai's website that stresses the importance of thar=
panam=85 "If I have to recommend one solution for every one of our problems=
, be it financial, relationship or health, it is doing Tarpanam. Miracles d=
o happen after the performance of the rituals", says Dr. Pillai=85
More inf=
o can be found here

categ=3Dsearch&search=3Dtarpanam

I had also read on the Agasthiar website =
the importance of tharpanam=85

http://www.agasthiar.org/a/tharpanam.htm

I=
 wrote to both these groups & received positive feedbacks & comments about =
the experience of people after they did daily tarpanam.

I had asked God fo=
r confirmation and though I don't want to mention right now what confirmati=
on I got, I think it is suffice to say that I got my answer.So, I started d=
oing daily tarpanam as shown in these videos

http://www.youtube.com/watch?=
v=3DNlFEo7IWeGY&feature=3Demail

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdAxDFLHWo=
NU&feature=3Demail

Nothing short of miracles have happened since. My paren=
ts are alive & they do the monthly amavasya tharpanam for my paternal grand=
parents. I had infact asked my thatha & paati [my paternal grandparents who=
 are dead] for confirmation & they too have sent me confirmations [which ri=
ght now, I dont want to go into the details].....Every aspect of my life ha=
s improved - spiritual, relationships, finance etc.

So, my answer to your =
question? Do it...Ask God for your own 'personalized answers/confirmation' =
and when you get them, you will know the answer yourself and it becomes 'YO=
UR TRUTH'....Not something that some 'online-stranger-you-dont-even-know' a=
sked you to do.

Hope this answers your question.
