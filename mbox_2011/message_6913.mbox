Dear Narasimhaji and Ajaya,

Thank you for your wise replies and advice. Na=
rasimhaji, you say "Depending on how you visualize a devatA and mantra and =
with what attitude, it works on you accordingly, within that range of possi=
bilities". It seems to me that this visualization is a very personal intern=
al image, very alive and active? In my case, and my knowledge is but a smal=
l fraction of yours, when doing Savitur Gayatri, I visualize a golden peace=
 descending on me, and something flowing out of me to something higher. My =
visualization during the Kali mantra is of surrendering all of myself, as i=
f I were cleaning out myself from the inside out, to some vague but very fi=
erce Goddess form, and all my faults coming out of me like snakes, which ar=
e destroyed by the Goddess. I have reached these visualizations by trial an=
d error - when I do these ones, I seem to concentrate on the mantra much be=
tter. But I wonder if this is conflicting imagery.. Also I have trouble str=
ongly visualizing personified forms - most of the focus is always on colors=
, flows etc.. 

Sincerely,

Sundeep
