Namaste Sh Narasimha, et al. - I have done my first homam (SriKrsna homam) =
today, hopefully it was fine, as I made some minor mistakes. 
First of all,=
 the fire got put off twice, as the twigs did not catch fire easily. I lear=
nt that the twigs need to be cut vertically for them to burn better.
Second=
ly, the full dry coconut did not burn completely in the poornahuti and if I=
 put a half one or a piece it would have burnt completely.
Also, the dharbh=
as I have were a bit bent and I could not put them pointed to north or sout=
h or the other directions correctly. Hope that was ok too !

Now some quest=
ions (I am sure these have been answered, I apologize, but would appreciate=
 if you respond again); btw, if these could be put in FAQ, will be much obl=
iged.
1. what do I do with the partially burnt poornahuti ? Can I use it to=
morrow ? Also, what does one do with all the ash and the burnt part? What i=
s the holy way to dispose it off ? No lakes or river by in Bangalore ! Do I=
 put them under a tree and pour water ? Not many trees, only plants, in the=
 apts I live here.
2. If there are any unburnt part of the twigs, can I use=
 them again? Or do they need to be disposed off ?
3. Is it advisable to dip=
 (not pour) the twigs in the ghee so that they burn well ?

Let me know of =
other points I might have known for a beginner.

Finally, a million thanks =
and appreciations for all who are responsible (Sh MMP, Sh PVR, etc.) for th=
e KT.

regards
rAma
