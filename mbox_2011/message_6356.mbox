The parents nowadays are irresponsible. They are deluded. Thinking that the=
y are educating their children, they allow their children to rot in delusio=
n, worldliness and passion! If there are five sons, the parents want all th=
eir sons to become barristers and judges! There is vanity at the root of al=
l this. If at least one of your sons has the glorious fortune to open his i=
nward eye, to realize the futility of earthly life, to renounce all his att=
achments and to take to the wise path of self-realization, that son has don=
e his greatest duty to his parents, that son has opened the doors of salvat=
ion to his parents and family-people! He has become a center of worship and=
 adoration to all people in his country! What is the use of physical servic=
e to parents and relatives? What is the use of fighting for social and poli=
tical freedom, when everybody is locked up in the jail of ego and delusion?=
 What is the use of beating the air thinking it is a drum? But so is all th=
is activity and business of life in the world which is only an airy nothing=
 when compared to the glorious truth of self-realization! What is the use o=
f working in an office with a slavish mentality, which is but the outcome o=
f ignorance? The pay you receive in the offices is only a bait in this worl=
d of Maya! How much have you eaten, how much have you drunk, how much have =
you enjoyed, how much have you slept? Is there an end for this?
