Namaste Doctor Saa'b,

You have described aptly my experience and =
now I know that it's with many people at some stage. My interest in reading=
 books is almost negligible since past 3 years. Only books I read with grea=
t interest recently are Aghora Series.

I think Practical is required now. =
Purpose of books is probably served. As Ramakrishna said to one of his disc=
iples that once you read and understood the message written on a piece of p=
aper, then there is no need to cling on to the paper!

Regards,

Utpal
