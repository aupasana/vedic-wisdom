All tantrik philosophy is NOT left handed. There are right handed 
tantras as well as left handed tantras. You are totally off the mark.

Do you consider Rudra, Durga and Chandi as "taamasik deities"? If I want 
to worship Rudra with Rudra Namaka Prasna (from YajurVeda) or Durga with 
Durga Sooktam (from RigVeda) or Chandi with Devi Sooktam (from RigVeda), 
are you suggesting that I should do all of the above???!

*        *        *

The above is utter nonsense.

First of all, those who want to understand the gunas composing deities, 
humans and demons should read Yoga Vaasishtham. Vasishtha defines a 3x3 
matrix of gunas and places various kinds of deities, humans and demons 
in that. His description removes a lot of misconceptions on "tamasik 
deities" etc.

Second of all, the above is saying that the only way to worship some 
fierce deities (let me use this term instead of tamasik deities) is 
through vaama maarga (left-handed path). That is nonsense. Left-handed 
path is for those who are already so pure that even meat, fish, alcohol 
and sex do not distract one's focus from god and from the deep 
realization that "sarvam khalvidam brahma". It is not for all. As Robert 
Svoboda correctly says at the beginning of "Aghora: At the left hand of 
god", most people who are attracted to this path for the kick are doomed 
to fail and those who are pure enough for it are not attracted to it.

Fierce deities such as Rudra, Durga, Chandi etc can be worshipped in a 
saattwik manner also and THAT is better for MOST people.

*        *        *

> Narashima is very quick to give reference of shiva homa in tantrik

> and tamasik purans

First of all, I quoted Vishnu Dharmottara Purana and Agni Purana! If 
Agni (Fire!) Purana is not an acceptable reference for homam, I wonder 
what is!

Second of all, the notion that some puranas are saattwik, some are 
rajasik and some are tamasik, was conjured by people who could not 
reconcile apparent contradictions within different puranas. If one 
understands the Upanishadic essence correctly, all contradictions fall 
in place and all puranas are meaningful.

Is Shiva a sattwik deity or a taamasik deity? If he is a taamasik deity, 
I thought your theory was that he should not be worshippe in a saattwik 
manner! If he is a saattwik deity, what was your problem with a saattwik 
homam to him? You lectured on the taamasik methods above!

I see no consistency in your views and all I can see is stubborn 
misconceptions.

On saattwik, raajasik and taamasik worships, see what Krishna says in 
Bhagavad Gita. Just because you consider Rudra to be tamasik, worship of 
Rudra for spiritual progress does not become taamasik. Just because we 
consider Vishnu to be saattwik, worship of Vishnu for the death of an 
enemy does not become saattwik. Nature of worship is decided based on 
the desires, attitude and state of mind. See what Krishna teaches.

We do not cater to those who want to do homam for taamasik purposes, no 
matter which deity. We cater to people worshipping various deities for 
mostly saattwik purposes, viz fulfilling dharmik desires at the material 
level and progressing spiritually. So the procedure we teach IS 
invariable saattwik.

Those who want a physical guru can think of me or my guru Dr Manish 
Pandit as gurus for the homam procedures taught by us in free manuals. 
If you are doing something wrong because of my instruction, I am willing 
to take on the karma and suffer the consequences.

The original purohit and the original guru of Veda is Agni, the Fire. If 
you do not have a capable guru, take Agni as the guru, worship him 
everyday or every weekend and surrender to him. He will do the job of a 
guru and transform you. Anybody who says that is not possible does not 
know the power of Agni! Fire ritual is not my creation. It was the 
favorite sadhana of rishis and many cultures benefited from it.

Best regards,
Narasimha
