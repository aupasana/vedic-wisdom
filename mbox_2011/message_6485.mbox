Is it possible indeed?  I certainly hope so, for this seems a really lovely=
 idea.

The main difficulty I see in crafting such a rite is the offering i=
tself, as there doesn't even seem to be agreement among long-time scholars =
as to what Soma actually was/is.  Of course, there are substitutes - the pl=
ant(s?) used at the recent Kerala athirathram, for example - but what might=
 a person use if living in an area where such species are unavailable?

I'm=
 willing to help, though my knowledge is very small.
