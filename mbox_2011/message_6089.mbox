 197 Hence the totality of all these differences, experienced by the unwise=
,
exists only in the mind=E2=80=99s perception. All the mind=E2=80=99s perc=
eptions have their
root in the perception of the difference between the Sel=
f and the non-Self.

198 This is the persuasion =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=
=80=99, which is the root-cause of the
tree of samsara. And since this pers=
uasion is declared to be ignorance, all
differences are the outcome of igno=
rance.

199 The mind, which is named =E2=80=98the soul=E2=80=99, itself cre=
ates and perceives these
differences through ignorance. There are no differ=
ences in the state of deep
sleep. And in the supreme state there are no dif=
ferences, specifically the
difference between God and the soul and all the =
rest.

200 For this reason all the pairs and the triads are unreal. They ar=
e
non-existent in the natural state of the Self, and the one that dwells in=

that state, the supreme state, is unaffected by them.

The pairs are exemp=
lified in the next two verses.

201-2 The Master declares that all these [l=
isted items], and any similar
entities, are [unreal] like dreams because th=
eir root-cause is the ego
sense: the difference of inside and outside, birt=
h and death, the totality
and the units, the creation and the
dissolution o=
f the world, darkness and light, the Self and the not-Self,
bondage and del=
iverance, knowledge and ignorance, the soul and God, free
will and fate, pl=
easure and pain, bad and good qualities, and merit and sin.

These are pair=
s of opposites called dvandvas. The triads (triputis) are
discussed next.

=
203 The knower, the objects of his knowledge, which are non-Self, and his
k=
nowledge of objects, and everything else that similarly comprises these
thr=
ee factors are said to be unreal, like dreams, because they are the
outcome=
 of ignorance.The world is found on scrutiny to consist of these
pairs and =
triads. The first pair to be dealt with is that of the soul and
God.

204 T=
he two, namely those named =E2=80=98the soul=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98God=E2=
=80=99, which are created and
projected on the real Self by ignorance, are =
not different from each other.
This difference is perceived during the prev=
alence of ignorance, due to the
identification with a form that is assumed =
to be real.

Apart from the limitation imposed by the form, the two are the=
 same. This is
explained next.

205 Maya is the body [or attribute] of God.=
 Ignorance is that of the soul.
Maya is subject to that Supreme One. But th=
e soul is subject to ignorance.

206 Maya and ignorance are mentioned in th=
e sacred lore in order to account
for the difference between the soul and G=
od. This difference, being rooted
in the ignorance, is unreal, but it is [r=
egarded as] real from the
standpoint of worldly activity.

This is the expl=
anation of diversity, also called duality. This will appear
as real as long=
 as the cause, this ignorance, prevails.

207 Duality will continue to appe=
ar to be real, so long as this quality of
being a =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99 do=
es not cease by right awareness [of the Self]. For this
reason, this differ=
ence will appear as real, just like all other differences
here.

208 The un=
reality of the three =E2=80=93 namely the world, God and the soul =E2=80=93=
 is
taught as a single indivisible truth. It is not possible to use one hal=
f of
a hen for cooking and the other half for laying eggs.

The analogy is =
to impress the truth taught here that the three mentioned are
real or unrea=
l as one whole, and not separately. So the teaching of their
unreality cann=
ot be accepted in regard to one, and rejected for the other
two. This will =
become clear later.

209 For the one who regards himself as the owner or dw=
eller in the body, as
being a =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99, the real Self himself=
 becomes God. Such a one should
practise devotion to Him for the sake of de=
liverance.

This need for devotion exists even for an advaitin, a believer =
in
non-difference, as is shown below.

210 Such a one who knows the truth o=
f non-difference by the intellect alone,
but is unable to achieve experienc=
e of the true nature of the real Self,
must strive to attain deliverance by=
 devotion and self-surrender to God.

There are two paths prescribed, becau=
se of a difference in qualifications.
This is explained next.

211 Only two=
 paths are laid down for the aspirant to deliverance: for the
valiant, the =
quest of one=E2=80=99s own Self, and for the fearful, self-surrender to
God=
. In these two all the paths are included.

A great many paths are known an=
d followed, but all come under these two. The
valiant one has been already =
described. The other is the one who is afraid
of samsara, but is unable to =
take to the quest taught by Bhagavan as being
the direct path. On this dire=
ct path all preconceived notions are dropped,
as will be seen later. Self-s=
urrender is the final step in the practice of
devotion to God, which is the=
 only other alternative to the direct path.

212 This two-fold path has bee=
n taught by the most holy one, Ramana,
thus: =E2=80=98Either
seek the root =
of the ego-sense [the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 that rises within the body] or
su=
rrender that ego-sense to God to have it destroyed [by His grace].=E2=80=99=


The advaitin who looks down upon devotion as inferior is next censured.

=
213 That foolish man, who, considering himself as an advaitin, but not bein=
g
valiant enough [to take to the quest as taught by Bhagavan] and who looks=

down upon devotion as inferior, lives in vain, without devotion to God. He=

is a man with a tainted mind.

The devotee is next shown to be better off =
than the rest of men.

214 In this samsara the devotee is like a pot let do=
wn into a well with a
rope tied to it. The man without devotion is like a p=
ot fallen into the
well, without a rope being tied to it.

The meaning is t=
hat the devotee is destined to be rescued from samsara by
God=E2=80=99s gra=
ce, but not so those who have no devotion.

The path of devotion is dealt w=
ith next.

215 Those who are endowed with the diabolic temperament cannot h=
ave the
right kind of devotion. Hence the good one should take hold of the =
divine
temperament for practising devotion to God.

216 The power of God, w=
ell-known in the world as grace, has three forms:
God, the Supreme Being; t=
he Holy Guru; and the real Self in the supreme
state.

These three are thus=
 declared to be one. Devotion to God leads to the
finding of the Guru, who =
is God Himself. Devotion to the Guru leads on to
right awareness of the Sel=
f, which is none other than God.

217 This Grace [of God] is merely the fac=
t that He Himself is present in the
Heart as the real Self. Grace is the ve=
ry nature of that supreme one, and
without grace He can have no existence.
=

218 That grace of God is ever wide-awake; there is never a time when that
=
grace is absent. But so long as man=E2=80=99s ego-sense is alive, he needs =
effort on
his part.

219 That grace of God will not desert any one; she wil=
l [surely] lead all to
deliverance. Some will be delivered soon; others aft=
er a long time.

220 The devotee may think, =E2=80=98I am practising devoti=
on to God by my own
efforts, but this is not true, because it is God who pu=
rsues the deluded
soul, who wanders blindly in the forest of samsara, and t=
akes hold of him
[by His grace].

It is next shown that God=E2=80=99s grace=
 is immeasurable.

221 The extent of God=E2=80=99s grace is so much, He giv=
es Himself to devotees: for
when, by His grace, the ego is destroyed, the a=
spirant obtains the state of
not being different from Him.

This is one of =
the sayings of Bhagavan.

222 God is that kind of magnetic mountain which d=
raws the souls to Himself,
makes them motionless and consumes them [like fo=
od] and ever after
safeguards them in the supreme state, endless bliss, whi=
ch is His own state.

This truth is set forth in the 6th and 11th verses of=
 one of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s
hymns to Sri Arunachala, Arunachala Dasakam.

Al=
l souls are destined to reach this goal by divine grace. This is described
=
in the next verses, whose theme is taken from the eighth verse of Bhagavan=
=E2=80=99s
Arunachala Ashtakam.

223-4 As the river, born from the rains of=
 the clouds that rise from the
sea, returns to its source, the sea, and as =
the bird, wandering a long time
in the sky, obtains rest by returning to [i=
ts home on] earth, so the soul,
which has originated in the supreme one, af=
ter wandering in this samsara for
an immense period of time, returns in the=
 reverse direction and rejoins that
supreme one, from where it originated.
=

225 Devotion is taught as being of two kinds, according to the degree of
r=
ipeness of the devotee; in the beginning it is devotion like that of the
ba=
by monkey, and afterwards devotion like that of the kitten.

The baby monke=
y keeps hold of its mother by its own effort, whereas the
kitten makes no e=
ffort, but relies entirely on the mother cat. The unripe
devotee is like th=
e former and the ripe one is like the latter; the former
has his egoism ram=
pant; the egoism of the latter is greatly subdued, and
hence he is the reci=
pient of more abundant grace, and reaches the goal much
sooner.

226 After =
practising devotion like that of the baby monkey through a great
many lives=
, in the end, when his egoism is greatly reduced, he practises
devotion lik=
e the kitten.

227 The devotion that is like the kitten=E2=80=99s is the sa=
me as taking refuge at
the feet of God and surrendering to Him. This devoti=
on, becoming further
purified by the refinement of the mind, becomes equal =
to right awareness in
course of time.

228 There is the saying of the most =
holy one that real surrender is that
which is made by he who knows the trut=
h of himself by the quest of the Self.

Self-surrender is real and effectiv=
e to the extent that the ego-sense is
attenuated. Hence, so long as the ego=
 survives, self-surrender is imperfect
and incomplete. It becomes complete =
and fruitful only when the ego dies once
for all, never to revive.

229 Dev=
otion is also of two kinds: one with a sense of separateness and the
other =
with a sense of non-difference. The former is prescribed for the
unrefined;=
 the latter is excellent for the well-refined ones.

The sense of differenc=
e detracts from the quality of devotion. He who is
convinced that differenc=
es are not true is alone capable of the real
surrender of himself; hence hi=
s devotion is superior. But, as is shown next,
devotion with a sense of dif=
ference is not to be despised.

230 If one, considering Him, who is only th=
e Self, as other than oneself,
worships Him in a form and by a name, then i=
n course of time, through the
clarification of his intellect, he surely rea=
ches the supreme state. There
is no doubt about this.

Ascribing a form and=
 a name to God is unavoidable for those who, being
unable to take to the di=
rect path, nevertheless want deliverance and wish to
worship God to win His=
 grace.

The ignorance and narrowness of those followers of religions that =
condemn
the use of images in divine worship was well exposed by Bhagavan in=
 a talk
with some Muslims, which is reported in Maha Yoga and in Talks with=
 Sri
Ramana Maharshi. The gist of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s reply to the Muslims w=
as that one
who thinks himself to be a form, a mortal body =E2=80=93 while =
really being really
formless and nameless =E2=80=93 has no right to raise t=
his question. During the
state of ignorance it is permissible for a sincere=
 devotee to regard God as
having a form and a name, and to use images or sy=
mbols to facilitate
worship. There is another saying of Bhagavan, which is =
given in the next
verse.

s mother by its own effort, whereas the kitten makes no effort, but relies =
entirely on the mother cat. The unripe devotee is like the former and the r=
ipe one is like the latter; the former has his egoism rampant; the egoism o=
f the latter is greatly subdued, and hence he is the recipient of more abun=
dant grace, and reaches the goal much sooner.</span><br>

<br><span style=
=3D"font-weight:bold">226 After practising devotion like that of the baby m=
onkey through a great many lives, in the end, when his egoism is greatly re=
duced, he practises devotion like the kitten.</span><br>
<br>227 The devoti=
on that is like the kitten=E2=80=99s is the same as taking refuge at the fe=
et of God and surrendering to Him. This devotion, becoming further purified=
 by the refinement of the mind, becomes equal to right awareness in course =
of time.<br>

<br>228 There is the saying of the most holy one that real su=
rrender is that which is made by he who knows the truth of himself by the q=
uest of the Self.<br><br>Self-surrender is real and effective to the extent=
 that the ego-sense is attenuated. Hence, so long as the ego survives, self=
-surrender is imperfect and incomplete. It becomes complete and fruitful on=
ly when the ego dies once for all, never to revive.<br>

<br>229 Devotion i=
s also of two kinds: one with a sense of separateness and the other with a =
sense of non-difference. The former is prescribed for the unrefined; the la=
tter is excellent for the well-refined ones.<br><br>
The sense of differenc=
e detracts from the quality of devotion. He who is convinced that differenc=
es are not true is alone capable of the real surrender of himself; hence hi=
s devotion is superior. But, as is shown next, devotion with a sense of dif=
ference is not to be despised.<br>

<br>230 If one, considering Him, who is=
 only the Self, as other than oneself, worships Him in a form and by a name=
, then in course of time, through the clarification of his intellect, he su=
rely reaches the supreme state. There is no doubt about this.<br>

<br>Ascr=
ibing a form and a name to God is unavoidable for those who, being unable t=
o take to the direct path, nevertheless want deliverance and wish to worshi=
p God to win His grace.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">The ignoran=
ce and narrowness of those followers of religions that condemn the use of i=
mages in divine worship was well exposed by Bhagavan in a talk with some Mu=
slims, which is reported in Maha Yoga and in Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi=
. The gist of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s reply to the Muslims was that one who thin=
ks himself to be a form, a mortal body =E2=80=93 while really being really =
formless and nameless =E2=80=93 has no right to raise this question. During=
 the state of ignorance it is permissible for a sincere devotee to regard G=
od as having a form and a name, and to use images or symbols to facilitate =
worship.</span>=C2=A0There is another saying of Bhagavan, which is given in=
 the next verse.<br>
