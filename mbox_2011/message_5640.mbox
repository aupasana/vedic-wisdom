Dear Gurujans,

Need your help. In life many a times we are forced to take =
some decisions knowing that they may not be a right Karma but situation and=
 circumstances force you to do somethig which is not right.

I have recentl=
y gone through one of such tough decision and really from that day I am loo=
king for ways to mitigate the negative Karma.

What are the doshas to a mar=
ried couple if they abort a pregnancy
which is 5 weeks old pregnancy ( 3 we=
eks of conception). And if there are doshas, please suggest remedy to overc=
ome the same. Request the esteemed astrologers to suggest rituals,puja or a=
nything which is advisable so that we perform that. Also, we can pray to GO=
D that in life we dont have to take any such step.

Thanks,
Vivek
