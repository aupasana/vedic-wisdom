Namaste friends,

Thanks to the efforts of Utpal Pathak and Rajesh Rajgor, Tarpana manual 
is available in Gujarati language. The manuals until now gave the 
instructions in English and only mantras were transcribed in various 
Indian languages. Now this manual is entirely in Gujarati!

You can download it from http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana as 
usual. Click on "manual that is completely in Gujarati language".

Also, Mahaganapathi homam manual completely in Gujarati language is 
available at http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam. Click on 
"Mahaganapathi homam" and look for "one with both mantras and 
instructions in Gujarati".

Best regards,
Narasimha
