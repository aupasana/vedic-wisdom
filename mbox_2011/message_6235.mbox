The question of what constitutes a real and authentic guru is crucial for a=
ll sincere spiritual seekers. In this very direct, authoritative and no non=
sense talk, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.) provid=
es the conclusive criteria necessary to recognize who is - and is not! - an=
 authentic and legitimate guru. Even if you have been on the path of Sanata=
na Dharma for decades and feel that you already know what a real guru is, p=
repare to have your understanding radically expanded!
