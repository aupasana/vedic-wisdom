 19 That state, in which one remains immovable in one=E2=80=99s true nature=
 [as the
real Self] is [itself called] right awareness, deliverance and the=
 natural
state. He that dwells immovably in that supreme state, free from d=
elusion,
is the =E2=80=98Awakened One=E2=80=99 [Prabuddha].

The significan=
ce of the last-mentioned term will appear when we come to
study the contras=
t between the three states of life in bondage with the
so-called fourth sta=
te, which is beyond. The natural state is so called
because it transcends t=
he three states, namely waking, dream and deep sleep.

The term =E2=80=98Pr=
abuddha=E2=80=99 is the same as the term =E2=80=98Buddha=E2=80=99, which me=
ans =E2=80=98a sage=E2=80=99.

The physical body may and often does survive=
 the attainment of the supreme
state. How this can be is explained next.

2=
0 The sage who has attained the supreme state is free, even though his body=

survives, [because] he does not look upon it as himself nor as belonging t=
o
himself. Therefore, that sage is really bodiless.

Being embodied or bodi=
less is due to the attachment or non-attachment to the
body. In ignorance t=
here is the sense of =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 or of =E2=80=98This bo=
dy is
mine=E2=80=99, that is, the body is either =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 or =E2=
=80=98mine=E2=80=99. When this attachment
ceases, bondage is at an end.This=
 is an intricate point, which will become
clearer as we proceed. This survi=
val of the body of the sage is very
important because without it he cannot =
fulfil his mission, which is to
uplift his disciples.

=E2=80=98Is that sta=
te desirable?=E2=80=99 is a question that is asked. The answer to it is
now=
 given.

21 The mind-free state stated above is itself complete and endless=

happiness, since it is the mind itself that covers up [or overpowers] the
=
[natural] happiness [of the real Self] and unfolds suffering for every
crea=
ture.

The desire for happiness, says Bhagavan, is natural, but it is not t=
o be had
in its perfection in the world, where the mind is dominant, but on=
ly in the
mind-free state. It should be noted that happiness, which is natu=
ral to the
real Self, is not to be confounded with pleasure, which belongs =
to the
world-order, along with its opposite, suffering. True happiness is j=
ust
peace.

The qualifications of the aspirant for the supreme state are ne=
xt stated.

22 The lover of deliverance who is straightforward, pure, truth=
ful,
unassuming, valiant, profoundly devoted to the Guru, and endowed with =
the
six perfections, namely serenity of mind and the rest, will attain that=

supreme state without delay.

The unqualified one will be hindered in his =
efforts to attain that state by
the defects of character that are the oppos=
ites of those specified here. The
qualified one will succeed in reaching th=
at state soon and with great ease.
Defects arise from the ego, while the qu=
alifications arise by the weakening
of the ego.

The term =E2=80=98valiant=
=E2=80=99 used in the previous verse is explained next.

23 The =E2=80=98va=
lour=E2=80=99 enjoined here is just the concentration of the mind that the
=
aspirant [sadhaka] achieves by restraining its vagaries in the pursuit of
t=
he quest of the Self, since no other valour is needed here.

The word =E2=
=80=98dhira=E2=80=99 in Sanksrit consists of the two letters =E2=80=98dhi=
=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98ra=E2=80=99. The
former means the series of thoughts=
 that arise and pass through the mind.
The latter is taken as a symbol for =
=E2=80=98raksha=E2=80=99 (rakshanam), meaning control.
Through this one ach=
ieves the mental strength necessary for pursuing the
quest of the Self.

De=
votion to the Guru is another qualification that needs to be clarified. In
=
the first place, there is the question, =E2=80=98What sort of person should=
 be taken
as the Guru?=E2=80=99 This question is first answered.

24 The as=
pirant to deliverance must resort to a sage as his Guru, that is,
one who h=
as awakened from the sleep of ignorance of the Self and is
therefore free f=
rom delusion. How can one who has not awakened from that
sleep awaken other=
s who are in the same state?

This will be self-evident. Here there is a pu=
n on the word =E2=80=98prabuddha=E2=80=99,
which has two meanings: it means=
 =E2=80=98a sage=E2=80=99 and it also means =E2=80=98one who has
awakened=
=E2=80=99. Awakening implies a sleep from which one has to awake. Here the
=
sleep is the ignorance of the Self in which the dream of worldly living goe=
s
on. This description of =E2=80=98samsara=E2=80=99 as a dream in the sleep=
 of ignorance
occurs in the ancient lore.

The nature of the devotion to th=
e Guru is explained next.

25 Only that devotion to the Guru is good which =
is rendered to a sage-Guru,
and which regards him as identical with God. On=
ly by such devotion does one
attain freedom from delusion. Truly the sage i=
s not other than God.

The sage who is accepted as one=E2=80=99s Guru must =
not be regarded as just a human
being, a person, but as an incarnation of G=
od Himself, because that is the
truth of the sage, and because, if the Guru=
 be so regarded, the goal will be
reached soon. This point will be explaine=
d in detail later.

The six-fold endowment mentioned in verse 22 is next en=
umerated.

26 Mental calm, sense-control, withdrawal from worldly pursuits,=
 fortitude,
faith in the words of Guru, steadiness in sadhana =E2=80=93 the=
se six are prescribed
for the aspirant, and through these his mind will rem=
ain firm in the quest.

These will come and ripen if the aspirant persists =
in efforts to make the
quest. Faith, of course, must be present from the ve=
ry beginning. Faith
should be understood as adherence to conclusions arrive=
d at rationally, not
blindly.

All items of this endowment, especially the =
first two, depend upon the
practice of abstemiousness in eating, a discipli=
ne that is usually
neglected. Bhagavan has said that eating the minimum of =
wholesome food =E2=80=93
food of the sattvika quality =E2=80=93 is necessar=
y for sadhakas. The policy of
living to eat was expressly condemned by him =
in a Tamil verse, of which the
following is a rendering in Sanskrit. The st=
omach is represented as accusing
the eater, the soul, as a violator of the =
law of fairness to the digestive
organs:

You do not allow me, your stomach=
, rest for even one half hour; nor do you
refrain from eating for even half=
 an hour at a time; you do not care to take
note of the suffering you infli=
ct on me, which is beyond bearing.
[Understand] O Unrighteous man! It will =
be hereafter impossible for me to
live with you in this body.

Eating just =
enough for health is the means of maintaining vital economy, as
much for th=
e spiritual life as for the worldly. Health of mind is very much
dependent =
upon the health of the body as a whole, and especially of the
nervous syste=
m. It must be noted that in the West gluttony is listed as the
worst of the=
 seven deadly sins. Self-control will be easy for him who eats
righteously,=
 not for him who is wanting in fairness to the stomach. A
contented and che=
erful mind should be maintained all the time, and this will
be possible onl=
y by respecting the divinely ordained laws of health, for
which right eatin=
g is by no means the least important.

The truth of the natural state, to b=
e won by the pursuit of suitable
sadhana, is then indicated, not directly, =
but indirectly, as follows. The
next verse, which is introductory, explains=
 that no direct description of
the state is possible.

27 That state is kno=
wable only by actual experience of the truth of the real
Self. It is indica=
ted [in the sacred lore] only by negations, =E2=80=98Not so, not
so=E2=80=
=99. It is not described by speech or thought of by the mind. [Even] the
pr=
imal Guru [Dakshinamurti] taught it only by silence.

The primal Guru was G=
od Himself as Dakshinamurti, who taught the four sages,
Sanaka and the rest=
, by silence alone. The real Self, Bhagavan has
repeatedly said, is the ete=
rnal subject, who cannot be objectified, being
the Self of him that seeks t=
o objectify him.

This supreme state is therefore indirectly taught by cont=
rasting it with the
three states of life that are experienced in the life o=
f the world, while
subject to ignorance.

28 Since that state is changeless=
, worldless and calm, beyond the states of
waking and the rest, it is calle=
d the fourth state. Such is the teaching of
the Mandukya Upanishad.

This i=
s the shortest of all the chief Upanishads, but in it is given the
essence =
of all of them. Life in the world is a continuous cycle, consisting
of thre=
e distinct states, namely, waking, dream and deep sleep.

These three state=
s are a vicious circle, because all three are sustained by
an underlying co=
mmon cause, the nature of which is next explained.

29 For every creature t=
here are three states: waking, dream and deep sleep.
Sustaining these three=
 there is another sleep, the sleep of ignorance.

This ignorance of the Sel=
f is the common factor in all the three, without
which the vicious circle o=
f the three states would come to an end. This
means that for the one who ha=
s transcended the ignorance, the three states
do not exist. This basic slee=
p explains another fact, which will be stated
later.

30 The whole of this =
world is contained within this trinity of states. The
reality of the fourth=
 state, which is worldless, transcends these three
states.

This is why the=
re is no peace in the realm of ignorance. Peace prevails only
in the transc=
endental state, which is the true state of the Self.

Among the three state=
s there is a distinction, which is stated next.

31 Deep sleep is just drea=
mless sleep; the other two are sleep with dream.
The fourth state, being wi=
thout sleep and without dream, is the abode of
deliverance.

Thus it is sta=
ted that, because of the underlying sleep of ignorance, the
so-called wakin=
g is really a state of dream. This will be elaborated later,
when the quest=
ion of the reality of the world is discussed.

The fourth state is in perfe=
ct contrast with the other three, being
sleepless, dreamless and therefore =
worldless. It is the abode of freedom.
Freedom cannot be had in any of the =
three states. This is one of the
fundamentals of the transcendental metaphy=
sics as taught by the sages.

32 If that mind-free consciousness, which is =
at the meeting point of deep
sleep and waking, somehow becomes continuous, =
then the state that then dawns
is declared by the sages to be the state of =
deliverance.

Consciousness without thoughts, called pure consciousness, tr=
anscends time,
and hence it persists as the substratum even when the three =
states prevail. At
the minute point of time when one of these two states gi=
ves place to the
other, consciousness is without thought. If this transitio=
nal state is
sufficiently prolonged, then deliverance dawns say these sages=
. In the Yoga
Vasishta there is the following verse: =E2=80=98If one medita=
tes keenly on the state
that prevails at the end of waking and just before =
sleep, one attains
unending happiness.=E2=80=99

The world-appearance, ther=
efore, is just a dream. In fact, it often assumes
the quality of a nightmar=
e. It arises in the sleep that is ignorance of the
real Self. This is state=
d next.

33 Those that are overwhelmed by this sleep of ignorance are the s=
eers of
this bad dream, the world. And so long as this ignorance does not c=
ease by
the right awareness of the real Self, the souls have to wander in t=
his maze
of the three states.

The only way to escape from this bad dream i=
s to become fully aware of the
real Self. He may be called, for the moment,=
 =E2=80=98 the dweller in the supreme
state=E2=80=99.

Thus it happens that=
 all creatures =E2=80=93 both men and the so-called inferior
creatures =E2=
=80=93 are really asleep all the time, alternately dreaming and
sleeping dr=
eamlessly. Deep, dreamless sleep is just like an oasis in a
desert route.

=
34 Thus, every creature is asleep: none in this world of souls is awake.
On=
ly the sage, who, being firmly established in the fourth state, having
tran=
scended the three states, and who is free from ignorance, is awake.

Being =
awake here means being aware of the real Self as it really is. Because
of t=
his awakening, he [the sage] is no more troubled by the dream called the
wo=
rld.

This uniqueness of the sage is explained in the next two verses.

<br>Devotion to the Guru i=
s another qualification that needs to be clarified. In the first place, the=
re is the question, =E2=80=98What sort of person should be taken as the Gur=
u?=E2=80=99 This question is first answered.<br><br>24 The aspirant to deli=

om the sleep of ignorance of the Self and is therefore free from delusion. =
How can one who has not awakened from that sleep awaken others who are in t=
he same state?<br>

<br>This will be self-evident. Here there is a pun on t=
he word =E2=80=98prabuddha=E2=80=99, which has two meanings: it means =E2=
=80=98a sage=E2=80=99 and it also means =E2=80=98one who has awakened=E2=80=
=99. Awakening implies a sleep from which one has to awake. Here the sleep =
is the ignorance of the Self in which the dream of worldly living goes on. =
This description of =E2=80=98samsara=E2=80=99 as a dream in the sleep of ig=
norance occurs in the ancient lore.<br>

<br>The nature of the devotion to =
the Guru is explained next.<br><br>25 Only that devotion to the Guru is goo=
d which is rendered to a sage-Guru, and which regards him as identical with=
 God. Only by such devotion does one attain freedom from delusion. Truly th=
e sage is not other than God.<br>

<br>The sage who is accepted as one=E2=
=80=99s Guru must not be regarded as just a human being, a person, but as a=
n incarnation of God Himself, because that is the truth of the sage, and be=
cause, if the Guru be so regarded, the goal will be reached soon. This poin=
t will be explained in detail later.<br>

<br>The six-fold endowment mentio=
ned in verse 22 is next enumerated.<br><br>26 Mental calm, sense-control, w=
ithdrawal from worldly pursuits, fortitude, faith in the words of Guru, ste=
adiness in sadhana =E2=80=93 these six are prescribed for the aspirant, and=
 through these his mind will remain firm in the quest.<br>

<br>These will =
come and ripen if the aspirant persists in efforts to make the quest. Faith=
, of course, must be present from the very beginning. Faith should be under=
stood as adherence to conclusions arrived at rationally, not blindly.<br>

=
<br>All items of this endowment, especially the first two, depend upon the =
practice of abstemiousness in eating, a discipline that is usually neglecte=
d. Bhagavan has said that eating the minimum of wholesome food =E2=80=93 fo=

of living to eat was expressly condemned by him in a Tamil verse, of which =
the following is a rendering in Sanskrit. The stomach is represented as acc=
using the eater, the soul, as a violator of the law of fairness to the dige=
stive organs:<br>

<br>You do not allow me, your stomach, rest for even one=
 half hour; nor do you refrain from eating for even half an hour at a time;=
 you do not care to take note of the suffering you inflict on me, which is =
beyond bearing. [Understand] O Unrighteous man! It will be hereafter imposs=
ible for me to live with you in this body.<br>

<br>Eating just enough for =
health is the means of maintaining vital economy, as much for the spiritual=
 life as for the worldly. Health of mind is very much dependent upon the he=
alth of the body as a whole, and especially of the nervous system. It must =
be noted that in the West gluttony is listed as the worst of the seven dead=
ly sins. Self-control will be easy for him who eats righteously, not for hi=
m who is wanting in fairness to the stomach. A contented and cheerful mind =
should be maintained all the time, and this will be possible only by respec=
ting the divinely ordained laws of health, for which right eating is by no =
means the least important.<br>

<br>The truth of the natural state, to be w=
on by the pursuit of suitable sadhana, is then indicated, not directly, but=
 indirectly, as follows. The next verse, which is introductory, explains th=
at no direct description of the state is possible.<br>

the shortest of all the chief Upanishads, but in it is given the essence of=
 all of them. Life in the world is a continuous cycle, consisting of three =
distinct states, namely, waking, dream and deep sleep.<br>
<br>
These three=
 states are a vicious circle, because all three are sustained by an underly=
ing common cause, the nature of which is next explained.<br><br>29 For ever=
y creature there are three states: waking, dream and deep sleep. Sustaining=
 these three there is another sleep, the sleep of ignorance.<br>

<br>This =
ignorance of the Self is the common factor in all the three, without which =
the vicious circle of the three states would come to an end. This means tha=
t for the one who has transcended the ignorance, the three states do not ex=
ist. This basic sleep explains another fact, which will be stated later.<br=
>

<br>30 The whole of this world is contained within this trinity of state=
s. The reality of the fourth state, which is worldless, transcends these th=
ree states.<br><br>This is why there is no peace in the realm of ignorance.=
 Peace prevails only in the transcendental state, which is the true state o=
f the Self.<br>

<br>Among the three states there is a distinction, which i=
s stated next.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">31 Deep sleep is jus=
t dreamless sleep; the other two are sleep with dream. The fourth state, be=
ing without sleep and without dream, is the abode of deliverance.</span><br=
>

<br>Thus it is stated that, because of the underlying sleep of ignorance=
, the so-called waking is really a state of dream. This will be elaborated =
later, when the question of the reality of the world is discussed.<br><br>
=

The fourth state is in perfect contrast with the other three, being sleepl=
ess, dreamless and therefore worldless. It is the abode of freedom. Freedom=
 cannot be had in any of the three states. This is one of the fundamentals =
of the transcendental metaphysics as taught by the sages.<br>

<br>32 If th=
at mind-free consciousness, which is at the meeting point of deep sleep and=
 waking, somehow becomes continuous, then the state that then dawns is decl=
ared by the sages to be the state of deliverance.<br><br><span style=3D"fon=
t-weight:bold">Consciousness without thoughts, called pure consciousness, t=
ranscends time, and hence it persists as the substratum even when the three=
 states prevail.</span>=C2=A0At the minute point of time when one of these =
two states gives place to the other, consciousness is without thought. If t=
his transitional state is sufficiently prolonged, then deliverance dawns sa=
y these sages.=C2=A0<span style=3D"font-weight:bold">In the Yoga Vasishta t=
here is the following verse: =E2=80=98If one meditates keenly on the state =
that prevails at the end of waking and just before sleep, one attains unend=
ing happiness.=E2=80=99</span><br>

<br>The world-appearance, therefore, is=
 just a dream. In fact, it often assumes the quality of a nightmare. It ari=
ses in the sleep that is ignorance of the real Self. This is stated next.<b=
r><br>33 Those that are overwhelmed by this sleep of ignorance are the seer=
s of this bad dream, the world. And so long as this ignorance does not ceas=
e by the right awareness of the real Self, the souls have to wander in this=
 maze of the three states.<br>

<br>The only way to escape from this bad dr=
eam is to become fully aware of the real Self. He may be called, for the mo=
ment, =E2=80=98 the dweller in the supreme state=E2=80=99.<br><br>Thus it h=
appens that all creatures =E2=80=93 both men and the so-called inferior cre=
atures =E2=80=93 are really asleep all the time, alternately dreaming and s=
leeping dreamlessly. Deep, dreamless sleep is just like an oasis in a deser=
t route.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">34 Thus, every creature =
is asleep: none in this world of souls is awake. Only the sage, who, being =
firmly established in the fourth state, having transcended the three states=
, and who is free from ignorance, is awake.</span><br>

<br>Being awake her=
e means being aware of the real Self as it really is. Because of this awake=
ning, he [the sage] is no more troubled by the dream called the world.<br><=
br>This uniqueness of the sage is explained in the next two verses.<br>
