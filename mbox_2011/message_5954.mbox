 The Supreme Science as of the Self as Taught by Sri Ramana

In the late 19=
20s Lakshman Sarma had the rare privilege of having private
lessons from Bh=
agavan. Their subject was the philosophy and practical
teachings expounded =
by Bhagavan in Ulladu Narpadu. Lakshman Sarma
subsequently summarised the e=
ssence of these lessons in two works: his Tamil
commentary on Ulladu Narpad=
u and Revelation, his expanded Sanskrit rendering
of the original Ulladu Na=
rpadu verses. In the 1930s Bhagavan remarked that
Lakshman Sarma's commenta=
ry on Ulladu Narpadu was the best available on that
work. In the late 1930s=
 Lakshman Sarma put many of these ideas and
explanations into Maha Yoga, hi=
s English presentation of Bhagavan's
teachings.

In the 1950s Lakshman Sarm=
a made a further attempt to explain and summarise
Bhagavan's teachings. He =
composed a Sanskrit work of over 700 verses,
entitling it Sri Ramana Paravi=
dyopanishad.

Benedictory Verse

We bow our heads to holy Ramana, the ocean=
 of grace, the infinite,
incommensurable, unborn primal divinity, Guru of a=
ll Gurus, shining in the
Hearts of all creatures as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.

I=
n this verse the essence of the teaching is indicated. Devotion and
self-su=
rrender to the one real being, the real Self of all creatures, is
shown to =
be the means of attaining the goal of life, which may be here
stated as re-=
integration with that Being, separateness from it being the
original sin an=
d the cause of all evil.

Herein is also expressed the saving truth, the un=
ity of the three apparently
distinct entities, God, the Guru and the real S=
elf, which was neatly
expressed in an ancient work, the Manasollasa, a comm=
entary by Sri
Sureshwaracharya on the Sri Dakshinamurti Stotra by Bhagavan =
Sri
Sankaracharya:

1 Homage to Sri Dakshinamurti, manifest in three forms =
as God, the Guru and
the real Self, whose form is infinite as the sky.

Dak=
shinamurti was the name of God when He appeared as the primal Guru and
taug=
ht the sacred mystery of the supreme state by silence to the four sages,
Sa=
naka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanatkumara. Bhagavan our Master has said
tha=
t these three are the three stages of divine grace: first God, then the
Gur=
u, and last the real Self. This will be explained later.

The subject of th=
is revelation is next stated.

2 In this work is expounded the teaching abo=
ut the natural state of the real
Self, known as right awareness, which was =
taught in the Mandukya and other
Upanishads, and which has [now] been taugh=
t by that same [divine Guru],
along with the means thereto, as experienced =
by himself.

Both the ancient Upanishads and these new Upanishads have been=
 given out by
the same teacher. For all sages and Gurus are one, being iden=
tical with the
Supreme Being, the Self of all.

It is to be noted that the =
state of deliverance, the goal of all aspirants,
is styled the =E2=80=98nat=
ural state=E2=80=99, because even now we are all in that state,
our sense o=
f being in other states being an illusion.

Bhagavan, our Master, took on a=
 human form and even went through sadhana
[means of reaching the goal] so t=
hat he could teach us by his own
experience.

How one becomes a disciple is=
 next briefly described.

3 Becoming keenly aware that worldly life is full=
 of misery, because it is
infested with desire and fear, one should approac=
h a Guru, a sage who is
free from those bad forces, and after doing reveren=
ce to his holy feet
should question him about how to become free.

Worldly =
life is full of misery because of one=E2=80=99s subjection to desires and
f=
ears that never cease but only change their forms. Only one whose
attachmen=
ts have been weakened by the realisation that true and lasting
happiness is=
 not to be had in this worldly life is ripe for discipleship. Such
a one sh=
ould seek out a competent Guru, who is free from the bondage he
wants to es=
cape from, and who is a sage who always abides in the aforesaid
natural sta=
te. Reverence to the Guru is imperative, because the ego, which
is the seed=
 of all evil, has to be eliminated in due course, not pampered.

4 The sage=
 will give out in reply the supreme secret, confirmed by the
[uniform] expe=
rience of all sages: =E2=80=98If you know yourself, there is no
suffering f=
or you. If you suffer [it only means that] you do not know
yourself.=E2=80=
=99

5 =E2=80=98Since you have no suffering in deep sleep, this suffering i=
s only falsely
ascribed to your Self. Realise the truth of yourself by the =
resolve to know
it, and thereafter remain in your own true nature, which is=
 bliss.=E2=80=99

The real Self transcends the mind and is therefore unaffe=
cted by pleasure
and pain. These are in and of the mind alone. The proof of=
 this is that
these are experienced only when the mind is functioning =E2=
=80=93 as in waking and
dream =E2=80=93 and not when the mind is still, as =
in deep sleep. To be free from
suffering the only means, therefore, is to b=
ecome aware of one=E2=80=99s real Self
by the quest taught by Bhagavan, our=
 Guru. The Self does not need to be made
happy. It is itself happiness. Thi=
s very teaching appears in brief in the
Tamil Book, Kaivalya Navaneetam, an=
d Bhagavan gave it out as the essence of
his own teaching.

Is that all? Wh=
at about the contents of the Upanishads and the rest of the
sacred lore?

6=
 This teaching of the Guru is the very essence of all the Upanishads. All
t=
he texts of the latter are just commentaries on this teaching.

The teachin=
g is given in a slightly more detailed form in the verses that
follow.

7 I=
n the Heart there dwells the reality that is pure consciousness, the real
S=
elf. To be in the Heart, with the mind quiescent, is knowledge [awareness]
=
of it, and also the state of deliverance.

The state of deliverance is just=
 the mind-free state in which the real Self,
the dweller in the Heart, is r=
ealised as such.

The real Self is not the dutiful little apparent self, ca=
lled the =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99.
What then is it? The answer follows.

8 Th=
at pure consciousness, which is the real Self shining in the Heart, ever
th=
e same [without change], and the basic substratum =E2=80=93 named Brahman =
=E2=80=93 of the
whole universe, are both one and the same.

That is the me=
aning intended to be conveyed by the sacred texts of the
Upanishads, which =
say that the Supreme Being itself entered the body as the
soul, while also =
giving a popular account of what is known as =E2=80=98creation=E2=80=99.
Re=
ally there was no creation, except that which will be presently explained.
=

9 The world appearance is ignorantly superimposed by the mind upon that
su=
bstratum, which is the truth of the Self. It [the world appearance]
conceal=
s that reality and shines [as if it is] real so long as the ignorance
persi=
sts.

Ignorance and mind are inseparable; where there is mind, there alone =
is
ignorance; where there is no mind, there is no ignorance, since in the
m=
ind-free state the real Self is not concealed. This explains why the real
S=
elf is not known to men in general.

An analogy is next given to help to un=
derstand the above statement.

10 Just as, in a dim light, the snake concea=
ling the real rope is taken as
real in its own sight, so the world, conceal=
ing the Self, appears as real in
its own sight. This is the state of ignora=
nce.

The notion of the Self that develops because of this basic ignorance =
is
described next.

11 Because of ignorance, the Self is believed to be lim=
ited to the body. [In
that state] it enjoys and suffers, is bound by bonds =
of desire to the world,
[and appears to be] ignorant and distinct from the =
Supreme Being. Really the
Self is identical with it, not other.

This mista=
ken view of one=E2=80=99s own Self is the starting point of all the evil,
k=
nown as samsara, which means the necessity of being born and dying in an
en=
dless cycle. But all this is unreal, as explained in the very first verse
o=
f Ekatma Panchakam (The Five Verses on the One Self), where it is said that=

mistaking the body for the Self, the cycle of births and deaths,
Self-real=
isation and becoming the Self, are all a dream, like a world tour
in a drea=
m.

12 Hence this world-wandering of the Self is just a myth. But this can =
be
verified only in the mind-free state. =E2=80=98Apart from the mind there=
 is no
ignorance; the mind itself is ignorance, which is bondage to life in=
 the
world.=E2=80=99

The latter half of the verse is a quotation from Vive=
ka Chudamani of Sri
Sankaracharya.

The analogy of the rope-snake is here r=
epeated, to explain this wrong notion
of the Self.

13 As one seeing the fa=
lse snake fails to see the real rope, so, seeing the
world =E2=80=93 in whi=
ch are included the personal God and the individual soul =E2=80=93 he
does =
not see the real Self as it really is, that is, as the supreme reality
[Bra=
hman].

How long will this effect of ignorance continue?

14 The Self will =
remain concealed [in this way] as long as the world is
taken to be real. It=
 will cease to be so taken when the mind is once and for
all extinguished; =
hence one must strive towards extinguishing the mind.

The world-appearance=
 being the obstacle to right awareness of the Self, and
the mind being the =
cause of the world-appearance, the cure of this evil is
the attainment of t=
he mind-free state, which is done by the quest, which
will now be briefly d=
escribed.

15-16 The mind projects on the Self the illusory world appearanc=
e. He who,
seeing the Self, becomes firmly established in the true state as=
 that Self,
thus uncovering that Self and dissolving the mind, which compri=
ses ignorance
and the whole world, will enjoy his own true state, which is =
without
samsara, which is not covered by the vehicles, which is identical w=
ith
Brahman, and which exists alone, without a second.

The full significan=
ce of these revelations will be understood in due course,
in the course of =
this book.

An alternative to the quest is the path of devotion to God, cul=
minating in
self-surrender, which also leads ultimately to the same goal. T=
his is
indicated in the next two verses.

17 Or if, from fear of the flood =
of births and deaths, one takes refuge in
God, then ignorance will cease by=
 His grace alone, and then one will become
established in the true state of=
 the Self.

This self-surrender is the final stage of the practice of devot=
ion, which is
dealt with in the next verse.

18 The wise call by the name =
=E2=80=98self-surrender=E2=80=99 the offering of oneself to God
through dev=
otion. Hence, the seeker of deliverance must practise devotion to
God, whic=
h is described as ninefold, consisting of listening and the rest.

The nine=
fold list comes from a list in the Bhagavatam: =E2=80=98Listening to tales
=
of God=E2=80=99s glory, telling and remembering them, cleaving to His feet,=
 worship,
obeisance, acts of service, cherishing Him as a friend, and offer=
ing oneself
to Him.

A few of the different names of the supreme state are =
given next:

<br>17 Or if=
, from fear of the flood of births and deaths, one takes refuge in God, the=
n ignorance will cease by His grace alone, and then one will become establi=
shed in the true state of the Self.<br><br>This self-surrender is the final=
 stage of the practice of devotion, which is dealt with in the next verse.<=

offering of oneself to God through devotion. Hence, the seeker of deliveran=
ce must practise devotion to God, which is described as ninefold, consistin=
g of listening and the rest.<br>

<br>The ninefold list comes from a list i=
n the Bhagavatam: =E2=80=98Listening to tales of God=E2=80=99s glory, telli=
ng and remembering them, cleaving to His feet, worship, obeisance, acts of =
service, cherishing Him as a friend, and offering oneself to Him.<br>
