Dear Seniors, 
=C2=A0
These are indeed truly inspiring and encouraging emai=
ls. But I have a few questions to ask and a few comments to make. Excuse me=
 if they apear too silly. 
=C2=A0
1. When you say the homam with entire Cha=
ndi, do you mean the just the 13 chapters or the whole thing with all forma=
lities like kavacham,argala, keelaka, suktas, atharvaseersha, rahasyams, ks=
hama and siddha kunjika? The reason I ask this is, there is big difference =
in the amount of time that one has to plan for between the former and latte=
r approaches.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
2. Rajarshi is amazing, he travels in overcrowde=
d trains in mumbai, and still does the spiritual sadhana! Wow! that is some=
thing that is truly inspiring. I worked in mumbai for a short time and know=
 what life is like, although I never had to take those trains for daily wor=
k. I was living in powai and working at seepz, taking autorickshaws for dai=
ly commute. A royal life one could get in mumbai! 
=C2=A0
3. I know it is a=
 matter of prioritizing but I have too many priorities where everything see=
ms important. I am a practising amateur musician and that demands at least =
a few hours of practise every week just to retain the skill I acquired in l=
ast three decades. I am interested in telugu classical literature and keep =
reading pothana and kavitrayams works and boy! those are voluminous works. =
I am deeply interested in Samskritam and=C2=A0am currently enrolled in Sams=
krtia Bharati's courses=C2=A0and there=C2=A0is significant amount of work i=
n that too. I have started=C2=A0trying to read Bhagavadgita and=C2=A0Valmik=
i Ramayanam in original, without getting to the translation=C2=A0since that=
 is objective behind=C2=A0learning Samskritam. That takes quite a bit of ti=
me as well. I=C2=A0was not a scholar from childhood and trying to learn the=
se things in this middle age is=C2=A0taking a lot from me..=C2=A0I think th=
at is the issue. But I trust mother will show me a=C2=A0way=C2=A0as the tim=
e=C2=A0goes by. 
=C2=A0
4. All you serious sadhakas, if you are married, ho=
w much of spousal support you get for=C2=A0your practises?=C2=A0In my case,=
 She tolerates it to certain extent, like daily=C2=A0 Ganapathi Homam, but =
anything beyond that she gets stressed out, although I don't expect any hel=
p from her. She doesn't openly protest it, but she get stressed and it star=
ts affecting her health. 
=C2=A0
Regards, 
=C2=A0

------------------------------------<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> Dear Rajarsh=
i,<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> I completely agree with you that Chandipath is=

 a wonderful sadhana and I <BR>> am stating this with personal experien=
ce. Around Navaratri this year I <BR>> have completed a 108 times recita=
tion of chandipath over two/three <BR>> months and that was indeed one o=
f the best periods of my life so far. <BR>> Although there is nothing th=
at manifested in terms of material benefits, <BR>> my overall mood was p=
retty elevated/calm most of the time. After that, <BR>> however I am not=
 able to practise it so much and I don't enjoy that same <BR>> bliss any=
more. But whenever I do Chandipath, that day in general my <BR>> mental =
state is pretty calm. However, it is a tough sadhana to do <BR>> everyda=
y. The Path alone takes around an hour to recite, that too if you <BR>> =
superfast, which you are not supposed to, according to the book. If you <BR=
>> recite at comfortable speed, it takes around 1 hour 20 minutes just f=
or <BR>> the 13 chapters. Add the kavacham, argala, keelaka,
 ratrisukta=
m, <BR>> artharvaseersham before and devi sooktam, three rahasyams, ksha=
ma <BR>> prathana and siddha kunjika strotram you are taking 2 to 2.5 ho=
urs. For <BR>> me that seems impossible on a daily basis. So, I have tri=
ed to do 2/3 <BR>> chapters a day for daily practise but that does not g=
ive me the same <BR>> bliss that I enjoy when I do the whole thing. So, =
I don't know how to <BR>> practise this regularly on a permanent basis. =
Any inputs from you?<BR>> <BR>> Nagraj<BR>> <BR>> --- On Sat, 1=

 19, 2011, 1:03 PM<BR>> <BR>> Dear Rakesh,<BR>> <BR>> The Chand=
iPath is a text which can bestow all the four aims of life as <BR>> ment=
ioned in scriptures - Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moskha. One who does a <BR>&g=
t; Chandipath thrice a day for a few years at leasts, ends up transforming =
<BR>> himself completely from being an ordinary, average, limited, frail=
 human <BR>> being to a 'god' of sorts. Our religion teaches the transfo=
rmation of <BR>> how a man becomes a god. Not G-d but god.<BR>> <BR>&=
gt; Strength, courage, confidence, devotion, knowledge, application of <BR>=
> special knowledge, authority (if one so desires it), power, wisdom, <B=
R>> spiritual experiences, liberation, enlightenment etc -
 everything c=
omes <BR>> from this one text. It is a whole package.<BR>> <BR>> E=
ventually you get what you crave for deep down. It is not too difficult <BR=
>> to master the text. Some effort, some patience and it can be done. Sp=
end <BR>> one hour daily practicing the text and in 3 months you can rea=
d it <BR>> whole.<BR>> <BR>> Best of luck.<BR>> <BR>> -Regar=
ds<BR>> Rajarshi<BR>> <BR>> PS: A small word of caution. Maybe not=
 relevant right now, but if ever <BR>> by Her will you become an accompl=
ished Chandi sadhaka in future then <BR>> this will be of help. Don't as=
k for anything when doing Her worship is <BR>> an ideal situation. If yo=
u pray simply as you pray in any temple, then <BR>> too there is not a p=
roblem. Praying with humility is never a problem. <BR>> BUT if ever you =
try out kriyas with Chandi or do the Chandipath to get <BR>> xyz results=
 in abc timeframe, (specially during complex forms of
 worship <BR>> of =
Chandi like those involving charnel grounds), then be sure that you <BR>>=
; know the precise and exact procedures. There are no half measures in <BR>=
