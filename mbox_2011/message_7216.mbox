Namaste

I am Ashish and i belongs to gujarat, here we have tradition that =
we dont cut hair on thursday and saturday, we dont buy shoes and anything m=
ade of iron on saturday. The reason is it brings badluck to it.

Last satur=
day i experienced it, that day me and my father resolved a matter we had di=
fference on, at evening i went to buy shoes for me, after buying them when =
i was watching tv, my father suddenly called me and started cursing me.

So=
 the question is, is it truth or belief?
