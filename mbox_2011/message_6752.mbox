Dear Anand Ji,

About wood used for Homams: The be=
st ones for good purposes are the milk giving 
tree's wood. (I mean dried o=
nes.). In south mostly wood of Jackfruit tree is 
used and in its=C2=A0abse=
nce=C2=A0there is another tree=C2=A0resembling=C2=A0fruits like that

t=C2=A0or 
pivalsa or peja kayi and =C2=A0I=C2=A0don't=C2=A0know its name i=
n other languages)
=C2=A0Where as in other circumstances where such wood is=
 not accessible then any wood 
can be used which is not of sour taste.=C2=
=A0
The outer coverings (shells) of Coconut are also used for creating the =
base of 
homa and also for carrying agni as it is being=C2=A0one of the par=
t of Kalpavriksha 
(coconut tree is also called kalpavruksha on earth as no=
 part of it is wasted) 
it is considered to be pure.

About Sadhanaas or ho=
mams on funeral Pyre: Yes such saddhanaas do exist but they 
are not meant =
for the common people like us. =C2=A0There is no doubt that such 
sadhanaa =
is also equally=C2=A0yielding=C2=A0as that of the=C2=A0mainstream=C2=A0simp=

 though being parallel path to that of

=C2=A0 
Hi,

=
Addendum to below explanations.

We can explain meaning of burning diyas as=
 following...

i) it=C2=A0 is one type of sewa offered to god.
ii) by burni=
ng it in front of god we are asking god to remove the andhakaar or 
tamas t=
hat has covered us and show the path of light and take us towards the 
ulti=
mate which is devoid of any gunas and full of light and self illuminating 
=
(swayamprakash)
iii) by burning it in front of god we are asking him to bur=
n all our karmas 
(good bad and all ) and make us free from bondages of kar=
mas and to take us back 
in him who is free from all karma bandhanaas.

so =
the method and materials used in doing it has its own impact on it.

Sesame=
 Seeds and its Oil:-- The quality of (gun) sesame Seeds and its oil is 
coo=
lness (sheetal gun).( The sesame seeds are used to reduce problems of heat =
or 
Ushna baadhas) and=C2=A0 the burning of same (oil) gives coolness to en=
vironment and 
to the mind too. hence most of the times in temples sesame o=
il is used for 
burning diyas. It is also helpful if you are trying to do m=
editation it will 
help in creating a environment for it.

Ghee -- And in g=
hee it is only ghee of gaay or cow=C2=A0 should be used and in that 
too of=
 one which has its calf alive( nowadays we don't come to know it as we buy =

it from shops so this point cannot be applied but it is still observed in =
rural 
areas where people prepare ghee for themselves)
The reason I mention=
ed this because its only cows ghee is pure and is of satvic 
gun and can gi=
ve similar fruits if used where as the ghee of female buffalo 
(bhains) is =
said to be of gaadh tamas and use of same would give similar results 
i.e. =
yield more tamas.( And so is difference in milk too...)

And most important=
ly it is said that the devatas eat with their drishti and by 
sensing the f=
ragrance. hence in appeasing any deity the respective material 
needs to be=
 used for offering or burning. where as ghee is most widely used in 
homams=
 as comon material the remaining offerings vary as per deity.
=C2=A0 

Than=
ks & Regards,
Chetan=C2=A0

Shri Ananda Ji,

I understand that Agni is a carrier of information (s=
ubtlest possible one) to 
the system(read as god/the other/etc) so i guess =
subtle variations would occur 
based on the combinations of thoughts/intent=
s and materials used. How many

wayamprakash)<BR>iii) by burning it in front of god we are asking him to bu=
rn all our karmas (good bad and all ) and make us free from bondages of kar=
mas and to take us back in him who is free from all karma bandhanaas.<BR><B=
R>so the method and materials used in doing it has its own impact on it.<BR=
><BR>Sesame Seeds and its Oil:-- The quality of (gun) sesame Seeds and its =
oil is coolness (sheetal gun).( The sesame seeds are used to reduce problem=
s of heat or Ushna baadhas) and  the
 burning of same (oil) gives cool=
ness to environment and to the mind too. hence most of the times in temples=
 sesame oil is used for burning diyas. It is also helpful if you are trying=
 to do meditation it will help in creating a environment for it.<BR><BR>Ghe=
e -- And in ghee it is only ghee of gaay or cow  should be used and in=
 that too of one which has its calf alive( nowadays we don't come to know i=
t as we buy it from shops so this point cannot be applied but it is still o=
bserved in rural areas where people prepare ghee for themselves)<BR>The rea=
son I mentioned this because its only cows ghee is pure and is of satvic gu=
n and can give similar fruits if used where as the ghee of female buffalo (=
bhains) is said to be of gaadh tamas and use of same would give similar res=
ults i.e. yield more tamas.( And so is difference in milk too...)<BR><BR>An=
d most importantly it is said that the devatas eat with their drishti and b=
y sensing the fragrance. hence in
 appeasing any deity the respective mater=
ial needs to be used for offering or burning. where as ghee is most widely =
used in homams as comon material the remaining offerings vary as per deity.=
