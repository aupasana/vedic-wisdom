This very touching  message was forwarded to me,and i thought more people =
should read it.I hope i am not breaking any rules.

--- USED vs LOVED---

W=
hile a man was polishing his new car, his 4 yr old son picked up a stone
an=
d scratched lines on the side of the car. In anger, the man took the
child'=
s hand
and hit it many times not realizing he was using a wrench.
At the ho=
spital, the child lost all his fingers due to multiple fractures.
When the =
child saw his father, with painful eyes he asked, 'Dad when
will my fingers=
 grow back?' The man was so hurt and speechless; he
went back to his car an=
d kicked it a lot of times.
Devastated by his own actions, sitting in front=
 of that car he looked
at the scratches;
the child had written 'LOVE YOU DA=
D'.
The next day that man committed suicide. Anger and Love have no limits;=

choose the latter to have a beautiful, lovely life & remember this:
Things=
 are to be used and people are to be loved.
The problem in today's world is=
 that people are used while things are loved.
Let's try always to keep this=
 thought in mind:
Things are to be used,
People are to be loved.

Watch you=
r thoughts; they become words.
Watch your words; they become actions.
Watch=
 your actions; they become habits.
Watch your habits; they become character=
;
Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.

I hope you have a good da=
y no matter what problems you may face
it's the only day you'll have before=
 it's over.
Love all WHO love you genuinely, and those You can trust
