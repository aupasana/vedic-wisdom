Dear Narasimha,

I was reading a very old post of yours 
http://groups.yaho=
o.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/41

where you have mentioned that Parashar=
 gave some different mantras for planets and also their count is different =
than what is generally listed out.

I request you to take out some time and=
 bring to light the Planet mantras which Parashar gave for benefit of all. =
Please give english/ devnagri version with meaning. 

Since you are sankrit=
 scholar it will be our good fortune if we can hear/learn the correct pronu=
nciation via mp3/youtube file.

much thanks and regards
Akshaya
