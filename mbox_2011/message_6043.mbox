NAMASKAR,

Dear PVR Ji, Pathak Ji and all,

My intentions to giving ahutis =
to MA BAGALAMUKHI is not at all in any materialstic gain / win over enemy e=
tc. but to surrender the whole me! in her lotus feet... D20 suggest her as =
my ISHTA DEVATA... so I thought Her more dearer to me and things could be f=
aster towards MOKSHYA... but, my mundane situations getting wrong! I am not=
 ready this time yet... Gurujans should suggest the appropriate path... I c=
an stick to the same sadhana...but whats happen to my little son, wife, fat=
her, mother, brother... I can help them by means of my material wealth... p=
ersonally I can bear any situation for myself... but what about my dependen=
t? 

Nowadays, I am stuck by the books on Vimalanda, Ramkrishna... feelings=
 the joy of different world... Searching for the appropriate path...Serchin=
g for MA...


JAI MA
Biswajit

IMHO, it is very early to think about stopping the same. Though intentions =
for specifically invoking Mother Bagalamukhi is not known, I believe that i=

 incidences to Homam with experiences of just a couple of days.

mas and I have had many set backs and some good things as well but again th=

mately, it is all about attraction/liking for a particular deity. It is my =
personal view that one needs to decide upon a Homam of a deity (Ugra or Sou=
mya Devata or Ugra-Soumya in external Nature) to which one feels most attra=
cted and then forget about the rest. It would be a destabilizing effect on =
mind of a person to start judging and relating day to day experiences with =
homam. The chosen deity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or Krishna or Shiva =
or Hanuman or any other deity. Once person starts surrendering to the chose=
n deity, one is in safe hands. Even if things starts going wrong, one need =
not despair and should keep faith till it is impossible because if God exis=
t, there never would be a breaking point and that holds true for all of us =
whether we have families to look after or not.
> I completely tend to agree=
 and hence repeat for benefits of others that Ganapati is not a Lower devat=

keep on performing his homam without need of switching. Actually to switch =
from Maha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is NOT changing of Levels (esp=
