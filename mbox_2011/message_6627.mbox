Hello - When I was contemplating of purchasing the copper homa kund, that w=
as small and with no base stand, I asked a priest standing next to me and h=
e mentioned Iron one is normally used. Immediately a north indian who was b=
uying other puja stuff too chimed in and said "loha kaa havan kund hota hai=
" ! 
So, I purchased Iron homa kund ! Apart from gunas, etc is there a reas=
on why there is a difference of opinion on which metal kund has to be used =
? 

Does the main homam mantras need to be counted? I am doing it by keepin=
g some time limit to it and not counting !

Lastly, I did not find any homa=
m manual that goes along with sandhya vandanam ! Someone I respect, mention=
ed of AupAsana homam done with daily sandhya vandanam of which 10% of mantr=
as are offered to Agni. In fact, he mentioned it is the duty of every house=
holder. Would any one here have some article or manual for it ? 

Thanks ag=
ain for your time.

regards
Prasad
