Namaste, Please tell me how can I convince my parents that doing homam is s=
afe for me? When I told my father that I purchased kundalam for doing homam=
 he was little uncomfortable about me doing it without following right proc=
edures. I think, he is afraid that something might happen to me, so I share=
d homam information by Narasimha Rao ji as well but he said not to do Chand=
i homam by myself. I am planning to start Sri Maha Ganapathi Homam over the=
 weekend.
