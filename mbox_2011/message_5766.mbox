 Q. A man in the audience said, "If ministers stop preaching hell-fire, the=
y
will have no control over their people."

A. They had better lose it then=
. The man who is frightened into religion has
no religion at all. Better te=
ach him of his divine nature than of his
animal.

Q. What did the Lord mean=
 when he said, "The kingdom of heaven is not of
this world?"

A. That the k=
ingdom of heaven is within us. The Jewish idea was a kingdom of
heaven upon=
 this earth. That was not the idea of Jesus.

Q. Do you believe we come up =
from the animals?

A. I believe that, by the law of evolution, the higher b=
eings have come up
from the lower kingdoms.

Q. Do you know of anyone who r=
emembers his previous life ?

A. I have met some who told me they did remem=
ber their previous life. They
had reached a point where they could remember=
 their former incarnations.

Q. Do you believe in Christ's crucifixion?

A.=
 Christ was God incarnate; they could not kill him. That which was
crucifie=
d was only a semblance, a mirage.

Q. If he could have produced such a semb=
lance as that, would not that have
been the greatest miracle of all?

A. I =
look upon miracles as the greatest stumbling-blocks in the way of
truth. Wh=
en the disciples of Buddha told him of a man who had performed a
so-called =
miracle =E2=80=94 had taken a bowl from a great height without touching it
=
=E2=80=94 and showed him the bowl, he took it and crushed it under his feet=
 and told
them never to build their faith on miracles, but to look for trut=
h in
everlasting principles. He taught them the true inner light =E2=80=94 =
the light of
the spirit, which is the only safe light to go by. Miracles ar=
e only
stumbling-blocks. Let us brush them aside.

Q. Do you believe Jesus =
preached the Sermon on the Mount?

A. I do believe he did. But in this matt=
er I have to go by the books as
others do, and I am aware that mere book te=
stimony is rather shaky ground.
But we are all safe in taking the teachings=
 of the Sermon on the Mount as a
guide. We have to take what appeals to our=
 inner spirit. Buddha taught five
hundred years before Christ, and his word=
s were full of blessings: never a
curse came from his lips, nor from his li=
fe; never one from Zoroaster, nor
from Confucius.
