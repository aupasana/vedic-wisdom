 Jnanis of the lowest order also enjoy pleasure and pain like the ignorant,=

but their remembrance of such experiences is frequently broken up by
inter=
vals of realisation. Thus worldly experiences do not leave an
impression on=
 their minds.

Jnanis of the middle class, accustomed to control their mind=
s by
long-continued austerities, keep their minds in check even while
exper=
iencing pleasure and pain, and thus their response to the world is as
indis=
tinct as that of a man in sleep, to a gentle breeze playing on him or
an an=
t creeping over his body.

Jnanis of the highest order are left untouched,f=
or they always remain as the
burnt skeleton of a cloth (retaining its old s=
hape but useless) after their
realisation.Just as an actor is not really af=
fected by the passions which he
displays on the stage, so also this Jnani, =
always aware of his perfection,
is not affected by the seeming pleasures an=
d pains which he regards as a
mere illusion, like the horns of a hare.
