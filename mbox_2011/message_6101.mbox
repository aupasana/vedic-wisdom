 231 =E2=80=98If a man adores God, who is nameless and formless, he will be=

liberated from the bondage due to names and forms.=E2=80=99 Such is the te=
aching of
Sri Ramana.

Also the following.

232 The man who, being endowed =
with the divine temperament, meditates with
devotion on God with a form, wi=
ll attain that same State [of deliverance]
that one attains by meditating o=
n Him as formless.

The next verse shows that the devotee is free, for purp=
oses of his devotion,
to ascribe to God any name or form that appeals to hi=
mself as lovable.

233 One may adore that one Being by name and in any form=
, as one likes.
Among the forms of the supreme one, the wise one, whose min=
d is pure, will
not see any superiority or inferiority.

Thus true catholic=
ity is the distinguishing feature of the teaching of
Vedanta. Catholicity c=
onsists not in claiming that all people should give up
their own faiths and=
 embrace one=E2=80=99s own, but in recognising that all
religions are paths=
 to God. The advaitins are expected to understand this.

Then the dictum of=
 the great poet, Kalidasa, on this point, is quoted.

234 =E2=80=98There is=
 only one God form; (but) It became divided into three; and
common to all t=
he three is superiority and inferiority [by turns].=E2=80=99

Among them, t=
here is no real superiority, nor inferiority. But superiority
or inferiorit=
y is allowed to be ascribed to them by devotees, to suit their
needs. They =
are all equally forms of the formless Brahman, the real Self.
These forms d=
isappear when the real Self is experienced as it really is.

Which, of all =
available forms, is the best, is the next question, which is
answered next.=


235 Of all the forms of God, the best is the sage, who does not consider
=
Himself as other than the Self. Indeed the sage, who is the Guru, is the
se=
cond of the [three] forms of divine grace.

236 Bhagavan Sri Krishna himsel=
f says in the Gita: =E2=80=98I myself am the sage.=E2=80=99
Therefore to kn=
ow this truth of him, as stated in the sacred lore, one
should regard the s=
age as not different from God.

237 [Also] there is the text of the Upanish=
ads, that one who wants
deliverance must worship the knower of the Self. If=
 he thinks of him [the
sage, who is the Guru] as other than God, that thoug=
ht will obstruct his
path.

One of the prominent defects of devotees who re=
gard God as other than the
Self is next noticed.

238 Those devotees who wo=
rship God as not the Self are wanting in
catholicity. In the case of a few =
of them, this defect ceases after a long
time by a clarification of the int=
ellect.

Narrowness of mind is a serious defect, and till it is overcome, t=
he
aspirant will not reach his goal.

The next topic is =E2=80=98God-vision=
=E2=80=99, on which some ignorance prevails.

239 The devotee yearns to see=
 the form of God as conceived by himself.
Sometimes he may even see that ve=
ry form, but this vision is transitory and
hence unreal.

The absurdity of =
this desire is now shown up.

240 Being himself that very Supreme Being, bu=
t regarding Him as other than
the Self through ignorance, he strives throug=
h devotion to obtain a vision
of Him! Is there anything more surprising tha=
n this?

Indeed this is topsy-turveydom!

241 How can the seeing of a form =
of the formless one be a true vision? And
how can the vision as not-self, o=
f Him that is the Self, be a true vision?

Bhagavan unties this riddle with=
 ease.

242 All form is mental, and hence the form of the spectacle is insi=
de the
spectator. It is the truth of the seer that should be sought, since =
that is
the truth of the Supreme Being.

The unreality of these visions is =
declared next.

243 =E2=80=98The man who, by the practice of devotion, sees=
 God as someone other
than himself, sees only a mental form=E2=80=99 =E2=80=
=93 such is the utterance of the most
holy one [on this point].

What then =
is the reality of God?

244 That which remains over on the annihilation of =
the [would-be] seer, by
the quest [for the truth of] the seer, is itself th=
e truth of the Self and
also the truth of the Supreme Being.

Here, the que=
st of the Self, the direct path taught by Bhagavan, is referred
to. It will=
 be dealt with later.

The real vision is the same.

245 That state, in whi=
ch the mind, called the soul, is swallowed up and has
become one with Him i=
s itself both the true vision of the Self, and the
right vision of God =E2=
=80=93 so says the holy Guru, Sri Ramana.

The next question is about how t=
o meditate on God.

246 Revelation prescribes that the aspirant should medi=
tate on Him as one=E2=80=99s
own real Self. The revelation styles as beasts=
 those who meditate on Him as
not-the-Self.

247 Bhagavan Vasishta has said=
 that he who worships God as not-Self, turning
away from the real God who i=
s the Self, is like one who goes about seeking a
precious stone, throwing a=
way the gem named Kaustubha already in his hand!

This is a quotation from =
the Yoga Vasishtam. The same subject is dealt with
from another point of vi=
ew.

248 Since the most holy one has shown that the original sin [spoken of=
 by
Christians] is just the sense of =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, the s=
ense of being
separate from God, which is the outcome of this sin, is itsel=
f only sinful!

249 The completeness [allness] of the Supreme Being, assert=
ed by revelation,
becomes true only by His being the Self. The deluded ones=
 are just denying
this completeness of His by their notion of being separat=
e from themselves.

250 But devotion practised without a sense of differenc=
e is the way of
accepting this completeness of God; and Bhagavan, our Guru,=
 says that this
devotion is most excellent and highly purifying for the asp=
irant for
deliverance.

Bhagavan also shows that devotion with sense of dif=
ference does not lead to
the goal.

251 Also, the most holy one has shown t=
hat, like the man who pursues
darkness, light in hand, the devotee who medi=
tates on God as separate does
not reach God [so long as he has this false n=
otion].

The light in the hand is the real Self, and the darkness is the
no=
n-existent, separate God. This is said by Bhagavan in the Arunachala
Ashtak=
am.

The superior devotion, on the other hand, leads to the goal, which is =
the
egoless state.

252 Since the better devotee approaches God as the Self=
, knowing that the
notion of difference, due to the ego, is false, for this=
 aspirant for
deliverance, the annihilation of the ego will be accomplished=
 quickly.

Another point is this.

253 In the case of him who adores God as=
 non-Self, the surrender of himself
is a sham, just like the gift of a coco=
nut [to a guest] is a sham in the
Chola region.
The analogy given here is t=
he custom of placing a coconut on a plate, just
for form=E2=80=99s sake, wi=
thout intending to give it.

Another consequence of the sense of difference=
 is next noted.

254 When the Supreme Being is reduced to the status of non=
-Self, the result
is that He is not the most beloved of all. For according =
to both revelation
and the common experience of all creatures, the Self is =
the dearest of all!

The concluding verse of the teaching in the Gita is a =
riddle. How Bhagavan,
our Master, solved this riddle is shown next.

255 Bh=
agavan, our Guru, declared the secret of the correct meaning of the
last ve=
rse of the Gita in the following way: =E2=80=98One should make surrender of=

oneself to the supreme one by giving up the attributes falsely ascribed to=

the real Self, namely that one is a =E2=80=9Csoul=E2=80=9D and so on.=E2=
=80=99

The word dharma in that verse of the Gita must not be taken as mean=
ing
righteous action, but as meaning =E2=80=98status=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98q=
uality=E2=80=99. Thus interpreted,
the verse makes good sense, not otherwis=
e.

This brings us to the topic of self-surrender, which is now explained.
=

256 What is called surrender of oneself to God is the final consummation o=
f
the practice of devotion. This can be achieved by the purified mind when =
the
might of the ego is greatly reduced.

257 Just as a small magnet become=
s united to a big one by the juxtaposition
of the opposite poles, so the fi=
nite soul becomes one with the Supreme Being
by the conjunction of its head=
 with His feet.

This simile of the magnet serves to bring out the need of =
perfect humility
of the devotee. If the ego is rampant, there can be no sel=
f-surrender.

How the one that has surrendered himself to God must get thro=
ugh life until
he attains perfect egolessness is described next.
