The history of sannyasins starts with the four Kumaras, Sanaka, Sanandana, =
Sanatkumara and Sanatsujata. These four Kumaras were the mental sons of Bra=
hma, the creator. Brahma created these four Kumaras through his mind and as=
ked them to help him in the work of creation. The Kumaras refused to fulfil=
 his request. They were nivritti-niratas, possessed of absolute renunciatio=
n. In spite of Brahma=E2=80=99s anger, they took to the life of nivritti an=
d meditation on Brahman. Brahma in his rage wanted to burn down these Kumar=
as. But the powerful Kumaras who ever lived in the Supreme Soul, unconnecte=
d with pravritti, could not be harmed by Brahma. Brahma=E2=80=99s rage burs=
t open through his forehead and from there emerged the ferocious Rudra.Such=
 is the power of renunciation and life in the Absolute.
