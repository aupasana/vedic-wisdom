Any neurologist will assure you that the brain offers no proof that the
out=
side world really exists and many hints that it doesn=E2=80=99t.

All the b=
rain does, in fact, is to receive continuous signals about the
body=E2=80=
=99s state of chemical balance,temperature, and oxygen consumption, along
w=
ith a crackling stream of nerve impulses. This mass of raw data starts out
=
as chemical bursts with attached electrical charges. These blips run up and=

down a tangled web of spidery nerve cells, and once a signal reaches the
b=
rain, like a runner from the edge of the Empire bringing a message to
Rome,=
 the cortex assembles the raw data into even more complex arrangements
of e=
lectrical and chemical blips.

The cortex doesn=E2=80=99t inform us about t=
his never-ending data processing, which
is all that is happening inside gra=
y matter. Instead, the cortex tells us
about the world=E2=80=94it allows us=
 to perceive sights, sounds,tastes, smells, and
textures=E2=80=94the whole =
array of creation. The brain has pulled an enormous
trick on us, a remarkab=
le sleight of hand, because there is no direct
connection between the body=
=E2=80=99s raw data and our
subjective sense of an outside world.

For all =
anyone knows, the entire outside world could be a dream. When I=E2=80=99m
i=
n bed having a dream, I see a world of events just as vivid as the waking
w=
orld (for most of us, the other four senses are scattered unevenly
througho=
ut our dreams, but some dreamers can touch, taste, hear, and smell
as accur=
ately as they can while awake). But when I open my eyes in the
morning, I k=
now that these vivid events were all produced inside my head.
I=E2=80=99d n=
ever make the mistake of falling for this trick because I already
assume th=
at dreams aren=E2=80=99t real.

So does my brain dedicate one apparatus to =
making the dream world and
another to the waking world? No, it doesn=E2=80=
=99t. In terms of cerebral function,
the dream mechanism doesn=E2=80=99t fl=
ick off when I wake up. The same visual
cortex in the rear of my skull allo=
ws me to see an object=E2=80=94a tree, a face,
the sky=E2=80=94whether I am=
 seeing it in memory, in a dream, in a photo, or
standing before me. The lo=
cations of brain cell activity
shift slightly from one to the other, which =
is why I can distinguish among
a dream, a photo, and the real thing, yet th=
e same fundamental process is
constantly taking place. I am manufacturing a=
 tree, a face, or the sky from
what is actually a random tangle of spidery =
nerves shooting bursts of
chemicals and electrical charges in my brain and =
all around my body. No
matter how hard I try, I will never find a single
pa=
ttern of chemicals and charges in the shape of a tree, a face, or any
other=
 shape. There is just a fire-storm of electrochemical activity.

This embar=
rassing problem=E2=80=94that there is no way to prove the existence of an
o=
utside world=E2=80=94undermines the entire basis of materialism. Thus we ar=
rive at
the second spiritual secret:You are not in the world; the world is =
in you.

The only reason that rocks are solid is that the brain registers a=
 flurry
of electrical signals as touch; the only reason the sun shines is t=
hat the
brain registers another flurry of electrical signals as sight. Ther=
e is no
sunlight in my brain, whose interior remains as dark as a limestone=
 cavern
no matter how bright it is outside.

Having said that the whole wor=
ld is created in me, I immediately realize
that you could say the same thin=
g. Are you in my dream or am I in yours=E2=80=94or
are we all trapped in so=
me bizarre combination of each other=E2=80=99s personal
version of events? =
To me, this isn=E2=80=99t a problem but the very heart of
spirituality. Eve=
ryone is a creator. The mystery of how all these
individual viewpoints some=
how mesh, so that your world and
mine can harmonize, is the very thing that=
 makes people seek spiritual
answers. For there is no doubt that reality is=
 full of conflict but also
full of harmony. It is very liberating to realiz=
e that as creators we
generate every aspect, good or bad, of our experience=
. In this way, each of
us is the center of creation.
