The Three Gunas: The Metaphysical Grounding of Physical Reality

By Sri Dha=
rma Pravartaka Acharya


"The empirical reality that we perceive around us =
is composed of matter. Whether we are referring to the buildings we reside =
in, the many possessions we strive for, or the very bodies with which we so=
 intimately identify, all objects are composed of the prakriti, or the prim=
e material energy, of God. Of the many qualities that are discernible in pr=
akriti (matter), the essential feature encountered is that of transience. M=
atter is in a constant state of flux, a continual cycle of becoming, being =
and dissolution. Thus everything that we perceive around us, though seeming=
ly stable, ultimately is destined to cease existing.

Prakriti, herself, is=
 not a purely undifferentiated field of substance. Prakriti consists of a s=
ubstratum of three different modes, each one dependent upon the other two f=
or their mutual existence and proper functioning. These three modes of prak=
riti, or material energy, are also known as the three gunas, which in Sansk=
rit (the ancient, sacred language of Sanatana Dharma) means 'qualities' or =
'modes'...."
