To be a Guru, one must have a command from God.
Mere study of books cannot =
make one a Guru. One who has studied the Vedas, and who has direct knowledg=
e of the Atman (Self) through Anubhava (experience), can alone be enrolled =
as a Guru. A Jivanmukta or liberated sage is the real Guru or spiritual pre=
ceptor. He is the Sadguru. He is identical with Brahman or the Supreme Self=
. He is a Knower of Brahman.
A Sadguru is endowed with countless Siddhis (p=
sychic powers). He possesses all divine Aisvarya (powers), all the wealth o=
f the Lord.

Possession of Siddhis, however, is not the test to declare the=
 greatness of a sage or to prove that he has attained Self-realisation. Sad=
gurus generally do not exhibit any miracle or Siddhi. Sometimes, however, t=
hey may do so in order to convince the aspirants of the existence of superp=
hysical things, give them encouragement, and instill faith in their hearts.=
