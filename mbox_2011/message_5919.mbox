Dear Narasimha and others,

Can different Ayurvedic herbs be used in homas =
to cure ailments? Recently I met someone who suffers from serious cronic de=
pression and bipolar disorder (shifting between extreme states of exhilarat=
ion and severe depression). The person wanted me to check her chart, but I =
trust Ganapati far more than my astrological readings. I advised the person=
 to start off worshipping Ganapati in fire irrespective of astrology.

Now =
recently while reading a book on herbs I found a reference that Jaatamaasi =
can be used to cure mental/psychological disorders. Can doing a homa using =
just jataamaasi and black til help a person get out of severe depression?

=
All thoughts/advices are welcome!

-Regards
 Rajarshi
