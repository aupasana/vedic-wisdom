 November 20th: Krithikai Day. The ashram is busy with the pouring crowds.
=
Bhagavan is sitting outside his cottage. The ashram was then just a cottage=

of thatched leaves. I was sitting inside. I did not stir from my perch fro=
m
6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Even the call for food did not shake me. My friends had
=
come that day to take me to Pondicherry.

I was rather unwilling to leave t=
he presence of this dynamic force. I could
not even open my lips for permis=
sion. For my mission and its fulfilment were
clear before me. I was hanging=
 and swinging between =E2=80=98this=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98that=E2=80=99, =E2=
=80=98here=E2=80=99
or =E2=80=98there=E2=80=99. My friends sat before me pu=
tting questions to me. Silence was my
answer. They went to Maharshi and rol=
led out their conundrums. Silence was
the answer. We were in silent heart-t=
o-heart communion as my friends
pestered him.

What is the good of remainin=
g mum like this? What is the goal of man? What
is God? What is =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99? Why are we born? How to get swaraj [self-rule] for the
country? =
Violence or non-violence? What is Vedanta? What is Siddhanta? What
is the m=
eaning of the Vedas? A series of serried questions and a cascade of
thrilli=
ng silence followed. One self-sufficient man lost his patience; he
was a fo=
llower of modern education. His brain was full with Kant and
Descartes. He =
had very poor opinion about our Sankaras and Gaudapadas. He
had more regard=
 for hatted and booted western armchair philosophers than for
realised bald=
 heads.

He hurried up to me and remarked, =E2=80=98Swamiji, you, as a well=
-educated man,
must not be like this. You must be more like Bergson, Berkel=
ey, Jung,
Huxley. You must go to America and London and acquire name and fa=
me.' My
reply: silence.

Maharshi spoke out in a calm, mellow, silvery voic=
e: =E2=80=98Bharathi, take refuge
in silence. You can be here or there or a=
nywhere. Fixed in silence,
established in the inner I, you can be as you ar=
e. The world will never
perturb you if you are well founded upon the tranqu=
ility within. You have a
sankalpa =E2=80=93 to write out your inspirations,=
 to bring out the Bharata shakti
[power of India]. It is better to finish o=
ff sankalpas here and now and keep
a clear sky within. But do it in silence=
. Gather your thoughts within. Find
out the thought centre and discover you=
r Self-equipoise. In storm and
turmoil be calm and silent. Watch the events=
 around as a witness. The world
is a drama of gold, women, desire and envy.=
 Be a witness, inturned and
introspective.=E2=80=99
