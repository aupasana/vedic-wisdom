very interesting discussions on homam recently. I really enjoy reading all =
these. Particularly notable are the inspirational posts from Shri PVR ji as=
 usual and personal anectodes from Shri Utpalji and Shri Rajarshiji. After =
reading all these, I feel as to how fortunate I am that I had a formal guru=
 from whom I learnt the procedure of doing homam. PVRji made that understan=
ding a lot more deeper by discussing various aspects of Shrik and Shruvam s=
ometime ago. But I admire the enthusiasm of Shri Rajarshiji for diving into=
 homams just by observing a priest doing homams and the persistance of Shri=
 Utpal ji for keep on trying to do homams in some way or the other, being e=
ven in Middle East! But I would invite discussions on Chatushpatra and Shat=
patra prayogas of Bodhayana for a deeper understanding of the same. I know =
that Ganapathi, Gayatri homams are generally practised as Chatushpatra with=
 Shrik, Shruvam, Ajya Patra and Kalasa, but I am not sure about
 Shatpatra =
prayogas. All I know is Navagraha homa and Sudarshana homa are practised as=
 shatpatra prayoga. Is all this applicable to Bodhayana methods and Krishna=
 yajurvedam only? What are the practises as prescribed in other schools? Fo=
r instance, I recently watched a North Indian poojari do homam at our local=
 temple. He said he is doing havan as per the Rik Vedam procedure. To begin=
 with, instead of "Chatvari Shringastrayoh" he chanted "Agnenaya Supatha Ra=
aye Asmaan" which we recite at the end thanking Agnideva for co-operating. =
Also, he did not have the ending "Anvamamstha!" corresponding to "Anumanyas=
wa" mantras. Also, he did not do tarpana or bali or varshoddhara or even th=
e most important "meditation". Causes doubt to me if he knows any method of=
 homa at all! Also, Arya Samaj way of doing havans is another example. I wo=
uld like to know what people think of all these various methods. I am quite=
 convinced that the methods PVRji prescribed are very
 authentic but I just=
 include some of the procedures that my guru taught me along with those.

Namaste Atul Ji,

>Can we use this =
mantra to give ahutis
>also? if yes when can we do this during homam

Serio=
usly i do not know! actually i do not know the qualifying criteria for any =
Mantra/Stotra/shloka/Ardh-Shloka for using it in offering Aaahutis during H=
omam. No knowledge is some times beneficial in such cases;)

What i can thi=
nk at the moment is that you may think of using that Mantra at the begining=
 when you ask for permission of doing Homam and substitute "MAM SUPRABHATAM=
" with "MAM HOMAKARMA" 

Best Regards,

Utpal
