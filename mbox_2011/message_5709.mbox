Namaste,

Thanks for this email. Very valuable! It clarified few things whe=
n Shri Shani is perfectly stationary in space.

Krishna did not go to Ayodh=
ya to tell people that he is reincarnation of Rama.....That was quite convi=
ncing and logical. Even during his lifetime, very few knew (probably only 3=
 or 4 persons) about Krishna being a Vishnu's incarnate.

You keep saying t=
hat even highly evolved yogis can imagine things based on their own mental =
conditioning.

That statement reminded me of 2 specific verses of Durga Sap=
tashati.

Jnyaaninaamapi Chetaansi devi bhagavati hi saa|
Balaadaakrushya M=
ohaaya Mahaamaayaa prayachchhati||

Mohyante Mohitaashchaiva Mohameshyanti =
chaapare|
Tamupeihi Mahaaraaja Sharanama Parameshwari||

Namaschandikayei !=

Utpal
