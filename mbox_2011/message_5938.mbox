The Name of the Lord is a potent, unfailing antidote for those who are bitt=
en by the serpent of Samsara. It is the nectar that can confer immortality =
and perennial peace. Repeat the Name of the Lord always and attain the fear=
less state. You can repeat any divine Name you like. All names of the Lord =
are equally potent.

Sing the Lord=E2=80=99s glory. Worship the Lord with a=
ll your heart and with all your mind. Remember Him always. All your miserie=
s will come to an end. Your heart will be purified. The Lord will soon reve=
al Himself to you. You will truly feel His presence everywhere. Pray ferven=
tly to the Lord for the descent of His light and grace. Crave for His mercy=
. Yearn for communion with Him. Melt the mind in divine love. Burn the lowe=
r nature in the fire of devotion.

Man is not a helpless being. He has a fr=
ee will of his own. Self-effort ensures divine grace. Therefore, overcome a=
ll your unfavourable circumstances by right aspiration and application. Hav=
e courage. Be bold. Never despair. You will surely succeed. There is nothin=
g in this world which cannot be achieved by a man of determination, perseve=
rance and the right kind of effort.
