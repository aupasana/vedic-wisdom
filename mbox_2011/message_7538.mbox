      Namaste friends=
,



I have been meaning to write these words on the future of homam moveme=
nt 

for many months now, but it never happened until now.



*        *   =
     *



Homam movement is slowly gathering steam. There seem to be many 
=

thousands of people doing homam by themselves now (though not all of 

the=
m are members of this vedic-wisdom yahoogroup). Some of them are 

making g=
ood spiritual progress and undergoing transformation. Many of 

them are en=
joying the experience and feeling some peace and happiness. 

Several of th=
em are also enjoying some material benefits.



This movement may catch on =
even more with time and play an important 

role in the establishment of Sa=
natana dharma on earth over the next 

several decades.



*        *      =
  *



I encourage everyone interested in doing homam to try it and continu=
e if 

they like it. I also encourage everyone interested in spreading homa=
m to 

tell others about it and show the the free manuals, audio and video.=
 

There will be more free resources in future and these will be organized =


better.



But please never make this commercial or forceful. Never charg=
e money 

for teaching homam, as that would be a very bad idea. Also, never=
 try to 

sell it hard or put pressure. Tell people about it and let them d=
o it 

when (and if!) they are ready. Tell people about it passionately, bu=
t 

don't expect anything. Most importantly, don't be disappointed or 

dis=
heartened if some people told by you do not start homam.



Action is a *sa=
cred* duty and do not shy away from right and dharmik 

action (as judged b=
y your conscience). But results are not in your hands 

and hence do not be=
 disappointed if a seemingly perfect action did not 

give the intended res=
ult.



*        *        *



Lastly, some people have developed a special=
 attachment, love, respect 

and even fascination for Manish and me. I stro=
ngly recommend not doing 

that.



This movement will last a long time, bu=
t we'll be gone sooner or later. 

Moreover, we may or may not be what you =
imagine us to be. We may be 

normal people with weaknesses and troubled by=
 shadripus. In any case, it 

is irrelevant really. It is not about us, but=
 about Fire!



If someone sees me as a guru, I cannot stop that. But let m=
e make it 

very clear that I am not some powerful guru. I am a normal pers=
on who 

happens to be introducing a powerful guru (Fire!) that everybody c=
an 

approach and benefit from!



My message is not that Manish or I are s=
pecial, can confer blessings on 

you and solve your problems. My message i=
s that I can show you a way in 

which you yourself can solve your problems=
 IF you are ready to put in 

some effort. Let us recede into background an=
d let your attention, love, 

respect, devotion and fascination be directed=
 towards Fire instead of 

us.



Fire is the original guru and original pr=
iest. He can guide you, remove 

your weaknesses over time and take you to =
god. If there are mistakes in 

your method, he can also help in getting th=
em rectified in time. 

Surrender to Fire and request him to guide you and =
take you to god. He 

will not disappoint you.



Best regards,

Narasimha
