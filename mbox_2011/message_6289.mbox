This is a pretty old thread.
I was trying to look up for Narasimha Homam ma=
nual (Monday is Narasimha Jayanti)
Vijay shared a link below. But that down=
load link is no longer working.
I am wondering if anybody has a copy of thi=
s Narasimha Homam - I would really appreciate your help if you could provid=
e a downloadable link to it.

Thanks and Regards,
Srikanth
