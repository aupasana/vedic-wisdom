Subject: Questions about meditating on Kali Mantra - any conflict with Savitur Gayatri?

Dear Narasimhaji and others,

I used to meditatively listen to/chant the Sa=
vitur Gayatri every morning, and on the weekends, I did a homam also (doing=
 the Savitur Gayatri). Gayatri, especially in Homan seems to make things aw=
aken in me, even with a tinge of sexual desire, yet still making me more sp=
iritual. Separately, for the past few months, I have been having this heavy=
 weight of a depressive feeling (due to several events/situations in my lif=
e) which just hasnt left me, and even the Gayatri/Homam doesnt relieve exce=
pt immediately after a Homam for less than a day. After some reading around=
 and doing some astrology, I finally arrived at a Kali mantra - Om Kreem Ka=
likaye namah, and I have started meditating on that every morning, but I st=
ill do weekend homams with Savitur Gayatri. But things have changed now. Th=
e Kali mantra is very punishing in a mental tightness kind of way, yet stil=
l helps me deal with mental hardship without completely giving up/getting a=
ngry/stressed. So I have continued it. Yet the day I do Savitur Gayatri hom=
am, the Gayatri results seems a bit weaker - I have no idea why. Also, if I=
 dont meditate on the Kali mantra later on in the same day (i.e. if I try t=
o drop a day of doing Kali mantra), I get into conflicts much more easily. =
Is there some kind of conflict between the two? 



Regards,

Sundeep
