Dear friends, respected Narasimhaji, 

I have a query regarding whether oth=
er deities can be worshipped via shiva lingam. It came to my mind to worshi=
p surya, and wondering if i could do avaahana and offer oblations to surya =
via shiva lingam. 

Hope to get some insight on this. 

Thanks, 
Puneet
