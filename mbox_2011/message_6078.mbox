Dear Jitender,

I do not know if i've understood your question perfectly or=
 not, however i go ahead with my reply.

I suggest you to try following:
1)=
 Offer Full Dry coconut as Purnaahuti
2) Then Recite Varsordhara and pour s=
ufficient ghee (but not too much)to cover complete coconut and surrounding =
area.

The dry coconut will catch the fire within a minute and then it will=
 burn generating big fire. That fire will be quite sufficient to burn some =
unburnt coconut peices if any and other materials offered in the Kunda. 

Y=
ou will not need to then open your eyes or worry. everything will be burnt =
completely.

try it once and see if it happens.

Best Regards,

Utpal
