The Vedic Art of Leadership
A Video Presentation With
Sri Dharma Pravartaka=
 Acharya

Whether we refer to the unprecedented problems we are experiencin=
g in the economy, on the political scene, or in the rapid degeneration of c=
ultural, social and spiritual standards, we know that we are living in an e=
ra of tremendous global crisis. As Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya explains i=
n this timely and important video, the root cause of all these peripheral c=
rises can be directly attributed to a deep crisis in leadership. We are lac=
king able leaders. We are, today, lacking credible political, spiritual and=
 cultural leaders who are equipped to lead us out of the darkness and into =
the light. 

In this bold presentation, Sri Acharyaji explains to us the cu=
rrent crisis that we are facing, how our leadership has fallen far short in=
 their sacred duty toward their people, and what must be done to create a f=
uture leadership that will ensure the rebirth of spiritual civilization and=
 a more just world. If you are currently occupying a leadership position, i=
f you aspire to someday become a leader, or if you understand the importanc=
e of leadership during this time of global crisis, you must see this greatl=
y enlightening video today.
