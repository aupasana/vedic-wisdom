Namaste NagarajJi! If I may comment , from my own limited intellect and kno=
wledge- Sri Lalitha, Sri Chandika etc are limited concepts of the unlimited=
 divine. As the Devi says in the Chandi- 'Ekai vasi jagad yatra dvitiya ka =
mama paraa '. She Herself is beyond concepts and beyond the ability of our =
consciousness to comprehend 'jnananam chinmayatita'. They take our mind fro=
m the limited concept, to ultimately dissolve in the unlimited.

The concep=
t of the Ishta Devatha in bhakti and in the path as taught by my Gurus is t=
hat the Ishta devatha is the para devatha or the all pervading parabrahman =
for each practitioner. This is borne out by the various Atharva-Sheersham i=
n which the Devatha of the atharva sheersham is considered to be the all pe=
rvading para-brahman. If Lalitha is your Ishta devatha or upasana devatha, =
then every other devatha( and creation itself) by definition is Her emanati=
on and so it is for Chandi, Maha Ganapathy, Shiva, Surya, Narayana etc. 

I=
n the south there is an unwarranted fear of 'ugra devatha' and also there i=
s a historic influence of certain Shri-kula parampara. In the east, Kali-Ku=
la is more influential.. These are what I would personally consider desha-a=
chara or kula-achara. Having said this, there are lots of Kali, Durga,Bhadr=
akali temples in every southern state, so I feel that these acharas are of =
relatively recent origin. 

I hope this is at least a little bit useful..

=
Jaya Devi Durge.
