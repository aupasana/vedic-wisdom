 258 The self-surrender is truly made by him who always has the feeling,
=
=E2=80=98Let all things happen according to your will. In all respects, I a=
m bound
to you.=E2=80=99
That is, after self-surrender, he must resign hims=
elf to the divine will,
without any reservations.

259 He that has surrende=
red himself will be at peace, remembering that He
[God] is the bearer of th=
e world=E2=80=99s burden. The one that bears the burden
himself will be
rid=
iculous, like the figure on the temple-tower appearing to bear the tower
on=
 its own shoulders.

260 As one travelling in a carriage puts down his lugg=
age in the carriage
itself and completes his journey, so should he resign h=
is own [samsaric]
burden to God and complete his life in the world.

Those =
who take on themselves the task of reforming the world or of
alleviating th=
e sufferings of others are dealt with next.

261 The wise one should resign=
 to God his cares concerning the good of the
world, just as he resigns to H=
im his cares about his own body and family.

262 The ripe devotee must pass=
 his time, patiently enduring whatever happens
to him, whether pleasant or =
unpleasant or otherwise, without yielding to
sorrow or joy, with his heart =
absorbed in Him.

263 When the ego dies, having been swallowed by divine gr=
ace, the devotee=E2=80=99s
self-surrender becomes true and complete.

This =
has been said in the language of the intellect. But the actual truth of
thi=
s consummation transcends the intellect and is hence not easy to convey
in =
words. Indeed, the notion of self-surrender is absorbed from the
standpoint=
 of the absolute truth.

264 As would be the offering [to Ganesa] of a port=
ion, taken from an image
of Ganesa made of jaggery, so is the surrender of =
one=E2=80=99s self to God, since
there is no self apart from Him.

265 Sinc=
e the Self is the Supreme Being Himself, by whom, how and to whom is
the su=
rrender to be made? True self-surrender is only the extinction of the
ego, =
by which the sense of being different from Him arises.

266 =E2=80=98If you=
 desire to give yourself to God, then first seek out and know
your Self. Th=
e gift of oneself to God will be accomplished in this way.=E2=80=99 So
said=
 the most holy one.

The truth about namaskara (prostration) is the same as=
 self-surrender. This
is explained next.

267 The truth of namaskara also i=
s only the perfect giving up of the
ego-sense. Right awareness, self-surren=
der and namaskara, all these three
are one and the same.
Thus it is shown t=
hat God does not become an object of vision. Neither does
He become an obje=
ct of knowledge. This is shown next.

268 As God does not become an object =
of vision, neither does He become an
object of knowledge. Since He transcen=
ds the mind, the mind will know Him
[if at all] only wrongly.

269 Since th=
e real Self, which is consciousness, is the same as God, and
since there is=
 no consciousness apart from Him, [it follows that] there is
no one to know=
 Him, other than He, nor does He become an object of
knowledge.

The real S=
elf is the eternal subject, and hence He can never become an
object, says B=
hagavan.

270 The source of the light of consciousness that exists in the m=
ind is just
the real Self. Hence, apart from Him, there is no such thing as=
 mind
existing as something real.

271 Like the sun, the consciousness that=
 is the Self shines in the Heart by
its own light. By its light the mind =
=E2=80=93 which by itself is insentient =E2=80=93
appears as sentient, like=
 the moon.

272 Since [mind-] consciousness is not the true nature of the m=
ind, it goes
into latency in deep sleep. [But] the real Self never goes int=
o latency
since consciousness is its very nature.

But the mind has the pow=
er of veiling the Self.

273 The mind always veils [for itself] the real na=
ture of the Self, both in
dream and in waking. Becoming latent in deep slee=
p and wholly extinguished
in the supreme state, how can it ever know Him, w=
ho is the sole reality?

What then is =E2=80=98knowing God=E2=80=99?

274 T=
here is the pronouncement of the most holy one that the true knowing of
God=
 is simply the mind becoming one with Him in the natural state by seeking
t=
he source wherefrom it has come into being.

Thus the pair of God and the i=
ndividual soul is resolved. The conclusion is
as follows.

275 What one has=
 to do is obtain perfect poise in unity with the Supreme
Being, whether by =
devotion or by the quest of the real Self, with the clear
understanding tha=
t God and the soul are not distinct entities in reality.

The next pair to =
be discussed is that of knowledge and ignorance.

276 There is a two-fold i=
gnorance, named as knowledge and ignorance, which
is experienced by those n=
ot aware of the real Self. This pair is unreal just
like all else.

277 The=
 two are inseparable. Neither exists without the other, and because
both ar=
ise from ignorance of the Self, both are equally ignorance.

Worldly knowle=
dge and worldly ignorance are both ignorance for the reason
stated here. Th=
is is explained further.

278 Everyone, being ignorant of his own real Self=
, seeks to know what is
not-Self. The relative knowledge [acquired in this =
way] is an outcome of
this ignorance. Hence, says our Guru, it is only igno=
rance.

279 Whatever knowledge one acquires by the intellect and the senses=
, if it
is acquired without first knowing the truth of the one that arises,=
 saying
=E2=80=98I am the knower=E2=80=99, is all wrong knowledge.

280 He =
that does not know the Self might consider the world, which is
unreal, to b=
e real, and he will look upon his own real Self, which
transcends the world=
, as an individual soul contained in the world.

281 The intellect, the sen=
ses and the mind are only the servants of the
primary ignorance. Hence, the=
 worldly modes of =E2=80=98proof=E2=80=99 serve only to delude
the creature=
.

282 If the ego dies by the quest, =E2=80=98Whence arises the ego, the ex=
periencer of
the two, knowledge and ignorance?=E2=80=99 with it will be ext=
inguished this pair
[knowledge and ignorance].

283 Right awareness is only=
 dwelling in the natural state of the Self, after
the extinction of the ego=
. In that state, which is free from duality, these
two manifestations of ig=
norance, which belong to the worldly life, do not
survive.

284 The sages [=
Buddhas] call that the state of right awareness. In it there
is neither kno=
wledge nor ignorance. That is the highest state, in which
there is nothing,=
 whether sentient or insentient, other than the Self.

285 The illiterate, =
the literate and the =E2=80=98knower of the Self=E2=80=99 are all three
equ=
ally ignorant. The third one also is ignorant, because for him there is
not=
hing knowable other than the Self.

This was what Bhagavan said. The first =
two are ignorant because they do not
know the Self. The sage is ignorant fo=
r a different reason, which is here
stated. He also said:

286 That one who=
 has become established in his own natural state is adorable
by all, whethe=
r men or angels. As he is not distinct from the Supreme Being,
he is also f=
it to be adored [as God] by the seekers of deliverance.

A doubt raised by =
some disciples is next answered.

287 Not knowing that this worldly knowled=
ge is only ignorance, some ask:
=E2=80=98Let ignorance come to an end in th=
e supreme state, but why should knowledge
also cease?=E2=80=99

288 In the =
supreme state there is nothing to be known, neither a knower, nor
knowledge=
 [of objects]. Just as pairs are absent in that state, so the
triads also a=
re absent.

289 In the supreme state that Self shines alone, free from both=
 knowledge
and ignorance. Since it is there as pure consciousness, without =
change, how
can that state be a void?

That the state is not a void is ment=
ioned here because some believe that
there is no reality beyond the world.
=

290 There the Self shines by its own light of consciousness, as the sole
r=
eality, which is bliss. In that supreme state there is no reality to shed
l=
ight on it, nor anything =E2=80=98other=E2=80=99 that could shine by its li=
ght.

291 That consciousness light, which is its nature, neither rises nor =
sets,
but is ever the same [without change]. It is by borrowing a minute pa=
rticle
of its consciousness that the mind appears conscious.

292 Disciples=
 of non-sages, fearing that in the supreme state the Self will
cease to be,=
 wish to go to some other celestial world for the sake of
eternal happiness=
.

293 As this world is unreal, so the other worlds also are unreal. For th=
e
sage [who is in the supreme state] the Self is itself the world, and henc=
e
that world is real in its own right.

Hence, sages are free from all worl=
dly attractions.

294 =E2=80=98What do we need wealth or offspring for when=
 the Self is itself the
world?=E2=80=99 So thinking, the sages, whose desir=
es have all subsided, care not
for action, nor for inaction.

295 That Self=
, which is consciousness, is alone real. The consciousness that
has the wor=
ld-form is ignorance [not true knowledge]. Since the world does
not exist a=
part from that world-consciousness, it is unreal.

The question then arises=
, =E2=80=98Is this ignorance real?=E2=80=99 It is answered in the
following=
 way:
