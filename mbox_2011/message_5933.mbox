Namaste,

The views b=
elow are completely my mental notions and they must not be taken as any abs=
olute,expert or scriptural advice.
If i were to be the person in context wh=
at i would have done i am writing.

1.I would never disclose contents of su=
ch a dream openly.Though you have done here do not do it anymore.
2.Try to =
find out the temple and pujari.If you think it is Datia go to that place an=
d see how much your dream resembles physically.
3.Try to consult a sadhu ,s=
annyasins or a person of spiritual expertise that you know.Disclose the dre=
am to him only.
4.You can visit the nearest Ramakrishna Mission centre and =
consult with the sannyasins therein and see what they advise.

If the dream=
 is true, dont worry ,everything will fall in place.If God has graced you t=
his much the rest will also come.
Such spiritual experience always has some=
 meaning.Wheteher we know it know or we will know it in years to come.
But =
one day this event will surely reveal its meaning.
