Nowadays it is very hard even to talk of renunciation. It was said of me in=
 America that I was a man who came out of a land that had been dead and bur=
ied for five thousand years, and talked of renunciation. So says perhaps th=
e English philosopher. Yet it is true that that is the only path to religio=
n. Renounce and give up. What did Christ say? 'He that loseth his life for =
my sake shall find it.' Again and again did he preach renunciation as the o=
nly way to perfection.
