Dear Mr Narasimha

Thanks for the clarification.

One last question (for no=
w:-)) If, for some reason (mostly due to time pressure), I can't do the hom=
am in the morning, may I do it in the evening?

I never blow off a burning =
lamp. I find it most inauspicious. After the homam, I simply move it to my =
altar. If the lamp goes off on its own, may I use any remaining ghee for th=
e homam the next day?

Regards
Ranga
