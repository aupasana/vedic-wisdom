Hi, 
=C2=A0
Now I can clarify better. I am posting some letters in devanaga=
ri font, so that the expression will be clear. 
=C2=A0
What I said "S" in p=
revious mail is the letter to represent the middle sound like in Siva. Like=
 this. 
=C2=A0
=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5
=C2=A0
Itrans however uses 'sh' =
to get the above letter. so, you may go ahead and write shiva, for consiste=
ncy with Itrans. I used to use other fonts like 'pothana', 'tikkana' where =
'S' stands for the above sound (in telugu script) and 
=C2=A0
Itrans uses S=
h (note the upper case 'S' along with h to get the harder sha sound like sh=
own below. 
=C2=A0
=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=A3=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=96
=
=C2=A0
Having said that, sarma should be Sarma in pothana font, sharma in I=
trans, in my understanding. 
=C2=A0
Also, north indians not only write=C2=
=A0Shiva but pronounce it like =E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5=C2=A0and =E0=A4=
=B7=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80 
Also the way they pronounce it, it=
 should be written as =E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=
=80. But they write it as =E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5 and =E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=
=BF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BF, which is the correct way of writing, which =
is a good practise and we know what they mean! 
=C2=A0
Just to re-iterate,=
=C2=A0's' is for softer=C2=A0sound of=C2=A0S, like =E0=A4=B8 for=C2=A0words=
 like =C2=A0=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B8 (rasa and not ras :) )
'sh' or upper case 'S=
' for the middle sound of S, like =E0=A4=B6 for words like=C2=A0 =E0=A4=B6=
=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5=C2=A0
'Sh'=C2=A0for the harder sound of 'S' like =C2=A0=
=E0=A4=B7 for words like =E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=A3=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A5=81=E0=
=A4=96
=C2=A0
Hope this clarifies. 
=C2=A0

Namaste Utpal-ji and Nagaraj garu,



=C2=A0i had this confu=
sion from the day i got to know how to write my name in english, it is writ=
ten correctly in telugu/hindi but the whole confusion arises the moment i w=
rite that in english, it is written as sarma in english but pronounced as s=
harma in telugu and hindi, because it is written as sarma in English some t=
end to pronounce that as sarma instead of sharma.... (exact confusion as of=
 siva and shiva).
=C2=A0i explain my non-patient friends that a "h" is drop=
ped after "s" in telugu to conserve energy while writing but it should be p=
ronounced as sharma , but to any serious and patient listeners i explain it=
 as below (please note all this is just my =C2=A0opinion) --


=C2=A0The th=
ree "shSh's" are classified as below according to the place they originate =
(in vaikhari of course) - =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 
=C2=A0 Palatal/taalavya (origin=
ated when middle part of tounge is raised against the middle part of roof o=
f mouth while pronouncing an s) - written in ITRANS as::sh examples::shiva/=
sharma/session - there is no real english equivalent letter for this 
=C2=
=A0 Cerebral/muurdhanya (originated when tip of the tounge tries to contact=
 the roof of the mouth while pronouncing s) - written in ITRANS as ::Sh, sh=
h, Z, S=C2=A0 examples::riShi/Shall/Ship =E2=80=93 equivalent to sh in engl=
ish=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0

=A0 Dental/dantya (originated when tip of the tounge tries to contact/conta=
cts the upper teeth as exactly in s) - written in ITRANS as::s examples::sa=
rasvathi/sindhu/same=C2=A0 - equivalent to s in english


=C2=A0 Since ther=
e is no exact equivalent of palatal sh in english some people (especially f=
rom south) write the palatal sh as s in English (like siva) and most (from =
north) use sh (like shiva), either the case shiva/siva is written correctly=
 in respective languages with a palatal sh, IMO both are correct as long as=
 one does not alter pronunciation (but that alteration can happen due cours=
e of time when we forget the basics of grammar, and/or forget the basics pr=
onunciation from our mother languages if an Indian, and also because of nat=
ural language corruptions =E2=80=93 some parts of AP pronounce shiva as siv=
a which is not correct according to me)... 


=C2=A0 Please refer to CHART-=
LINE V in http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/52/4V/524V0401.htm, the s=
econd column is dental s, the third one is palatal sh, and the fourth one i=
s cerebral Sh/shh).

Namaste Nagaraj Ji,
Thank you fo=
r giving your views and i understand that there is no State wise bias in yo=
u and same is with me. I absolutely dislike about those divide and on this =
backdrop i am giving my views.
***
My views are based on Devanagari script =
in which we find Sanskrit language written.
***
First let me take GANAPATI.=
=C2=A0I agree to your views.
In Sanskrit language which is always found wit=
ten in Devanagari script, Ta & Tha are different consonants and obviously t=
heir pronunciation is different. and as Ganapati is always=C2=A0*found* wri=
tten as "GanapaTI"=C2=A0and NOT "GanapaTHI", The pronunciation of=C2=A0 "TI=
" is correct one which is same as it comes in "MaTI" or "BhranTI" or "SaTI"=
 etc... to pronounce as "Thi"=C2=A0in Ganapati is definately=C2=A0Incorrect=
.
***
[>>>In my observation, most North Indians, replace "S" with "sh" and =
write Lord Siva as Lord Shiva and also=C3=82=C2=A0refer to him as "Shivji".=
<<<]
Good that you=C2=A0came out with this point. that was also my one of t=
he pending point w.r.t ponunciation.
Here i disgree. In My opinion, "SHiva"=
 is=C2=A0correct Pronunciation where as "Siva" is incorrect one.
i just fin=
ished reading Durga SaptaShati. Take "SaptaShloki Durga".=C2=A0 It Starts w=
ith "SHIV uvaach". It does not mention "SIVA uvaach".=C2=A0 in the same 7 v=
erses, we have "...SHUbham dadaSI". now it is vey clear that SH in Shubham =
AND SI in dadasi are diffeent consonants and should have diffent sound assi=
gned. so for correct reading, SHUbham should be pronounced as SHu as in SHo=
bha and dadaSI should be pronounced as Si as in ManaSi, VaranaSi etc...
Tak=
e one more example. "SHive Sarvartha Sadhike..." Consonant in SHive and Sar=
varth are different. hence SHive is correct in the first word and it is inc=
orrect to pronounce it as SIve.
***
Please think over the above and give me=
 your views.
Best Regards,
Utpal

 the letter 'ta', in Ganapati, it should be the softer "ta", like "lata", "=

 I have noticed that most of the tamilians have the habit of writing it as =
"Ganapathi" leaving one wonder if it is the word like "katha". Their argume=

 It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a consonant cannot e=
xist by itself and its life is given by the Vowel. But for whatever reason =
in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry that habit to other la=
nguages as well and recently I heard one of the North Indian bhajan singers=
 (I don't know the name) singing Adi Sankara's Bhaja Govindam as "Bhaj govi=
ndam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE", which sounded quite odd to=
 me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj Bhasha and Avadhi a=
s well. For instance, for them "Ramacharita Manasa" is more important than =
even Valmiki's Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also without proper vowe=
l endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that approach is incorrec=
t. In avadhi, a chowpai like "Sri Gurucharana

ld be pronounced exactly like that and not like "Sri Gurucharan saroj raj".=
 You may shed more light on this aspect as well.

 However, pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation =
is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can=

"tha" (as in "kathaa" =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as "dha=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Now I =
can clarify better. I am posting some letters in devanagari font, so that t=
he expression will be clear. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>What I said "S" =
in previous mail is the letter to represent the middle sound like in Siva. =
Like this. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5</DIV>
=
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Itrans however uses 'sh' to get the above letter. so=
, you may go ahead and write shiva, for consistency with Itrans. I used to =
use other fonts like 'pothana', 'tikkana' where 'S' stands for the above so=
und (in telugu script) and </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Itrans uses Sh (no=
te the upper case 'S' along with h to get the harder sha sound like shown b=
elow. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=A3=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=
=A5=81=E0=A4=96</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Having said that, sarma should=
 be Sarma in pothana font, sharma in Itrans, in my understanding. </DIV>
<D=
IV> </DIV>
<DIV>Also, north indians not only write Shiva but pron=
ounce it like =E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5 and =E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=
=B5=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80 </DIV>
<DIV>Also the way they pronounce it, it should=
 be written as =E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80. But =
they write it as =E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5 and =E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=
=B5=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BF, which is the correct way of writing, which is a good=
 practise and we know what they mean! </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Just to=
 re-iterate, 's' is for softer sound of S, like =E0=A4=B8 fo=
r words like  =E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B8 (rasa and not ras :) )</DIV>
<DI=
V>'sh' or upper case 'S' for the middle sound of S, like =E0=A4=B6 for word=
s like  =E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B5 </DIV>
<DIV>'Sh' for the=
 harder sound of 'S' like  =E0=A4=B7 for words like =E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=A3=
=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=96</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>

the "t" sound at the end of the words like "prachodayaat", "ava purastaat",=
 "sahasrapaat" etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrec=

 "prachodayaat",
 the sound "yaat" as one letter/syllable/akshara. If you c=
hange it into "yaattu" or "yaatu" by adding a vowel sound at the end, it be=
comes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the chha=

ife force) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel afte=

 "t" has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara "ya=

 Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols for the same =

 "t" (as in=
