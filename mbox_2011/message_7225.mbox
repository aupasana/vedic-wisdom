namaste,

There are many different "correct" ways of chanting mantras. Each veda has
it's very own "pronunciation guide", and even among adherents of a given
style, the actual pronunciation varies regionally. Some people, out of an
abundance of faith, believe that all of these methods are perfect and defect
free. However, some others, who have some Sanskrit background, take a step
back and confidently say that "none of these methods are perfect". For the
most part, the "truth" lies somewhere in the middle, where all the various
styles intersect.

The page referenced below prescribes the "Tamil Nadu" style as the correct
one, and over-emphasizes some aspects of that style. I disagree with it in a
few places:

(a) The author keeps trying to "emphasize" some letters (long vowels,
accents, conjunct letters), which is the wrong approach. One should try to
pronounce ALL letters clearly, rather than trying to "emphasize" some
letters over another.

(b) I have to disagree with almost the entirety of the section on "visarga
pronounciation". Visarga can never become "fa". There is no such sound in
Sanskrit.

(c) There is a tendency to have "two levels" of anudAtta when there is a
sequence of them. The chanters try to emphasize the last one by lowering it
even more. Actually the problem here is not with the "last letter", but with
all the letters that precede it ! Since they are usually pronounced badly,
people try to over-emphasize the last one. Rather than over-emphasizing this
letter, we should strive to pronounce all previous accents correctly.

The best thing to do is to try and listen to "vedic chanting experts" from a
variety of places in India. Especially for people from South India, it is
really worth paying close attention to the pronunciation of experts from
Maharashtra.

sasneham,

   ajit
