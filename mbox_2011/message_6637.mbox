There are innumerable sannyasins at present belonging to one or the other o=
f the four centers established by the four disciples of Shankara=E2=80"at S=
ringeri, Dwaraka, Badrinath and Jagannath Puri. They are called Dasanami sa=
nnyasins, i.e., sannyasins with ten names. The credit of vigorous insistenc=
e on the necessity for sannyasa goes solely to the adorable advaitic sannya=
sin, the glorious Shankara!

Glory, glory to the Sages, the gurus, the sann=
yasins, who have opened our eyes from sleep, who have widened our hearts, b=
rightened our intellects and immersed us in Supreme knowledge!
