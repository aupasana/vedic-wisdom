Namaste all,

I've heard that it is considered not good to eat (and even dr=
ink?) on the day of the eclipse (or during eclipse itself?). What is the re=
ason behind this? And what are the detailed prescriptions what to do and wh=
at not to do?

Also I was told that merit earned through any spiritual prac=
tice done on this day is 1000 times more compared to that on an ordinary da=
y. Is it true??

In Vedic_Wisdom_1.pdf much revered Narasimhaji shares him =
doing some practice on Akshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya) day which=
 has the same effect of multiplying by 1000 (page 99). Can we know the list=
 of such days?

Thank you in advance,
Maneesha
