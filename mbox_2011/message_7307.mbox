Translation -  Both the pitru =
devataas who are here and who are not
here, both those whom we know and who=
m we do notyou know all of them O,
jaatavedaas, accept the offerings well p=
repared with this
sacrifice/yaGYa.##
Interpretation -  This rik is in conti=
nuation of earlier and explains
why we are invoking agni and asking agni to=
 bear the oblations and carry
them to pitru devataas, it expands upon the e=
arlier rik and emphasises
on an important point of agni that agni knows all=
 of them who need to
obtain our sacrifices.  aaprii hymns of rig veda menti=
on about twelve
deities that are different personified forms of agni - like=

samidhaH[wood], idmaH[fuel], barhi[dharbha/kusha], tvaShTaa[creator],
tanu=
unapaat[self generated] etc... since agni himself is a personified
form of =
creator(tvaShTaa) he knows about all that was/is/has to be
created and also=
 since agni himself is the offering[idmaH/samidhaH]
knows where to carry th=
e oblations as well. we show our respects to agni
and request agni to carry=
 the oblations to pitru devataas who have come
here to the sacrificial site=
, and also to the ones who are not present
here because of our improper inv=
ocations or because we might have
forgotten them in invocations as well we =
do not know most of them. Also
we are stating that the offerings have been =
sukRRitaM[well prepared],
they are well prepared as per the prescribed rule=
s and also can mean
pious/auspicious being prepared with a desire for dharm=
ic needs [shaM
yoH arapaH dadhaata - 10.015.04]. sukRRita also mean decease=
d fathers
who are in higher realms because of their virtuous deeds, so anot=
her
interpretation can be that we are requesting agni to juShasva[accept]
a=
nd carry the svadhaabhiH[oblations] of this yaGYa[sacrifice] which have
bee=
n prepared well(sukRRitaM)/for pitru devataas(sukRRitaM) to them.
