Sannyasa is necessary for attaining self-realization. Even in the prelimina=
ry stage one should join the ascetic order, as this voluntary renunciation =
while yet a neophyte will qualify the aspirant for Vedantic study.
The srut=
i says: =E2=80=9COne should leave the house the very day dispassion dawns i=
n him.=E2=80=9D
The sannyasi is free from all kinds of worldly distractions=
, ties and attachments The garb puts a check on the aspirant from going ast=
ray or doing evil actions. When there is internal change, when one is ready=
 for entering the fourth ashrama of life, why should he be afraid of puttin=
g on the orange-colored robe? Why should he say, =E2=80=9CI have given colo=
ring to my heart?=E2=80=9D It is a sort of timidity and hypocrisy. Vasanas =
(subtle desires) still lurk in his heart.
