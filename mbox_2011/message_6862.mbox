Namaste, 

Good that you want to do homam, even i am a student in USA

1. I=
 used to do homam quite regularly as in my earlier apartment i could safely=
 take out batteries of fire alarm. 

2. Smoke is very minimal to almost zer=
o. the right amount of ghee keep it to zero. at the end when fire dies out =
it does produce smoke. i used to keep the kund outside in the garden. you c=
an certainly keep it near window when done.

3. Right now i am in new apart=
 and here if i take batteries out then the doorman comes straightaway so i =
cant do homam in new apartment. So instead of that i chant the strotras for=
 1hr in morning and a mantra for 30min in night. Keep your sadhana regular.=
 

4. You can buy kund on Indousplaza.com there are 3 sizes order the middl=
e one. They have all the stuff.

5. Start with ganapati homam only for firs=
t 2-3 months.

regard
priyank
