Dear Rajarshi,

I understood which coconut you meant. actually i once offer=
ed Coconut as purnahuti during my last visit to India where in My native pl=
ace, i had performed a chandi homam with lot of woods. I prepared Kunda wit=
h bricks and cow-dung.

I remember that it took a lot of time to completely=
 burn the Coconut which we offered as Purnahuti. I appreciate your patience=
 and passion for Homam and burning Coconut every day. Its a lot of work. It=
 was actually foolish on my part to ask my orginal query :)

Sometime as al=
ternative, i offer Whole Dry Coconut whenever it is available.

Warm Regard=
s,

Utpal
