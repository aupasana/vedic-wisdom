Namaste Srinivas ji,

y, if I were to >try something of that sort. Needless to say, my neighbors =
will call >9-1-1 in no-time :)

The above lighter quote is actually a pract=
ical worry which many aspirants harbour and rightly so. I am inspired to wr=
ite my story in this regard. Hoping that it can inspire somebody on the lis=
t and removes mainly the fear factor.

***
about 2.5 years back, Narasimha =
wrote to me this: "Do whatever compromises, but 20 minutues Homam every day=
 is a must. find out ways to do that". I remember different fears i was hav=
ing in my mind. I was then staying as a paying guest with a family. though =
i had a separte room, i was not sure if they would allow me to do something=
 related to fire. that was the main worry. then there was self doubt concer=
ning my ability to perform Homam but I decided to perform and did the first=
 Homam which was Maha Ganapati homam on 1st day of Ashwin Navaraatri. I rem=
ember that i took me around 2.5 hours total including all the preparation a=
fter that rest of the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homams. each Chandi homam =
took around 4 hours. I remember that on the Ashtami day, some of My colleag=
ues with family came to see my chandi Homam and they told me that the smoke=
 was even visible in the ground floor (The Apartment i was staying was on 4=
th) and there were nice smell every where. The interesting thing is that Ol=
d lady of the family actually co-operated with me. she used to help me in c=
utting Dray coconut in to small peices with knife. I cut my finger on sever=
al occasions while cutting coconuts for chandi homam. I used to offer the b=
lood stained coconut peices in Chandi Homas.

My all previous fears thus pr=
oved absolutely Non-existent. From the very first Homam, It was a smooth ri=
de. I was exahusted after Navaratri and could not continue and there was a =
break of a week or so. Then again i started daily Maha Ganapti Homam while =
learnt the technic of breaking Dry coconut halves by crushing it with both =
palms.

After few months, I had to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tr=
ied to search for it. few families rejected when i put the condition of doi=
ng Homam everyday. at last One christian family agreed for that. I paid big=
ger amount but they allowed me to do homam and i continued there for around=
 3 months. during that time i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path eve=
ryday for 1 year.

after 3 months, i started searching for my own separate =
Rental Apartment because my family was joining me. Again the same concern (=
Prime) is to search for Apartment where there is no obstacle to do Homam. I=
 got a brand new apartment. I observed the flat and finalised the dealing. =
continued Homam every day for 1 year. The whole flat became black. even the=
 Home applicances liem refrigerator etc.. were covered with black dust of H=
oma smoke. clothes in the wardrobe, Openings of Central A/c etc... were all=
 filled with black dust. My whole brand new apartment became dark due to th=
e Homam. Smoke particles travelled to my lungs and throat and i started cou=
ghing badly. I suffered with severe Cough for many months and there was pre=
ssure from near ones to stop Homam or atleast perform it once every week. B=
ut there was lot of determination provided by *some power* which i like to =
call as "Mother".

After 1 year in that Apartment, i started serching diffe=
rent place. I searched whole area and was looking for a apartment which als=
o has Balcony so that My homam goes smoothly without nmaking my whole aprtm=
ent look black and there are no more complaints from my wife .
I could not =
get one such perfect place which gives me a Blacony and at the same time th=
ere are no buidlings in front which can observe me doing homam in balcony a=
nd make a instant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was very=
 comfirtable and required option so that i can do it there and smoke handli=
ng becomes very easy but at the same time it is also that much risky becaus=
e any road-side person can complain seeing smoke comming out.
Finally i got=
 one aprtment without balcony but with a special location. When i vacated t=
he previous apartment, the owner'e representative was shell-shocked looking=
 at the condition of the apartment :) He told me over Phone - "Aaap Kya kar=
ata tha flat me?". He then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the compen=
sation. I happily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal instaed of=
 going to police station.

In new Apartment (current one), security is very=
 tight. But I decided to make an arrangement so that i do not *spoil* condi=
tion of the  Apartment. hence i came out with the Idea of Chimney. (Please =
see the more pictures in photo section) and started doing Homam. Though the=
 chimney is visible to neighbours and other flat owners, no body has compla=
ined till now. neither to police nor to security personnel. Only once Secur=
ity person cautiuoned me. I stopped for a few days and started as usual. It=
 is going on till today. I do not know about tomorrow but i do not worry. b=
ecuase after 2.5 years of experience, it is more than clear to me that It i=
s not I who is arranging all these but there is Mother behind all these. SH=
E is making my road clear so that i can perform Homam as i wish.

***
The m=
oral of the story is that if you genuinely desire to perform Homam/Havan, t=
hen It will be done. No obstacle will stand on your way.
Do not fear. All t=
he fears will break like Papads once you start walking over them to do homa=
m. i can swear for it!

No owner will kick you out, No neighbour will call =
9-1-1 and even if that happens, there will open a way!

Best Regards,
