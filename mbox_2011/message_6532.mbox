 You are thinking "Let us first of all have yearning,  faith and devotion;t=
hen  we  shall do  our Sadhana(spiritual practices)."       Is that possibl=
e? Can we see the day  without the break of dawn? 
When the  Lord comes,  l=
ove,  devotion  and faith follow Him as His retinue.
 Can anything be achie=
ved without Tapasya? Brahma at  first  heard 
"Tapas  (meditate), Tapas(med=
itate), Tapas(meditate)." Do you not see 
what a  severe Tapasya even the A=
vataras(Incarnations  of God) had to  perform? Has anybody gained anything =
without labour? Buddha,Sankara  and  others-what  tremendous austerities th=
ey practised in  their  lives!What burning renunciation they posessed! What=
 severe Sadhana 
they performed!
