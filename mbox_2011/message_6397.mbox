III. THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE FIVE SHEATHS

3. The body which is produce=
d from the seed and blood of the parents, which
are in turn formed out of t=
he food eaten by them, grows by food only. It is
not the Self, for it does =
not exist either before birth or after death.

5. The vital airs which perv=
ade the body and give power and motion to the
eyes and
other senses constit=
ute the vital sheath. It is not the Self because it is
devoid of
consciousn=
ess.

6. That which gives rise to the ideas of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =E2=
=80=98mine=E2=80=99 with regard to one=E2=80=99s
body,house and so forth, i=
s the mind sheath. It is not the Self because it
has desires and is moved b=
y pleasure and pain, is subject to delusion and is
fickle.

7. The intellec=
t which has the reflection of pure consciousness, and which
pervades the wh=
ole body up to the tips of the fingers in the waking state
but disappears i=
n deep sleep, is known as the intellect sheath. It also is
not the Self bec=
ause it too is changeable.

8. The inner organ functions as the agent and a=
lso the instrument. Hence
though
one, it is treated as two, viz., the intel=
lect sheath and the mind sheath.
Their fields of operation are the inner wo=
rld and the outer world
respectively.

9. There is a position or function (=
of the intellect) which, at the time of
enjoying the fruits of good actions=
, goes a little farther inward and
catches the reflection of the bliss and =
at the end of this enjoyment, merges
in deep sleep. (This is what is known =
as the sheath of bliss).

10. This bliss sheath also cannot be the Self bec=
ause it is temporal and
impermanent. That bliss which is the source of this=
 reflection is the Self;
for it is
eternal and immutable.

11. (Objection):=
 By granting that the sheaths beginning with that of food
(body) and
ending=
 in that of bliss (joy or sleep) are not the Self, yet (when they are
negat=
ed),
no further object remains to be experienced.

12. (Reply): True, bliss=
 sheath etc., are experienced and not anything else.
Yet who
can deny that =
by which these are experienced ?

13. As the Self is Itself of the nature o=
f experience only. It cannot be an
object of experience. Since there is no =
experiencer nor any experience other
than It, the Self is unknowable =E2=80=
=93 not because It does not exist but because
It cannot be an object of exp=
erience.

IV. THE DIFFERENTIATION OF DUALITY

2. The Svetasvatara Upanishad=
 says: =E2=80=98Know Maya as Prakriti and Brahman
associated with Maya as t=
he great Ishvara=E2=80=99 (who imparts existence and
consciousness to it an=
d guides it). It is He who creates the world.

3. The Aitareya Upanishad sa=
ys that before creation there was Atman only,
and He thought, =E2=80=98Let =
me create the world=E2=80=99, and then He created the world by
His will (to=
 create).

4. The Taittiriya Upanishad says that from the Self or Brahman a=
lone arose
in succession the whole creation including Akasa, (ether), air, =
fire, water,
earth,vegetation, food and bodies.

5. The Taittiriya Upanisha=
d says that desiring =E2=80=98I shall be many, so I shall
create=E2=80=99, =
the Lord meditated; and thus created the world.

20. Objects created by Ish=
vara (e.g., gems) do not alter; they remain the
same. But
gems may affect d=
ifferent people differently according to their mental
states.

21. One man =
may feel happy on obtaining a gem, whereas another may feel
disappointed at=
 failing to obtain it. And a man uninterested in it, may only
look on and f=
eel neither happy nor disappointed.

22. The Jiva creates these three feeli=
ngs of happiness, disappointment or
indifference with regard to the gem, bu=
t the nature of the gem as created by
Ishvara
remains the same throughout.
=

23. Through personal relationships, one and the same woman appears
differe=
ntly as
a wife, a daughter-in-law, a sister-in-law, a cousin and a mother; =
but she
herself
remains unchanged.

24. (Objection): These different relati=
onships may be seen, but no changes
in the
woman=E2=80=99s appearance are s=
een to result from other people=E2=80=99s ideas about her.

25. (Reply): No=
t so. The woman has a subtle body as well as a physical body
composed of fl=
esh etc. Although other people=E2=80=99s ideas about her may not
affect her=

physical body, yet they can change her mental state.

27. (Reply): True, A=
charya Shankara, Sureshvara and others acknowledge the
fact that the mind a=
ssumes the form of the external object with which it
comes into contact and=
 modifies that form to suit its purposes.

29. Or just as sunlight assumes =
the forms of the objects which it illumines,
so the
mind assumes the forms =
of the objects which it perceives.

33. In dream, when external (material) =
objects are absent, man is bound by
the intellect to pleasure and pain, alt=
hough outer objects are not
perceived. In deep sleep, in a faint and in the=
 lower Samadhi (when the
mental functions are temporarily suspended), no pl=
easure or pain is felt
inspite of the proximity of outer objects.

34. A li=
ar told a man whose son had gone to a far-off country that the boy
was dead=
,although he was still alive. The father believed him and was
aggrieved.

3=
5. If, on the other hand, his son had really died abroad but no news had
re=
ached
him, he would have felt no grief. This shows that the real cause of a=
 man=E2=80=99s
bondage
is his own mental world.

38. (Objection): If the mi=
nd causes bondage by giving rise to the phenomenal
world,
the world could b=
e made to disappear by controlling the mind. So only Yoga
needs to
be pract=
ised; what is the necessity of knowledge of Brahman ?

39. (Reply): Though =
by controlling the mind duality can be made to disappear
temporarily the co=
mplete and final destruction of the mental creation is not
possible
without=
 a direct knowledge of Brahman. This is proclaimed by the Vedanta.

45. =E2=
=80=98An intelligent person, who has studied the scriptures and has
repeate=
dly
practised what they enjoin should renounce them after knowing the supre=
me
Brahman, just as a man throws aside a flaming torch at the end of his
jo=
urney=E2=80=99.
[Amritanada Upanishad]

46. =E2=80=98An intelligent person,=
 who has studied the scriptures and has practised
what
they enjoin should d=
iscard them after experiencing Brahman as his Self, just
as a
man discards =
the husk when he has found the grain=E2=80=99. [Amrita-Bindu Upanishad]

47=
. =E2=80=98A wise man, having experienced Brahman as his Self, should keep =
his
higher intuitive faculty (prajna) united with Brahman. He should not op=
press
his mind with many words, for they are a mere waste of energy=E2=80=
=99.
[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]

48. It has been clearly told in the Shruti=
: =E2=80=98Know that One and give up other
talks=E2=80=99 [Mundaka Upanisha=
d] and =E2=80=98A wise man should restrain his speech and
keep it within th=
e mind=E2=80=99. [Katha Upanishad]

52. You may say: Let there be no libera=
tion in life; I am satisfied if there
is no birth anymore. We reply: Then (=
if the desires remain), you will have
births also. So be satisfied with hea=
ven only.

53. If you say that the pleasures of heaven are defective, havin=
g waning and
gradation, and so are to be renounced, then why don=E2=80=99t =
you give up this
source of all
evils, the passions ?

55. Sri Sureshvara sa=
ys that one who pretends to be a knower of Brahman and
yet lives without mo=
ral restraint is like a dog that eats unclean
things.[Naiskarmyasiddhi-IV-6=
2]

66. If sometimes owing to actions performed in previous births the mind=
 of a
reflective man is distracted by desire, then it may be brought back t=
o a
peaceful
state by the constant practice of spiritual meditations.

V. F=
IXING THE MEANING OF THE GREAT SAYINGS

2. The one consciousness which is i=
n Brahma, Indra and other gods, as well
as in
human beings, horses, cows, e=
tc., is Brahman. So the consciousness in me
also is
Brahman.

VI. THE LAMP =
OF THE PICTURE

7. On consciousness are superimposed various forms. In each=
 of them there is
a reflection, i.e., a special function of consciousness. =
They are known as
the Jivas and are subject to the process of birth and dea=
th.

12. Therefore one should always enquire into the nature of the world, =
the
individual Self and the supreme Self. When the ideas of Jiva and Jagat
=
(world) are negated, the pure Atman alone remains.

13. By negation it does=
 not mean that the world and Jiva cease to be
perceptible to
the senses, it=
 means the conviction of their illusory character. Otherwise
people
would b=
e automatically liberated in deep sleep or in a faint.

14. =E2=80=98The su=
preme Self alone remains=E2=80=99 also means a conviction about Its
reality=
 and
not non-perceiving of the world. Otherwise there would be no such thin=
g as
liberation
in life.

69. The Buddhists believe that the Atman consists=
 of the momentary states of
the intellect, because the intellect, endowed w=
ith the faculty of
understanding, is the basis of the mind and through it t=
he mind grasps
matter.

70. The internal organ (Antahkarana) has two kinds =
of vrittis, viz., the
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-
consciousness, and =E2=80=98this=
=E2=80=99 consciousness. The first constitutes the
intellect, the
subject-c=
onsciousness and the second the mind, the object-consciousness.

75. Quotin=
g the Shruti, =E2=80=98In the beginning all this was non-existent (Asat)=E2=
=80=99,
the Buddhists say that perception and the objects of perception are=
 the
creations of illusion.

76. The Vedantins refute them by saying that t=
here can be no illusion
without a
substratum which is not an illusion. The =
existence of the Atman must be
admitted.
Even the void has a witness; if no=
t, it would be impossible to say, =E2=80=98There
is a void=E2=80=99.

94. T=
he first of the sheaths, the bliss-sheath which persists in the state
of de=
ep sleep and which does not manifest consciousness fully, is taken as
Atman=
 by the followers of Prabhakara and some logicians. What they state to
be t=
he nature of the Self, is in fact, characteristic of the bliss-sheath.

95.=
 The followers of Bhatta hold that consciousness is hidden in Atman and
tha=
t its
nature is both consciousness and unconsciousness. This is inferred fr=
om the
fact of
the remembrance of sound sleep by the awakened man.

96. =E2=
=80=98I became unconscious and slept=E2=80=99, such feeling expresses the m=
emory of
that inert state which he actually experienced. But this remembran=
ce of
unconsciousness in deep sleep would not be possible unless there were=
 at the
same time a conscious element.

<br>13. By negation it does not mean that the world and Jiva cease to be pe=
rceptible to<br>the senses, it means the conviction of their illusory chara=
cter. Otherwise people<br>would be automatically liberated in deep sleep or=
 in a faint.</span><br>

<br>14. =E2=80=98The supreme Self alone remains=E2=
=80=99 also means a conviction about Its reality and<br>not non-perceiving =
of the world. Otherwise there would be no such thing as liberation<br>in li=
fe.<br><br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">69. The Buddhists believe that =
the Atman consists of the momentary states of the intellect, because the in=
tellect, endowed with the faculty of understanding, is the basis of the min=
d and through it the mind grasps matter.<br>

<br>70. The internal organ (A=
ntahkarana) has two kinds of vrittis, viz., the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-<br>con=
sciousness, and =E2=80=98this=E2=80=99 consciousness. The first constitutes=
 the intellect, the<br>subject-consciousness and the second the mind, the o=
bject-consciousness.</span><br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:bold">75. Q=
uoting the Shruti, =E2=80=98In the beginning all this was non-existent (Asa=
t)=E2=80=99, the Buddhists say that perception and the objects of perceptio=
n are the creations of illusion.<br><br>76. The Vedantins refute them by sa=
ying that there can be no illusion without a<br>

substratum which is not a=
n illusion. The existence of the Atman must be admitted.<br>Even the void h=
as a witness; if not, it would be impossible to say, =E2=80=98There is a vo=
id=E2=80=99.</span><br><br>94. The first of the sheaths, the bliss-sheath w=
hich persists in the state of deep sleep and which does not manifest consci=
ousness fully, is taken as Atman by the followers of Prabhakara and some lo=
gicians. What they state to be the nature of the Self, is in fact, characte=
ristic of the bliss-sheath.<br>

<br>95. The followers of Bhatta hold that =
consciousness is hidden in Atman and that its<br>nature is both consciousne=
ss and unconsciousness. This is inferred from the fact of<br>the remembranc=
e of sound sleep by the awakened man.<br>

<br><span style=3D"font-weight:b=
old">96. =E2=80=98I became unconscious and slept=E2=80=99, such feeling exp=
resses the memory of that inert state which he actually experienced. But th=
is remembrance of unconsciousness in deep sleep would not be possible unles=
s there were at the same time a conscious element.</span><br>
