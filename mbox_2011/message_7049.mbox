Namaste,

Since these discussions centered a lot on Swami Vivekananda and s=
iddhis...here is what he had to say about them.

" All powers and all  puri=
ty and all greatness =E2=80=94 everything is in the 
soul. The Yogi would t=
ell you  that the siddhis - Anim=C3=A2, Laghim=C3=A2, and so on =E2=80=94 t=
hat he wants to attain to are  not to be attained, in the proper 
sense of =
the word, but are already there in  the soul; the work is to 
make them man=
ifest. Patanjali, for instance, would tell  you that even 
in the lowest wo=
rm that crawls under your feet, all the eightfold  
Yogi's powers are alrea=
dy existing. The difference has been made by the 
body.  As soon as it gets=
 a better body, the powers will become 
manifest, but they are  there."

So=
urce:=C2=A0 http://www.vivekananda.net/Lectures/LecturesColomboAlmora/15.ht=
ml

While the rest of the lecture is not about siddhis, it is an absolute m=
ust read!

This website ( http://www.vivekananda.net/ ) is also one of the =
best I have found that is dedicated to Swami Vivekananda's life and works.

=C2=A0 
Namaste,
=C2=A0
An interesting point came u=
p in a private exchange with a couple of folks and I will write it down for=
 the benefit of others.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =

=C2=A0
It is not like "you ge=
t so & so siddhi when you reach so & so level".
=C2=A0
Siddhis come because=
 one DESIRED them in this or a PREVIOUS life. When one has made enough prog=
ress, Nature grants one's desires (or the ability to fulfil a group of desi=
res) and sees if that tempts one and one stops or one can progress further.=

=C2=A0
So what siddhis one gets or does not get, is a function of (1) one'=
s spiritual progress now AND (2) all of one's desires until now (in this li=
fe AND previous lives). At the same level of progress, two people may fare =
differently in terms of what they get, based on what kind of wishes they en=
tertained in the past.
=C2=A0
So siddhis cannot be used to measure one's pr=
ogress. You cannot use reverse of f(x, y) to gauge x, without knowing y.

=C2=A0 
What I said is not a "blanket statement", but an explicit teachi=
ng of Vasishtha to Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is also absolutely consiste=
nt with Upanishadic learning. 
=C2=A0 
You talk about taking the words of a=
 great instead of speculating. In fact, did Vimalananda *explicitly* write =
that Ramakrishna is only a "Paramahamsa" and not a siddha or a natha or a r=
ishi, that Vivekananda is not a rishi or natha or siddha or paramahamsa, an=
d so on? In my case, my statement above is explicitly and unambiguously sta=
ted by Vasishtha. By answering Vivekananda's question "will siddhis help me=
 in god realization" in the negative, Ramakrishna also affirmed this teachi=
ng of Vasishtha. Krishna also essentially refers to the same thing in Bhaga=
vad Gita when he talks about seeking small things from demigods vs seeking =
"me" (Self). Vaishtha's words, however, are the clearest and most unambiguo=
us. 
=C2=A0 
Yoga Vaasishtham was taught by Vasishtha to Lord Rama in the p=
resence of Vishwamitra and other great sages and recorded by Valmiki. It is=
 the highest watermark of spiritual knowledge. 
=C2=A0 
Aghora series is ni=
ce, but can give wrong notions to some who may tend to be fascinated by ext=
ernal miracles. I have no doubt that Vimalananda had no confusions himself,=
 but some people reading those books can form misconceptions (though it is =
still ok if that makes them do sadhana. The only problem is if they start d=
oing the bad karma of making negative judgments on greats thinking they are=
 blindly following Vimalananda). It is a good idea to balance the perspecti=
ve with some Vedantic understanding such as Yoga Vasishtham or Bhagavad Git=
a.

 And they manifest externally. 
=C2=A0 
Yes, some external siddhis are poss=
ible only at a very rarefied level of realization. But some with the same o=
r higher level of realization may not possess the same external siddhi. Thu=
s external miracles cannot be used as measures of one's level. 
=C2=A0 
Thi=
s is like the analogy I gave of collecting fruits from the trees on the sid=
e of the road to the hilltop. Some keep tavelling on the road and accept on=
ly those fruits that land in their lap by themselves. Some get distracted f=
rom the journey and pursue the fruits actively. Collecting fruits is neithe=
r necessary nor sufficient for reaching the top. Though having a fruit that=
 is available only at a very high altitude shows that one has reached great=
 altitude, it cannot be used as a measure of one's progress, for someone ma=
y have climbed greater heights without collecting that (or any) fruit. 
=C2=
=A0 
External and internal do NOT have a one-to-one correspondence. Just as=
 you cannot tell what is inside a house by looking at it from outside, so c=
annot you tell one's state of mind from looking at one. One's spiritual mat=
urity and attainment is in one's state of mind.

Whe=

No. Hence =

The example you mentioned of Sri Ramakrishna's description =

 you mentioned. And as I see it, this is similar to the analysis I was ment=

erfectly! Yes that is why they were Nitya Siddhas. 
=C2=A0 
I see Siddhis i=
n other beings as a thermometer. It can be used to make some assessments. Y=

Otherwise, as per Vimalananada's, the hirerchy is well defined. But=
 what is also important is to remember great beings send their amsa for spe=

=C2=A0 
To get a better understanding, why do=

=C2=A0

How do you know that Vivekananda, Yogananda e=

I assume because Vimalananda mentions that they are greater to each ot=

Simple! Ramakrishna says =
Vivekananda was a part of a Rishi who came down. An amsa is not a Rishi in =
fullforce, but sufficient part of the Rishi's consciousness that comes down=
 for a secific purpose and once the purpose is served, goes back to the sou=
rce. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. Therefore, very technically, Swami Vi=
vekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi, a projection of a Rishi. Not the Rishi i=
s full. BTW, all of these Siddhas, Naths, Munis etc are projection Rishis o=
ne way or the other. Each is kept is ingorance of their real being (Rishi) =
such that the play can go on (not my words, Vimalananda's words). They are =
Nitya-siddha because even if they take birth over and over, being parts of =
extremely higher beings, these emanations/projections/amsas will surely eve=
ntually go back to the source when the work is done. 
=C2=A0 
However, in t=
heir forms as specific individuals like Vivekananda, whether these amsa att=
ain the specific stages which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will determine=
 if they are to be called so. They may not need to do so since they are her=
e for a purpose. But, the only way a person can be called a siddha in true =
sense is when he, as Vimalananda puts it, "picks a petal", (some specific s=
haktis) an "orbit" and moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into =
it, deeper and deeper.=C2=A0 
=C2=A0 
There is a book of conversations betw=
een Totapuri and a certain sadhaka (his disciple) when Totapuri lived in Pu=
ri. He used to stay in the Swargadwara smashana and later someone build a s=
mall ashram for him. Totapuri's ashram still exists in Puri. In that conver=
sation, Totapuri also mentions a similar ideas of what is a siddha and high=
er. And how only a Siddha and none less is a true Vigyani. He further menti=
ons that Swami Vivekananda did not (need) to go to the stage of a Siddha. H=
is work was specific, he did the work and went off. He did not need to and =
therefore did not become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. 
=C2=A0 
Adde=
d to this the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the discipl=
es of Ramakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual being=
, and higher than them. Here too I see no confusion. 
=C2=A0 
<<It is not n=

This is what I cal=

You assumed that =

Now, Ramakrishna himself said that Vivekananda and six other =

Dear Narasimha, 
=C2=A0 
I=
n the discussion that happened, here is my stand, in case you have not unde=

=C2=A0 
1) He was something special - which I ca=

gement more than your or mine. 
=C2=A0 
2) Some siddhis as you noted are sp=

f siddhis did come up, Vimalananda's ability to suck up a ton of mercury by=
 Vajroli and bring it out from his hair infront of someone of Vishudhananda=
's spiritual calibre, is not a easy feat. This is not a run-of-the-mill sid=
dhi. 
=C2=A0 
3) I never compared Vimalananda with Ramakrishna, but with Ra=
makrishna's disciples. That is a crucial difference.=C2=A0 My comparisons a=
re always based NOT on my understanding, but clear words of great spiritual=
 people. That is why I am 100 perecent clear that Ramakrishna is spirituall=
y higher than a Vivekananada or an Abhedananda. You may not want to judge t=
hem., thats your point of view. I on the other hand would rather rely on th=
e clear words of Vivekananda and Abhedananda on this matter rather than spe=
culation. Both Vivekananda and Abhedananda used to say Ramakrishna is their=
 Guru and spiritually far higher than they were. 
=C2=A0 
4) Whether Ramakr=
ishna was a paramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda's scale is merely your sp=
eculation. Vimalananda's books however betray no such speculation. I would =
rather rely on the words of the book. 
=C2=A0 
5) In this age everyone like=
s to take a title for himself. Many spiritual people name themselves Rishis=
, and we know it they are not.=C2=A0 So the Nityananda comparison does not =
stand. Vimalananda on his part never used any titles, not even the term Gur=
u. I base my judgement of this man on a) critical study of the books b) Man=
ish's words. And I have not found you giving any sound logic for why I shou=
ld change the same. 
=C2=A0 
6) If you do not want to compare spiritual peo=

that does not mean the world will not do so, specially when the great spiri=

=C2=A0 
Namaste friends, 
=C2=A0 
This is a small writeup on "siddhis" vis-=
a-vis spiritual progress, in reaction to further exchanges on Twitter. This=
 is a delicate area where many have misconceptions and I will try to addres=
s them. 
=C2=A0

=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Maharshi Vasishtha's teaching to =
Lord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The goal of existence and sadhana i=
s self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither specifically sought nor speci=
fically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature gives one some siddhi(s), o=
ne should accept them with neither excitement nor disappointment. But one s=
hould NOT run after them, for they are neither necessary nor sufficient for=
 self-realization and liberation. 
=C2=A0 
Vivekananda used the same princi=
ple when Ramakirishna proposed to give his siddhis to Vivekananda. He asked=
 whether the siddhis will enable him to realize god. Ramakrishna said no. V=
ivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, when Ramakrishna gave=
 them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda's two actions demonstrate=
 Vasishtha's instructions well. 
=C2=A0

=C2=A0 
Let us use=
 the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one's spiritual sadhana. =
Reaching the top is liberation. Different people climb the hill from differ=
ent sides and using different paths. There may be trees with nice fruits on=
 the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special abilities. 
=C2=A0 
If =
one gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and collecting fruits, one's=
 journey gets delayed and one may not reach the top. That is why Vasishtha =
says a seeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. 
=C2=A0 
But if some fru=
its fall in one's lap by themselves, one can keep them. Similarly, siddhis =
that come to one by themselves can be accepted by a seeker of Self. 
=C2=A0=
 
Now an important distinction: 
=C2=A0 
There are some trees that are foun=
d at lower altitudes also, but some really special trees are found at very =
high altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, it shows that one has climbed=
 great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do not mean much, but some siddhis =
are very special and only really elevated sadhakas can obtain them (whether=
 by trying or without trying). If a sadhakas demonstrates such a siddhi, yo=
u can see that one progressed a lot. However, the key is that one who climb=
ed the same or more distance may not have that or any other fruit. 
=C2=A0 =

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 
=C2=A0 
Unlike in the example of climbing hill, which is=
 an external activity, spiritual progress in real life is *internal*. There=
 is NO way for anyone to know for sure how much progress one has made, how =
much self-control one has internally and what exactly goes on in one's mind=
. We may try to judge it from external factors such as actions, words etc, =
but it is not necessarily accurate. 
=C2=A0 
Here, some people swayed by si=
ddhis may be tempted to use one's siddhis to judge how high one climbed. Bu=
t that is faulty. One person who reached the absolute top may not have any =
fruits, while one person who still has ways to climb may have gotten some r=
eally nice fruit. Using externaslly demonstrable siddhis that are neither n=
ecessary nor sufficient for Self-realization as a measure of one's progress=
 is unsound. 
=C2=A0 
Given that spiritual progress is internal, how can we=
 judge it and compare people then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a=
 sarvaantaryaami - a perfected being who has access to each being's interna=
l state - can do that.

=C2=A0 
Rajarshi, you are a=
ssuming that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scal=
e. You are concluding that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; Abhedananda, Vivek=
ananda etc are lower than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and hence Vimalanan=
da is superior to Abhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. 
=C2=A0 
Is P=
aramahamsa Nithyananda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa=
 because he is known so? See, how people are famously known may or may not =
reflect their spiritual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you=
 cannot see it. 
=C2=A0 
We do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really =
is. He may not be just a paramahamsa on Vimalananda's scale, but be a siddh=
a or a natha or even a rishi. He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself =
said and some religious experts of that time declared based on various sign=
s. If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda e=
tc can definitely be rishis or naths in Vimalananda's scale. If your argume=
nt is that they cannot be because they did not demonstrate siddhis compatib=
le with that status, that is a non-point as I explained above. The disagree=
ment between then boils down a difference in the relevance and importance o=
f externally demonstrated siddhis.

Why thi=
s is relevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to hav=
e misconceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing =
miracles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. 
=C2=A0 
Vasishtha =
is not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught Lord=
 Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will=
 balance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis=
 are neither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don't be distra=
cted by them or be infatuated with them. 
=C2=A0 
The goal of sadhana is th=
at your notions of "this is I and these are mine" get subtler and subtler a=
nd hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and weaker. Others ma=
y or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you know your prog=
