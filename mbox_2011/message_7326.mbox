Dear Aswin,

Narasimha has previously written that some little movement of the vocal
cords is useful to start developing resonance between the external fire and
the internal spiritual fire. You can easily have some little movement of the
vocal cords without chanting in an audible way. Chanting in an inaudible way
is not wrong.

A couple of caveats: it is easier to mispronounce the words etc when you
chant in an inaudible way. Also, when you chant loudly, the physical mouth
and ears are involved. When chanting mentally, unless you have good focus,
you can end up in some totally different place. It is up to each person to
decide what works best for them.

Do what it takes to achieve focus and bhakti. After all, that is the point
of all spiritual practices ...

sasneham,

   ajit
