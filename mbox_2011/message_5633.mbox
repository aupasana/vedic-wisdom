 Revealing the profound philosophical insights of the world's most ancient =

o I know God?" from the distinctly Vedic (Hindu) perspective, but also expl=
ores the further issues of what it even means to be able to know God. With =
greater detail than any other book ever written to date, it reveals the pre=
cise mystical mechanisms employed for knowing the Divine; the psychological=
 conditions necessary for such a spiritual endeavor; the transformative cog=
nitive experiences that occur within the spiritual practitioner upon achiev=

piritually revealed literature, and the important role of living teachers; =
and the vast implications of the Vedic world-view on contemporary global ph=

od?", this is the book that will give you the precise road-map!
