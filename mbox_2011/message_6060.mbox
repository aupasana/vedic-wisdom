Maharshis who overcame the concept of Time and space-time conti=
nuum when living here in a body can bless us even after they leave earth. T=
o those of you who do any kind of homam daily or weekly and want to surrend=
er to Parasara and get some blessings from him, I suggest making 4 or 8 or =
12 aahutis (oblations) of ghee at the beginning of uttaraangam while saying=
 one of the following:

daM na mama.
