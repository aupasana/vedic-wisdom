Hi,

I have produced two documentary films on spirituality that you are gua=
ranteed to love.    

These documentaries are sure to invoke a lively discu=
ss.  The first film, Beyond Me, is about consciousness, instincts, personal=
ity disorders and evolution and makes a case for how meditation is the solu=
tion for human suffering.  

The second film, Beyond Belief, presents a cas=
e for Missing Knowledge that Jesus taught and that His authentic teachings =
have their roots in Vedanta.

No matter what your spiritual background is, =
the knowledge in these films applies universally and is very profound & tho=
ught provoking.

Both films are available to view at no charge at

Enjoy!!

Have a Happy New Year!!

Frank

ps--I do not =
make any money from them and I'm not trying to sell anything.  The sole int=
ention is to just share this knowledge in an easy to understand format.
