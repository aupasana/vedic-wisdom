Namaste Narasimha,

What is the source of the verse *agnimukhaa vai devaah*=
 ? I would like to be
able to do some research and writing about it, and I =
have personally found
homa and time in front of the fire to be powerful and=
 purifying.

Soon in Mendota, MN an event called "World Peace and Prayer Da=
y" will be
held and the theme is "Honoring Sacred Water with offerings of F=
ire and
Silence" and while its impulse comes from the Native American/Lakot=
a
spiritual leaders like Chief Arvol Looking Horse some representatives fro=
m
vedic and hindu yoga traditions will be participating. I'd love to have
s=
omething simple and inviting written up to pass out to people who want to
t=
ake this kind of practice home with them for incorporation into  regular
sa=
dhana.

Thank you,
Soren C. Sorensen / Magnus Ramachandra
