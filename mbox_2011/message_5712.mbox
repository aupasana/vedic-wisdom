 Who provides food for the little frog that lives hidden between the strata=

of rocks?Who has clothed the fruits with skin to prevent contamination fro=
m
outside? Who divided the season? Who made the water warm beneath the ice =
to
enable the fishes to live comfortably in the icy regions of the Himalaya=
s,
and other places? Who has combined four parts of nitrogen with the one p=
art
of oxygen?

At whose command does the sun rise in the morning and set i=
n the evening?
The sun is 92,830,000 miles away from the earth. What a grea=
t wonder that
from such a long distance the sun is able to convey light, he=
at, energy and
vitality to all the living beings who inhabit the earth. The=
re are millions
of suns larger and smaller than the one which we see, but w=
hich appear to us
like tiny stars on account of their being remoter than th=
e sun with which we
are acquainted. It takes millions of years for the ligh=
t from these stars to
reach this earth. Velocity of light is 186,000 miles =
per second. Light from
some distant stars has not yet reached us even now. =
What a great marvel it
is! All these stars, planets, and satellites are rev=
olving in the sky in
fixed orbits from day to day, month to month and year =
to year, under
immutable, definite laws. God is the Niyanta (controller). T=
he sun cannot
shine without Him. Fire cannot burn without Him.

Who supplie=
s water to the trees, flowers, various shrubs, etc., that are
found in this=
 world? Who is this unseen, untiring gardener who works without
wages or an=
y sort of remuneration? Who gives nourishment in time to tigers,
lions, bir=
ds, fishes, plants, insects, worms, etc.? How is it that only
human beings =
are born of human beings, birds of birds, tigers of tigers,
dogs of dogs, h=
orses of horses, elephants of elephants, ants of ants, bears
of bears, mule=
s of mules,- an exact copy of their parents in every respect?
>From a tiny s=
eed there springs a huge banyan tree that can give shelter for
thousands of=
 persons. From a tiny seed there comes out a big mango tree that
gives thou=
sands of delicious fruits. What is that power which supports and
nourishes =
these trees? What is that hidden,miraculous power that brings out
huge form=
 with hair, fingers, toes, eyes, nose, teeth, ears, legs,thighs,
etc., out =
of a tiny embryo? What is that power that brings out a mighty tree
with fol=
iage,flowers, twigs and fruit out of a tiny seed?
