Translation - W=
ho, having thirsted among Gods, gasping, knowing
oblations and having prais=
e fashioned with songs, O agni, come with the
gracious pitru devataas, who =
are true and wise, and who reside in
heavens, come here.
Interpretation - T=
he one who is thirsted among Gods, who is
jehamaanaH[gasping], jehamaanaH c=
an also mean one who has tongue visible
because of open mouth (jihva - jeha=
maanaH), the one who  is
hotraa-vidah[one who knows oblations], he knows ob=
lations because he is
the one who bears the sacrifices to Gods becoming hot=
ra-vaahaka, and
also because he is the hotRRi(chief priest) himself , and i=
s
taShTaasaH[fahioned] by stoma[praise], and the praises are in the form
of=
 arkaiH[hymns/songs], Yes he is none other than our beloved, friend,
guide =
and priest - the agni.  agni is thirsted to carry oblations to
Gods, he is =
the one who has his seven tounges gasping for the oblations,
and is the chi=
ef priest who is praised by hymns such as "agniM
iile(iiDe-praise) purohiit=
aM(the choosen priest) yaGYasya(of sacrifices)
devam RRitvijam, hotaaram ra=
tna dhaattamaM".
   Agni is invoked here and is welcomed to yaahi[come] arv=
aan[here]
aa[near to us], along with our su-vidatrebhiH[gracious] pitru dev=
ataas,
with pitru devataas who are kavyai[wise], sathya[truthful] and
gharm=
asat-bhiH[with the ones who reside in heavens].   kavyai can also
be interp=
reted as below -
    *     kavya also mean a sacrificial priest, agni is in=
voked here
along with pitru devataas who are kavyai[with kavya], agni being=
 the
cheif priest need accompanying priests for the sacrifice and hence we
=
are calling upon agni to come to the sacrifice along with the
accompanying =
priests (pitru devataas).
    *     kavya also mean the offering given to p=
itru devataas (havya is
given to deities and kavya to pitru devataas), and =
agni is both
havya-vaahaka (the one who carries oblations to Gods) and also=
 a
kavya-vaahaka (the one who carries oblations to pitru devataas), agni is=

being called upon here to help us carry oblations to pitru devataas and
he=
nce the invitation to agni is to come with kavyaiH[with the ones who
accept=
 kavya]
    *     kavya also mean a class of pitru devataas originated from=
 rishi
named kavi and are connected to braahmanaas(Manu 3.199), and we find=

them in Rig Veda 10.14.3 as well, in aitareya brahmana (7.34.2) - where
we=
 find kavyaaH are a type of pitru devataas who are offered food
afternoons.=

    *     kavya also mean wise, pitru devataas are said to be wise,
Manu(3=
.201) says pitru devataas are born from rishis, and from pitru
devataas and=
 human are born, and from devaas the movable and immovable
are born, since =
pitru devataas are born from rishis they are said to be
wise, that again pr=
oves - what else is there in this brahmaanDa which is
not from rishi sankal=
pa? jay ho Vimalananda guru!!!
  agni is also being invoked to come here wi=
th gharmasat-bhi[bhi-with,
gharmasat=3Dgharma+sat {gharma=3Dsun/sunshine/fi=
re/warm/day, sat=3Dseated}].
pitru devataas are classified into various typ=
es as per sruthi and
smrithi and one such classification as per Rig Veda 10=
.154.1 -       
somyaasaH - pitru devataas who love soma [we have been invo=
king them in
previous riks]      havishpaaH - pitru devataas who drink obla=
tions     
haviradaH - pitru devataas who eat oblations (by smell?)     
gh=
armasadaH - pitru devataas who are in heaven in suurya mandala,
liberated?
=
     there are more classifications that we can find in manu smrithi
(3.194=
 to 3.199), and some more in braahmanaas, but one gross
classification can =
be as follows -
     soma also mean moon and is connected to night/dark, an=
d sun is
connected to day/light and the pitru devataas who have departed in=
 those
timeframes (or pitru devaaatas by virtue of karma) can be said somya=
asaH
(connected with moon, and are in lower realms) and gharmasadaH
(connec=
ted with sun, and are in higher realms), this could also be
connected to pi=
tru devataas who departed in dakshinaayana and
uttarayana.
       gharmasad=
aH also means sitting near agni - as an acceptor of our
offering from kavya=
-vaahana, agni as kavya-vaahaka [carrier of kavyam]
is being invoked along =
with pitru devataas, hence putting it all
together - pitru devataas are bei=
ng addressed here as the ones who are
seated in heavens/who are liberated, =
and also as acceptor of our
offering from agni.
