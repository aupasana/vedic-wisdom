Narasimhaji,

Namaste!

Thank you for explaining so easily once again. As y=
ou have mentioned, if one wants to get close to the diamond, one HAS to pic=
k one side. How does one know/realize which side to pick? Is there a way to=
 know/find out? What if one has picked one side but there is a sense of gui=
lt left in the mind that the other side(s) were not picked? Please advise h=
ow to chose the right direction when one is at a point where all directions=
 seem right.

Regarding the other question, could you please also enlighten=
 which deity form of the Divine Mother represents the sattvic quality of He=
r?

Many thanks and kind regards,

Manish
