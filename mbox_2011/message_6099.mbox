Dear T,
I'll take a stub at answering the duality and non-duality from my =
understanding, may not be providing with pin-point answers to your question=
s..
We humans who have not realized ourselves i.e with no self realization,=
 we perceive everything as dual..we strive to realize the non-dualistic nat=
ure of the universe through spiritual practices ..and attains it making us =
god (if we can constantly stay in that state without having an iota of perc=
eption of self said to be EGO). This stage is called samadhi (not sure what=
 variant of it is). In another words when the kundalini or shakti from you =
raises and reaches the shiva the nerger of shakti and shiva is a state of s=
amadhi making you forget about your ego..
But this state in most of us do n=
ot hold on and the shakti descends back...When the shakti descends..you aga=
in come back to your dual state..BUT with a difference..as now you have the=
 knowledge of what the non-dualism is (which otherwise nobody can ever expl=
ain by words..budhism explains this as sunyaa..or void state also). With th=
is knowledge and increased sense of difference about dual and non-dual mech=
anisms you develop complete vairagya (detachment) from everything and just =
will be part of the dual play of the cosmos for whatever reason the god is =
playing..hence as you correctly quoted..the underlying energy is the same..=
however in a project plane of reference the dualistic nature exits and (tak=
ing a guess here) perhaps the forms of Ganesha and others exist there diffe=
rent from shiva..
I've rambled just from my understanding..may be the learn=
ed members like Sri Narasimha garu can guide us properly..
CheersKK

      It is confusing ! if eventually all=
