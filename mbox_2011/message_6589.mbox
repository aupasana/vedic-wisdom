Dear respected sirs,

Real sanyasa is a condition of the mind. Sri Ramakris=
hna Paramahamsa, despite 
taking sanyasa got married and never retired into=
 solitude and yet maintained 
the kind of purity and vairagyam impossible f=
or even any other ochre-donned 
sanyasi. 


My questions to you dear sirs i=
s, for someone who has the information that the 
path of karma and jnana ar=
e jointly needed to reach the supreme end, how may we 
attain the mental st=
ate of sanyasa while still remaining in this world? The 
sensory attraction=
s by no small means induce passion in place of the goal which 
is vairagya.=
 My humble request is to please share how we may be able to "fight" 
or ove=
rcome this sensual attractions and attain to real vairagya so that we may 
=
attain our desired spiritual end? 


Regards,
Anoop.

Realizati=
on is the right word here; else, we tend to take what all was spoken 
liter=
ally without knowing the time, place and circumstances when those words 
we=
re spoken.
In one of the brahmacharya classes, SrilaPrabhupad mentions that=
 "one has to 
avoid women the way one avoids politicians". Afte some years,=
 those comments 
were taken out of context and some people went on to say t=
hat SP was a male 
chauvinist :-)
Like SriVidyaPrakasanandagiri Swamiji of =
SukaBrahmasramam in SriKalahasti 
mentioned, Janaka maharaj, who is not a s=
anyasi literally, must have been an 
extremely great realized soul and henc=
e a great renunciate, else which all great 
names were mentioned the Gita a=
part from King Janaka? Why would Lord Vishnu's 
consort prefer to be his da=
ughter ?

Prasad
