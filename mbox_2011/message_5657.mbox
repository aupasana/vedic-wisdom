The best way is practice.. there is little or no point in memorising these.=
 The teacher does not award for extra points for memorising stuff. Points a=
re given only for doing it ;) 

As a matter of fact, in these things, accor=
ding to some paramparas all texts and stotras need to be read from a book. =
In others, this is applicable only if there are more than 1000 slokas- what=
 I am trying to say is that there is no shame in reading from the book or p=
rinted/written paper until you have done it enough number of times for it t=
o become 'by heart'. 

It will happen in time so dont waste your time in sp=
ecial efforts to do that
