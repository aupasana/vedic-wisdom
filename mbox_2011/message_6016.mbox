Namaste

I just wanted to share some random thoughts to get the opinion of =
the members.The intent is not to dehumanize the suffering or justify it , j=
ust was wondering on the reason. I was thinking about the recent earthquake=
 and the tsunami which followed and did the most damage in Japan. The ways =
of karma are mysterious and like Vimalananda says in the aghora series " Ka=
rma gahano gatih " . 

 2011-2012 transition is bringing its own share of n=
atural disasters.

1.Floods in pakistan last year which took a huge toll. 
=

( Could be due to the huge violence this region has inflicted on the world=
 continously in the past few decades ) 

2.Floods in Australia in Jan/Feb w=
hich also took a huge toll

and now the Earthquake/Tsunami in Japan.  Why s=
hould nature react in these places.

Japan it turns out is the biggest kill=
er of whales every year. Japan continues to hunt wild whales in numbers exc=
eeding 2000 every year under the guise of scientific hunting.No other moder=
n country does this.The ICW often criticizes the japanese for doing this . =

Surely this act of killing=
 so many of Maa's children in the water maybe brought about her wrath throu=
gh the water .

I have heard many modern day guru's talk about 2011-2012 be=
ing a lesson to humanity to learn to respect life in all forms and stop pol=
luting mother earth and the constant killing . It is not earth that is in d=
anger,it is man for nature can easily swat us like a mosquito with a giant =
tsunami or earthquake.


The directive of the mother goddess to Manish ji a=
nd Narasimha ji and the noble intent to heal the etheric atmosphere of the =
earth through many people taking up homa is commendable in letting people c=
orrect their course before nature decides to take drastic action.
