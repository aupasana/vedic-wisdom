Namaste,
While Naramasimhaji and other brothers will probably add their inp=
uts I just felt that I can give my own "2 cents".. Please ignore / forgive =
if you dont agree with my view points.
I dont believe that one needs to be =
initiated to start reading any of the slokas / Mantras that you have mentio=
ned here. But as Narasimhaji said on multiple occasions "IF"=C2=A0 you are =
really lucky enough to get a formal initiation from a "Qualified" Guru then=
 its like starting off with a hefty bank balance. Then its upto you to buil=
d on the balance . But in case you dont get such a Guru (Such Guru's are ra=
re and maybe not existing at all in today's age).. then Nature will make ar=
rangements for you to learn and this Yahoo Group is one such example. You p=
robably start with a Zero Balance or may be some balance from your previous=
 births . The very fact that you are inclined to make spiritual progress is=
 indicative of past Good Karmas ..Regarding the choice of Mantras I dont th=
ink sequence really matters although the Devi Mahatmyam Book by Gita Press =
is standard and flows logically ...As the Paramahamsa said instead of diggi=
ng 100 holes (synonymous of=C2=A0
 different Mantras/ Gods) in search of Wa=
ter just dig one deep hole (synonymous of=C2=A0 a single Mantra/ Gods) and =
keep digging and eventually you will find water.... As long as you are in t=
his world and have obligations towards your kins you will need to do mundan=
e activities along with Spiritual Activities and hence need to balance with=
 whatever time is available ..Just read what ever number of chapters of Dev=
i Mahatmyam you can read per day and adhere to the same standard. It is no =
doubt a complex script and may take many months / years / Births to master =
based on ones samskaraas but keep preserving with devotion .. You can even =
start doing the regular Chandi Homa once you become comfortable with the pr=
ocedure and the Text.. Agni and the divine mother will take care of the res=
t ..

Girish Sundaram

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Query Re=
garding Durga Sapthashati


=C2=A0 
Namaste Narasimhaji,

This is my first =
post, I'm a silent member of Vedic =C2=A0Wisdom, i read all the posts and t=
hankful to all the members of this group.

I have a query regarding reading=
 Durga sapthashati.=C2=A0

My query is i have a desire to read durga saptha=
shati, this has been there since more than a year or two. I got the book la=
st year, but i still haven't started reading.

The reason being i've come a=
cross all your posts and people responding to your posts, i.e whether a per=
son who has not been initiated could read or should not read. I'm not able =
to conclude, even now i'm reading the post and text by Dr. Sathya Prakash C=
houdhary, but still unable to conclude.

I've read that people should be ve=
ry careful while reading Durga Sapthashati, i don't know to what extent and=
 what could be the consequences

I do read Aditya Hrudayam, Srisuktham, Vis=
hnu Sahasranamam, Lalitha Sahasranamam, Lalitha Trishati. I don't know how =
i started reading, no body guided me or initiated me how to read but i read=
 it easily, whenever i do prayer i ask for for well being of all the people=
 i know, sometimes just blessings and sometimes i don't even ask anything.
=

I try to follow reading for one deity=C2=A0continuously=C2=A0for N number =
of days, then start reading for other deities and follow the same rule.

Ab=
out me: I'm a bachelor aged about 28

My questions

1. Should i start readi=
ng Durga Sapthashati.
2. If so what are the do's and don'ts .=C2=A0

Finall=
y the process to read, i read the book and as per it, it is



=E2=80=A2 Ka=
vacham=C2=A0
=E2=80=A2 Argala Stotra=C2=A0
=E2=80=A2 Keelakam=C2=A0
=E2=80=
=A2 Navakshari japam=C2=A0
=E2=80=A2 Ratri Suktam=C2=A0
=E2=80=A2 Devi Maha=
tmyam=C2=A0
=E2=80=A2 Navakshari mantra japam=C2=A0
=E2=80=A2 Devi Suktam=
=C2=A0
=E2=80=A2 Rahasya trayam=C2=A0
=E2=80=A2 Kshama Prarthan

Does it re=
quire the above process to be followed strictly to read single adhyaya per =
day or it's ok to just read the chapter without above process.=C2=A0
Or in =
other ways what all should be read if i read a single chapter a day.

Apart=
 from these questions can a person read Laitha Sahasranaama / Trishati afte=
r reading Vishnu Sahasranama or vice versa.

Best Wishes,
Balaji
