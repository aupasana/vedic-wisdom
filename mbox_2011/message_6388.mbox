Namaste:

Thought of sharing this interesting video and website. One of my
friend forwarded this to me.

SSRF:Spiritual Science Research Foundation - The below link is a video
about SSRF (infomercial). The video explains all the activities of
SSRF (and also one will realise why doing Pitri Tarapana is
important). Their main focus is on the research of spiritual causes
for the unsolved medical problems and have lots of information on
their website. It's worth visiting once.
