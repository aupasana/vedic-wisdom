 Namaste,
[

endous >wisdom I have seen elsewhere
]

YES!I have witnessed Sivananda's wo=
nderful wisdom in "Yoga Vaasishtham" by Venktesananda. By all means he woul=
d been speaking to a special target group when he expressed some thoughts o=
n Sanyaasa.

Actually these whole matter a good eye opener for any spiritua=
l Aspirant. It is not a wise idea to accept every quote blindly without eno=
ugh reflections and understandin. Everything has a purpose and meaning. Tru=
th can have many shades. Narasimha Garu as usual, explained and clarified i=
t very nicely....Perfect.


Regards,

Utpal
