Namaste,

>If you want to do a panchopachara pooja to fire, you can do it >=
after "chatvaari" mantra praising fire.

Incidentally, I started doing Panc=
hopchara to Agni Deva since a couple of months. Also Panchopchara to Varuna=
 (after "Vam" mantra) and Deepam (2 upachara). Lekin koi bhi Deva se abhi t=
ak mulakat nahi hui :-)

Happy Rishi Panchami to All and best wishes for An=
y New Spiritual Kick Start.

Utpal
