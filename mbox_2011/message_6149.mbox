Namaste

I completly agree with Krishna Kanth ji's take on celibacy. Narasi=
mha ji has often posted " Shakti is restraint" and this quote applies to bo=
th mental emissions ( anger ,jealousy and the astha pashas ) and also to ph=
ysical celibacy. 

Even for the body to stay strong to be able to do seriou=
s sadhana in the form of yoga one needs to conserve the vital fluids. Ayurv=
eda considers the vital fluids to be one of the four pillars supporting one=
's health. 

In addition to that Lust will ruin one's power of visualizatio=
n by adding a lot more garbage to the mental stream which will have to work=
 its way through the system.

Some great commentators have said Lord Sri ra=
ma hitting the monkey king Vali from behind a tree is symbolically the way =
to overcome lust and the astha pashas . Vali had a boon that he would absor=
b the strength of one who faced him directly .One cannot grapple with Lust =
directly.If one tries to forcibly suppress the desire it rebounds with doub=
le the strength.

After all it is an inside job !!!!!One will need the help=
 of the deity and homa  to purify one's own nature. 

Regards
Vemparla Ram =
Kishore
