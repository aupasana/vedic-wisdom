Namaste,

Very well put thoughts! And specially if one spends some months i=
n online astrology forums, one will lose faith on astrology and astrologers=
 as a breed. Feels like you are watching a zoo or a circus! Exceptions are =
rare. 

Inherently weak minds use astrology as a crutch which does nothing =
more than making themselves weaker, mentally and by character. Vivekananda =
had a point. If one needs a crutch, let it be God because all knowledge in =
the field of duality is subject to change based on evidences and emperical =
understanding. 

-Regards
 Rajarshi
