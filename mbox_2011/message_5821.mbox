The Meaning of Human Existence

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya


"Accordi=
ng to the ancient wisdom of Dharma, we exist to begin with because it's our=
 very innate nature to exist. The sacred scriptures of both Yoga and Sanata=
na Dharma teach us that our true, innermost nature is that we are atman, or=
 eternal units of consciousness. We have the Absolute (Brahman, or God) as =
both our causative and substantial source, and as the ontological sustainer=
 of our existential being. Having God as our underlying source, it necessar=
ily follows that we naturally share in many of God's essential attributive =
qualities. Because we participate in God's innate attributes - and if not t=
o a quantitatively equivalent degree, then certainly to a qualitative one -=
 we too share in many of God's qualities. One of those attributes that both=
 the infinite Godhead and we as finite units of consciousness have in commo=
n is necessary existence. In other words, both God and we ourselves (atmans=
, or souls) are eternal by our inherent nature. God and individual atmans c=
annot but exist. To go out of existence is simply not within the realm of o=
ur capability.

Never was there a time when we came into being, and never w=
ill there be a time when we cease to exist. So, in a way, we exist because =
we cannot but exist, being purely spiritual beings in essence. Such is our =
nature, for it is the nature of God, the ultimate source of our being...."
