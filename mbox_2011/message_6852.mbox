Namaste Utpal Ji

Just adding some random thoughts before Narasimha ji resp=
onds. Swami Sivananda in his understanding karma book has written about it =
this way. The prarabdha allocated for this life is unrevocable and will hav=
e to be worked out. Intensity might be modified ...

1.Maybe if someone is =
destined to have an accident with injury to the body. If no modifying karma=
s are done the person might have a very big accident with lower part of the=
 body paralyzed. With some of the remedial measures he will still have the =
accident no doubt...but might have an very quick recovery with almost mirac=
ulous healing which might be promoted by the homa/kavacha or any other reme=
dy.

2.The rest of the Sanchita Karma ( accrued sum total ) can be burnt by=
 a serious Yogi since it has not yet materialized. Even very serious blocki=
ng karmas reserved for future births might be rapdily burned away if one is=
 sincere in practise and sadhana.

3.The agaami Karma ( Karma being perform=
ed right now and which will come in the future ) can be positively impacted=
 since the homa refines ones present condition.

All in all Homa/Remedial m=
easures are an huge blessing since it has the potential to burn the Sanchit=
a and also modify the Agaami via the refinement feedback and also there is =
an remote possibility the present karma might get rearranged a little bit l=
ike Narasimha ji said.
