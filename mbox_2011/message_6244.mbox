Namaskaram PVR garu,

I recently fell badly and sprained my leg. As a resul=
t I am not able to perform homams sitting on the ground. Now I do it in tab=
le and chair. Ever since I started this way homams don't seem to be as effe=
ctive as before. I can feel the difference in results. 

My table height is=
 26'' and chair 16 "". Does it matter whether the chair/table is made of pl=
astic/metal or wooden... as my table is wooden and chair is plastic? Kindly=
 guide if I am doing anything wrong?

Many thanks for your help always,

Be=
st regards,
Priya
