Hi I'm not in India so we have drywall with paint overlay and I had the s=
ame problem. Actually, I was doing homam in basement for about a year, and =
it went through the ventiliation system and we had black soot destroying ou=
r carpet and depositing on our walls. I have since stopped totally in the h=
ome. Would only do outside-in the garage now.
 
Remedy was to remove the ca=
rpet and get hardwood/laminate flooring. And there is a chemical dry sponge=
 which can be used to pick up soot from walls. Usually it is used in places=
 with fire damage. google chemical dry sponge. I am in Canada and ordered f=
rom USA. Then we cleaned off the walls with TSP mix with water and re-paint=
ed the home. So yeah, overall the experience has been a dent in the bank ac=
count, but hopefully it has been worth it. so try chemical sponge and tsp s=
olution, then paint. Soot gets eveerywhere. If in N. America, make sure to =
change your furnace filter EVERY MONTH, get duct cleaning every year, & avo=
id inside if possible to avoid this.
