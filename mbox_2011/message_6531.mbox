The qualifications necessary for taking sannyasa are:

1. Discrimination be=
tween the One Eternal Substance and the appearance of ephemeral phenomena.
=

2. Dispassion for the enjoyment of things existing either in this or the o=
ther world.

3. Possessing the six-fold wealth, viz., tranquillity of mind;=
 control of the senses; cessation from all worldly activity; endurance of t=
he pairs of opposites, like heat and cold, pleasure and pain, love and hatr=
ed, etc.; faith in the Vedantic truth as inculcated by the spiritual precep=
tor; power of concentration of mind.

4. An ardent yearning for liberation.=
