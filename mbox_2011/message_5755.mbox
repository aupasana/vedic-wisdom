Namaste,

What the Holy Mother said in simple words is the essence of 
spirituality. When it comes to spiritual sadhana, no effort is wasted. 
Everything eventually adds up.

*        *        *

One who thinks, "I have done so much sadhana. Did I get anything back", 
is trying to do business with god. One cannot conquer god or do business 
with god. One can only surrender to god.

In this age, there are very few who think of god, even with a selfish 
attitude. Then, what to say of those who think of god with selfless 
devotion and surrender? God is also looking for such devotees. How can 
god hide from such a devotee? Anyone who calls on god will eventually be 
answered. More so for those who call on god with surrender.

*        *        *

But remember one thing. For us, 10 years or 100 years (or even 1000 
years) may be a long time. But, for god, it is a very very very short 
span of time.

A hungry child crying for mother may be disappointed if mother does not 
rush to one in a second or a minute to feed one. But mother knows that 
she need not come immediately and no hell will break loose if she takes 
10 minutes to come. Child may be disapppointed by the delay, but mother 
knows the best. Eventually, mother will come to the child and feed the 
child before it is too late.

Same with god. Do sadhana. Keep calling on god. God will come to one at 
the right time, in the right form.

*        *        *

Though fear of god is ok in the beginning, try to convert that fear into 
love and surrender.

Pray to god, not for the fear of hell (either celestially or on earth!) 
nor for the lure of heaven (either celestially or on earth!), but 
because god is the concentrated essence of purity in the universe (and 
hence within each person, who is a microcosm of the universe). Love god, 
adore god and surrender to god. Eventually, that will purify you and 
fill you with divinity.

Best regards,
Narasimha
