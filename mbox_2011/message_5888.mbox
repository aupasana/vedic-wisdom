Namaste, 
=C2=A0
kindly refer to the homam manuals by PVR ji where he expla=
ined the misconception of why women should not perform homa (misconception =
no.7 in maha ganapati homam manual). That has a clear explanation of why wo=
men are discouraged from certain practises. Most of that applies to Rudra P=
arayanam as well, IMHO. While I know that there are restrictions on women r=
eciting Rudra parayanam in tradition, I am not aware of restrictions on lis=
tening. I think for listening, anyone is okay. Also, if rudra parayanam is =
giving you immense bliss and you want to recite it anyway, my humble sugges=
tion is please learn it formally from=C2=A0 a guru, instead of reciting on =
your own.
