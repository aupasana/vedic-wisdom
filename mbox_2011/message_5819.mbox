 Devotee.: Is it necessary to take sannyasa (a vow of renunciation) in orde=
r
to attain Self-realisation?

Bhagavan: =E2=80=98Sannyasa=E2=80=99 means r=
enouncing one=E2=80=99s individuality, not shaving one=E2=80=99s
head and p=
utting on ochre robes. A man may be a householder but if he does
not think =
he is one he is a sannyasin.On the other hand, he may wear ochre
robes and =
wander about,but so long as he thinks he is a sannyasin he is not
one. To t=
hink about one=E2=80=99s renunciation defeats the purpose of renouncing.

W=
hat do you mean by =E2=80=98taking sannyasa=E2=80=99? Do you think it means=
 leaving your
home or wearing robes of a certain colour? Wherever you go, e=
ven if you fly
up into the air, will your mind not go with you? Or, can you=
 leave it behind
you and go without it?

Why should your occupation or duti=
es in life interfere with your spiritual
effort?

For instance, there is a =
difference between your activities at home and in
the office. In your offic=
e activities, you are detached and so long as you
do your duty you do not c=
are what happens or whether it results in gain or
loss to the employer.

Yo=
ur duties at home, on the other hand,are performed with attachment and you
=
are all the time anxious whether they will bring advantage to you and your
=
family. But it is possible to perform all the activities of life with
detac=
hment and regard only the Self as real. It is wrong to suppose that if
one =
is fixed in the Self, one=E2=80=99s duties in life will not be properly
per=
formed. It is like an actor.

He dresses and acts and even feels the part h=
e is playing, but he knows
really that he is not that character but someone=
 else in real life. In the
same way, why should the body consciousness or t=
he feeling =E2=80=98I-am-the-body=E2=80=99
disturb you, once you know for c=
ertain that you are not the body but the
Self?

Nothing that the body does =
should shake you from abidance in the Self. Such
abidance will never interf=
ere with the proper and effective discharge of
whatever duties the body has=
 any more than an actor=E2=80=99s being aware of his
real status in life in=
terferes with his acting a part on the stage.
