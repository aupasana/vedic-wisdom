My friend, you have some weird notions. Agni permeates the 14 worlds and 
is responsible for their smooth running. He can take your offering 
anywhere and not just to "heaven". In homam/yajna, we make offerings to 
various beings living in various worlds. For example, in jayadi homam 
done at the end of various homas, we make offerings to pitris, parvatas, 
bhutas, samudras, yakshas etc.

Secondly, to one who sees Shiva as the supreme being, Shiva does not 
"live in" one place, but he is the underlying reality of everything.

Though Shiva is depicted as living in smashana (cemetary) with spirits, 
it has esoteric significance. I elaborated this in a Sanskrit shloka I 
composed just a few days back and you can read it, its meaning and 
commentary at that:

Parasara mentioned making offerings to Shiva in fire with "tryambakam 
yajaamahe" mantra (Mrityunjaya mantra) as a remedy to several horoscopic 
problems!!

Vishnu Dharmottara Purana mentioned Rudra Yajna. Agni Purana also 
mentioned Rudra homam. Mrityunjaya homam to Shiva with Mrityunjaya 
mantra is also mentioned and popular in tradition.

In any homam, the final offerings made are those to Vishnu and Rudra, 
irrespective of what homam it is. What Daksha did was to break the rules 
by doing a "Nirishwara yajna". He was trying to insult Shiva and he paid 
for it. It is foolish to take his foolish act as an example to conclude 
that offerings should not be made to Shiva in fire.

If you think it is "absolute nonsense", please do not do it! Do homam to 
Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Vishnu, Shiva, Krishna, Chandi etc. Pick somebody 
else. Or don't do homam at all if you please.

BTW, I personally know people doing homam to Shiva and making brisk 
spiritual progress.

If you really want to "insult and reject" someone, you will be better 
off picking someone killing and raping in the name of god or spreading 
intolerance and hatred in the name of god and religion. Or people 
engaging in so many worse evils on earth today. Why target poor people 
worshipping Shiva in fire!

Just for the record, I do not consider myself a guru. If someone 
voluntarily (and mentally) considers me a guru for the purpose of 
performing homam, I do not mind it. However, my main role is not to be a 
guru, but to show people their guru. Let me elaborate.

People who have access to a good external guru to give a push to one's 
spiritual progress, they may follow that guru. Otherwise, I am giving 
them access to a superb external guru who will remain on earth in a 
physical form even after you and I leave - Agni (Fire), the original 
preceptor, guru, priest and purohit of Veda! Invite Agni into your life 
as your guru and purohit and spend some sacred time with him everyday 
with reverence. He will transform you from the core and show the correct 
direction. I am not a guru, but I can show you a guru who can change you 
for better.

And, BTW, I do not sell ANYTHING. So don't worry about "falling prey to 
marketing". Try homam if you want to and continue if you like it. 
Period. No strings attached.

Best regards,
Narasimha
