 The imperfections that beset life in samsara are transcended. It is shown
=
in the supreme state reached by the sages.

559 For the sage who dwells in =
the state of non-duality, fear and desire do
not arise as they do in an ign=
orant one. Desire and fear are unavoidable for
those who are deluded by see=
ing differences.

560 The sentence, =E2=80=98Fear arises from a second enti=
ty=E2=80=99, shows that seeing
duality is the cause of fear. No creature wh=
ose Self has been apparently
stolen by the belief in the reality of differe=
nces is ever free from fear.

561 =E2=80=98The sage who is immersed in the =
ecstasy of the blissful real Self, who
is beyond the scope of mind and spee=
ch, is not afraid of anything
whatsoever.=E2=80=99 In this way revelation t=
eaches us that nothing moves the sage
from his supreme state.

562 For him =
that is established in the supreme state, desires do not arise,
because the=
 desirer, the ego, has ceased to exist.The sage in that state is
ever conte=
nted, as if he had obtained simultaneously enjoyment of all
possible desire=
s at a stroke.

This is from the Taittiriya Upanishad. What is meant is tha=
t all the
happiness that is possible in the worldly life is contained in a =
minute
fraction of that bliss of Brahman.
