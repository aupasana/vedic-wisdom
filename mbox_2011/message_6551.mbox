THE  SWAMI     Are your religious practices going well? 

SHISHYA        No=
, Maharaj.With all  my efforts I see no spiritual unfoldment;hence I find n=
o peace of mind.Evidently we are born with evil Samskaras(impressions)and t=
hese stand in the way of our spiritual progress. 

THE SWAMI      My boy,yo=
u should not think thus.Practise Japam at  dead of night.If you cannot do i=
t at that time,  do it  during the early hours of the morning.Perform  Pura=
scharana.Do not waste your  valuable time any more.Lose yourself in prayer =
and meditation.All inner truths will come by themselves if you  practise Sa=
dhana for some time.                
              The spiritual aspirant s=
hould not take much food at night.At first take three-fourths of usual diet=
.Then reduce the quantity to half.In the beginning you may feel some weakne=
ss of the body.But the body will be all right after some time, and will rem=
ain active and in perfect condition.                                   

  =
                                               
     (The Swami then referr=
ed to the days when he practised Sadhana in  the company of his  brother di=
sciples and said: "We used to take only a single meal during the whole day =
and night.")  

                               
                           =
                
                                                         
=
