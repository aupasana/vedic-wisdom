NAMASTE

Dear Sir,

I am not very much familiar with Sanskrit pronunciation=
, so I started giving offerings to DURGA SAPTASLOKI followed by NAVARAN MAN=
TRA... eventually I added ARGALA STOTRA, DEVI SOOKTAM and the DEVI STHUTI..=
. still it is only approx 100 verse out of 700...now, the question is...whe=
ther this short procedure of CHANDI HOMAM(if u call it so!) is useful? Some=
times time is constraint... so I make offering to only SAPTASLOKI and NAVAR=
AN MANTRA only... whether it is useful too for the situation?

Please sugge=
st...

JAI MA

regards,
Biswajit
