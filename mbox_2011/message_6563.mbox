Namaste all, 

It is said in many places that before starting any sadhana o=
ne should definitely have a Guru or a Mental guru, otherwise the practise b=
ring bad results. 

If i recall correctly Narasimha had mentioned before th=
at some karmic burden occurs on Gurus part when some shishya starts a pract=
ice with that gurus name.

will appreciate if someone can explain on this.

regards
priyank
