Namaste Narasimha,

I have been thinking of doing Tarpan for quite some tim=
e, but i dont know the actual dates when i not supposed to use sesame seeds=
.

1. Is it fine if i do tarpan daily with sesame seeds, overlooking the da=
ys when its not supposed to be done? 
my reasoning is that the days when it=
 is supposed to be avoided will be very few in a year. I am not aware of si=
gnificance of those days and wethere its a strict rule.


2. In your TARPAN=
 manual you talked about
"Alternately, one can view this as an internal eve=
nt of satisfying and releasing an internal kaarmik predisposition. Ultimate=
ly, it is the latter. However, one needs to externalize first and perform e=
xternal rituals, while thinking of what it means internally."

You had writ=
ten about mental homam also, in case one is not able to engage in actual on=
e. 

a. Can one similary do a Tarpan mentally.

b. poorahuti means complete=
 surrender and one has to "actually feel it", tarpan means releasing an int=
ernal kaarmik predisposition. How/What does one "actually feel" while doing=
 this.


regards
priyank
