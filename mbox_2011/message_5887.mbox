Namaste,

I would like to know if ladies can recite rudra parayanam or it should be
done only with the help of priests?

i have observed that things are moving in a positive direction for me when
rudrabhishekam/rudra parayanam is performed  and  when any form of
jupiter is worshipped.

whenever i attended any pooja programme in a nearby mutt, elderly ladies
insisted me on reciting lalitha saharanamam than listening to rudra parayana
and the reason quoted was that lalitha is the feminine form of lord shiva
and its better for ladies to meditate on the her form.

KIndly clarify if there are any such restrictions for reciting rudra
parayanam

humble regards,
Bangaru
