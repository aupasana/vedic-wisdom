Namaste Ranga,

1)Point to Appendix C: Shodasopachara Pooja, Page 31 (engli=
sh) in the below link.
http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/ganapathi/maha_=
ganapati_homam_english.pdf

2)Refer Page-13 in the same link for Kalasa Sud=
dhi (water purification)

3&4) Please follow the below links:
http://www.ve=
dicastrologer.org/homam/ganapathi.htm
http://www.bellaterreno.com/art/a_rel=
igion/buddhism/buddhist_mudra.aspx

5)It is always better to go with possib=
le max number of counts with best focus, reciting 108 name-prayer one time =
with much focus is good rather many times without focus. My suggestion is t=
o forget about the number counts while chanting and try to focus as much as=
 you can.If you feel any divagation, try to set it back else move to the ne=
xt step of the homam.

All the best!

Best Regards,
Srini.
