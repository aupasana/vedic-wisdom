Namaste


1.Would it be possible for you to provide a pic or web link of an=
y pic
of Shri Nakhate Maharaj as I failed to find any.
2.It would be great =
if you can share some events or incidents of Shri
Nakhate Maharaj as I read=
 only about the diksha method of Manishji you
mentioned in a forum long tim=
e back
3.As far as I learnt the parampara Manishji or you are has a Shaktip=
at
tradition.Am I right?
Can you please say something about it
or if  you n=
ame any book regarding this lineage i.e. either about Shri
Tembe Swami or S=
hri Gulwani Maharaj .It would be very much helpful.

It would be unexpected=
ly marvellous if Manishji could share some of his
reminiscences.
