Dear Sri PVRji, 

While I truly enjoy your brilliant posts, with every pos=
t of yours, I get really disappointed that my questions never got your atte=
ntion in the recent past. I posted several times about lalitha/chandi conce=
pts and so on! Could you please shed light on those. For a quick recap, I r=
epost them here. 

Durga SapthaSathi does not talk about LalithaDevi or Bha=
ndasura. In which purana do they appear and what is the basis? I know it co=
mes in Brahmanda purana, but my question is if Lalitha Form is superior to =
Durga form or any confusion like that. I hope you understand my ramblings. =
What I observe is, it is south india we follow Lalitha worship a lot and in=
 the north this form is not that well known. Can you please shed some light=
 on this ! 

Nagraj

    =
  
      Namaste,



Pingala nadi (solar channel) is the channel of the hot=
 fire of 

discrimination. Ida nadi (lunar channel) is the channel of the s=
oothing 

comfort of feeling. The mantra you do and the praanaayaama you do=
 may 

have a small impact on which channel tends to open more, but the pri=
mary 

influence will be your basic attitude and aptitude. Ida nadi is more=
 

likely to open in a humble, emotional and relaxed person. Pingala nadi 
=

is more likely to open in a logical, analytical and intelligent person. 

=
Thus, targeting a nadi with praanaayaama and mantra does not add much 

val=
ue.



Gayatri mantra tends to open up Pingala more. Shiva mantras (e.g. 

=
Panchakshari) tend to open Ida more. However, it also depends on how you 

=
visualize your god. For example, does Shiva stand for a relaxed mahayogi 

=
in bliss to you or the fiery Rudra of destruction?



*        *        *

=


Moreover, the goal is not to make shakti flow through Ida or Pingala 

an=
yway. The goal is that shakti flows through Sushumna nadi in the 

middle. =
All the higher worlds and deities in them lie within Sushumna 

nadi. Depen=
ding on the nature of mantra and your nature, Ida or Pingala 

may open mor=
e and some vaayu may be flowing through it. But, when 

Kundalini gets awak=
ened oneday, Sushumna may also open and Kundalini may 

shoot up through Su=
shumna.



Many people referring to Kundalini in higher chakras/nadis are a=
ctually 

talking about the flow of vaayus there. Most people talking about=
 

Kundalini have not experienced Kundalini itself in higher chakras.



Ku=
ndalini shakti is one's self-awareness. Shakti meeting Shiva is a 

metapho=
r for individual self-awareness (shakti) merging in cosmic self 

(Shiva). =
A vaishnava may also view it as a Gopi meeting Krishna.



*        *      =
  *



Shakti will not rise unless one's awareness of physical body disappe=
ars. 

The instruction of some teachers to focus on a particular chakra or =
a 

particular body part to force Kundalini to rise is not wise. As long as=
 

you think "I am the body. Inside this body, there is a chakra or a body =


part. I will focus on that part inside this body", your self-awareness 

=
is unlikely to rise above the physical body. In other words, your 

Kundali=
ni is stuck in the mooladhara chakra corresponding to the 

physical realm.=




Wanting Kundalini to rise to X or Y chakra is unproductive. It never 

=
happens that way. Whenever I had expected or anticipated something, 

nothi=
ng happened. Things happened spontaneously only when my mind was 

nearly e=
mpty and the focus on mantra/god became so intense that it 

filled my mind=
. In fact, when I first experienced a Kundalini rise, I 

did not even know=
 much about Kundalini and chakras and considered all 

those concepts as di=
rty Tantrik ideas that I wanted to do have nothing 

to do with. Only after=
 experiencing did I understand what it was 

intellectually. Thus, intellec=
tual analysis of Kundalini and chakras and 

trying to manipulate them is u=
nnecessary and, in fact, 

counter-productive. If you want Kundalini to ris=
e, do not even think in 

terms of Kundalini and chakras.



*        *    =
    *



Kundalini rises when and only when your self-awareness rises above=
 the 

physical body. The key is to forget that you are the body. The key i=
s to 

NOT think that you are (or you are not) the body. The key is to forg=
et 

about the body completely. The key is to immerse the mind so deeply in=
 

the mantra/deity that you forget everything else.



And then patience. =
By being in a hurry that your Kundalini should rise, 

you will only ensure=
 that Kundalini remains in Mooladhara forever. As I 

said, stop thinking i=
n terms of shakti and chakras, if shakti were to 

really rise.
