The sannyasin has only three duties to perform, shaucha, bhiksha and dhyana=
. There is no fourth duty for a sannyasin. Meditation is his duty, meditati=
on is his food, meditation is his life. He lives meditation, breathes medit=
ation. He is ever intent upon the realization of the Supreme Brahman.

By r=
estraining the senses, by annihilating desire and aversion, by extending co=
mpassion to all creatures, by seeing the Eternal Being alone existing every=
where, a sannyasin attains immortality.

By means of yoga, a sannyasin shou=
ld comprehend the disembodied Self or the Supreme Brahman which runs throug=
h all creatures, good or bad, high or low. The all-pervasiveness of this in=
ner Self which spreads among all living and dead beings alike, is unintelli=
gible to the untrained and uncultured intellects; let the sannyasin witness=
 the majesty of this Existence-Knowledge-Bliss by means of profound meditat=
ion.
