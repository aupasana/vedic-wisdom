Namaste all, 

Sharing an excellent article, it covers a lot more than what=
 the title suggest. Nice analogies in between.

(A dialogue between His Holiness Sh=
ri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami and a Disciple): [His Holiness was the=
 Sringeri Mathadhipati 1912-1954.]
 
H.H. : I hope you are pursuing your st=
udies in the Vedanta as usual?
D. : Though not regularly, I do make some oc=
casional study.
H.H. : In the course of your studies, you may have come acr=
oss many doubts.
D. : Yes, one doubt repeatedly comes up to my mind.
H.H. :=
 What is it?
D. : It is the problem of the eternal conflict between fate an=
d free-will.
What are their respective provinces and how can the conflict b=
e avoided?
H.H. : If presented in the way you have done it, the problem wou=
ld baffle even the highest of thinkers.
D. : What is wrong with my presenta=
tion? I only stated the problem and did not even explain how I find it to b=
e a difficult one.
H.H. : Your difficulty arises in the very statement of t=
he problem. D. : How?
H.H. : A conflict arises only if there are two things=
. There can be no conflict if there is only one thing.
D. : But here there =
are two things, fate and free-will.
H.H. : Exacly. It is this assumption of=
 yours that is responsible for your problem.
D. : It is not my assumption a=
t all. How can I ignore the fact that the two things exist as independent f=
actors, whether I grant their existence or not?
H.H. : That is where you ar=
e wrong again.
D. : How?

H.H. : As a follower of our Sanatana Dharma, you =
must know that fate is nothing extraneous to yourself, but only the sum tot=
al of the results of your past actions. As God is but the dispenser of the =
fruits of actions, fate, representing those fruits, is not his creation but=
 only yours. Free-will is what you exercise when you act now.

D. : Still I=
 do not see how they are not two distinct things.
H.H. : Have it this way. =
Fate is past karma; free-will is present karma. Both are really one, that i=
s, karma, though they may differ in the matter of time. There can be no con=
flict when they are really one.

D. : But the difference in time is a vital=
 difference which we cannot possibly overlook.
H.H. : I do not want you to =
overlook it, but only to study it more deeply. The present is before you an=
d, by the exercise of free-will, you can attempt to shape it. The past is p=
ast and is therefore beyond your vision and is rightly called adrishta, the=
 unseen. You cannot reasonably attempt to find out the relative strength of=
 two things unless both of them are before you. But, by our very definition=
, free-will, the present karma, alone is before you and fate, the past karm=
a, is invisible. 

Even if you see two wrestlers right in front of you, you=
 cannot decide about their relative strength. For, one may have weight, the=
 other agility; one muscles and the other tenacity; one the benefit of
prac=
tice and the other coolness of judgment and so on. We can go on building ar=
guments on arguments to conclude that a particular wrestler will be the win=
ner.

But experience shows that each of these qualifications may fail at an=
y time or may prove to be a disqualification. The only practical method of =
determining their relative strength will be to make them
wrestle.

While th=
is is so, how do you expect to find by means of arguments a solution to the=
 problem of the relative value of fate and free-will when the former by its=
 very nature is unseen!

D. : Is there no way then of solving this problem?=

H.H. : There is this way. The wrestlers must fight with each other and pro=
ve which of them is the stronger.

D. : In other words, the problem of conf=
lict will get solved only at the end of the conflict. But at that time the =
problem will have ceased to have any practical significance.
H.H. : Not onl=
y so, it will cease to exist.
D. : That is, before the conflict begins, the=
 problem is incapable of solution; and, after the conflict ends, it is no l=
onger necessary to find a solution.
H.H. : Just so. In either case, it is p=
rofitless to embark on the enquiry as to the relative stregth of fate and f=
ree-will.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
D. : D=
oes Yor Holiness then mean to say that we must resign ourselves to fate?
H.=
H. : Certainly not. On the other hand, you must devote yourself to free-wil=
l.

D. : How can that be?
H.H. : Fate, as I told you, is the resultant of t=
he past exercise of your free-will. By exercising your free-will in the pas=
t, you brought on the resultant fate.
By exercising your free-will in the p=
resent, I want you to wipe out your past record if it hurts you, or to add =
to it if you find it enjoyable.
I any case. whether for acquiring more happ=
iness or for reducing misery. you have to exercise your free-will in the pr=
esent.

D. : But the exercise of free-will however well-directed, very ofte=
n fails to secure the desired result, as fate steps in and nullifies the ac=
tion of free-will.
H.H. : You are again ignoring our definition of fate. It=
 is not an extraneous and a new thing which steps in to nullify your free-w=
ill. On the other hand, it is already in yourself.

D. : It may be so, but =
its existence is felt only when it comes into conflict with free-will. How =
can we possibly wipe out the past record when we do not know nor have the m=
eans of knowing what it is?
H.H. : Except to a very few highly advanced sou=
ls, the past certainly remains unknown. But even our ignorance of it is ver=
y often an advantage to us. For, if we happen to know all the results we ha=
ve accumulated by our actions in this and our past lives, we will be so muc=
h shocked as to give up in despair any attempt to overcome or mitigate them=
. Even in this life, forgetfulnes is a boon which the merciful God has been=
 pleased to bestow on us, so that we may not be burdened at any moment with=
 a recollection of all that has happened in the past.

Similarly, the divin=
e spark in us is ever bright with hope and makes it possible for us to conf=
idently exercise our free-will. It is not for us to belittle the significan=
ce of these two boons--
forgetfulness of the past and hope for the future.
=

D. : Our ignorance of the past may be useful in not deterring the exercise=
 of the free-will, and hope may stimulate that exercise. All the same, it c=
annot be denied that fate very often does present a formidable obstacle in =
the way of such exercise.

H.H. : It is not quite correct to say that fate =
places obstacles in the way of free-will. On the other hand, by seeming to =
oppose our efforts, it tells us what is the extent of free-will that is nec=
essary now to
bear fruit.

Ordinarily for the purpose of securing a single =
benefit, a particular activity is prescribed; but we do not know how intens=
ively or how repeatedly that activity has to be pursued or pesisted in.

If=
 we do not succed at the very first attempt, we can easily deduce that in t=
he past we have exercised our free-will just in the opposite direction, tha=
t the resultant of that past activity has first to be eliminated and that o=
ur present effort must be proportionate to that past activity.

Thus, the o=
bstacle which fate seems to offer is just the gauge by which we have to gui=
de our present activities.

H.H. : The obstacle is seen only after the exer=
cise of our free-will; how can that help us to guide our activities at the =
start?
H.H. : It need not guide us at the start. At the start, you must not=
 be obsessed at all with the idea that there will be any obstacle in your w=
ay. Start with boundless hope and with the rpesumption that there is nothin=
g in the way of your exercising the free-will.

If you do not succeed, tell=
 yourself then that there has been in the past a counter-influence brought =
on by yourself by exercising your free-will in the other direction and, the=
refore, you must now exercise your free-will with re-doubled vogor and pers=
istence to achieve your object.

Tell yourself that, inasmuch as the seemin=
g obstacle is of your own making, it is certainly within your competence to=
 overcome it. If you do not succeed even after this renewed effort, there c=
an be absolutely no justification for despair, for fate being but a creatur=
e of your free-will can never be stronger than your free-will.

Your failur=
e only means that your present exercise of free-will is not sufficient to c=
ounteract the result of the past exercise of it.

In other words, there is =
no question of a relative proportion between fate and free-will as distinct=
 factors in life. The relative proportion is only as between the intensity =
of our past action and
the intensity of our present action.

D. : But even =
so, the relative intensity can be realised only at the end of our present e=
ffort in a particular direction. 
H.H. : It is always so in the case of eve=
rything which is adrishta or unseen. Take, for example, a nail driven into =
a wooden pillar. When you see it for the first time, you actually see, say,=
 an inch of it
projecting out of the pillar. The rest of it has gone into t=
he wood and you cannot now see what exact length of the nail is imbedded in=
 the wood. That length, therefore, is unseen or adrishta, so far as
you are=
 concerned. Beautifully varnished as the pillar is, you do not know what is=
 the composition of the wood in which the nail is driven. That also is unse=
en or adrishta.

Now, suppose you want to pull that nail out, can you tell =
me how many pulls will be necessary and how powerful each pull has to be?

=
D. : How can I? The number and the intensity of the pulls will depend upon =
the length which has gone into the wood.

H.H. : Certainly so. And the leng=
th which has gone into the wood is not arbitrary, but depended upon the num=
ber of strokes which drove it in and the intensity of each of such strokes =
and the resistance which the wood offered to them.
D. : It is so.
H.H. : Th=
e number and intensity of the pulls needed to take out the nail depend ther=
efore upon the number and intensity of the strokes which drove it in.
D. : =
Yes.
H.H. : But the strokes that drove in the nail are now unseen and unsee=
able.
They relate to the past and are adrishta.
D. : Yes.
H.H. : Do we stop=
 from pulling out the nail simply because we happen to be ignorant of the l=
ength of the nail in the wood or of the number and intensity of the strokes=
 which drove it in? Or, do we persist in
pulling it out by increasing our e=
ffort?
D. : Certainly, as practical men we adopt the latter course.
H.H. : =
Adopt the same course in every effort of yours. Exert yourself as much as y=
ou can. Your will must succeed in the end.

D. : But there certainly =
are many things which are impossible to attain even after the utmost exerti=
on.
H.H. : There you are mistaken. There is nothing which is really unattai=
nable. A thing, however, may be unattainable to us at the particular stage =
at which we are, or with the qualifications that we
possess. The attainabil=
ity or otherwise of a particular thing is thus not an absolute characterist=
ic of that thing but is relative and proportionate to our capacity to attai=
n it.

D. : The success or failure of an effort can be known definitely onl=
y at the end. How are we then to know beforehand whether with our present c=
apacity we may or may not exert ourselves to attain a
particular object, an=
d whether it is the right kind of exertion for the attainment of that objec=
t?

H.H. : Your question is certainly a pertinent one. The whole aim of our=
 Dharma Shastras is to give a detailed answer to your question. Religion do=
es not fetter man's free-will. It leaves him quite
free to act, but tells h=
im at the same time what is good for him and what is not.
The resposibility=
 is entirely and solely his. He cannot escape it by blaming fate, for fate =
is of his own making, nor by blaming God, for he is but the dispenser of fr=
uits in accordance with the merits of
actions. You are the master of your o=
wn destiny. It is for you to make it, to better it or to mar it. This is yo=
ur privilege. This is your responsibility.

D. : I quite realise this. But =
often it so happens that I am not really master of myself. I know, for inst=
ance, quite well that a particular act is wrong; at the same time, I feel i=
mpelled to do it. Similarly,
I know that another act is right; at the same =
time, however, I feel powerless to do it. It seems that there is some power=
 which is able to control or defy my free-will. So long as that power is po=
tent, how can I be called the master of my own destiny? What is that power =
but fate?

H.H. : You are evidently confusing together two distinct things.=
 Fate is a thing quite different from the other one which you call a power.=
 Suppose you handle an instrument for the first time. You will do it
very c=
lumsily and with great effort. The next time, however, you use it, you will=
 do so less clumsily and with less effort. With repeated uses, you will hav=
e learnt to use it easily and without any effort. That is, the facility and=
 ease with which you use a particular thing increase with the number of tim=
es you use it.

The first time a man steals, he does so with great effort a=
nd much fear; the next time both his effort and fear are much less. As oppo=
rtunities increase, stealing will become a normal habit with him and will r=
equire no effort at all. This habit will generate in him a tendency to stea=
l even when there is no  necessity to steal. It is this tendency which goes=
 by the name vasana. The power which makes you act as if against your will =
is only the vasana which itself is of your own making. This is not fate.

T=
he punishment or reward, in the shape of pain or pleasure, which is the ine=
vitable consequence of an act, good or bad, is alone the province of fate o=
r destiny.

The vasana which the doing of an act leaves behind in the mind =
in the shape of a taste, a greater facility or a greater tendency for doing=
 the same act once again, is quite a different thing. It may be that the pu=
nishment or the reward of the past act is, in ordinary circumstances, unavo=
idable, if there is no counter-effort; but the vasana can be easily handled=
 if only we exercise our free-will correctly.

D. : But the number of vasan=
as or tendencies that rule our hearts are endless. How can we possibly cont=
rol them?
H.H. : The essential nature of a vasana is to seek expression in =
outward acts. This characteristic is common to all vasanas, good and bad. T=
he stream of vasanas, the vasana sarit, as it is called, has two
currents, =
the good and the bad.

If you try to dam up the entire stream, there mey be=
 danger. The Shastras, therefore, do not ask you to attempt that. On the ot=
her hand, they ask you to submit yourself to be led by the good vasana curr=
ent and to resist being led away by the bad vasana current.

When you know =
that a particular vasana is rising up in your mind, you cannot possibly say=
 that you are at its mercy. You have your wits about you and the responsibi=
lity of deciding whether you will encourage it or not is entirely yours. Th=
e Shastras ennciate in detail what vasanas are good and
have to be encourag=
ed and what vasanas are bad and have to beovercome.

When, by dint of pract=
ice, you have made all your vasanas good and practically eliminated the cha=
rge of any bad vasanas leading you astray, the Shastras take upon themselve=
s the function of teaching you how to free your free-will even from the nee=
d of being led by good vasanas.

You will gradually be led on to a stage wh=
en your free-will be entirely free from any sort of coloring due to any vas=
anas. 

At that stage, your mind will be pure as crystal and all motive for=
 particular action will cease to be. Freedom from the results of particular=
 actions is an inevitable consequence. Both fate and vasana disappear. Ther=
e is freedom for ever more and that freedom is called Moksha.
