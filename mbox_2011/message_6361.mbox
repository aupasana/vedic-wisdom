Dear Shri Narshimaha,

A question is raised by my freind that the Tarpan be=
 performed by a person who lost his parents/ specially father and as per hi=
m in the Garud Puran it is mentioned that the first Tarpan be given to the =
father of the person doing the Tarpan. 

Since I am not well versed with Ga=
rud Puran, therefore this request for clarification. 

I am confident that =
per mannual of Pitri Tarpan irrespective of ones parent are alive or otherw=
ise, one has to perform it.

regards

Ganesh Gulati
