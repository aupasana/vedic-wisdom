Namaste,
=C2=A0
Eclipses last a couple of =
hours or may be 3 hours (today's eclipse was a really big one and lasted 3.=
5 hours). If you can't fast, don't fast. Plan such that you eat 1-2 hours b=
efore eclipse (depending on how fast you digest food) and eat when eclipse =
ends. This means a 3-5 hours gap between two meals. That's not really fasti=
ng.
=C2=A0
External Sun and Moon have resonance to Sun and Moon inside us. =
That is why their state has some effect on us. For example, some people's m=
oods were found to correlate to Moon's phase in some studies. Some people w=
ith mental disturbances act differently around full Moon and new Moon days.=

=C2=A0
Sun facilitates the digestion of food and Moon the absorption and n=
ourishment. When they are afflicted, internal Sun and Moon will also be a l=
ittle weak. It is not that anybody eating during eclipse gets sick, but the=
 probability of indigestion or bad digestion that causes long-term problems=
 is 1,000 times (not an accurate assessment) during an eclipse.
=C2=A0
One =
more thing is that digestion peaks at mid-day and becomes weak at night. Th=
at's because Sun is invisible.
=C2=A0
Similarly, there is an internal day/n=
ight based on whether right nostril (Sun) or left nostril (Moon) is more op=
en. They alternate every 1.5 hours on average. Food eaten during Sun's port=
ion gets digested better. If you must eat during Moon's portion, eat a litt=
le less and eat food easier to digest.
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
