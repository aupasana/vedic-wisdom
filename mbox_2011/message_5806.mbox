Mr. Priya,
If you=B4re feeling this strong negative realities, its because =

you=B4re beginning to feel the unity of God in everyone as you already rea=
lized. 
But do not be distracted by deluded negative or positive realms, ev=
en in dreams. 
Experiment it, then realize its only a manifestation of Maya=
, it=B4s not what 
we truly are. Do as Guru Sri Ramana Maharishi teached us=
: " I=B4m not this,Who am 
I?" . Try to remember Lord Shiva during this exp=
eriences, He will show Himself 
in all of His grace and compassion. Realize=
 that everything is God, beyond the 
idea of duality.. No good or bad thing=
s exists, only in our mind.

I=B4m sorry for my poor english. I=B4m very ig=
norant, but I have come to have the 
same experiences as you. So that=B4s w=
hy I decided to post a reply. The most 
important thing is to realize non d=
uality in every moment of your life, and 
feel immense love and affection f=
or everyone and everything. This can purify 
your mind and take you to anot=
her level of perception, closer and closer to God.

I apologize to everyone=
, for any errors I have made during this post. Please 
correct me,but as I =
got through the same experiences as Mr. Priya, I felt I 
should share what =
I have lived so far.

May you be free of any kind of hindrance of mind, and=
 may you dive into the 
ocean of Brahma as fast as a lightning, bringing be=
nefit and wisdom to everyone 
around you through your Love and virtues!!!

=
With Love, 

Andre
