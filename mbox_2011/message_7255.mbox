Dear Dr. Hramalini and others participating in this discussion thread,

Wow=
! Good to read your experiences. Since 2009, I am regularly doing tarpana
e=
very amavasya and every day of pitrupaksha but havent got any dreams like
y=
ou!

But that is not important. I guess that the first time one starts doin=
g
tarpana, one generally gets some sort of positive indications. The key is=

not to get distracted by these indications and focus on doing the tarpanam=

with sincerity and devotion.

Just wondering why it is not advisable for t=
he sesame seeds to germinate? I
suppose Nature knows best what to do with o=
ur offerings and therefore we
shouldnt worry that much.

best regards
Hari
