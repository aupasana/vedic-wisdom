It may be argued that the ignorant, seeing that their obligations are not d=
ischarged, cannot turn sannyasins. This is not right, for there can be no o=
bligation incurred before one enters the order of a householder. According =
to the text, =E2=80=9CLet one leave his home for the forest, and become a s=
annyasin, even if he is a brahmacharin; let him immediately turn a sannyasi=
n, either from home or from the forest.=E2=80=9D The order of the sannyasin=
 is enjoined even on one who is in the householder=E2=80=99s order. 
We rea=
d in the Chandogya Upanishad also that in the case of some people performan=
ce of agnihotra for twelve days, and subsequent renunciation, is enjoined. =
As for the argument that the order of a sannyasin is only for those who are=
 unable to perform karma, we say, it is unsound; as, in their case, there i=
s the separate text of the sruti, =E2=80=9CHe who has discontinued the fire=
 or never maintained it,=E2=80=9D etc. If you say that it is immaterial whe=
ther one lives in his house or in the forest, we say, it is fallacious. Sel=
f-denial alone being the matter of course with him, he cannot stay in the h=
ouse as that is prompted by desire, and self-denial is mere absence of it. =
Acting recklessly is entirely out of question with regard to the man of kno=
wledge, for that is known to be the way of extremely ignorant persons.
Ther=
efore the text =E2=80=9COnly doing karma, one should wish to live a hundred=
 years=E2=80=9D has been refuted by showing that the text applies to the ig=
norant, and that karma cannot coexist with knowledge.
