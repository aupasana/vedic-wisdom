Namaste Anoop,

Interesting  you ask this question about vairagya! Swami S=
ivananda has written 
an  entire book on this subject, "How to get Vairagya=
"!

http://www.dlshq.org/download/vairagya.htm

A couple of quotes from the=
 book:

What vairagya is not: 

 "Vairagya does not mean abandoning social =
duties and responsibilities of life. 
It does   not mean detachment from th=
e world. It does not mean a life in the 
solitary caves of the   Himalayas =
or in the crematorium. It does not mean living 
on Nim-leaves, cow's urine =
and   dung. It does not mean wearing of matted-hair 
and a Kamandal made of=
 fence-gourd or   coconut shell in the band. It does not 
mean shaving of h=
ead and throwing of clothes. "

What vairagya is:

"Vairagya is mental deta=
chment from all connections with the world. That is all. 
A man   may live =
in the world and discharge all the duties of his order and 
stage of life w=
ith   perfect detachment. He may be a householder. What if? He 
may live wi=
th family and   children. But at the same time he may have perfect 
mental =
detachment. He can do his   spiritual Sadhana. That man who has perfect 
me=
ntal detachment while remaining in the world   is a hero indeed. He is much=
 
better than a Sadhu living in the Himalayan caves because the   former ha=
s to 
face the innumerable temptations of life every moment."

I  hope you =
find the book helpful in your pursuit of vairagya. If you do,  and 
want a =
daily dose of Swami Sivananda's teachings!, I would suggest  you join the 
=
Yahoo group

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sivanandadaily/

The  files sect=
ion of the group has a lot of his teachings in pdf format  (some 
of them o=
ut of print and/or not freely available on the internet). The  "Sadhana 
To=
ols" folder has practical instructions that I am sure you will find quite 
=
useful!

sincerely,
Chandraprakash

tman and maya (RE: Sannyas by Swami 
Sivananda Part 37)

  
Dear respected =
sirs,

Real sanyasa is a condition of the mind. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=
, despite 
taking sanyasa got married and never retired into solitude and y=
et maintained 
the kind of purity and vairagyam impossible for even any oth=
er ochre-donned 
sanyasi. 


My questions to you dear sirs is, for someone =
who has the information that the 
path of karma and jnana are jointly neede=
d to reach the supreme end, how may we 
attain the mental state of sanyasa =
while still remaining in this world? The 
sensory attractions by no small m=
eans induce passion in place of the goal which 
is vairagya. My humble requ=
est is to please share how we may be able to "fight" 
or overcome this sens=
ual attractions and attain to real vairagya so that we may 
attain our desi=
red spiritual end? 


Regards,
Anoop.

Realization is the right=

literally without kn=
owing the time, place and circumstances when those words 
were spoken.
In o=
ne of the brahmacharya classes, SrilaPrabhupad mentions that "one has to 
a=

were taken out of context and some people went on to say that SP was a ma=

chauvinist :-)
Like SriVidyaPrakasanandagiri Swamiji of SukaBrahmasrama=
m in SriKalahasti 
mentioned, Janaka maharaj, who is not a sanyasi literall=
y, must have been an 
extremely great realized soul and hence a great renun=
ciate, else which all great 
names were mentioned the Gita apart from King =
Janaka? Why would Lord Vishnu's
