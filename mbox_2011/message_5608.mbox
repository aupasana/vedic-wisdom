what u say is true,but evolution is also true=
.

the purush sukta is used by people to propogate
casteism and destroy dha=

being born into a brahmin family i hv experienced
this first hand.

w=

hma
is truth.

man is not created by any jehova/allah to worship him exclus=
ively
nor being mnoatheist is superior,same way being brahmin or any
caste =
is not superior or inferior.

let us accept truth of evolution and strive f=
or a casteless and spiritual
world
where hatebased belief like monoatheism =

When Purusha=
 sookta says that Brahmana is from the mouth of Purusha (supreme cosmic bei=
ng), kshatriya is from the arms etc, it is not wrong. Please note two thing=
s here:<br>
 <br>
(1) Varna as I said before is not to be decided solely ba=
sed on birth. It is based on one's skills, aptitude and work. Family an=
d environment in which one grows up influences one's value system, skil=
ls and aptitude, but does not necessarily determine it. You cannot apply to=
day's rigid caste system where shudras and even chandalas call themselv=
es as braahmanas and kshatriyas to the Purusha sookta hymn.<br>

 <br>
(2) =
It is not that mouth and arms are auspicious parts and feet are inauspiciou=
s. Each part simply plays a different role. Mouth cannot support your weigh=
t and make you walk and foot cannot speak.<br>
 <br>
Similarly, braahmanas =
or those who pursue knowledge and wisdom share their wisdom with others and=
 guide others and that is why they are compared to the mouth of god, which =
speaks. Kshatriyas use their power and protect others and that is why they =
are compared to the arms of god. Shudras do all the necessary hard work to =
keep the society running and that is why they are compared to feet. Nobody =
is more important or less important.<div class=3D"im">
