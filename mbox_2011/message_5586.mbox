Hari Om Tat Sat

Most humble pranams to all devotees of the Lord that are r=
eading this post. I am currently studying vedic chanting and I have found s=
ome Audios and Lyrics of some of them, but then sometimes I have found only=
 Lyrics or only Audio for some of the Vedic Hymns.

I was wondering if any =
of you could share some audios and/or lyrics of Vedic Hymns such as "sarasv=
ati suktam, ganesha suktam, maha narayana upanishad, maha mantra pushpam, l=
aghunyasah..." Im particullary interested in lyrics in devanagari so I can =
verify the pronunciation of every letter.

Thanks in advance,
Ivan
