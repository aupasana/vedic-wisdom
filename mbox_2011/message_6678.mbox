Hello

Even i suffer form OCD and in that process i ended up learning a hel=
l lot of
things from bach flower, homeopathy, reiki, Jinshinjyustsu.

My ad=
vise
1. Leave all the theory aside, mind is a monkey and it will jump over,=
 so you dotn have to follow any thought. OCD means a compulsive monkey.

2.=
 Do 20 min homam daily, pick ur favourite god, choose one simple mantra, of=
fer in fire atleast 108 times with full love and devotion. Do it regularly =
for 3-4 months

3. Choose a good homeopathy. there is a site abchomeoapthy =
where
brisbanehomeopath gives free consultations and you can post ur querie=
s daily, he will help you out.

4. Bach flower remedies for OCD is combinat=
ion of Cherryplum + Whitechestnut. if you want detailed analysis respond on=
 my personal id.

5. Join a group lalkitab_remedies and post your birth det=
ails, remedies for your problems as per your chart will be given. 

6. Your=
 reality is reflection of your karma, with medicines you can contorl and ch=
ange it upto a certain extent. Only with intense sadhana you can change you=
r Karma and reality itself. such is the power of intense sadhana. 20-30min =
of homam is indeed equivalent to 4-5hrs of intense meditation. PVR said thi=
s some time back, i doubted it at that time but when i did it i realised it=
 was correct.

regards
priyank
