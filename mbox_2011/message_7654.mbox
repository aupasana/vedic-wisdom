Namaste,

Dara Shikoh was the eldest son of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and his wife 
Mumtaz Mahal (in whose honor Shah Jahan built Taj Mahal). He was a 
spiritually elevated soul. He believed that search for god was the same 
all over the world through ages and believed that correct answers were 
found by great seers in various parts of the world at various times. As 
these findings are often expressed allegorically, understanding any 
single version becomes tough but putting multiple versions together 
gives better insight.

He studied under Sufi Islamic saints and also studied Hindu scriptures. 
He put them together and tried to find some common ground. His 
conclusions were recorded in "Majma ul-Bahrain" (The Mingling of Two 
Oceans). He detailed the similarities between Vedantic and Sufi notions 
of the Absolute Truth.

He learnt Sanskrit and, taking help from scholars and ascetics of 
Varanasi, translated 52 Upanishads, Yoga Vasishtham and Bhagavad Gita 
(what a wonderful and thoughtful selection!) into the Persian language. 
He believed that Upanishads are the book referred to in Quran as Kitab 
al-Maknun (The Hidden Book)!

He saw this as his mission and spent much of his time and energy in this 
translation effort. As though this was indeed what he was born for, his 
life ended a couple of years after he finished this work. He was 
persecuted by the clergy and his younger brother Aurangazeb and was 
executed.

Interestingly, his work served an important purpose. Apart from laying 
foundation for an integration of Hindu and Muslim philosophies, it was 
the first step in awakening the Western intellectual circles to the 
wisdom of Vedanta. Twelve years after his death, a French visitor took 
the Persian translation to France and that laid the foundation for 
awakening European interest in Indian philosophy.

Had he become the Mughal emperor, which was expected at some stage, 
world history would have been so different. His ambitious younger 
brother Aurangazeb did some machinations and won the throne finally. 
Again, had he left Dara Shikoh alone and enjoyed the throne, world 
history would have been so different. He made the singular sin of 
killing Dara Shikoh. Dara Shikoh was not a normal soul and this Brahma 
Hatya was a terrible sin. The weight of such a huge sin was needed to 
pull down a strong empire. Mughal empire fell soon.

We do not know the divine plan fully. We need to play our role as we see 
it in this divine drama and trust the director (god) to have a solid 
script that ties everything together!

Best regards,
Narasimha
