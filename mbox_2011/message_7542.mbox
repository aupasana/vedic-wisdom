offer more coconut pieces during uttarangam. in purnahuti, you can think of=
 offering "whole Dry coconut" which is available in the market. cut the who=
le coconut in 2 halves (serves 2 purposes -you can check if the cocnut is n=
ot rotten from inside) & you can then tie up both the halves, with a thread=
 used in holy rituals,after filling it with some offerings.

ill surel increase your meditation time to atleast half an hour. if whole d=
