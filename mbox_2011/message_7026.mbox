THE SWAMI                        It is indeed no easy thing to dedicate
on=
eself heart and soul

                                                to th=
e Lord.Many people
say:  "I have surrendered myself,

                     =
                           my all, to God. I am
doing as He is making me do=
".But if

                                                we observe their =
life,we
shall see that their actions are

                                 =
               quite contrary to what
they profess .If they do anything

  =
                                              good, they take the
credit to=
 themselves, feel highly elated

                                          =
      over it, and think: "Oh,
what a great thing I have achieved!"

      =
                                          But when even a slight
trouble be=
sets them, they

                                                immediatel=
y throw the
blame on the Lord, saying:"What a

                            =
                    great  misfortune He is
bringing on me!" This is how mo=
st
                                                people spend life.
