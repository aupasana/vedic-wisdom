Namaste,

I want to do the holy thread ceremony for my son this year in summer
after June 17th when his school
year is over. Based on different panchanga styles it seems
dakshinayanam starts either on June 22nd
or July 14th and I think it is recommended to do the thread ceremony
only in Uttarayanam.
Can you please guide me if I can use the July 14th date as it gives me
more choices to find
a date for the ceremony.  I felt it is ok to ask you on this topic on
this forum as it relates to
brahmopadesham.

thank you.
