Narasimhaji,

Namaste!

The diamond analogy is beautiful and explained so l=
ucidly. 

Due to my limited ability to understand well, one question arises=
 in my mind, which is, how would one explain this for someone who prays to =
multiple deities instead of only one deity and feels at peace after such wo=
rship/sadhana? I have moved from one deity to another in the last few years=
 (more so due to different states I found myself in in material terms- care=
er problem, delayed marriage, dispute with familial relationships, which so=
mehow inspired/deluded me to change the object of my worship for smooth mat=
erial existence- hence a very selfish motive/purpose) and many times I did =
experience peace of mind while worshipping a particular deity, but still sh=
ifted due to reasons explained above. Now, I find myself worshipping many d=
eities daily (although quality of time/devotion to each would be less than =
if praying to only one deity), but I somehow feel good about it everyday, a=
nd have started to connect with a few out of many. Some could say, maybe I =
am moving ahead in my journey, and one fine day, I will relate most emphati=
cally with only one deity, and then progress thereon. While, another way to=
 look at it could be that I am relating to some deity due to my long-term c=
onnection (worship to) with that deity, while connecting with another deity=
 as that could be my saviour at present times? (I somehow feel that after I=
 started to worship a particular deity in the not-so-distant past, and felt=
 positive, energized and hopeful during my worship, my situation improved m=
aterially after a really long period of time, but maybe it is temporary?) I=
 apologize if all this sounds foolish or if I am not making sense. I really=
 wish to understand from more elevated beings, such as you. Apart from my e=
xample, Mr. Nagraj Kota has also mentioned in this same thread that he also=
 worships multiple deities as part of his daily sadhana and does not find i=
t confusing that one form is different form another. With Mother's grace, h=
e is seemingly at a better place than I am (spiritually speaking) and I wis=
h and pray his beautiful journey continues and culminates ever more beautif=
ully. For a confused person like me, how could one explain this from the di=
amond analogy?

Just one more question, in the diamond analogy thread, you =
have mentioned that Vishnu represents the Sattva quality of the Supreme Cos=
mic Being, so by that concept, Vashnavi (Maa Lakshmi) would also represent =
the Sattva quality of the Divine Mother? However, yesterday I read someplac=
e while reading about the Divine Mother (since I wanted to read more to sui=
tably prepare/energize myself for the Navratris that started today) that du=
ring the Navratris, at some places (seemingly in South India), the first th=
ree days are devoted to Maa Kali, the next three days to Maa Lakshmi, and t=
he last three days to Maa Saraswati, and that this is how, the divine energ=
y works within us, i.e, first it destroys the evil tendencies within us (ta=
masic represented by Maa Kali), then it provides us with spiritual wealth, =
abundance and prosperity (rajasic represented by Maa Lakshmi), and finally =
it grants the truly liberating Supreme self knowledge leading to Moksha (sa=
ttvic represented by Maa Saraswati) In this concept, the divine energy repr=
esenting the sattvic quality differs from the one deduced from the diamond =
example. Could you please throw some light on this as well? 

The above may=
 sound superficial questions, and not really relevant to a more evolved sad=
haka, however, given my current stage, I will be able to satisfypacify thes=
e questions/doubts and move forward in my journey more peacefully.

Hope th=
e Divine Mother grants you all that you wish for, provided, there is anythi=
ng you wish for, but also (selfishly) hope that by then you would have shar=
ed your insights and illuminated many more around you.

Kind regards,
Manis=
