Dear Sir,

Yes, it can be a taxing sadhana. A proper ChandiPath takes 2/3 h=
ours or more with reasonable meditation.I spend five and half hours in trav=
elling to and from office everyday in over crowded trains and terrible and =
stressful traffic jams, and then fight for time to squeeze in my daily homa=
s. 

You can try doing a full Chandipath one day a week, say Saturday or Tu=
esday. Or do one full Chandipath on every astami/amavashya tithi. Whatever =
is comfortably possible for you. It is better to do one focused and detaile=
d Chandipath a week, then a hurried, unfocused, scrambled path every day (m=
y view). Else, you can try doing a set of chapters which appeal to you dail=
y basis and do the full path for 1 day a week on once in 14 days. As your m=
ind finds suitable. 

When I am short of time but I feel like doing some pa=
rts of the Chandi, I chant the madhyamacharitra (2,3,4). Or 1,4,7,11. Simil=
arly you can take a set you find comfortable and do it daily, while on week=
ends do a full path. You decide what is best for you.

-Regards

Dear Rajarshi, 
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I co=
mpletely agree with you that Chandipath is a wonderful sadhana and I am sta=
ting this with personal experience. Around Navaratri this year I have compl=
eted a 108 times recitation of chandipath over two/three months and that wa=
s indeed one of the best periods of my life so far. Although there is nothi=
ng that manifested in terms of material benefits, my overall mood was prett=
y elevated/calm most of the time. After that, however I am not able to prac=
tise it so much and I don't enjoy that same bliss anymore. But whenever I d=
o Chandipath, that day in general my mental state is pretty calm. However, =
it is a tough sadhana to do everyday. The Path alone takes around an hour t=
o recite, that too if you superfast, which you are not supposed to, accordi=
ng to the book. If you recite at comfortable speed, it takes around 1 hour =
20 minutes just for the 13 chapters. Add the kavacham, argala, keelaka, rat=
risuktam, artharvaseersham before and devi sooktam, three
 rahasyams, ksham=
a prathana and siddha kunjika strotram you are taking 2 to 2.5 hours. For m=
e that seems impossible on a daily basis. So, I=C2=A0have tried to do 2/3 c=
hapters a day for daily practise but that does not give me the same bliss t=
hat I enjoy when I do the whole thing. So, I don't know how to practise thi=
s regularly on a permanent basis. Any inputs from you?
