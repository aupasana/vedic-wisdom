 SRI BHAGAVAN WARNED the hearers against the mistake of disparaging a jnani=

for his apparent conduct and again cited the story of Parikshit.

He was a=
 still born child. The ladies cried and appealed to Sri Krishna to
save the=
 child. The sages round about wondered how Krishna was going to save
the ch=
ild from the effects of the arrows (apandavastra) of Asvattama.
Krishna sai=
d,=E2=80=9CIf the child be touched by one eternally celibate
(nityabramacha=
ri) the child would be brought to life.=E2=80=9D Even Suka dared not
touch =
the child. Finding no one among the reputed saints bold enough to
touch the=
 child, Krishna went and touched it, saying, =E2=80=9CIf I am eternally
cel=
ibate (nityabramachari) may the child be brought to life.=E2=80=9D The chil=
d
began to breathe and later grew up to be Parikshit.

Just consider how Kr=
ishna surrounded by 16,000 gopis is a brahmachari! Such
is the mystery of j=
ivanmukti! A jivanmukta is one who does not see anything
separate from the =
Self.
