Since i am keenly bent on finding the benefits of existence, i would like i=
nputs from people who know the vedas/scripts/vedantas if there is any answe=
r for the following question.

What is the benefit of existence compared to=
 non existence?

What was the purpose/reason/logic to introduce duality (Sh=
akthi & Shiva)?

When the proposed highest purpose of human life is to atta=
in bliss (brahman) again a state of nothing and everything as per the vedas=
, is the play of shakthi and shiva in this world purposeless?

Note: obviou=
sly when i mean purpose/reason/logic i am not asking it in the perspective =
of humans. All the above questions obviously cannot be answered by humans a=
s we lack the perspective of higher beings. Hence if anyone knows any answe=
r/explanation/lack of explanation briefed in the vedas/scripts/vedantas ple=
ase share.
