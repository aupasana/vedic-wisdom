=C2=A0 
Dear Rajarshi, 


I complet=
ely agree with you that Chandipath is a wonderful sadhana and I am 
stating=
 this with personal experience. Around Navaratri this year I have 
complete=
d a 108 times recitation of chandipath over two/three months and that 
was =
indeed one of the best periods of my life so far. Although there is nothing=
 
that manifested in terms of material benefits, my overall mood was pretty=
 
elevated/calm most of the time. After that, however I am not able to prac=
tise it 
so much and I don't enjoy that same bliss anymore. But whenever I =
do Chandipath, 
that day in general my mental state is pretty calm. However=
, it is a tough 
sadhana to do everyday. The Path alone takes around an hou=
r to recite, that too 
if you superfast, which you are not supposed to, acc=
ording to the book. If you 
recite at comfortable speed, it takes around 1 =
hour 20 minutes just for the 13 
chapters. Add the kavacham, argala, keelak=
a, ratrisuktam, artharvaseersham 
before and devi sooktam, three rahasyams,=
 kshama prathana and siddha kunjika 
strotram you are taking 2 to 2.5 hours=
. For me that seems impossible on a daily 
basis. So, I=C2=A0have tried to =
do 2/3 chapters a day for daily practise but that 
does not give me the sam=
e bliss that I enjoy when I do the whole thing. So, I 
don't know how to pr=
actise this regularly on a permanent basis. Any inputs from 
you?

Nagraj
