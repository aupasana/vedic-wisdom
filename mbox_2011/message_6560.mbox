Namaste Sir,

I checked and confirmed that this was a mistake made by me. Though 
salilam (flowing water) is also meaningful, the traditional version IS 
satilam (with sesame) as you gentlemen pointed out. I will be correcting 
it in the manuals soon. Thank you very much to you two and also the 
priest you talked to.

Thanking humbly,
Narasimha
