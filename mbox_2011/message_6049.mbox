Sadhana for Ten Days

by Swami Sivananda

You can do this during Christmas =
holidays or Puja holidays or summer vacation. Shut yourself up in an airy r=
oom. Do not talk to anybody. Do not see anybody. Do not hear anything. Get =
up at 4 a.m. Start Japa of the Mantra of your Ishta Devata or your Guru Man=
tra and finish it at sunset. Then take some milk and fruits or Kheer (milk =
and rice boiled with sugar). Take rest for one or two hours but continue th=
e Japa. Then again start Japa seriously. Retire to bed at 11 in the night. =
You can combine meditation along with Japa. Make all arrangements for bath,=
 food, etc, inside the room. Have two rooms if you can manage, one for bath=
 and the other for meditation. Repeat this four times in a year. This pract=
ice can be kept up even for 40 days. You will have wonderful results and va=
rious experiences. You will enter into Samadhi. You will have Darshan of yo=
ur Ishtam. I assure you.
