Phenomenon called apoptosis says =E2=80=9CFor every cell there is a time to=
 live
and a time to die.=E2=80=9D

Apoptosis is programmed cell death, and =
although we don=E2=80=99t realize it, each
of us has been dying every day, =
right on schedule, in order to remain
alive. Cells die because they want to=
. The cell carefully reverses the
birth process: It shrinks, it destroys it=
s basic proteins, and then it goes
on to dismantle its own DNA.Bubbles appe=
ar on the surface membrane as the
cell opens its portals to the outside wor=
ld and expels
every vital chemical, to finally be swallowed up by the body=
=E2=80=99s white cells
exactly as they would devour an invading microbe. Wh=
en the process is
complete, the cell has dissolved and leaves no trace behi=
nd.

When we read this graphic account of a cell sacrificing itself so
meth=
odically, you can=E2=80=99t help being touched. Yet the mystical part is st=
ill
to come. Apoptosis isn=E2=80=99t a way to get rid of sick or old cells,=
 as you
might suppose. The process gave us birth. As embryos in the womb, e=
ach of
us passed through primitive stages of development when we had tadpol=
e
tails, fishlike gills, webbing between our fingers, and most surprisingly=
,
too many brain cells. Apoptosis took care of these unwanted vestiges=E2=
=80=94in the
case of the brain, a newborn baby forms proper neural connecti=
ons by
removing the excess brain tissue that we were all born with. (It cam=
e as a
surprise when neurologists discovered that our brains contain the mo=
st
cells at birth, a number which gets whittled down by the millions so tha=
t
higher intelligence can forge its delicate web of connections. It was lon=
g
thought that killing off brain cells was a pathological process associate=
d
with aging. Now the whole issue must be reconsidered.)

Apoptosis doesn=
=E2=80=99t end in the womb, however. Our bodies continue to thrive
on death=
. The immune cells that engulf and consume invading bacteria would
turn on =
the body=E2=80=99s own tissues if they didn=E2=80=99t induce death in each =
other
and then turn on themselves with the same poisons used against invade=
rs.
Whenever any cell detects that its DNA is damaged or defective, it know=
s
that the body will suffer if this defect is
passed on. Fortunately, every=
 cell carries a poison gene known as p53 that
can be activated to make itse=
lf die.

These few facts barely scratch the surface. Anatomists long ago kn=
ew that
skin cells die every few days;that retinal cells, red blood cells, =
and
stomach cells also are programmed with specific short life spans so tha=
t
their tissues can be quickly replenished. Each dies for its own unique
re=
ason. Skin cells have to be sloughed off so that our skin remains supple,
w=
hile stomach cells die as part of the potent chemical combustion that
diges=
ts food.

Death cannot be our enemy if we have depended upon it from the wo=
mb.
Consider the following irony.As it turns out, the body is capable of ta=
king
a vacation from death by producing cells that decide to live forever. =
These
cells don=E2=80=99t trigger p53 when they detect defects in their own=
 DNA. And by
refusing to issue their own death warrants, these cells divide=
 relentlessly
and invasively. Cancer, the most feared of
diseases, is the b=
ody=E2=80=99s vacation from death, while programmed death is its
ticket to =
life. This is the paradox of life and death confronted head on.
The mystica=
l notion of dying every day turns out to be the body=E2=80=99s most
concret=
e fact.

What this means is that we are exquisitely sensitive to the balanc=
e of
positive and negative forces, and when the balance is tipped, death is=
 the
natural response. Nietzsche once remarked that humans are the only
cre=
atures who must be encouraged to stay alive. He couldn=E2=80=99t have known=
 that
this is literally true.Cells receive positive signals that tell them =
to
stay alive=E2=80=94chemicals called growth factors. If these positive si=
gnals are
withdrawn, the cell loses its will to live. Like the Mafia=E2=80=
=99s kiss of death,
the cell can also be sent messengers that bind to its o=
uter receptors to
signal that death has arrived=E2=80=94these chemical mess=
engers are actually known
as =E2=80=9Cdeath activators.=E2=80=9D

A Harvard=
 Medical School professor had discovered an amazing fact. There is
a substa=
nce that causes cancer cells to activate new blood vessels so that
they
can=
 get food. Medical research has focused on finding out how to block this
un=
known substance so that malignant growths can be deprived of nutrients
and =
thus killed. The professor discovered that the exact opposite substance
cau=
ses toxemia in pregnant women, a potentially fatal disorder in which the
bl=
ood vessels are =E2=80=9Cunhappy=E2=80=9D that they are undergoing normal p=
rogrammed cell
death. =E2=80=9CYou realize what this means?=E2=80=9D he sai=
d with deep awe. =E2=80=9CThe body can
trigger chemicals in a balancing act=
 between life and death, and yet
science has totally ignored who is doing t=
he balancing. Doesn=E2=80=99t the whole
secret of health lie in that part o=
f ourselves, not in the chemicals being
used?=E2=80=9D The fact that consci=
ousness could be the missing ingredient, theX
factor behind the scenes, cam=
e to him as a revelation.

Apoptosis rescues us from fear, I think. The dea=
th of a single cell makes
no difference to the body.What counts is not the =
act but the plan=E2=80=94an
overarching design that brings the balance of p=
ositive and negative signals
that every cell responds to. The plan is beyon=
d time because it dates to
the very construction of time. The plan is beyon=
d space because it is
everywhere in the body and yet nowhere=E2=80=94every =
cell as it dies takes the plan
with it, and yet the plan survives.

So afte=
r seeing Apoptosis At Work No one can really remain a materialist.
