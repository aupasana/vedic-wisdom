 The subject of silence and the thought-free state came up again after
Bhag=
avan had cited, with great approval, a passage by Gandhi in which the
latte=
r had given a description of his own experience of this state:

Sri Bhagava=
n referred to the following passage of Gandhiji in the Harijan of
the 11th =
instant:

=E2=80=98How mysterious are the ways of God! This journey to Rajk=
ot is a wonder even
to me. Why am I going, whither am I going? What for? I =
have thought nothing
about these things. And if God guides me, what should =
I think, why should I
think? Even thought may be an obstacle in the way of =
His guidance.

=E2=80=98The fact is, it takes no effort to stop thinking. T=
he thoughts do not come.
Indeed, there is no vacuum =E2=80=93 but I mean to=
 say that there is no thought
about the mission.=E2=80=99

Sri Bhagavan rem=
arked how true the words were and emphasised each statement
in the extract.=
 Then he cited Thayumanavar in support of the state which is
free from thou=
ghts:

The state in which you are not,
that is nishta [Self-abidance].
But,=
 even in that state,
do you not remain?
You whose mouth is silent,
do not b=
e perplexed!
Although [in that state] you are gone,
you are no longer there=
,
yet you did not go.
You are eternally present.
Do not suffer in vain.
Exp=
erience bliss all the time!

Two days after Bhagavan had cited Thayumanavar=
 to illustrate Gandhi=E2=80=99s
thought-free experiences, a visitor returne=
d to the subject:

Devotee: Is not what Gandhi describes the state in which=
 thoughts themselves
become foreign?

Bhagavan: Yes, it is only after the r=
ise of the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thought that all other
thoughts arise. The w=
orld is seen after you have felt =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99. The
=E2=80=98I=E2=
=80=99-thought and all other thoughts had vanished for him.

Devotee: Then =
the body sense must be absent in that state.

Bhagavan: The body sense is a=
lso a thought whereas he describes the state in
which =E2=80=98thoughts do =
not come=E2=80=99.

Devotee: He also says, =E2=80=98It takes no effort to s=
top thinking=E2=80=99.

Bhagavan: Of course no effort is necessary to stop =
thoughts whereas one is
necessary for bringing about thoughts.

Devotee: We=
 are trying to stop thoughts. Gandhiji also says that thought is
an obstacl=
e to God=E2=80=99s guidance. So it is the natural state. Though natural,
ye=
t how difficult to realise. They say that sadhanas are necessary and also
t=
hat they are obstacles. We get confused.

Bhagavan: Sadhanas are needed so =
long as one has not realised it. They are
for putting an end to obstacles. =
Finally there comes a stage when a person
feels helpless notwithstanding th=
e sadhanas. He is unable to pursue the
much-cherished sadhana also. It is t=
hen that God=E2=80=99s power is realised. The
Self reveals itself.

Devotee=
: If the state is natural, why does it not overcome the unnatural
phases an=
d assert itself over the rest?

Bhagavan: Is there anything besides that? D=
oes anyone see anything besides
the Self? One is always aware of the Self. =
So it is always itself.
