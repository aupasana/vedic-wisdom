Namaste, 

Many many thanks to Shri PVR Narasimha Rao Garu for this excelle=
nt forum and all the guidance that he and other learned people offer here, =
Free of any cost! 

With your constant Sat-Sangatya, I was able to keep the=
 motivation for good things and have just completed reciting Durga SaptaSat=
hi 107 times. I am completing the last time on the Chaturdasi before the Na=
varatris begin. During Navaratris I plan to perform Chandi Homam with 700 v=
erses. Currently I am doing Chandi Homam daily with only Durga Sapta Sloki =
because I am doing chanting otherwise. Sapta Sati, tough as it seemed in th=
e beginning, became a lot more easier for me to chant now (that was the obj=
ective with which I have taken up this 108 times pArAyaNam) and some day I =
plan to memorize all that. On this occasion, I have a question for Shri Nar=
asimha Garu. I have come across a writing somewhere on Sapta Sati as to how=
 it can be a mantra Sastra. The second verse "SavarniH Soorya TanayOH .....=
" was interpreted to as "Hreem.." beejakshara mantra. Do we have a book tha=
t explains all of the SaptaSati in several contexts, the literal meaning, e=
soteric meaning, the several mantras that the verses represent etc.? If the=
re is no book like that, I would request Shri PVR to author such a book bec=
ause of his deep insights into the subject/language and the advanced sadhak=
a that he is! 

Nagraj
