Namaste Narasimha, 

> Final words

Till i can hear gods words, i rely on y=
our words of experience. I have read all your post some back till 2003 also=
. The evolution of your thoughts is very clearly visible esp in last 4-5mts=
. 

The intensity/regularity of your sadhana is also well documented from 1=
08 names of laxmi every friday to laxmi homam to chandi homam. my sincere r=
espect and gratitude for sharing your experience and thoughts.



> (1) Ver=
y likely, one is carrying really serious karmas and was destined to experie=
nce the setbacks during that period anyway. Homam (or other sadhana) made i=
t better, though one has no way of confirming it.


In her case i strongly =
suspect dasha/period related major illness as it seems she had been doing h=
omams for last 1.5yrs. 

I will urge priya to send her dob,time,place also =
to you and will appreciate if you can see the dasha/period related situatio=
n.


If this is not the reason then i will have to accept your choice (c) d=
iety coming close to test faith. but this doesn't make sense 
1. narayan/Vi=
shnu creates maya and one tries to approach him he tests him thoroughly, wh=
y? 
2. i have never read any negative experience in your case or manish's c=
ase. so i doubt the option (c) as you guys have done lot of sadhana.


I wa=
s under impression that setbacks can happen only in the initial period and =
not after 1.5yrs. needless to say i am a bit surprised.

regards
priyank
