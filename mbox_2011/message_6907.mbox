Hi Priya, 

Note - giving my 2 cents since similar thing happened to me als=
o. I am also waiting PVRs reply. In any case take his words as final words.=



Similar kind of unfortunate thing happened to me also after doing 21 vis=
hnu sahastranaam homam. 

I strongly believe that getting inspired by PVR w=
e have in a way jump started the spiritual side by doing homams. (They are =
powerful) PVR had already lot of sadhana (i believe for 4-5yrs) before he m=
et his guru and started with homams.

Noone knows the exact theory and i be=
leive that such things are not in ones chart also. Even i was worried like =
you to get my chart analysed and know the reason but 3-4 astrologers couldn=
t tell me the reason. i came to understand that chart is a map not a territ=
ory. 

PVR also has mentioned that its better if people do Ganapti homam fo=
r first 2-3 months. I will request PVR to add this information in each and =
every manual and also to suggest some non homam sadhana of ganapati so that=
 people who are eager to start their journey can have a beautiful start to =
their sadhana. 

Priya, you can stop the homams and get confortable and con=
fident first. Dont attach any guilt to not doing homams. No god is out ther=
e to punish you, its just that karmas are extremely complex. Its better to =
start with ganapati to remove all obstacles first. 


I can strongly sugges=
t few ganapati sadhana. 

1. Ganapati Homam 
(This is no doubt very powerfu=
l and i suggest this one for everyone but for al those who for any reason c=
ant do homam, please start sincerely with some non-homam sadhana)

2. Ganap=
ati tarpan
Use ganapati mool mantra 444 times for 40 days. (takes around 40=
min)
ॐ श्रीं ह्रì=
8;ं क्लीं ग्लौ&=
#2306; गं गणपतये व=
352; वरद सर्वजनं=
; मे वशमानय स्&=
#2357;ाहा॥ add "tarpayami" after swaha
http://guruj=
iamrita.tripod.com/mahaganapathy_tarpanam.htm

3. Variations in Ganapti tar=
pan
a. Instead of turmeric mound in the sadhana listed above you can keep g=
anapti yantra also. 
b. I simply chooze to visualise ganapati and either i =
visualise washing his feet or simple focusing on mantra. 
c. As PVR has sai=
d many times before that sincerity and devotion are the key and not the tec=
hnicalities.

4. I am on 30th day of this ganapti tarpan sadhana and i can =
vouch for a wonderful clarity and good results.


regards
priyank
