Namaste,
   Very true and inspiring, apart from connecting us cross section=
ally in
time, it could be cross dimensional as well....

   Coming to the p=
roblem with sesame seeds, i think Narasimha garu in the
past has said to ta=
ke care that the seeds do not germinate, from that point
of time i strain t=
he water after the ritual (using a reserved hanky/reserved
sieve - somethin=
g similar to the one that is used to strain Tea). i collect
the seeds after=
 that and mix them with a some cooked rice, make a ball and
keep that on te=
rrace/balcony so that birds pick that (in a way - bhuuta
rina).

    Birds =
at my place are eternally hungry :-) - so i can see the rice ball
gone by e=
vening time but this is an option which can be tried out and the
pour the l=
eft over water to plants.

Regards,
-sarma.
