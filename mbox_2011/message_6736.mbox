Hi,

Addendum to below explanations.

We can explain meaning of burning diy=
as as following...

i) it  is one type of sewa offered to god.
ii) by burni=
ng it in front of god we are asking god to remove the andhakaar or 
tamas t=
hat has covered us and show the path of light and take us towards the 
ulti=
mate which is devoid of any gunas and full of light and self illuminating 
=
(swayamprakash)
iii) by burning it in front of god we are asking him to bur=
n all our karmas 
(good bad and all ) and make us free from bondages of kar=
mas and to take us back 
in him who is free from all karma bandhanaas.

so =
the method and materials used in doing it has its own impact on it.

Sesame=
 Seeds and its Oil:-- The quality of (gun) sesame Seeds and its oil is 
coo=
lness (sheetal gun).( The sesame seeds are used to reduce problems of heat =
or 
Ushna baadhas) and  the burning of same (oil) gives coolness to environ=
ment and 
to the mind too. hence most of the times in temples sesame oil is=
 used for 
burning diyas. It is also helpful if you are trying to do medita=
tion it will 
help in creating a environment for it.

Ghee -- And in ghee i=
t is only ghee of gaay or cow  should be used and in that 
too of one which=
 has its calf alive( nowadays we don't come to know it as we buy 
it from s=
hops so this point cannot be applied but it is still observed in rural 
are=
as where people prepare ghee for themselves)
The reason I mentioned this be=
cause its only cows ghee is pure and is of satvic 
gun and can give similar=
 fruits if used where as the ghee of female buffalo 
(bhains) is said to be=
 of gaadh tamas and use of same would give similar results 
i.e. yield more=
 tamas.( And so is difference in milk too...)

And most importantly it is s=
aid that the devatas eat with their drishti and by 
sensing the fragrance. =
hence in appeasing any deity the respective material 
needs to be used for =
offering or burning. where as ghee is most widely used in 
homams as comon =
material the remaining offerings vary as per deity.
  

Thanks & Regards,
C=
hetan

Shri Ananda Ji,

I und=
