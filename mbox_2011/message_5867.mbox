Hello,

Very nice article Chandra ji. Lot of Thanks for posting it.

Respec=
ted Utpal ji has answered about hinduism in a very touching manner. I don't=
 think anything need to be added.

I believe that every soul born on earth =
is Hindu(not a very correct word to use for our religion although). Sanatan=
 dharma is the basic functioning with default settings coming with every br=
and new body. Just like basic functioning default settings of new mobile ph=
one. Although after buying, one can make changes in it as per his own prefe=
rences and taste. But still basic functions remain the same.  When a call c=
omes, your phone will tell you. It can tell by vibration, or by singing a s=
ong or by chanting an aarti. But still it will tell you, because it is the =
basic functioning of phone. 

All the religions, including the now-a-days c=
alled hinduism, are different just on the basis of their profile settings. =
Basic functioning of all the religions is same. They all are used to make c=
alls! And that basic functioning is 'sanatan dharma'. These religions known=
 as  hinduism, sikhism, budhism, islam, christianity and many other religio=
ns just use different ring tones, different wallpapers and different screen=
 savers. Rest is same :)

About initiation in religion i think that initiat=
ion is a stage when you think ' i want to know what is god' when you think =
such a thought, you are initiated! It means that you just received a call! =
Your ringtone may be different, your caller image may be different. But all=
 it means is that you had just received a call. Pick up your phone! 

Sorry=
 for mistakes. Sorry if i confused you instead of helping you. I usually do=
 so :)

Kind regards
