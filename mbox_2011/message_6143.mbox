Namaste

Vimalananda after writing about the effects of the intoxicants say=
s the best intoxicant is bhakti and total surrender to an deity and no othe=
r intoxicant comes close.

The human brain is capable of manufacturing all =
the required " rasas" and is essentially an chemical storehouse.The brain h=
as its own natural painkillers, sedatives and happiness inducing hormones .=
It would be much better method to use this natural capability of the body i=
nstead of experimenting with dangerous drugs .

If you want to truly experi=
ment and reduce the flow of thoughts towards sexual desires , just try two =
things which is extremely safe.

1.Cut out garlic entirely from your diet.
=
2.Also remove onions completely .

(Garlic has chemicals which cross the bl=
ood brain barrier and onion is a known to increase the secretion of certain=
 hormones ) 

This has an added side advantage , you will not be offering t=
hese substances into your internal homa of digestive fire ( Jatharagni ) .V=
imalananda also mentions this in the second book on the chapter about food =
that one of the best methods to do internal homa is to offer one's favourit=
e mantra with every morsel of food into the internal fire. 

Agreed one's v=
isualization might not be perfect to do an internal homa  but removing the =
above two substances will go a long way in reducing sexual thoughts.
