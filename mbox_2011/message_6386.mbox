One has to be completely dead to the narrowness and the delusion of the wor=
ld if he is to live in the grandeur and the beauty of life in the Spirit. T=
his truth is forgotten and the play of Satan in the human brain has been at=
 present in the stage of foolish ratiocination and comfortable argumentatio=
n. While living in the sensual plane of life, an intelligent exposition of =
Acosmism and Absolute Idealism in attractive rhetorical language cannot pas=
s for more than a childish prattle. Dreams of bringing God to the sensual e=
arth are nothing but the exhibition of human vanity which is the outcome of=
 his failure in distinguishing between what is really true and existent and=
 what is not.
