lishing House, Chennai

I-13. Delusion appears five-fold; it will be presen=
tly set forth. Due to the
first delusion, Jiva and God appear to have diffe=
rent forms.

I-14. Due to the second, the attribute of agency dwelling in t=
he Self
appears to be real. The third (consists in) deeming the Jiva associ=
ated with
the three bodies as having attachment.

I-15. The fourth takes th=
e world-cause (God) to be mutable. The fifth
delusion ascribes reality to t=
he world as distinguished from its cause.
Then, also, in the mind flashes t=
he cessation of the five-fold delusion.

I-40. Consider in your mind: who a=
m I ? How is all this (brought about) ?
How do death and birth (happen) ? T=
hus (considering) will you earn the great
benefit (of investigation).

II-8=
-9. The mind that clings not to acts, thoughts, and things, to
wanderings a=
nd reckonings of time, but reposes in Consciousness alone,
finding no delig=
ht anywhere, even when turned toward some objects, revels in
the Self.

II-=
12. The quiescent state of the attenuated mind, free from all objective
ref=
erence, is said to be the deep sleep in wakefulness.

II-14. Having attaine=
d the indestructible status in this fourth stage, one
reaches a non-blissfu=
l poise (as it were), its nature being invariably
delightful.

II-23. Liber=
ation is not on the top of the sky; not in the nether world; not
on the ear=
th. The dwindling of mind in which all desires dry up is held to
be liberat=
ion.

II-35. Here is the supreme Self whose essence is the light of Conscio=
usness
without beginning or end; the wise hold this luminous certitude to b=
e the
right knowledge.

III-7. The five openings, eyes and so forth, known =
as the sense organs of
cognition, I am watching carefully with my mind.

II=
I-8. O you sense-organs ! Slowly give up your mood of agitation. Here I
am,=
 the divine spiritual Self, the witness of all.

IV-4. Whatever objects are=
 present in the world are (held to be) of the
stuff of nescience. How can t=
he great Yogin, who has dispelled nescience,
plunge into them ?

IV-7. Only=
 influenced by some desire does man work for miraculous powers.
The perfect=
 man, seeking nothing, can have no desire whatsoever.

IV-8. When all desir=
es dry up, O sage, the Self is won. How can the mindless
(sage) desire mira=
culous powers ?

IV-12. Dead is his mind who is unmoved in joy and sorrow, =
and whom nothing
jerks out of equality, even as breaths stir not a mighty m=
ountain.

IV-16. The nature of mind, know, is folly, O sinless one ! When t=
hat
perishes one=E2=80=99s real essence, mindlessness, is (won).

IV-26. Th=
at eternally self-shining Light, illuminating the world, is alone
the witne=
ss of this world, the Self of all, the pure One.

IV-48. Being continuously=
 free from latent impressions, when the mind ceases
to ponder there arises =
mindlessness that yields supreme tranquillity.

IV-79. As long as the laten=
t impressions are not attenuated, the mind is not
tranquillised; as long as=
 the knowledge of truth is not won, whence can come
mental tranquillity ?

=
IV-80. As long as the mind is not tranquil, Truth cannot be known; so long
=
as the knowledge of Truth is not won whence can mental tranquillity come ?
=

V-3. The knower digests (whatever) food he eats =E2=80=93 (whether it is) =
impure,
unwholesome, defiled through contact with poison, well-cooked or st=
ale, as
though it were =E2=80=98sweet=E2=80=99 (i.e. a hearty meal).

V-4. =
The (wise) know liberation to be the renunciation of (all) attachment:
non-=
birth results from it. Give up attachment to objects; be liberated in
life,=
 O sinless one !

V-16. Where latent impressions remain in solution there i=
s =E2=80=98deep sleep=E2=80=99; it
does not make for perfection. Where the =
impressions are seedless, there is
=E2=80=98the Fourth=E2=80=99 that yields=
 perfection.

V-70. =E2=80=98This is fine; this is not ! -- such (feeling) =
is the seed of your
extended sorrow. When that is burned in the fire of imp=
artiality, where is
the occasion for sorrow ?

V-77. Just as space is calle=
d =E2=80=98Pot-space=E2=80=99 (and) =E2=80=98great space=E2=80=99, so, due =
to
delusion, is the self called Jiva and Ishvara in two ways.

V-102. The c=
ause of bondage is mental construction; give that up. Liberation
comes thro=
ugh the absence of mental construction; practise it intelligently.

V-106. =
In the multitude of objects, moving and stationery, extending from
grass, e=
tc.; upto the living bodies, let there be nothing that gives you
pleasure.
=

V-116. O twice born, perform acts, remaining in deep slumber in wakefulnes=
s
itself. Having internally renounced everything, act externally as occasio=
n
arises.

V-120. Whoever studies the Annapurnopanishad with the blessing o=
f (one=E2=80=99s)
teacher become a Jivanmukta, and by himself altogether Br=
ahman =E2=80=93 This is the
Upanishad.
