Ananda,

offering water/ liquid seems to take different forms based on who you 
offer it to.

To shiv linga - Abhishekam
Surya - Arghyam
Tarpana - pitru, rishi and gods. Based on who you offer it to the method 
of offering changes.  You might have noted pitru tarpanam goes between 
thumb and index finger, deva tarpanam goes touching the mount of middle 
finger.

More knowlegdeable gurus could correct or throw more light on 
significance of these.

                        different element and unlike fire. IF subtle
                        water element is already pure inside you, then
                        associating it with external water and offering
                        it to a deity pleases the deity (the noun
                        tarpaNa comes from the verb root tR^ip, i.e. to
                        please/satisfy). If it is not, the external
                        ritual of tarpana does not please the deity.</font></div>

                        face="Verdana" size="2">Note that fire element
                        stands for transformatory energy and water
                        element stands for harmonization. In homam, you
                        transform yourself (fire) with the help of the
                        nature of a deity. In tarpana, you harmonize
                        (water) your being with the spirit of a deity
                        and the deity inside you becomes satisfied and
                        pleased and you manifest the essence of that
                        deity more fully. That of course is the final
                        goal of sadhana of any deity.</font></div>

                        successful, you need to purify yourself first.
                        Thus, directly doing tarpana is unlikely to do
                        any benefit to most people. It will help only
                        the purest sadhakas. For most, internal
                        purification with homam is the best thing to do
                        before doing anything else.</font></div>

                        places should not be stressed too much. Yes,
                        banks of Ganges are very auspicious, but one
                        whose internal Ganges (devotion) is dirty and
                        dried up, may not benefit even from the bank of
                        external Ganges. Cowshed is auspicious, but one
                        whose internal cowshed (control over senses) is
                        weak, may not benefit even from a cowshed. If
                        you have a chance, use these principles.
                        Otherwise, just do wherever you can and not
                        worry about those effectiveness ratios.</font></div>

                        the same asana facing the same direction and
                        wearing the same clothes. Read nice spiritual
                        literature and try to improve control over
                        senses. One searching for a perfect formula will
                        keep searching, while one doing sadhana with
                        whatever formula will actually make progress.</font></div>
