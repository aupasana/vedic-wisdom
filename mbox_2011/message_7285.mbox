Dear Nagraj ji,
=C2=A0
The Damara Tantra says that Sri Hari understands 3/4=
 of the Chandipath, Sri Brahma understands 1/2 of the Chandipath and Sri Ve=
da Vyasa understands 1/4th. We can safely assume that no human in this age =
can completely understand the exact esoteric significance of each verse,=C2=
=A0let alone=C2=A0each word of the Chandi.
=C2=A0
But the potency of the te=
xt is due to it being a revealed text, even if one does not understand a si=
ngle word of it and yet keeps chanting it, results will come unfailing! The=
re are a few explanatory books of the Chandi by many esteemed spiritual peo=
ple, the most famous being that by Sri Nagoji Bhatta and Sri Bhaskaracharya=
. In Bengali there are=C2=A0quite a=C2=A0few=C2=A0very beautiful texts prov=
iding different interpretations of the Chandi, but sadly none of them are i=
n English. Again Sri Shayama Charun Lahiri used had also given some comment=
s on the Chandi from a Yogic point of view. Each of the=C2=A0three Charittr=
as=C2=A0represent one of the three Granthis - Brahma,=C2=A0Vishnu and=C2=A0=
Rudra Granthi.
=C2=A0
If you can get a copy of the Chandi published by the =
Ramakrishna Mission, then read the preface. It is an nice scholarly work on=
 the history of this text. Btw, the Ramakrishna Mission published Chandi ha=
s some differences in verses from the Gita Press. The former being more pop=
ular in Bengal and Assam while the later being more popular in North India =
and the rest of India. However,=C2=A0BOTH work equally well when it comes t=
o experiencing spirituality.

=C2=A0 
Namaste, 

Many many thanks to Shri=
 PVR Narasimha Rao Garu for this excellent forum and all the guidance that =
he and other learned people offer here, Free of any cost! 

With your const=
ant Sat-Sangatya, I was able to keep the motivation for good things and hav=
e just completed reciting Durga SaptaSathi 107 times. I am completing the l=
ast time on the Chaturdasi before the Navaratris begin. During Navaratris I=
 plan to perform Chandi Homam with 700 verses. Currently I am doing Chandi =
Homam daily with only Durga Sapta Sloki because I am doing chanting otherwi=
se. Sapta Sati, tough as it seemed in the beginning, became a lot more easi=
er for me to chant now (that was the objective with which I have taken up t=
his 108 times pArAyaNam) and some day I plan to memorize all that. On this =
occasion, I have a question for Shri Narasimha Garu. I have come across a w=
riting somewhere on Sapta Sati as to how it can be a mantra Sastra. The sec=
ond verse "SavarniH Soorya TanayOH ....." was interpreted to as "Hreem.." b=
eejakshara mantra. Do we have a book that explains all of the SaptaSati in =
several contexts, the literal meaning, esoteric
 meaning, the several mantr=
as that the verses represent etc.? If there is no book like that, I would r=
equest Shri PVR to author such a book because of his deep insights into the=
 subject/language and the advanced sadhaka that he is! 

Nagraj
