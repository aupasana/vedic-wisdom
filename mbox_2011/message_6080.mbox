Dear Jitender, namaste

Just relax and leave it to the intelligent fire to =
decide what to do. You
need to let go of the thought that the fire needs co=
nstant attention; it
will do what it wants to do. Try and develop a healthy=
, respectful and
loving relationship with the fire. Your situation is not n=
ew to me; I've
faced this quite a few times where I get tensed about whethe=
r the poornahuti
will burn or not. Slowly I've learnt to let go and flow wi=
th the situation.
If you use a coconut piece as poornahuti, then dip it in =
ghee before
offering...do this immediately after vasordhara...u will see th=
at when
vasordharaa starts, the fire will simply leap up as if in anticipat=
ion. If
you use a half of a dry coconut as poornahuti, then fill that half =
with
ghee, coin, what all you offered before and place it carefully in the =
centre
of the havan kund. If you use a full dry coconut as poornahuti, then=
 before
the havan, cut it into two parts (where one part is smaller and oth=
er is
larger), fill the larger part with ghee and other offerings, close th=
e
coconut and tie it up with a string or cloth...then keep it ready for
off=
ering.

In any case, let go and delve deep into medidation trusting the fir=
e to do
what it will do...then watch the magic unfold!

best regards
Hari
