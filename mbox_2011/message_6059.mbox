Good day.

Frankly, ishta devata has to be your ishta, your like; in which =
case, you look for the deity you love and go with worshipping of that deity=
. Then irrespective of what happens to you when you worship him / her, you =
would not have qualms about if the results are good / bad.

You may get con=
fused / irritated, but would go back to your deity as you love them :-)

My=
 cents,

 needs to decide upon a Homam of a deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or Ugra-Sou=
mya in external Nature) to which one feels most attracted and then forget a=
bout the rest. It would be a destabilizing effect on mind of a person to st=
art judging and relating day to day experiences with homam. The chosen deit=
y can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or Krishna or Shiva or Hanuman or any othe=
r deity. Once person starts surrendering to the chosen deity, one is in saf=

 keep faith till it is impossible because if God exist, there never would b=
