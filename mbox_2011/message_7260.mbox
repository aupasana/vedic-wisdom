Om Ganeshai Namah.

Namaste All,

In Tarpan and Homam manual Darbha and Pav=
itram ( ring made of Darbha ) is mentioned as seprate iteams. 

So if one c=
an find Darbha, can not one make the ring od Darbha himself ? Or is there s=
ome ritual for making one ? Or Priest or Brahmin only can make it ?

Regard=
s.

Mihir
