Namaste,

Someone asked me how to explain a kid why there are many gods in =

Hinduism while some religions have a single god. I will share some 
though=
ts.

*        *        *

When one is thirsty, one can drink water (H2O) to=
 get some energy. From 
the same water, we can also make different mineral =
waters, vitamin 
waters, flavored waters, soft drinks of various kinds etc =
and drink them 
instead of water.

Hindu scriptures say that there is only =
god (Brahman or Aatman or Self), 
but that god manifests as different devat=
as (deities) with various 
natures, qualities and energies.

The one god - =
Brahman or Allah or Holy Spirit - has no qualities (like 
form, color, shap=
e, nature etc) and is beyond description and the source 
of all deities. Si=
milarly, plain water - which is the source of all 
other drinks - has no ta=
ste or smell or flavor. Deities arising from 
that one god have various qua=
lities (gentle, fierce etc). Similarly, 
many kinds of flavored water and s=
oft drinks have different taste, smell 
and flavor. Just as one can drink w=
hatever drink one likes, based on 
one's taste, to quench thirst, similarly=
 one can worship whatever deity 
one likes, based on one's taste, to quench=
 the inner thirst of one's 
soul and give it energy to do its work.

*     =
   *        *

Just as Abraham said no to the worship of idols and forms an=
d installed 
the notion of one god, one can ban flavored drinks and say tha=
t only 
plain water can be drunk. That is not wrong, but most people find w=
ater 
too plain and prefer different drinks. Similarly, most people cannot =

relate to ONE formless (i.e. beyond forms) god and using specific forms 
b=
ased on one's mental state helps improve devotion.

*        *        *

Ju=
st as different people may call water with different names (water, 
paani, =
jalam, tanni, neellu, acqua, wasser etc), similarly different 
people may c=
all the one god as Brahman or Parabrahma or Aatman or Buddha 
or Self or Al=
lah or Ahora Mazda or Holy Spirit or whatever. There's 
nothing in a name. =
Fighting that Allah is superior or Brahman, is akin 
to fighting that paani=
 is superior to jalam!

When you have water or a drink, the key is to drink=
 it and get energy. 
If one stores it, flaunts it and looks at now and then=
, it won't quench 
thirst. Similarly, keeping a god's idol or picture or a =
scripture or 
reading it now, it won't quench the inner thirst. One needs t=
o think of 
god in mind, contemplate on the nature of god and get some of t=
hat 
nature within oneself through resonance. That gives energy and 
transf=
orms one.

*        *        *

 From the "Fire Yoga" guide (http://www.Ved=
icAstrologer.org/fire):

People have the notion that there are different go=
ds who created 
different people. But the fact is that one god created this=
 whole 
universe and god is beyond forms, beyond knowing, beyond understand=
ing 
and beyond describing. People who have experienced different aspects o=
f 
this one god have given different names and descriptions and different 
=
paths to reach god.

Despite the existence of many religions and many notio=
ns of god today, 
one thing we can declare confidently is that god is one a=
nd all 
religions are different attempts to reach that one god or cosmic 
c=
onsciousness. Infinite god cannot be captured completely by anything 
finit=
e, including religion. God can be realized only though internal 
experience=
 and not through reading books or intellectual discussions or 
hearing abou=
t someone else=E2=80=99s description of god.

*        *        *

Happy Ga=
nesha Chaturthi to all of you!

Best regards,
Narasimha
