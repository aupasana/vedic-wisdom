Namaste:

I have not tried this recipe for kumkum, but here are the details=
:

------

This recipe for kumkum can be made at home with ingredients in a=
lmost
 everyone's kitchen. You can add oils, red sandalwood powder, or saff=
ron to
perfume the mixture.

Homemade Kumkum Powder

- 1 part haldi (turmer=
ic)
- 1 part baking soda
- 1-2 parts water (to make a loose but thick paste=
)

Mix together in a bowl. At this stage you might add ground saffron, as w=
ell
 - just be sure to let it soak, if you do.

If you are using a small am=
ount (1 tsp to 1 Tbsp), put into the microwave
for approximately 15-30 seco=
nds. You might check it every 10 seconds or so,
depending on how much you'v=
e made. If you are making more, you'll have to
adjust the timing accordingl=
y and stir every 10-15 seconds.

When it's turned a brilliant red, you're d=
one. Spread the powder out on some
 parchment paper on a baking sheet to co=
ol and dry thoroughly before
storing.
