Namaste

Just to add to the discussion. There was an article in BBC about o=
ne of the british satellites taking an picture of the effective gravitation=
al field of various countries.I beleive this link was discussed in the foru=
m previously.

It shows scientifically with proof that the gravitational fi=
eld of India is very different from rest of the countries.

 I may be novice in this area but I don't that is accurate. Your intentions=

say that India (and some parts of SE Asia) is the "Karma Bhoomi", and Ameri=
ca is considered a "Bhoga Bhoomi", and as such even nithya karmas like Oupa=
asanam performed in the USA are not valid.  Since Oupaasanam is the basis f=
or many of the sroutha and smatth karmas, those karmas, inlcuding Deva yajn=
as and pitru yajnas, are not valid outside of India.  Is this true?
