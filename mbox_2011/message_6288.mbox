Where then is the room for lamentation and despair, my dear Niranjan? Thou =
art dear to the Lord. That is the reason why He gives troubles. If He wants=
 to take anyone to His side, He takes away all money. He removes his dear k=
ith and kin. He destroys all his pleasure-centres, so that his mind may ful=
ly rest at His Lotus-Feet. Face everything with a smiling, cheerful counten=
ance. Understand His mysterious ways. See God in everything, in every face-=
out of sight, but not out of mind. We are closer when we live physically at=
 a distance. Let us dwell in our hearts. Krishna suddenly hides Himself, so=
 that Radha and the Gopis might thirst for Him more eagerly. Sing like Radh=
a. Thirst like Gopis for his vision. Krishna's grace is bound to descend. H=
e is thy Immortal Friend. Forget not the Flute-Bearer of Brindavan, thy Sol=
ace and the joy of Devaki.
