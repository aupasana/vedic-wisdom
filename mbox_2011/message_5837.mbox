Dear Narasimhaji,

I have also had similar experiences as Priya, but I feel=
 my case is slightly different and I have a specific fear, wondering if you=
 can address it. Background is that I am definitely going through a bad pat=
ch after my dad's passing about 7 months ago. Recently, in my dreams I have=
 witnessed intense suffering (and when witnessing it I somehow "knew" it wa=
s the worst suffering possible in this universe). Note that I say witnessed=
 and not experienced. In the dream one moment I was outside in the bright s=
unlight, then suddenly was drawn into an underground railway station and in=
to a train I didnt want to be in. A woman on the train told me it is going =
to Praarthak, Pravarthak (some such word). I wanted to get out, and take th=
e next train back. But it kept taking me on. I knew somehow it was going to=
 take me to 7 stations, I dont know how. At each of the 7 stations, all und=
erground without light, were "half formed people" in absolute, unbelievable=
 darkness, pain and misery. They were in a sense "trying to get their ident=
ity together" without as much as a ray of hope or light. The suffering was =
too intense. I felt like they/their pain would overwhelm me and draw me int=
o them/the pain/their-closed-suffering-filled-darkness for eternity, but I =
was not them. Simultaneously, I have had other dreams in which someone is a=
round me, trying to get to/into me.

I have also been doing meditations in =
which I am trying to open my heart, let my emotions out (I am very reserved=
 by nature). These meditations are quite cathartic and give me peace at the=
 end. But here is my fear: I feel this "opening myself out internally" is a=
ttracting some huge external negativity of some kind. Is this possible? Or =
is it simply my own bad karma of the past that is being revealed to me? How=
 do I tell if this negativity is to be experienced and suffered (if it is m=
y own), or is to be avoided (if it is someone else)?

Regards,

Sundeep
