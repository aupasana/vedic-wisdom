Heard that will be a lunar Eclipse on 10th dec. i reside in singapore and i
heard that eclipse will be showin in singapore.  My mom is doing Ganapathy
Homan on the 10th dec.  She is starting her homan arnd 5-6am.

My question my friend says it not advisable to do homan on this date and
she wont be getting any benefits.  Temple priest says eclipse is starting
in the evening arnd 6.30pm hence nothing will be effected.

Please advice on this issue.

Another question is..i wish to fast on this day...but i need sm guidance on
what shld i need to do?

Can i know the timing of the eclipse in singapore time?
