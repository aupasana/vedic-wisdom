      Namaste,



According to our ancient =
scriptures, Brahma, the creator, creates and destroys the universe cyclical=
ly. The life of Brahma is 120 divine years called Mahakalpa. Everyday he cr=
eates 14 Manus one by one and they create and control the world. So there a=
re fourteen Manus in one divine day called Kalpa of Brahma. The life of eac=
h Manu is called Manvantara and it has 71 eras of four quarters. Each quart=
er is has four Yugas - Krita or Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali. The followi=
ng are the complete calculations of Vedic units of time and periods.



The=
 time taken to tear apart the softest petals of a lotus is called 'TRUTI' 
=

100 Trutis make 1 Lub

30 Lub make 1 Nimesh

27 Nimesh make 1 Guru Akshar
=

10 Guru Akshar Make 1 Pran

6 pran Vighatika make 1 Ghatika or Dand

60 Gh=
ati make 1 day and night 



That means, in a day and night, there are 17,4=
9,60,000,00 Trutis

Thus, according to Western science, there are 86,400 se=
conds in a day and night, whereas in Indian science, a day and night consis=
ts of 17,49,60,000,00 Trutis. 



According to another system, the division=
 of time is



1 day or 24 hours =3D 60 Ghatis

1 Ghati =3D 60 Vighati (als=
o called Pala or Kala)

1 Vighati =3D 60 Lipta or (also called Vipala or Vi=
kala)

1 Lipta =3D 60 Vilipta

1 Vilipta =3D 60 Para

1 Para =3D 60 Tatpara=




As a lot of charts made in the olden days mention the birth time in Gha=
tis and Vighatis the following is the conversion to remember:



5 Ghatis =
=3D 2 hours

5 Vighati =3D 2 minutes

Another system of time at micro level=
 is

60 Tatparas =3D 1 Paras

60 Paras =3D 1 Vilipta

60 Vilipta =3D 1 Lipt=
a

60 Lipta =3D 1 Ghatika (Dand)

60 Ghatika =3D 1 Day & Night)



Therefor=
e, it is clear that there are 46,65,60,000,00 Tatparas in a day and night.
=



6.3. The Vedic Units of Time =96 Macro level



SATYUG 4,32,000 YEARS X =
4 =3D 17,28,000 YEARS

TRETA 4,32,000 YEARS X 3 =3D 12,96,000 YEARS

DWAPAR=
 4,32,000 YEARS X 2 =3D 8,64,000 YEARS

KALIYUG 4,32,000 YEARS X 1 =3D 4,32=
,000 YEARS

1 MAHAYUG (GRAND TOTAL OF ALL THE YUGAS) =3D 4,320,000 YEARS

7=
1 MAHAYUG =3D 43,20,000X71 =3D 1 MANVANTAR

1 MANVANTAR =3D 30,6720,000 YEA=
RS

14 MANVANTAR =3D 4,294,080,000 YEARS

(There are 14 Manvantars)



The =
earth remains submerged in the water for the period of 8,64,000 years i.e. =
half the number of Satyug, before the start of each Manvantar, it also rema=
ins submerged in the water for the same number of years, i.e. 8,64,000 year=
s, after the completion of each Manvantar. 

So in 14 Manvantars the number=
 of years



17,28,000 x 15 =3D 2,59,20,000

(Number of year in Satyug)

+ =
14 Manvantar =3D 42,9, 40,80,000

1 Kalpa =3D 43,2,0000000 years

One day &=
 night of Brahma =3D 4,320,000 Mahayug x 100 =3D 4,320,00,000 years 

Since=
 the one moment in the life of Brahma is considered to be of our 100years, =
therefore the life of Brahma in 100 years will be 

4,32,00,00,000 x 360 x =
100 =3D 1,555,200,000,000 years 



The Present Age of Cosmos according to =
the Vedic System is as follows:



There are 14 Manvantaras altogether. The=
 present period is passing through the seventh Manvantara called Vaivaswata=
 Manvantara.

One Manvantara consists of 71 Mahayugs, out of which 27 Mahay=
ugs have already passed. We are passing through the first phase of the Kali=
 Yuga which itself is the third Yuga of the 28th Mahayuga and which has com=
e after the passing of Satya Yuga, Treta and Dwapar Yuga. 

The time period=
 of Manvantara (exclusive period, when the earth is submerged in water, in =
the beginning and in the end) =3D 306,720,000 years 

1) Multiplying these =
years by 6 =3D 30,67,20,000 x 6 (Because we are in the midst of 7th Manvant=
ara, of the Svetvaaraah Kalpa and 6 Manvantaras have already passed) =3D 1,=
8,0,300,000 years 

The time period of Pralaya consists of 17,28,000 years =
since 7 Pralayas have passed, after the end of 6th Kalpa and before the beg=
inning of 7th Kalpa, so 17,28,000x 7 =3D 12,096,000 years 

Adding we have:=


1,840,300,000 + 120 96 000 + 1,852,396,000 years

Therefore, after 1,85,2=
4,16,000 years 'VAIVASVAT MANVANTARA' has started.



2) 27 Mahayugs with e=
ach Mahayuga consisting of 43,20,000 years. 43,20,000 x 27 =3D 116,640,000 =
years have passed

Total =3D 1,96,90,56,000 years 

3) Now the time period =
of Kali Yuga in the 28th Yuga =3D 

Time period of Satya Yuga =3D 17,28,000=


Time period of Treta =3D 12,96,000

Time period of Dwapar =3D 8,64,000

T=
OTAL =3D 38,88,000

Since all the above three Yugas have already passed, it=
 means that after 38,88,000 years, Kali Yuga came into existence. 

4) Kali=
 Yuga started on Bhadrapada, Krishnapaksha -13th day, in Vyatipaat yoga at =
midnight, in the Aashlesha Nakshatra and the age of the Kali Yuga has been =
fixed as 5101 years as till date that is Vikram Samvat 2057 =3D Shaka 1922 =
=3D 2000 AD. 

Sum of all the three Yugs =3D the Sum of 27 Mahayugas and Ma=
nvantar + the time period of Kali Yuga till date.



Kalpa consist of 4,32,=
00,00,000 years and out of these 1,97,29,49,101 years have passed. Therefor=
e, the earth's existence, according to the calculations devised by our anci=
ent sages, comes up to 1,97,29,49,101 years till date. It is interesting to=
 note that according to scientific calculations, the age of the cosmos is e=
stimated between 15 and 20 billion years. 



India has given the idea of t=
he smallest and the largest measure of time.

Krati =3D 34,000th of a secon=
d

1 Truti =3D 300th of a second

2 Truti =3D 1 Luv 

2 Luv =3D 1 Kshana

3=
0 Kshana =3D 1 Vipal

60 Vipal =3D 1 Pal

60 Pal =3D 1 Ghadi (24 minutes)

=
2.5 Gadhi =3D 1 Hora (1 hour)

24 Hora =3D 1 Divas (1 day)

7 Divas =3D 1 s=
aptaah (1 week)

4 Saptaah =3D 1 Maas (1 month)

2 Maas =3D 1 Rutu (1 seaso=
n)

6 Rutu =3D 1 Varsh (1 year)

100 Varsh =3D 1 Shataabda (1 century)

10 =
Shataabda =3D 1 sahasraabda

432 Sahasraabda =3D 1 Yug (Kaliyug)

2 Yug =3D=
 1 Dwaaparyug

3 Yug =3D 1 Tretaayug

4 Yug =3D 1 Krutayug

10 Yug =3D 1 Ma=
haayug (4,320,000 years)

1000 Mahaayug =3D 1 Kalpa

1 Kalpa =3D 4.32 billi=

The time period of Pralaya consists of 17,28,000 years since 7 Pralayas ha=
