Sannyasa destroys all worldliness, all evil samskaras,5 and establishes you=
 in advaitic meditation. You must come out of your house and wander away be=
gging for alms and fix the mind on the supreme lakshya,6 Brahman. You must =
meditate without break. Then only you can have the choice either to take or=
 not to take orange robe. But never say, =E2=80=9CI have no attachment, I a=
m a mental sannyasin.=E2=80=9D You will weep afterwards. Study the Mundaka =
Upanishad, If sannyasa is not necessary why should there be the four ashram=
as?7 Were the makers of such rules mere fools? How can you understand the g=
lory of sannyasa while remaining in the house and the office, clubs and hot=
els, amidst temptations and attractions, lust and attachment? How can you k=
now the glory of the destruction of Maya,8 realization of God? You want to =
eat, drink and enjoy all the day and night. You are immersed in sensual ple=
asures. There is no dispassion, no vairagya,9 no renunciation. That is why =
you are afraid to take sannyasa and try to justify your worldliness through=
 foolish arguments. You are afraid to bear suffering. You always want to be=
 carried away by your sense-craving. How, then, can you know the glory of s=
annyasa? The attachment to men and women, friends and relatives, money and =
gold, has to be ruthlessly burnt down to ashes. All the so-called duties of=
 the world have to be kicked away for the sake of that glorious state of se=
lf-realization! The Mahabharata proclaims that for the sake of self-realiza=
tion even the whole world should be renounced without hesitation.
