Namaskaar,

[> all members of your family will cling to you like leeches
> =
till the end of your life

I do not appreciate this tone at all.]

I am ins=
tantly writing this message. for long long time i was disputing the same th=
ought internally but i never got support to my dispute. I am much delighted=
 to see Narasimha's message.
Even Shri Balaram Basu uttered such words atta=
cking family members & relatives during his daughter's marriage. i did not =
appreciate that (They leaved with God).
Whenever i came across this popular=
 idea in favor of Sanyaasa viz-a-viz scathing attack on family members, my =
internal voice never accepted that. All most every time, i used to think ab=
out my Grand parents, My Mother & father, siblings, wife, uncle, Father's s=
isters etc...and i never found them like "leeches". in my personal case my =
family and other relatives has done more for me than what i could do for th=
em and still they feel vice versa. Almost everybody is selfish in varying d=
egree so if family members expect that their bare minimum needs are taken c=
are so that they can lead normal life and that is a reasonable selfishness =
in Sansaara.

In my opinion, a normal family, if they somehow get engaged i=
n God worship everyday, would be a boon and there would be no need to run a=
way from such family members.  

There is one personal little thing. Few ye=
ars back when i was still in Mumbai, once My mother seeing me doing a lot o=
f spiritual practices everyday told me -"Utpal, you are married, you have w=
ife and children, please do not run away from them and do not think of Sany=
asa" She was obviously very worried. I laughed heartily and then told her i=
n a very firm, reassuring tone that she must not worry. I would never run a=
way to jungle leaving them. Poor beloved Mother! She didn't know that there=
 is still a lot of Nishumbha power hiding inside me and staying with family=
 would not hinder the efforts of slaying the monster. on the contrary it wo=
uld help in that. Fighting from inside the fort of attachments!

Try to eng=
age you family members in Worship. That is the best course for all of us fa=
mily people.

Warm Regards,

Utpal
