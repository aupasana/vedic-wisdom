Dear group - I have some questions on Chandi homam.

1. While doing Chandi =
homam, do I need add svaaha to all "uvAcha" and "Uchu" too, I see the manua=
l says any thing that ends with number should have "svAha" followed by offe=
rings.
2. Also, the last verse in each chapter ends with "Om" or "klIm", do=
 I need to add svAha after that or before that when the verse finishes? I e=
nd with svAha when the verse finishes, followed by "Om SvAha" or "klIm svAh=
a". Hope that is fine.
3. Do I need to clean the havan kund every time I do=
 Chandi homam ? I do SriKrsna homam daily and am planning to do Chandi homa=
m weekly or whenever possible ? I clean my havan kund (wash) once a week or=
 10 days, else I clean the old havan burnings once in 3-4 days.
4. After Sr=
iKrsna homam daily, I eat whatever is ready to eat as breakfast. It can be =
leftovers from the previous night too. After Chandi homam, can I do the sam=
e? Meaning can I have freshly cooked and any leftovers from the night or is=
 that an offense ? Similarly, can I just eat some prasAdam and go out to ea=
t. I don't normally eat out, even if I, it is in an Iskcon restaurant or so=
me near by place where the food is cooked with onion / garlic; but still as=
king to know the rules.
5. I offer Sweet pongal for Chandi homam. Normally =
I eat little prasAdam once the hOmam is done. Is it fine that I have my mea=
l on the dining table or do we need to have the immediate next meal with pr=
asAdam on the floor like the traditional brahminical style ?
6. Can I put t=
he raksha on my kids foreheads if they did not take bath by the time hOmam =
is finished ?

Some of the questions may sound funny, still I wanted to kno=
w if there are any strict adherences.

Btw, I have done my second Chandi ho=
mam today; technically first in a copper havan kund :-)

regards
rAma
