Not only Dara Sikhoh but even the 9th Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur was executed b=
y Aurangzeb. Ramakrishna used to say that all the Sikh Gurus were partial i=
ncarnations of one Rishi. Tegh Bahadur formed an army to protect Hindus in =
Kashmir from forcible conversion. He was called by Hindus as the "shield of=
 India". On being captured, he was tortured mercilessly and asked to conver=
t to Islam and/or perform miracles in public to convince that he is a genui=
ne man of God. Tegh Bahadur stubbornly refused to do both, and he was behea=
ded. After his death the decline of Aurangzeb started in full force.

hal Prince)
 

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

Dara Shikoh was the eldest son of Mughal e=
mperor Shah Jahan and his wife 
Mumtaz Mahal (in whose honor Shah Jahan bui=
lt Taj Mahal). He was a 
spiritually elevated soul. He believed that search=
 for god was the same 
all over the world through ages and believed that co=
rrect answers were 
found by great seers in various parts of the world at v=
arious times. As 
these findings are often expressed allegorically, underst=
anding any 
single version becomes tough but putting multiple versions toge=
ther 
gives better insight.

He studied under Sufi Islamic saints and also =
studied Hindu scriptures. 
He put them together and tried to find some comm=
on ground. His 
conclusions were recorded in "Majma ul-Bahrain" (The Mingli=
ng of Two 
Oceans). He detailed the similarities between Vedantic and Sufi =
notions 
of the Absolute Truth.

He learnt Sanskrit and, taking help from s=
cholars and ascetics of 
Varanasi, translated 52 Upanishads, Yoga Vasishtha=
m and Bhagavad Gita 
(what a wonderful and thoughtful selection!) into the =
Persian language. 
He believed that Upanishads are the book referred to in =
Quran as Kitab 
al-Maknun (The Hidden Book)!

He saw this as his mission an=
d spent much of his time and energy in this 
translation effort. As though =
this was indeed what he was born for, his 
life ended a couple of years aft=
er he finished this work. He was 
persecuted by the clergy and his younger =
brother Aurangazeb and was 
executed.

Interestingly, his work served an im=
portant purpose. Apart from laying 
foundation for an integration of Hindu =
and Muslim philosophies, it was 
the first step in awakening the Western in=
tellectual circles to the 
wisdom of Vedanta. Twelve years after his death,=
 a French visitor took 
the Persian translation to France and that laid the=
 foundation for 
awakening European interest in Indian philosophy.

Had he =
become the Mughal emperor, which was expected at some stage, 
world history=
 would have been so different. His ambitious younger 
brother Aurangazeb di=
d some machinations and won the throne finally. 
Again, had he left Dara Sh=
ikoh alone and enjoyed the throne, world 
history would have been so differ=
ent. He made the singular sin of 
killing Dara Shikoh. Dara Shikoh was not =
a normal soul and this Brahma 
Hatya was a terrible sin. The weight of such=
 a huge sin was needed to 
pull down a strong empire. Mughal empire fell so=
on.

We do not know the divine plan fully. We need to play our role as we s=
ee 
it in this divine drama and trust the director (god) to have a solid 
s=
cript that ties everything together!

Best regards,
Narasimha
