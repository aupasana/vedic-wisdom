=C2=A0Dear Srikanth,

Jai Ma Durga!

<<I would not want to argue ..>>

Ne=
ver stop yourself from arguing if you think your point of view has logic! I=
 do it always, irrespective of consequences. So your mail and view point is=
 thoroughly welcome as far as I'm concerned.

I will try to explain a few p=
oints from your reply, as I see it.

<<It is not their identity that you se=
e, it is the identity which we have been exposed to since ages. Just an ana=
logy, Tendulkar may actually be a great father at home but we only saw the =
perceivable cricketer aspect of him as it is known to your outside world wh=
ich dwells on popularity or a pronounced thing. Kali is dreadful Goddess to=
 many who see her physical aspect but I did see many homes in Kolkata prayi=
ng her as family Goddess. All experiences are PERSONAL in nature between us=
 and the deity and can be abstract from a different view point.>>


You see=
 my basic point is that Tendulkar is a cricketing genius to 120 Crore India=
ns, while his identity as a father is limited to 2 children. If you approac=
h Tendulkar and call him father, he may feel weird about it.=C2=A0 Now deit=
ies of course are far more subtle and complex. One of names of Kaali in her=
 sahashranama is also=C2=A0Lalita. If you worship Kaali and expect Her to c=
ome to you in the form of Lalita, because the Sahasrahanama of=C2=A0Kaali h=
as the name Lalita,=C2=A0=C2=A0chances are that=C2=A0it may result in=C2=A0=
a hodgepodge. In the worst case it may result in fright. To give a very cru=
de example, this is like buying the DVD for the movie "The Exorcist" while =
consciously and sub-consciously expecting to see "Kaho Na Pyar Hai"!

Yes K=
aali is the most worshipped deity in Bengal for various historical reasons,=
 chief of which being that fantastic amount of Kali worshippers have lived =
in Bengal/Assam/Tripura/Odisha. This has caused=C2=A0the notion of Kali to =
get ingrained in the very culture. Even sufis in Bengal worship Kaali. But =
the key is to accept Her and love Her, AS SHE IS! Which means, say if you f=
ind the garland of skulls on her neck and the skull in her hand disturbing,=
 or if you find the blood-dripping from the freshly cut head in Her hand di=
fficult to relate to, you cannot cannot replace=C2=A0those from her iconogr=
aphy and expect to get clear results from your worship. Love Her the way Sh=
e is, in her ferocity and wildness and beauty. When you do that, you're gam=
e.=C2=A0Yes She=C2=A0can be dreadful, but that is how She is loved by her d=
evotees, without trying to modify Her innate nature and characteristics. Re=
late to Her as Ma, but don't ask Her to remove the skulls. 

The=C2=A0tradi=
tional=C2=A0idea, which I believe to be correct,=C2=A0is to worship the for=
m in the way it is and love and relate to it in all its attributes. I know =
a certain person who used to=C2=A0worship a very fierce form of Devi but me=
ntally was=C2=A0unable to relate to that form. She was adviced by her guru =
to do so, who used to worship that fierce form himself. When I asked her wh=
at does she feel about the deity, she said I mentally think of Her of Gouri=
 but perform the ritual for the fierce form=C2=A0as my Guru asked me to. I =
of course had no business interfering in the relationship between a Guru an=
d his disciple and so kept my mouth shut, but personally I was extremely sk=
eptical of this approach. When you can't even love=C2=A0the form you are wo=
rshipping, then what kind of worship is that? Later she met another individ=
ual who acted as a mentor and gave her a mantra of a much milder form of Go=
d. Today=C2=A0the lady spends nearly=C2=A08 hours every day immersed in the=
 worship of
 that milder=C2=A0form. Her spiritual life leap-frogged once sh=
e started worshipping the milder form of God. Thats why the Tantras stress =
so heavily on the importance of=C2=A0correct form for each individual. 



=
It is not my contention that worshipping an urga deity is difficult or simp=
le compared to worshipping a milder form. Both are difficult and to succeed=
 in any worship=C2=A0a combination of various factors must fall in place. I=
t's like trying to judge, which among Rugby and Table-tennis, is a more dif=
ficult game. Some like one, some like the other, but you cannot pass a judg=
ement about which is more dificult. 

-Take Care

=C2=A0 
Jai Maa Durge.

=
Rajarshiji,

Again, My two cents with my own humble understanding:

It is n=
ot their identity that you see, it is the identity which we have been expos=
ed to since ages. Just an analogy, Tendulkar may actually be a great father=
 at home but we only saw the perceivable cricketer aspect of him as it is k=
nown to your outside world which dwells on popularity or a pronounced thing=
. Kali is dreadful Goddess to many who see her physical aspect but I did se=
e many homes in Kolkata praying her as family Goddess. All experiences are =
PERSONAL in nature between us and the deity and can be abstract from a diff=
erent view point.

Our Subjective experience is based on density of=C2=A0 K=
armas and the associated Vasanas accumulated over several births coupled wi=
th your present life (Intensity of it depends on several variables in/out o=
f our control) Sadhana. Mother will reveal the respective band of her spect=
rum as you progress further using your free will carefully is my view exact=
ly as your physical mother knows when you feel hungry and not in right fram=
e of mind etc etc.(Though over simplified a bit)

In general we all wish to=
 pursue sadhana with a thought that she is not very far away and we indeed =
have a chance to reach her or abide by her.

I'm an ant at the foot hills o=
f a mountain and cannot talk about a glorious mountain like "Sri Lalitha De=
vi". I worship the Durga energies of her when I go on the karmic field and =
worship her play as Lalitha when I enjoy the bhoga(healthy body,Mind,Intell=
ect and Materials) she gave me unasked.

I would not want to argue but you =
will find many such ugra names in "Gayathri Sahasranaam" too.
=C2=A0
This s=
ynergistic concept of the Divine Mother was pursued in the sacred literatur=
e on Mother worship
across many centuries. In the Devi Mahatmya we find the=
 Divine Mother as the most beautiful, benevolent,and tranquil=E2=80=94saumy=

=80=94but at the same time the
most terrible, whenever required. Thus, the =
Divine Mother assumes all the characteristics at one time:the wisdom and sp=
iritual intellect of Saraswati, the redeeming spirit of Durga, the wealth, =
splendour,and cornucopia of Lakshmi or Sri, and the terribleface of Kali or=
 Gouri.

ater she met another individual who acted as a mentor and gave her a mantra=
 of a much milder form of God. Today the lady spends
 nearly 8 ho=
urs every day immersed in the worship of that milder form. Her spiritu=
al life leap-frogged once she started worshipping the milder form of God. T=
hats why the Tantras stress so heavily on the importance of correct fo=
rm for each individual. </DIV>

<div>Jai Maa Durge.<BR><BR>Rajarshiji,<BR><BR>Again, My two cents with my=
 own humble understanding:<BR><BR>It is not their identity that you see, it=
 is the identity which we have been exposed to since ages. Just an analogy,=
 Tendulkar may actually be a great father at home but we only saw the perce=
ivable cricketer aspect of him as it is known to your outside world which d=
wells on popularity or a pronounced thing. Kali is dreadful Goddess to many=
 who see her physical aspect but I did see many homes in Kolkata praying he=
r as family Goddess. All experiences are PERSONAL in nature between us and =
the deity and can be abstract from a different view point.<BR><BR>Our Subje=
ctive experience is based on density of  Karmas and the associated Vas=
anas accumulated over several births coupled with your present life (Intens=
ity of it depends on several variables in/out of our control) Sadhana. Moth=
er will reveal the respective band of her spectrum as you progress
 further=
 using your free will carefully is my view exactly as your physical mother =
knows when you feel hungry and not in right frame of mind etc etc.(Though o=
ver simplified a bit)<BR><BR>In general we all wish to pursue sadhana with =
a thought that she is not very far away and we indeed have a chance to reac=
h her or abide by her.<BR><BR>I'm an ant at the foot hills of a mountain an=
d cannot talk about a glorious mountain like "Sri Lalitha Devi". I worship =
the Durga energies of her when I go on the karmic field and worship her pla=
y as Lalitha when I enjoy the bhoga(healthy body,Mind,Intellect and Materia=
ls) she gave me unasked.<BR><BR>I would not want to argue but you will find=
 many such ugra names in "Gayathri Sahasranaam" too.<BR> <BR>This syne=
rgistic concept of the Divine Mother was pursued in the sacred literature o=
n Mother worship<BR>across many centuries. In the Devi Mahatmya we find the=
 Divine Mother as the most beautiful, benevolent,and

 spiritual intellect of Saraswati, the redeeming spirit of Durga, the wealt=

;></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN> </DIV></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN>Traditio=
nally, so I am told, this verse is ment to understand that She sits on a th=
rone held by five corpses. These five corpses are of Brahma, Vishnu, R=
udra, Mahadeva and Sadashiva. Simply put, She is representative energy of e=
verything. Personally, I don't like this explanation. To me the five pretas=
 are the five koshas surrounding the human organism. She controls all of th=
em.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN> </DIV>
<DIV><SPAN>Now if we take t=
his line literally, She sits on an asana of five pretas - spirits of a=
 kind. You must have read the biographies of many siddhas who worshipped La=
lita Tripursundari. How many have you found who has had a vision of Her in =
this form, sitting on corpses? The Lalita Sahashranama is a complete text o=
f ALL possible attirbutes of Lalita Tripursundari. Of these, what percentag=
e of names do you find which can be described as ugra?</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><S=
PAN></SPAN> </DIV>
<DIV><SPAN>Consider this example. If you ask 100 pe=
ople who is Sachin Tendulkar, all will reply that he is a great cricketer. =
But isn't Tendulkar also a father, brother, son, husband, a responsible cit=
izen of India, a consumer at the local grocery store, and for all you know =
maybe even a reasonable bathroom singer? These are all his identities too. =
But why don't we refer to them when we speak of Tendulkar? Because his cent=
ral defining identity for us is his cricket.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN=
> </DIV>
<DIV><SPAN>Same way, each deity eventually is everything. But=
 each has its own "defining identity" which has its own set of attributes. =
Of all the people worshipping Lalita Tripursundari at this very moment, pro=
bably a 2 percent or less will realize Her in this lifetime. Of these,=
 99.9999999999999999999 percent will realize Her ONLY in Her chief ide=
ntity as Lalita. How many will, or have till date, actually realized that f=
orm of Lalita Tripursundari sitting on a pretasana? And why is this form&nb=
sp;so remote and so uncommon for most standard worshippers of Lalita Tripur=
sundari? These are questions to ponder!</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN>&nbs=
p;</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN> </DIV>
<DIV><SPAN>I've very little knowled=
ge of worship of Sri Lalita Tripursundari, either theoritical or from the p=
oint of practical worship, but if there is beauty in this world, it is=
 Her. Like a five course gourmet meal, like a sublime poetry, lik=
e an efforlessly brilliant music, like a dazzling play of lights, like=
 a classic Tendulkar shot,.... all these combined together and much much&nb=
sp;more ...you feel and wish that it never comes to an end. It is difficult=
 to describe the feeling that She evokes, but it's like a flood of pure, di=
stilled essence of beauty and you feel like there is nothing more to b=
e done, no goal to reach, no path to walk, no battles to fight - simpl=
y bask in the depth of the moment because therein lies fullfilment and a wh=
ole new world! She banishes the very roots of the sense of strife and uglin=
ess from your system... the knowledge that She exists is enough to incapaci=
tate you from asking anything
 more. She is THE greatest poetry of all=
