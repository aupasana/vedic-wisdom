Respected members,
As per Hindu scholars, the present time is Kali Yuga. Bu=
t in the books
"Autobiography of a Yogi" and "The Holy science", the presen=
t time is
said to be Dwapara Yuga. What is correct?
Below is the extract fr=
om the wiki page
"The position of the world in the Dwapara Sandhi era at pr=
esent (AD
1894) is not correctly shown in the Hindu Almanacs. The astronome=
rs and
astrologers who calculate the almanacs have been guided by wrong
ann=
otations of certain Sanskrit scholars (such as Kulluka Bhatta) of the
dark =
age of Kali Yuga, and now maintain that the length of Kali Yuga is
432,000 =
years, of which 4994 have (in AD 1894) died, leaving 427,006
years still re=
maining. A dark prospect! And fortunately one not true"
