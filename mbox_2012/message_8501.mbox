Namaste Sir,

=A0
Though this is basical=
ly correct, the problem is that most of us do not have perfect shraddha! In=
 fact, if one has perfect devotion and surrender, then no ritual is needed.=
 Every action and thought of such a person becomes a ritual and a pure offe=
ring to Lord!
=A0
Because we are not in that position, we use rituals to pu=
rify us, cause internal transformation and improve our surrender, over time=
. So we should follow rules and technicalities to the best of our ability a=
nd not rely completely on our imperfect devotion. At the same time, don't a=
lso go to the other extreme and think that rules are of utmost importance. =
One should strike a balance.

Yes, real brahmanas are becoming rare. Many priests mis-pronounce=
 badly and show a lack of understanding of basics. Some even display the op=
posites of the Brahmana qualities mentioned by Lord Krishna (see 11.17.16 a=
t http://vedabase.net/sb/11/17).
=A0
However, it is not a good idea to judg=
e someone, unless there is a dharmik need to do so. A priest who mis-pronou=
nces may be clean at heart and god may be pleased with him. A priest who pr=
onounces perfectly may be proud and that is no good. These matters are too =
subtle to judge casually.

I am reminded of an anecdote. One young man who lives near us reads =
Durga Saptashati and is comfortable with the text and also does a daily hom=
am. Once he went to his native village in AP, India and attended some annua=
l celebrations at a local temple. The priest was doing Chandi homam, where =
Durga Saptashati is used. He was reading it with mistakes. This young man w=
as also reading along, because he knows it well. After a little while, the =
priest apparently told him, "you are reading better than me. I think it mak=
es sense if you do the homam instead of me" and asked the young man to sit =
in the main seat and make offerings while chanting.
=A0
When I heard this, =
I mentally bowed to the priest. Pronunciation and knowledge are secondary. =
Devotion and wisdom are primary. Knowledge without wisdom can bring pride a=
nd one can get stuck. OTOH, wisdom brings humility, honesty and surrender a=
nd takes one closer to god. As one becomes wiser, one starts to act selfles=
sly, without silly agendas, for universal good, and with a higher sense of =
purpose.
=A0

Narasimha
