Hi LaxmiNarayanji,

It's very interesting to hear about your experiences wi=
th the Name. 

I agree with your suggestion that She be worshipped for Her =
sake as well, not just for attaining Him. But in my mind, Durga, Lakshmi, H=
ari and Hara are all One, so I feel I worship them all when I say the mantr=
a Om Namo Narayanaya (for that matter, I feel I worship Allah, Buddha and J=
ehovah too when I repeat this mantra). I feel all these exist in Narayana. =
While I love the forms of Hari and Durga especially, and find them the easi=
est to talk to, I also find the forms of Radha and Shiva enchantingly beaut=
iful. The Hare Krishnas say that Krishna can only be attained through the G=
race of Radha. Many saints have said in the past that the mother is always =
easily accessible, always close to her children, keeping an eye on them and=
 they can speak with her freely.....the father tends to be a bit more dista=
nt....and only the Mother can introduce a child to it's Father! This idea s=
ort of appeals to my mind. So I pester/worship Durga to attain both Hari an=
d Her too (they are One of course). And also, to attain the formless God th=
at is beyond them both. I feel it is She who keeps me on the path, and keep=
s my sadhana going. Without her, there's no doubt, that all would be lost. =


Dubeyji,

Thanks for the links....I found the articles very interesting. =
Not quite sure what to make of the one on sleep paralysis, but all I can sa=
y is, I will certainly keep up the chanting before bedtime! 

Best wishes,
=

Aparna

senior lady Swami who initiated me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late =
hour of 11 pm, she very kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it=
 could have been some real negative force or just something from my imagina=
tion. Either way, she reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause=
 it, and repeating the Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting =
before bedtime to avoid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of =
the Mahamantra before going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the li=
