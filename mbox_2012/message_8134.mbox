Hello...

My heart goes out to you...as i read your post...it reminds me of=
  my late mother who seemed to be person of Godly inclination but would hav=
e outbursts of temper acompanied by very foul language...after which she wo=
uld pray God forgive me oh how i have sinned etc etc. I came to have this p=
roblem as well although in another compartment of paap. What i came to real=
ize is that there are obstructors or so called entities which we have attra=
cted due to our karmic propensities. And by reciting kavacham like Chandi k=
avacha or Sri Sudarshana kavacha that i was able by the grace to repel such=
 entities or my attraction to situations that caused a fall and retrieve my=
 innermost natural sense of goodness.  The whole point is that no matter wh=
at is going on or who or what is 'out there' i will not succumb to the doub=
t that God is removed from me.  That only seems to make the problem worse w=
ith bad results.  I cannot disregard you or hate you for coming here in a p=
ublic forum and asking for help.

However...no one can 'save' you from your=
 doubts only your sincere effort to give yourself a break and also to recit=
e the kavach whichever one you choose...will save you...

In the Devyatharv=
asheerSham it says:

namaste astu bhagavati maatarasmaan paahi sarvataH

Oh=
 Mother you are the empress of the universe we bow to you!
protect us in ev=
eryway.

Then it goes on to state:

saiShaaShTau vasavaH |saiSaikaadasha ru=
draaH |saiShaa dvaadashaadityaaH | saiSha vishvedevaaH somapaa asomapaashca=
 | saiShaa yaatudhaanaa asuraa rakShaMsi pishaacaa yakSha siddhaaH | saiSha=
 sattv rajas tamaaMsi | saiSha brahma viShNu rudra roopiNee | saiSha prajaa=
patIndra manavaH | saiSha grahanakShatra jyotIMsi | kalaakaaShThaadi kaalar=
oopiNee | taamahaM praNaumi nityam ||

She is of 8 forms of wealth-Vasus. S=
he is the 11 relievers of suffering-Rudras. She is the 12 sond of enlighten=
ment-Adityas. She is all the Gods drink the nectar of devotion and those wh=
o do not. She is the lowest concerns of the mind, the confusions and the go=
od spirits and attainments of perfection. She is truth and light activity a=
nd rest. She is the form of Brahmaa ViSNu and Rudra. She is the lord of all=
 beings-Prajaapati and Lord Indra the manifestation of reason governing the=
 senses. She is the planets and and the light of the stars. She is the form=
 of time and its divisions. We continually offer her obeisance.

paapaapaha=
ariNeeM deveeM bhukti mukti pradaayineem | 
anantaaM vijayaaM shuddhaaM sha=
aNyaaM shivadaaM sivaaM ||

To She who destroys sin and confusion the grant=
or of enjoyment and liberation, who resides within, the giver of victory, w=
ithout flaw or imperfection, the true competent refuge, bestower of welfare=
, and the infinite energy of goodness, to that Goddess we continually offer=
 our obeisance. 

Warm Regards......Ajaya
