Dear Sree Narasimha

Any plan to publish the manual for performing sudarsha=
na homam?

I heard recently that the best time to do Ganapathi homam is bet=
ween 6:20 and 7:40am especially if one wants to perform this homam to appea=
se Ketu.

What is your take on this?

Thanks for sharing publicly such valu=
able information which is hard to come by in India, let alone abroad.
