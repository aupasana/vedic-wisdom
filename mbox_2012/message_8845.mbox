Balancing Spirituality and Prosperity in Sanatana Dharma
A New Video Event =
With
Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

Too many people hold the misconception =
that Vedic spirituality is too
"other-worldly" to be of practical value in =
today's world, and that one must
chose to have either a life of spiritualit=
y or a life of prosperity. One or the
other...but not both! This is, howeve=
r, no more than an uninformed stereotype
about Vedic spirituality. Sanatana=
 Dharma is clear that we can - and must - have
a balanced and whole life in=
 which we have the ability to attain both spiritual
and material benefit. A=
s the incomparable Dharma Master, Sri Dharma Pravartaka
Acharya, demonstrat=
es in this powerful video, Vedic spirituality is the most
practical, scient=
ific, reasonable and prosperous worldview on Earth. It provides
us with the=
 proper perspective through which we can have it all!
