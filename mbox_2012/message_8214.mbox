Dear Sunil,

As per shastra, starting from the day of upanayana, the child performs
homa, japa, tarpana etc. If anyone wants to teach their child spiritual
practices such as homa, they have the support of shAstra.

Developing a sense of spirituality, reverence for scriptions, and basic
Sanskrit skills is a great suggestion for everyone. However, in my opinion,
it is not a pre-requisite for homa or any other spiritual practice.

What I know is that homa is helping me develop a sense of spirituality, and
is teaching me the true meaning of scriptures (without having to "study"
them). Sanskrit has helped me, but those who do homa with zero sanskrit
knowledge will progress just fine.

As a result of saying that homa is a powerful spiritual practice, some
people have become scared of it. Homa is a simple, regular, normal, everday
spiritual karma that is extremely "light" and safe for those who are doing
it as a spiritual practice. After all, shastra has told us that everyone
should do it, starting from a very young age.


> Many words in samskrita (not 'sanskrit')


When I speak in English, I say and write Sanskrit. When I speak in
Sanskrit, I say and write "samskritam". In English, it *is* Sanskrit, in
spite of what the current 'speak samskritam' movement has to say about it.
And anyways, this has nothing whatsoever to do with our discussion :-)


> Many words in samskrita have multiple layers of meanings


What a wonderful language. One of my favorite mantras is the popular mantra
that is recited as a prayer to the earth "pRthvi tvayA ...". Actually, this
is known as the "Asana-mahAmantra", and it is quite a nice
mahAmantra. People who use it should try focusing on it, rather than just
quickly reciting it while their body is not still. I believe that it has
many layers of meaning !

sasneham,

   ajit
