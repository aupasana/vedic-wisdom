=C2=A0Dear Utpal,

<<
It may require a LOT to reject philosophy of giant =
such as adi Shankara and yet some one may not be able to reject afterall. >=
>

Philosophy is pure rational thought. Spirituality on the other hand is e=
xperiential. One can sit in an armchair and contemplate on philosophy, but =
the same is not possible in case of spirituality. These two are different. =
Philosophy gives a logical framework of understanding something. There coul=
d be philosophy of science, a philosophy of ethics, a philosophy of spiritu=
ality, a philosophy of epistemology (the investigations into the process of=
 acquiring knowledge) etc.

That Sri Adi Shankara was a fantastic spiritual=
 giant, I have no doubt (which I have already stated in my previous email. =
Vibhuti of God). I am also sure that the very presence of such a man of suc=
h spiritual stature would have naturally drawn masses towards him.=C2=A0 It=
 happens with all great personalities. They have a magnetism which extends =
way beyond after their death.

However, to understand, appreciate, criticiz=
e, debate, analyses, comparatively-evaluate any philosophy of any individua=
l is not that difficult and is a valid rational process. 

While future is =
always uncertain, but chances look remote for me that I would find Mayavada=
 more attractive. It was Sri Adi Shankara's Mayavada - as is understood and=
 propagated by his followers - which I had studied when I was first trying =
to get a grasp of Hindu philosophy. It a nice, compact and easily understan=
dable philosophy. Possibly one the chief reasons why most=C2=A0 intellectua=
ls like his Adwaitha apart from being attracted by his personality. It is e=
asier to debate from Sri Shankara's stand-point. At that time I liked it. L=
ater as I got acquainted myself with more varieties of Hindu philosophy, I =
found others more comprehensive and covering more essential points and usin=
g a very, if I may use this phrase, a bottom-up approach to understanding r=
eality, while Sri Shankara's philosophy is a very top-down approach, with a=
 greater thrust on the top and an indeterminate leftover in the bottom. Sha=
nkara's Adwaitha, Ramanujacharya's Visistha-adwaitha,
 Vallavacharya's Sudd=
ha Adwaitha - so many varieties of philosophy.

I have a personal view abou=
t judging philosophy. For everything that one giant has said, there is alwa=
ys another one who has said exactly the opposite. And a third and forth one=
 who came up with a different view-point, differing with all the previous o=
nes. And each of these giants have spoken with the utmost conviction of the=
ir own realizations of truths. So personality and stature of the philosophe=
r should play no role in an objective analysis of the philosophy. Just like=
 the personality and stature of a mathematician is of no use in=C2=A0 judgi=
ng the correctness of a mathematical theory.=C2=A0 Spiritually, the reality=
 is same (and it maybe a very complex reality). But philosophically each ha=
ve differences which cannot the ignored. In such an intellectual climate, i=
n my personal opinion, it is fair enough to discard one philosophy for anot=
her, after a thorough and detailed contemplation of the pros and cons.

Fro=
m a spiritual view-point all this is utterly meaningless. Which ever spirit=
ual giant one chooses to hang on to, if sincere faith, reverence and effort=
 is engaged, surely progress will happen in time. But philosophy is a anoth=
er matter.

[To make my stand clearer, let me say hypothetically that IF by=
 some strange miracle of God, Sri Adi Shankara were to come and stand infor=
nt of me, I would have no qualms about falling at his feet and bowing down =
to him and asking for his blessings, for his spiritual stature is unquestio=
nable. Yet I will still not be agreeable to the philosophy he propagated du=
ring the time he lived.]

-Best Regards

Dear Rajarshi,
=

>>>Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his philosophy<<<

actually =
"rejecting" may not be the right word you probably mistakenly used. It coul=
d be that it does not attract you that much incomparision to the other one =
and/or as in case of Aurobindo's philosophy which did not make sense earlie=
r and which now makes a lot of sense. same way, it is possible for Adi Shan=
kara's adwait.

It may require a LOT to reject philosophy of giant such as =
adi Shankara and yet some one may not be able to reject afterall. That is M=
HO.

Best Regards,

Utpal

therefore it's extremely important to keep actively working on ourselves to=
 increase detachment, objectivity, genuine internal surrender (when that ha=

  is one of the sanest advices, ever. In the milieu of spirituality, too ma=
ny people get caught up in the less important - aka, visions, 'experiences'=
, tough-penances, complex rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while forgetti=

ody resulting in greater surrender to the Divine, greater equanimity to lif=
e situations, an abiding calm and peace, genuine humility, lessening of low=
er emotions like lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious attachme=
nts, such that eventually every action of the individual is like a consecra=
tion (sacrifice, yagjya) to the Divine. A life so transformed and so away f=
rom our average superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment on its=
 own. God is not the finish line of a bicycle race. It is the progressive u=

In this subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our own physical plane, th=
ere is a whole wide world of all possible forces, just like in our own worl=
d. It is a layer which is created out of force of pranashakti. This force o=
f pranashakti in humans beings is what causes all emotive movements on the =
consciousness - joy, happiness, love, passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, d=
isgust, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capable of influencing th=
e thinking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadhana and specially Tan=
trik sadhana, is to create a formation of the deity using ones own prana-sh=
akti through the aid of repeated rituals and procedures and mantras etc. If=
 you think carefully, you will realize that every idol, ever homa agni need=
s a pranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sadhaka used the force o=
f his/her
 own<br>
>  pranashakti to infuse life into a subtle formation=
 of the deity. Once this process is successfully done, this sublte formatio=
n of the deity which exists in the subtle plane, has a life of its own. It =
can then guide the sadhaka through the path and eventually, one day lead hi=
m/her to the real abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyond this=
 astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakti, and=
 make it identify/create such an astral formation of the deity, it becomes =
an even more powerful force. It is, from our limited human perspective, as =
much a powerful entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not the actual De=
ity yet. Exactly the same thing has been described by Sri Vimalananda in th=
e Aghora books, if you read carefully.=C3=82  <br>
> <br>
> When=
 a sadhaka has been able to associate with such an astral formation of the =
deity, it can guide the sadhaka along the path provided the sadhaka also is=
 trying to work hard and sincerely to reach the causal planes (the real spi=

he difference, if you ask, between this astral formation of the deity and t=
he real deity is that, the former is neither bound nor capable by itself of=
 causing a complete and total transformation of the average human nature wi=
thout a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one reaches the plane of=
 the Great Gods, which is where the real deity exists, one cannot avoid bei=
ng transformed in mind, emotions, body etc. And what kind of a transformati=
on will it be? One that will reflect to the world as a greater and genuine =
humility, sense of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL time and unfailingly=
, a complete withdrawal of lower nature of man - lust,
 anger,<br>
>  je=
alousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace, calm, detachment, mental-il=
lumination, genuine compassion, a widening of the consciousness. Such an in=
dividual, even if he/she just sits down next to another person, will exude =
a silent strong peace and unselfish love which will automatically calm the =
minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the authentic, =
unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of the great deities. This comes=
 even if one deity is properly realized in the causal planes of existence. =
But the astral formation of the same deity, which is created by the force o=
f our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case maybe, is often not capable =
of affecting this kind of a total transformation in a sadhaka. That is why =
it is limited. It is not limited because it can't=C3=82  get me a bett=

You surety is incorrect. There were certain events which happened in the la=

personality of the Divine Mother, and the more I meditated on Her, the more=
 would thoughts pour into my mind that my understanding of spirituality is =
imperfect and has serious flaws. I tried, using my own meditations to find =
out what was wrong or rather imperfectly understood, what needed rethinking=
. First question I asked myself was, what is the aim of spirituality? My mi=

pages. They were bouncers going one mile over my head. Three years ago some=

 rest I rejected, partly due to ignorance and partly due to egoistic arroga=
nce. Never opened any of his writing since then. This year, as my sadhana w=
as going on and as I was instinctively trying to correct the flaws in my un=
derstanding, one day while meditating I had an inner thought in the form of=
 an image, which told me that I should start reading Sri Aurobindo but in a=
 very specific manner. The image was very clear in my inner-eye, and thorou=
ghly pressing on my consciousness. I opened his book again, and read it in =
the prescribed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense to me. What I wa=

 understand<br>
>  from his writi=
ngs with much deeper clarity.=C3=82  Many of my own experiences made m=
ore sense to me. Many sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a n=
ew light. I read 40 - 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me to=
 stop at a certain point of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 =
% I will have to first make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational=
 mind will distort the information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected fi=

un. <br>

tried best to make me "see the truth" by such grandiose statements that=C3=

 be necessarily lesser. Or that I was making an egoistic denouncement. Both=
 of which are million light-years away from the truth. That Sri Adi Shankar=
