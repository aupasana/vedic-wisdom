Namaste,

<<Instead I emphasized detachment and equanimity, because those a=
re the TRUE signs of enlightenment.>>

Very true. Rishi Vasistha says to Lo=
rd Rama, "He who is friendly (internally) even to one who is about to murde=
r him is a seer of Truth. Adoration of one who has not risen above likes an=
d dislikes (raga and dvesa) is futile. Only he who is free from egoistic an=
d volitional activity and who is utterly non-attached to anything here, is =
genuinely liberated". 

As Lord Krishna says in the Gita, 

"56. He whose m=
ind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after 
pleasures, and w=
ho is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a 
sage of steady wis=
dom.57. He who is everywhere without attachment, on meeting with anything g=
ood 
or bad, who neither rejoices nor hates, his wisdom is fixed"

The same=
 truth has been repeated thousands of times across scriptures and by differ=
ent enlightened men across centuries.=C2=A0 Perfect equanimity in thoughts,=
 words and deeds is the ultimate goal to be attained. Any thing else, any m=
ystical experience etc, is helpful to the extent that it aids this goal. If=
 however, a mystical experience does not produce internal detachment and re=
sults in increasing pride (even subconscious pride) it can prove detrimenta=
l in the final equation.

-Regards
=C2=A0Rajarshi

Namaste Lalit,
=C2=A0
Thanks for g=
iving me free publicity by forwarding a link to what I consider to be one o=
f my best writings ever on spiritual matters:
=C2=A0
> http://groups.yahoo.=
com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/7948
=C2=A0
This particular writing was the =
culmination of a lot of observation, contemplation and churning on various =
issues related to spirituality over a long time. Of course, there will be s=
ome who think it is nonsense, but there will also be some who will like it =
very much.
 Thanks for forwarding the link to a wide group of people withou=
t my asking!
=C2=A0
Just for the record, I do not consider myself a "spirit=
ual guru" and nor do I want any followers.
=C2=A0
My views are obviously no=
t perfect, because they are still evolving.
=C2=A0
I unconditionally put ou=
t my views so that anybody who wants to benefit can benefit and others can =
just ignore. I said at the start of the above mail, "If you don't like my 2=
 cents, kindly feel free to ignore me and follow your gurus and others whom=
 you may prefer." 
=C2=A0
Whether it is my spiritual writings or homam/Saty=
a Narayan vrat/tarpana manuals or Jyotish class MP3s or Jyotish software, t=
hey are all available to others freely and unconditionally and with genuine=
ly no strings attached. Feel free to benefit (if you think it is possible a=
t all to benefit) or simply ignore. Very simple.
=C2=A0
BTW, I have not dis=
regarded "experiencing enlightenment". I have intentionally downplayed myst=
ical experiences that may trap one and make one egoistic, so that one does =
not mistaken them for "englightenment". Instead I emphasized detachment and=
 equanimity, because those are the TRUE signs of enlightenment.
=C2=A0
Expe=
rience
 of equanimity, i.e. experiencing that one's mind is calm in situati=
ons 
in which it would've been agitated or angry or sad at earlier times, i=
s 
the real "experience" one needs to seek and perfect.When that "experienc=
e" is perfected, THAT is enlightenment.

Dear Audience,

Very i=

Shameless Agenda:

All False Writings On Kundalini

=C2=A0
To be clear, whether one'=

Kundalini is currently, is =
NOT a measure of one's spiritual progress.
=C2=A0
//

He doesn't learn that=
 awakening=C2=A0& kundalini are synonyms, since he lacks basic qualificatio=
n and experiences, he=C2=A0assumes kundalini awakening is signified by feel=
ing hot/cold/jolt only and since he never had these hot/cold/jolt expereinc=
es, he is giving so many reasonings, fact is, his assumptions and reasoning=
s all are wrong.
=C2=A0
Why these guys simply don't do sadhana and when God=
 enables them, give them mandate with "Atma Gyan" then they come to preachi=
