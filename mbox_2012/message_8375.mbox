Namaste Rajarshi ji,



T=
hank you for the very interesting information about tantra, a subject I kno=
w very little about. 



It sounds fascinating. Making an idol of Durga fro=
m the mud collected from the house of a widow and a prostitute! I interpret=
 that ritual to demonstrate that Durga abides in the heart of a prostitute =
as much as she does in the heart of a saint, and so the soil from both thei=
r houses is equally sacred. 



I'm glad to hear you say that tantra has so=
 many women of high spiritual calibre...that's very inspiring. What a pity =
we don't hear much about them.



I recently read a wonderful book about th=
e women saints of India, called "Daughters of the Goddess", written by an A=
merican devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen). She asked the same question=
 "Where are the women saints of India?". A Pandit ji replied, "just because=
 they don't stand on public stages and give seminars, doesn't mean they don=
't exist!". Linda then went on a pilgrimage to India and met Ammachi (of Ke=
rala), Anandi Ma and other living realised saints in the female form. I've =
met Amma, but would love to meet some of the yoginis and Bhairavis you ment=
ion.



I'm curious about tantra and would like to learn more about it. I l=
ike Japa as my main spiritual practice,  but I'm open to learning about oth=
er paths (tantra probably includes Japa for all I know). And learning more =
about Goddess worship would be great. I see Durga as my spiritual guide, ke=
eping me on the path, doing the Sadhana with me (because I'm too lazy to do=
 it on my own), and Hari as the goal (actually they're the same in my head =
and are both my goal as my divine parents). The cowherd girls of yore, clev=
er girls, knew that the Goddess alone could give them Hari...as we all know=
, they famously worshipped Katyayani asking for Krishna, and She gave Him t=
o them! 



Please could you reccommend some articles/books on tantra. I wo=
uld love to have a read and educate myself on this, and may be even, add so=
mething to my practice. My only worhip of Durga currently (aside from abusi=
ng and praising her alternately) is repeating her mantra Om Dum Durgayai Na=
maha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) randomly. (My main mantra that I got inti=
ated into from a Swami of the Sivananda tradition is Om Namo Narayanaya.) A=
nd I have recently added homams to my practice, albeit only once in 2 weeks=
, and I worship both her and Hari with it (it's not a perfect homam techniq=
ue wise, but I try and put a bit of heart in it. And if I can't find any he=
art, I blame Durga for not giving me any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I=
'm afraid, but as she made me, it's her own fault). 



Thanks again for th=
e message, and here's to tantra, the path that treats women as equals! 



=
Aparna

 Every worship of Durga that happens anywhere today is India is still a wat=

who were guilty of rampant human-sacrifices, would never dare to offer a wo=

> Which brings me to ranting a bit =
about the general injustice of our esteemed Durga. The Atman is sexless, bu=
t the Atman in female form has been treated worse than the Atman in male fo=
rm over the centuries...even today it is being murdered in the womb (female=
 foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it is deathless etc, but=
 while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in the form of women. I has=
ten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I'm furious with Durga. How=
 outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women were not allowed to b=
e initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why aren't there mo=
re women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is probably 1:10. It's =
bloody disheartening. And what is the point of covering us with ignorance (=
it's her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yelling at us for not bei=
ng wise (as she does in all the scriptures). If she wants to save us, she w=
ill have to create in us the
 desire<br>

sh my hands of the whole thing.<br>

t, tell her to tell us to chant. Like she told you to. It's not our fault.<=

 Om Namo Narayanaya repetition now. Who knows when it's time for the cremat=
ion ground? You did it for a select few, but not for the rest of us million=
s- Damn you Durga. <br>
