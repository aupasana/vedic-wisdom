Namaste Sir,
=A0
I am replying to the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup without revea=
ling your identity.
=A0
1. Not really. It may bear fruit in next life or 10=
 lives later or in THIS life itself too! All are possible.
=A0
Imagine a pi=
peline with a lot of balls in it. If you throw a new ball forcefully into i=
t, it may get stuck and some old ball from long back may come out of it at =
the other end. However, it really depends on the density of balls stuck in =
the pipeline! If it's too dense, a ball thrown now may come after hundred b=
alls. If it's light, a ball thrown now may come out pretty quickly.
=A0
2. =
Any good or bad karmas done with identification and attachment will give th=
eir fruits (good or bad) and bind one. But karmas done with surrender and d=
etachment will not bind one. The goal of life is to keep performing good ka=
rmas to pay off debts incurred earlier and, in the process, reach a state o=
f detachment.
=A0
Action is not the problem. External world is not the prob=
lem. But expectation of fruit (reaction from the external world) from that =
action and attachment to it, is the problem. THAT is what binds us.
=A0
3. =
Yes, developing dispassion is the key. Compassion towards others, passion f=
or doing good to others and dispassion towards any results coming from it, =
is useful. Premature dispassion towards life itself when one has many rinas=
 can block one. Instead, dispassion towards the results of actions while on=
e still performs best possible actions, is more helpful.
=A0
Feelings won't=
 go away easily. It is the job of mind to have "feelings". A good way to ov=
ercome them may be to direct them towards a larger sense of self than this =
ballon of blood and flesh (and the names world gives this ballon and the st=
ories worlds tells about it). Instead of looking at things from one's persp=
ective, seeing them from the perspective of others and feeling compassion f=
or them may be a better use of the ability (and tendency) of mind to have "=
feelings".
=A0
4. Yes, that is a good way of putting it.
=A0
5. Yes, they a=
re "hitting around the bush" and "the root is in our own self". However, as=
 we cannot normally see the root and can only see the bush, it is very usef=
ul to hit around the bush. It can eventually show us the root!
=A0
Best reg=
ards,
Narasimha

Dear PVRNR 

The concept of 'prarabdha karma' as i understood means a=
ll the experiences of the current life is a result of actions of our previo=
us lives. The fruits of actions of the current life will be experienced onl=
y in the next life as per this concept. 

If my understanding of the concep=
t is right then i have the=A0 following queries: 

1. No matter what one do=
es in the current life (like praying for health, money, etc.) it will only =
manifest in the next life. Then is it not just a coincidence if a prayer is=
 answered or sadhana bears material fruits (as it would have manifested any=
way even in the absence of any efforts in the current life since it was due=
 from the previous life)? 

2. If our birth is only to empty this karma i.e=
. a man doing good deeds will be born again to enjoy its pleasures and suff=
er pain for bad deeds, is it not necessary to absolutely refrain from any d=
eed either good or bad to avoid re-birth? 

3. Is it not enough to focus on=
 'sanchitha karma'=A0 in the present life and direct all our efforts in dev=
eloping dispassion towards material existence and empty the antahkarna of a=
ll the feelings and dispositions? 

4. Does every spiritual activity merely=
 try to entice the common person with material gains but has a hidden purpo=
se of liberating the mind of desires? (which is the only tangible result ex=
perienced from a sadhana) 

5. If the 4th point is true then prayer, homa, =
devotion, good deeds, austerities, penance, etc. are all hitting around the=
 bush. The root is in our own self. Absolute vigilance on=A0 self is all th=
at is needed to realise liberty and manifest at will ? 

Thank you for your=
 time and patience 

With regards, 
<deleted>
