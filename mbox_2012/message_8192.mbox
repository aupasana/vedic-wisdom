Madam Priya,

Pranam
I only wish to cater to one line of your post.

"""
sh=
ouldn't they experience the life in fullest form before endeavouring the pa=
th of spirituality."""

Errrrrrr........ What???
What exactly is the full f=
orm of life??
Are you telling her to wear an ochre robe and sending her off=
 to some jungle when you want her to do a homam? fancy words these, the pat=
h of spirituality and the likes..
Or do you want that she ruins herself fir=
st and then come to this path?
She can lead and experience a "full form of =
life" (in line with your definition), while doing a regular homam also. She=
 can enjoy her gucci, muchi and all the pradas of the world alongside the h=
omam.

I don't understand the apprehensions of the world with a homam, its =
not a ritual for destruction, its one of the most efficient, quick and inte=
nse ways of worship available to us today and has been for millenia. Agni d=
ev is one of the most benevolent beings out there, till the time you don't =
offend him ;)

When your daughter , (if she is comfortable with it, don't f=
orce it), does a homam, she can very well lead a "normal" life Priya madam,=
 alongside doing a homam.

Don't little kids go to temples?
Your daughter i=
s only inviting god in front of her in the fire and worshiping instead of g=
oing to the temple and what harm can worship bring????

Don't be scared, if=
 you think she'll do fine, go ahead with it and supervise the entire thing.=
 The form of 'the one' you invoke will take care, and hopefully take your d=
aughter under his/ her/ its wings!!
Rest of your concerns have been answere=
d by Utpal.

Now don't get offended by the above text and apologize. And do=
n't expect any apology from me and write me a reply saying " hawww, how cou=
ld you say such things, oh my gaaawwwwd!!"

Yee- haawwww!!!!

P.s. do more =
homam's (to anyone who reads this) (You never know when you will die, jaldi=
 jaldi karo.... jaldi, jaldi, time nahin hai.)

Namaste,
NoBody
