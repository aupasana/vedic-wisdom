Special Mantras
 Saturday,=
 05 July 2008 - Swami Veda Bharati


Mantras may be practiced with motives =
or without motives. With motives are *
sa-kama*, lit. =93with desire=94 for=
 fruit and result. Without motives are *
nish-kama*, =93without desire,=94 =
only to gain the purification leading to
liberation.

*Sa-kama* is of two k=
inds (1) to fulfill a personal desire, such as: may my
husband=92s nature c=
hange; may I grow rich, (2) a subtler kind is, I want to
live a life of pra=
yer, worship [or service], but practical obstacles come
in the way. =93I ca=
nnot pray or serve because my husband won=92t let me as he
becomes jealous.=
=94 To correct such situations, the practice is the same as
the first, but =
with an ultimate desire which is *nish-kama*. There the *
sa-kama* desire i=
s to pave the way for the *nish-kama* goal. Even the
desire for liberation =
may be dropped, and the mantra may be practised *
guru-prity-artham*, for g=
uru's satisfaction, to receive grace.

Those that are done *sa-kama* may be=
 for specific purposes, such as to ward
off or heal an illness, to prevent =
accidents foretold, to prolong life, to
alleviate financial problems, to ac=
hieve a specific goal such as to be able
to buy a house, or capture power, =
or improve an organization, or regain
friendship, or eliminate someone's an=
imosity towards oneself, and so forth.

Another subtle differentiation may =
be understood here. One may do such
undertakings (a) for the purpose of sel=
f-purification and liberation only,
or (b) to obtain a desired result, or (=
3) to attain the *siddhi*(s) of that
mantra. The formula of =93number of sy=
llables multiplied by hundred thousand
plus twenty per cent=94 is definitel=
y efficacious to achieve the *siddhi*,
that is to say, that one then has th=
e powers inherent in the mantra and is
able to use the mantra with just one=
 or three or such other minimum number
of remembrances to attain a desired =
result for oneself or for one=92s
students or seekers. (etc.)



Hope that =
helps!
