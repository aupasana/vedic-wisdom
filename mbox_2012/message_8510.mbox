Dear Aparnaji,
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 My deep thanks f=
or sending this lovingkind healing energy. These things keep happening in m=
y life. What ever the desire of Divine Mother?

How about doing =A0the Japa=
 of this Sacred and Healing mantra with me as you were suggesting to Dolly =
Jha. I know you are doing the purscharan of another mantra and have a =A0de=
manding life as a Dr. I also want to do first time only 11 thousands japa a=
nd not go for complete 1.25lacs. Last year I started this one but due to lo=
t of tension and other things gave up. I know many people can do lac japa i=
n 40 days or early.

I want to do 501 every day. It takes me 30/35 minutes.=
 So it will take, say about 25/26 days. I do not do haven but as you are do=
ing it it will be amazing for you to do, at the end of it, if you have neve=
r done it on your own. So in a relaxing way it will be a month.
This is all=
 my personal estimates. I do not use a Mala. I use a clock. At the start I =
center myself and drink some water. I then say prayers to align myself with=
 the Divine Beings whose Mantra and Swroop =A0I am going to meditate upon. =
At the end I again drink water. You might do things in a different way.

Se=
e if have time in your demanding everyday schedule=A0for this as well.
Take=
 care and thanks again,
LaxmiNarayan

Hello LaxmiNarayanji,

I'm sorry to hear =
you are having health problems and suffering pain. They say God gives troub=
les like illnesses as a blessing to those He loves a lot so they remember H=
im, and attain Him quickly. But I know from my own experience of terrible h=
ead-splitting migraines that it is not easy to appreciate this type of His =
'help' without grumbling a little (or a lot as in my case!). 

While saying=
 the Mahamrityunjaya mantra, I wish you a speedy recovery and restoration o=
f your good health.=A0 

Best wishes,

Aparna
