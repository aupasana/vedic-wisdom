Priya Ji

Narasimha ji will probably reply to your mail in time. I just wan=
ted to share my thoughts regarding the same. 

If the intention is only to =
do good to the departed soul and sense of duty towards one parents.I do not=
 see any problem why this should not be done.In fact one of the gurus I fol=
low often narrates the incident of people always scaring even good intentio=
ned ones from the Srividya path of worship of the goddess. My guru openly s=
ays one can keep the SriChakra Meru in one's house and perform an simple pu=
ja as long as the place if kept clean and some basic rules are followed. Th=
ere will be thousands if not hundreds of schools which will take up arms ag=
ainst that suggestion claiming that one would have to do an elaborate puja =
for 3 hrs to even attempt something like that.

Why should I one fear appro=
aching the mother in any form.Even in the fire of the Smashana she is still=
 one's mother. Whatever she gives she knows best.

Just trust the inner voi=
ce also known as the "atma guru " . The beautiful FAQ section that Narasimh=
a ji has written for the homa manual already answers some of these question=
s in a subtle way.


For every puja you do in the world there will be 100 o=
thers who claim you are not allowed to do it. Nothing should stand between =
a devotee and God. I am not trying to downplay the role of Intiation or rul=
es....if somebody is Intiated into a certain process good for them. He or s=
he will start off with a million dollars in the bank. It does not man any o=
ther commoner with great intentions should not work towards gaining those m=
illion dollars on his own.


Like I said if the action is not going to resu=
lt in guilt or fear for you , do not hesitate to take up any sadhana or act=
ion. Just listen to your inner voice.

:) Even for doing a homa one can com=
plicate it a thousand fold with deciding to find out if Agni is residing in=
 earth,heavens or the netherworld.One can also search for the perfect muhur=
ta.One can try to clean the floor a thousand times to make sure it is spotl=
ess...I am not providing an excuse for being lazy. As long as one does his =
best to his given maximum ...for all shakti flows from her.One should relax=
 and surrender to her wishes.


When one is a beggar at her doorstep there =
is nothing to fear...When one approaches her as a child there is nothing to=
 fear. 

Regards
Vemparla RamKishore
