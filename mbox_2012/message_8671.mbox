Namaste PVR guruvu garu.



I am extremely happy to share with you a miracu=
lous incident that took
place over the weekend at our residence, =91Mani Dw=
eepam=92 in Tirupati.



I had the rare opportunity to get the chandi homam=
 done by Kaalika ammaa=92s
beloved child, Swami Sathasivom garu.

 i came t=
o know about swamiji thru your emails and write ups.

The homam conducted o=
n astami and navami thithis(Sep 8th and 9th)  went
well by the grace of lor=
d shiva.

Immediately after the purnahuthi was done, the ashes in the homa =
kundam
took the form of lord Ganesh sighting  the north-east corner of the =
house
and it was clearly witnessed by all of us.

Attached the pic. The twi=
rled trunk, large ears, both the knees and a
partial mouse can be observed.=
 I am not at all exaggerating but I am
overwhelmed by the appearance of Gan=
esh, the remover of obstacles, by a
mere call of swami ji.



The divine ra=
diation emerging from swamij I=92s face attracted huge number of
people to =
our house. Everyone was waiting for their turn to touch swamiji=92s
feet an=
d have a word with him. Such is swamiji=92s charisma!!!!

Each and every ti=
me I had a  conversation with swamiji, I felt that I am
speaking to one of =
my family member. All the residents in our street also
experienced the same=
 feeling like mine.we are really indebted to swamiji
for stepping into our =
ordinary house and in inviting a divine guest for us.


I can=92t put into =
words, the happiness I experienced while interacting with
Renuka auntie and=
 Harsha. They are very warm and blessed people I have ever
met.

The divine=
 mother Lalitha Tripura sundari has showered her grace on me by
giving me t=
he Sajjana Sangathyam of Renuka auntie, Harsha, gopala Krishnan
swami and m=
uthu Krishnan anna.



In the holy feet of guru raghavendra,

I remain



T=
hanks,
