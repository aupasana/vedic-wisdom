Thanks for the links Priyank ji, I will check them out when I'm at a com=
puter next (am writing this from my phone on a train- on my way to attend a=
 talk by the Dalai Lama in Manchester, very curious to know what he's like)=
.

Sorry if I've offended people inadvertently. It really wasn't my intenti=
on. Anyway if Durga is upset with what I've said to her, I'm sure she'll ta=
ke me to task for it. But I will speak to her as I please- we each have a r=
ight to speak to God with anger as much as with love. Somebody wise once sa=
id, offer all emotions that arise to God- both the good and bad ones. So I =
will continue to direct anger at Durga if anger arises in my mind for any r=
eason. She is the only one who can handle it as she gave it to
me. 

I do r=
espect all members of this forum including those who are currently annoyed =
with me. Apologies. :) 

Have a good day everyone. Thanks Priyank ji, I'm n=
ot yet a gopi but would love to be. :) 

Regards,

Aparna
