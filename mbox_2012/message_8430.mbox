Greetings,

Hope you're all well, and that your sadhanas are going fantasti=
cally well (especially after we all told each other to get verrrry serious)=
. 

I've had a gruelling few shifts in hospital the last few days, includin=
g witnessing some unfortunately inevitable deaths in very sick people...som=
ething that has become part of my daily life as a doctor. It is weird to se=
e how the body loses all importance the moment it dies. It is also strange =
how a dead body looks just like an empty house...exactly like someone just =
left. It certainly makes one think that there must be something more to us =
than this fleshy cage. This cage that becomes unattractive in old age, fill=
ed with appalling miseries in serious illness, and hideous in death. 

It i=
s interesting to think about what one can do to help the sick and dying, wh=
en they reach a stage beyond all human aid. It is not pleasant to watch som=
eone die while feeling utterly helpless to relieve suffering. 

Sivananda u=
sed to have great faith in the Name- he used to call it "Divine Namapathy".=
 While modern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, he used t=
o say that, Namapathy was an outstanding way to prevent disease and heal us=
 on all levels- physical, mental and spiritual. 

While he said all names o=
f God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the Maha=
mrityunjaya mantra specially for healing purposes. And especially for those=
 who are very sick or dying.

He says "Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra will remove =
accidents, incurable diseases and bestow long life and immortality. It is a=
 Moksha Mantra too."

I visited the Sivananda Charitable hospital in Pattam=
adai, Tamil Nadu some years ago, and the doctors and nurses who work there,=
 start the day with chanting of mantras (including the Mahamrityunjaya) for=
 their patients, each other and the whole world. I believe it is the same w=
ith the little Ashram hospital in Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to start =
the day.....repeating mantras with your colleagues. 

I wanted to mention t=
he power of this mantra for anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously =
ill (or indeed, if you yourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to =
invoke the blessing of God to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering bet=
ter. Basically saying "Thy Will be done" because You know what is best. Of =
course it is NOT asking for a miracle cure (unless that happens to be the W=
ill of God). 

At any point in time, there are several human beings, animal=
s and various creatures who are dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly =
during the process of dying. I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra=
 a few times daily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it works, and I be=
lieve them. 
 
Here is a link for those who are interested in learning more=
 about this great mantra. The article is written by a disciple of Swami Sat=
yananda, a saint of very recent times.
