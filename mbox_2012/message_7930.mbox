Shri Narasimhaji,

Namaste!

I performed the tarpana ritual yesterday, and =
felt nice after performing it. Thank you very much for providing such ritua=
l information to beginners like me!

I have a question, however, pertaining=
 to one of the technical aspects of the ritual. When one is supposed to tak=
e water in the right hand, directly from the pot or with the help of a spoo=
n, one is supposed to recite the mantra and then release the water in the s=
aid direction (as mentioned in the manual) However, as soon as I took some =
water in my right hand, and before I could finish reciting the mantra(s), s=
ome water kept slipping out of the hand. Does this happen often/is it okay =
or is this an error/non-acceptable?

Is their a video recording of this rit=
ual?

Thanks and best regards,
Manish
