Hi,=C2=A0
=C2=A0I wonder, Where would be names of those =C2=A0persons who b=
eside respecting their fellow human beings also show respect to animals as =
well. If they look at cows and pigs they are not thinking about putting the=
m in their inner fire.
If they look at birds and turkeys they are not think=
ing that xmas is coming soon.

I just wonder.

That angel should have left =
his mobile number just for emergencies like this.

Abou Ben Adhem =


-by James Leigh Hunt

Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one =
night from a deep dream of peace,

And saw, within the moonlight in his roo=
m,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,

An angel writing in a book of=
 gold:=E2=80=94
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,

And to the Presen=
ce in the room he said
"What writest thou?"=E2=80=94The vision raised its h=
ead,

And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered "The names of thos=
e who love the Lord."

"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"
Replied=
 the angel. Abou spoke more low,

But cheerly still, and said "I pray thee,=
 then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow men."

The angel wrote, and va=
nished. The next night
It came again with a great wakening light,

And show=
ed the names whom love of God had blessed,
And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all=
 the rest.
