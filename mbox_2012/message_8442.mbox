Hello LaxmiNarayanji,

Thanks for the encouraging message. The =
thought of Vishnu turning on his watery resting place and glancing in this =
direction is rather sweet. You've motivated me to do the mantra with even m=
ore enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for help with this.....=
.Ramakrishna says you have to keep tugging at Her sari till she gives you s=
omething vaguely worthwhile like devotion.

Very interesting to hear of you=
r experience in Delhi. I agree that the Name provides protection against do=
dgy situations. I don't like to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I'm emba=
rrassed to say that have always been scared of the dark since childhood, sl=
owly getting over it now. 

Once at university, around 7 years ago, I was p=
reparing for some exams. It was after term-time and I had stayed back to re=
vise.  I was moved to a room that was different to the one I had been stayi=
ng in, as my usual room was being used for some conference guests. I used t=
o hang out with the Hare Krishnas then, and was really into chanting the Ha=
re Rama mahamantra then (still love this mantra, but chant Om Namo Narayana=
ya more now)- used to do 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. 

I was ly=
ing on my back in this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in so=
me sort of light sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty sensation th=
at can only be described as something or someone trying really hard to stra=
ngle me! I felt very frightened, and couldn't move, speak or wake myself up=
.

In this state, my mind started repeating "Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, Hari" v=
ery very fast in terror. I think I chose this name because it was short and=
 I could say it very fast with concentration! The frightening experience th=
en passed and I felt the Name saved me.

I woke up and turned on the light =
feeling absolutely petrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then did som=
ething I wouldn't normally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in London a=
t that time of night (I knew they don't sleep till about midnight as I've s=
tayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who=
 initiated me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she ve=
ry kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it could have been some=
 real negative force or just something from my imagination. Either way, she=
 reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating th=
e Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting before bedtime to avo=
id similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra before=
 going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light though on because=
 I'm a coward ;).

Since then, I keep up the practice of repeating the Name=
 before bedtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings positi=
ve Divine energy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)

Best wishes,

Aparna=

 this mantra for anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or ind=
eed, if you yourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the =
blessing of God to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Basica=
lly saying "Thy Will be done" because You know what is best. Of course it i=

 animals and various creatures who are dying, and unfortunately suffering g=
reatly during the process of dying. I think it would be nice to repeat this=
 mantra a few times daily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it works, a=
