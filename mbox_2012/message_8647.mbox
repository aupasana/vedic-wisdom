Just to add further, I never tried combined practices of Havan and Sudarsha=
n Kriya. Any ways, It is matter of finding out by one's own experiences (an=
d that is actually the only way)rather than relying on experiences of other=
s. This is also opinion of Mihir and Narasimha Garu. unless ofcourse one ha=
s a spiritual Guru and full faith in Guru to just blindly perform the Sadha=
na commanded by Guru. for such person it is fine not to roam around.

Mediu=
m used in Sudarshan Kriya is Air (on gross level atleast) while that in Hom=
am/Havan is Fire and it is only logical to think that there must lie some d=
ifferences in terms of speed/quality/effects in their respective evolutiona=
ry curves and as far as I am concerned, I have probably had some knwoeldge =
of differences using Air and Fire. I can see that Mihir's experience of SK =
is somewhat similar to mine. It'll be interesting to note here that I did p=
erform a couple of havans with the inspiration of AOL and that was Mahamrit=
unjaya Havan, back in 2006 (before i started Havan regularly in 2008 with t=
he divine inspiration of Narasimha).

Best Regards,

Utpal

 So if now i compare it, the peace of mind and will power given by SK and P=
S was a surface one. They never created a situation where in i was ruthless=
ly tested on my weaknesses. So i would say that they are spiritual practice=
s which worked quite slowly and quite easily without disturbing me. While C=
P and Homam actually turned me on my head. It started giving me a real kind=
 of Detachment, wisdom. Few vital things have become much clearer now.
