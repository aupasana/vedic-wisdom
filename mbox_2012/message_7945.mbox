Namaste,
Regarding Swaha best rule is this to remember,Narasimha correct me=
 if I am wrong.
Agni opens mukh(mouth)on Swa and shuts with Ha hence offer =
ahutis not before Swa and not after Ha.Hope I am clear on this.

Namaste,

Great idea! Goo=

=C2=A0
Technically, the rule is that offering should be made in fir=
e during swaha, not before or after. I am not always good with it though an=
d you may see exceptions in video, in addition to small audio-video lipsync=
 lissues.
=C2=A0
Air should fill lungs so fully that filled lungs push diap=
hragm down and stomach protrudes out. When all air is withdrawn, stomach go=
es in and diaphragm moves up, constricting lungs.
=C2=A0
If diaphragm does =
not go down and stomach does not protrude out when breathing in, lungs will=
 have limited space and can only take in so much air.
=C2=A0
This practice =
maximizes the air intake and also keeps diaphragm well-exercised and health=
y. However, this should be done without any strain.

It might have happened in some age that one raam had d=

fire while saying swaha( sometimes it appers in the vedio that the offering=

this vedio has created a doubt. Kindly Clarify. 
=C2=A0 
Now a days=C2=A0 f=

 in lungs and not stomach(i.e. the stomach should not bulge). But another g=

Waiting for your reply.
