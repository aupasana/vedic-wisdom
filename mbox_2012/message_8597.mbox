A short conversation between a student and teacher.
Chant as you read along=
. Chant any name.

If you find it tough to chant, play this another tab/win=
dow
http://youtu.be/SIqag-x5gqI


Teacher : You are Duracell.

Student : er=
r=85.. what?

Teacher : *while smoking* or energizer or everyday or nippo.
=

Student : =85=85=85=85. hain? *scratches head*, you have lost it.

Teacher=
 : I lost "it", a long time ago its time for you to loose it ,
LOL

Student=
 : How am I Duracell or any of those damn battery companies you
just mentio=
ned?

Teacher : What do I get, if I prove it?

Student : What do you want?
=

Teacher : That you intentionally make a fool of yourself in front of
peopl=
e who have not lost it.

Student : okay, deal done. Prove it.

Teacher : Th=
ink twice.

Student : I have thought 4 times.

Teacher : Ho ho ho, what a f=
un day I will have.

Student : Yeah, right. *rolls eyes like a supermodel s=
aying whatever*

Teacher : Have you ever seen a battery powered toy? Especi=
ally the one
which is modeled in the form of a bear, and claps its hands as=
 soon as
it is powered on. Its hands hold two plates which strike each othe=
r ,
the bear's eyes light up as soon as the battery is put in, and boom, we=

are ready to go.

Student : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There are other t=
ypes also, like
when you put batteries in a car model, it suddenly starts o=
perating, and
going bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which starts repeating =
some cuddly
lines. It is loved by girls.

Teacher : Yes, exactly. You, righ=
t now, are the teddy bear, which girls
and everybody loves.

Student : =85=
=85=85=85. the fuck?

Teacher : aww!! How cute , my little child is thinkin=
g in terms of
profanities. Do you know why you are here?

Student : *thinks=
 in mind about all the philosophical stuff he has read,
and knew this quest=
ion was widely discussed and asked, and thus becomes
happy"=85. why?

Teach=
er : Because , somebody fucked somebody, LOL. But anyways, leave
this fucki=
ng business aside for a moment. Lets go back to the
discussion, the end of =
which will be very fun.

Student: we were on the topic that I am a teddy be=
ar.

Teacher : Don't twist my words, I said right now you are akin to a ted=
dy
bear. You have been that car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear who
c=
laps, basically all the battery powered toys earlier. In philosophical
term=
s they are called "births".

Student : How may I ask?

Teacher : What is yo=
ur name?

Student : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security & other hu=
morous
reasons)

Teacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma
as t=
he bear (the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and claps,
that "I am=
 Chaman Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 years old
, i like this=
 girl, I love playing sports, I live here, I read this, I
hate that, I this=
, and I that", okay?

Student : Go on.. * feeling a bit ridiculous about hi=
mself*

Teacher : So when Chaman dies, which is going to happen sooner than=

later, do you know what happens or what that means?

Student : I die, but =
in reality "I" don't die.

Teacher : Very good, you have read that off of a=
 book, ever realized it?
Are you not afraid of death?

Student : No, I am n=
ot afraid of death.

The lights turn off in the room, there is total darkne=
ss, for 5 minutes
there is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified, and then a =
pair of deep
red eyes appear in the dark, and in the most ghastly voice eve=
r asks Mr
Chaman, "why are you so afraid? the basis of all fear is death, a=
nd only
the lights have gone out, I haven't even started with you yet, if y=
ou
say you are not going to die, then why so scared?"

Suddenly the lights =
turn back on, the teacher is laughing his ass off,
with Chaman shivering.

=
Teacher : You said you were not afraid.

Student : I never meant it, like t=
hat.

Teacher : Then in what way did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that
=
practical stuff in this spirituality business is far greater than all
your =
books combined. You get lost while reading, you think you are
different. To=
 me you are no worse than the thousand others I meet,
in-fact they are bett=
er off without the texts you have studied.

Student : Agreed, but don't sca=
re me like that. Again.

Teacher : I will, if you make such ridiculous clai=
ms again. Anyways,
where were we? The death of the teddy bear. Yes. But min=
d you the teddy
remains, the outer shell remains, but teddy is dead. The ou=
ter shell is
either buried or burnt, in essence done away with, because it =
is of no
use. Right?

Student : Right

Teacher : Wrong. Lets get back to th=
e toy. Consider this, when you
remove the battery from the toy, what happen=
s? The toy is literally
useless, it can't clap, it can't shout, it can't cr=
y, it can't do shit.
Thus, at death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Cha=
man's body. You
never die, you are only the battery powering this personali=
ty which
leads to powering your body.

Student: How can you even=85=85

Tea=
cher : Lets consider that you are two batteries, two aa sized ones.
When yo=
u plug the batteries into a car, suddenly the car comes to life,
without th=
e battery the car is idle, but as soon as I put the battery
in, the car goe=
s=85=85.. beep beep honk honk, move, I am a car.

Student : sits in silence=
 knowing well that interrupting now will be the
biggest mistake ever.

Teac=
her :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it into
lets s=
ay a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,
or acts =
mushy. And when I pull the battery out?

Student : Teddy is idle, literally=
 useless.

Teacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same battery that power=
ed the
car, it was the same battery that powered the teddy bear, and it is =
the
same battery that can power any toy, correct?

Student : Correct

Teach=
er : While the battery is in the car, it believes itself to be the
car. It =
believes "yesssss, i am a car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 mm
torque, top speed=
 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the back, hot woman in my
passengers seat, I =
am the king baby, look at how hot I am"

Student: Oh dear god=85.

Teacher =
: Then I take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a
useless piece =
of metal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly it
believes itself =
to be the teddy, it goes " yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,
I am mushy, I am s=
oft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am, I can
even clap my hands ",=
 and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy
is=85..

Student : Useles=
s, and dead.

Teacher : Thats a useless conclusion, it is known by the worl=
d, not
realized. Every tom dick and harry knows that, Lets go deeper. The p=
oint
is the battery confuses itself to be the teddy or the god damn car.

S=
tudent : So the battery is the soul?

Teacher : *smacks on the student's he=
ad* Who said that?

Student : You did.

Teacher : *another phatek on the he=
ad of the student* When did I say?
You read it in one of your fancy article=
s and commentaries and satsangs
that people do, genius, and you read it all=
 too wrong, you read it and
thus think you 'know', you never practiced, foo=
ls you people are. Most
of the time you people are fed bullshit and you gob=
ble it up like pigs
in mud. That reminds me we haven't had a pepperoni  piz=
za in a long
time, lets order one. LOL

Student : Sorry=85

Teacher : Don't=
 be, you are my child, I love you. Anyways , back to our
discussion on toys=
. The confusion of the battery. And thus Chaman, you
confuse yourself to be=
 Chaman. This is the 67432th time , you have been
plugged into a a toy (rea=
d body) and the confusion prevails. Focus on
the "confusion" aspect.

Stude=
nt : Then who am I?

Teacher : You are the ever lasting consciousness, the =
universal bliss,
the infinite, the ever pervading light of the universe!!! =
Breathe in and
out and feel the bliss!!

Student : Yess!!! this is what I r=
ead, * breathes in and out deeply*
*Smells huge amounts of odor*=85=85 What=
 is that smell?

Teacher : I just farted, feels so blissful, did you feel y=
our bliss too?

Student : Ewwwww=85.

Teacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we =
guys are fools who have spent lives
in search of who we are, and you will k=
now just by breathing in and out,
and thinking you are the ever lasting con=
sciousness and all that???
Befkuf!! Chaman kahin ka!!

Student : But you on=
ly said that  "You are the ever lasting
consciousness, the universal bliss,=
 the infinite, the ever pervading
light of the universe!!! Breathe in and o=
ut and feel the bliss!!"

Teacher : It is called a test, and needless to sa=
y you have scored a
compartment.

Student : Hey ram=85=85=85.

Teacher : So=
 back to who you are, you are just like the battery who is
the source of th=
at body and the personality and confuses itself to be "
I am Chaman Sharma,=
 age 20, resident of vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,
am a male, love to pa=
rty, own a mercedez, worship a a little, interested
in god and whatever "

=
Student : So who am I?

Teacher : You are duracell=85..How do they write po=
st a mathematics
solution=85=85=85Q.E.D or hence proved. QED =3D  quite eas=
ily done.

Student : Thats one more self identification of being duracell

=
Teacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.

Student: *Feels quite proud=
*

Teacher : And THAT is one more self identification.

Student : Hey Ram!!=


Teacher : Ram Ram.

Student : So I theoretically understand it , but how =
do I actually
realize it?

Teacher : You do Sadhana.

Student : Sitting in =
a yogic pose and focusing on the lotus and all?

Teacher : I will fucking b=
eat you to your death if you repeat this
bullshit ever again.

Student: Sor=
ry=85

Teacher : No need to be. That is what is meant by Sadhana to most
pe=
ople. But does anyone know what is Sadhana?

Student : You shed some light =
on it?

Teacher: What do you think I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana i=
s
basically in essence, and mark these all important words.
" YOU trying to=
 convince yourself that "you" are not YOU "

Births are spent on this my bo=
y, births not lives, it takes a lot of
effort to tell and convince yourself=
 that you are just not you.

Student : and how do you do that?

Teacher : B=
y sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You
eventually yourself b=
ecome the form of the mantra that you chant, thus
realizing the deity( the =
big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the
one (the source of all the Big=
 and small batteries). A mantra means man
ki tarana, does it not?

Student =
: So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the battery and not
this persona=
lity?

Teacher : Yes, but the day "you" realize, "you" will go dead, to
you=
rself.

Student: I am beginning to understand a little, can you explain whe=
re
does a deity stand in this whole battery concept?

Teacher : If you are =
the battery, the battery has to have a source, you
are not svayambhu that y=
ou exist on you own. The deity is like a huge
power station in your compari=
son. It is almost infinite, but since it is
a power station it is bound to =
have a boundary somewhere, but to you, aa
sized battery it is endless. Cham=
an's source is his parents, but
chaman's actual source's (battery) parent i=
s the power station.

Student : Hmmm=85.. that's why she is worshipped as m=
a?

Teacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a girl who has realized that
=
he/she himself is the battery and then went on to become one with a
power s=
tation and thus sees himself/herself in everything because the
power statio=
n is the source of everything , of all batteries. And since
he/she actually=
 knows that all elements too are currents and everything
else too, he/she a=
ctually sees it as that. And thus, the "miracles". Let
say I fully well don=
't see a difference between me and this table, thus
I am this table, thus I=
f i wish to make it fly, I can do it, because I
am actually it. To you it i=
s a table, to me it is just a current, who is
just "me".

Student: Oooohhhh=
hhhh=85=85.

Teacher : He maybe sai baba to you, but thats how your eyes pe=
rceive him
to be as, an old man with frail clothing, belongs to shirdi etc =
etc, but
inside he is far beyond what you or I can comprehend. He first rea=
lized
he was a battery by doing penance, thus killing himself in the proces=
s,
the he realized that the battery is as good as the power station because=

the current is the same, so he became one with that, and then he went
beyo=
nd and came back to guide as he was chosen, just like many others
are, like=
 my great teacher, guru nanak dev, Ramakrishna and all
others=85=85=85

Stu=
dent : And the source of the power station is?

Teacher : The one- Satya sh=
ri akaal , he/she/it can't be put into words
because he is infinite and the=
 words are finite. It is purely on
defining him religious wars, riots betwe=
en religions , and intellectual
discussions and debates on this thing calle=
d internet happen, but
he/she/it is far beyond comprehension. Many people f=
ocus on that , and
get lost, but focus on the power station (deity) and it =
will take you to
big daddy.
Imagine an endless field of current in comparis=
on of the power station ,
an endless current which exists and all others ar=
e a figment of it. The
power stations are a part of it, the current has tak=
en the form of one
concentrated zone.. But even this contains error of spee=
ch, so chuck it.
The ultimate is only realized when you are one with the po=
wer station so
lets focus there.

Student : So the one has taken forms of d=
ifferent power stations to help
the batteries who are spread out to help un=
ite back with it?

Teacher : Brilliant.

Student: So all our lives we debat=
e/fight and cut each other off to
claim which power station (deity) is more=
 powerful over the other and
superior to all others, when in truth our eyes=
 perceive them(deities) to
be different, when they are in essence one(Satya=
 shri akaal) and
laughing back at us?

Teacher : ho ho ho=85.. Go on.

Stud=
ent : And we try to worship 10 different ones and always think that
we shou=
ld worship as many to get maximum benefit for our mistakingly
confused iden=
tities of teddy , the car and all other toys?

Teacher : *smokes slowly*=85=
 I am listening.

Student: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in d=
ebates and
pseudo breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with peacock =
feathers
and punches to the spine, reading stuff and debating on concepts w=
hich
they don't know a thing about?

Teacher: Yes,Speaking of Kundalini, sh=
e is basically you, she is the
battery. the stupidest thing in the world is=
 this concept of "my
kundalini", err=85. you are her you idiot, how is she =
yours? Anyways ,
many make this error, but it is essential because other wi=
se you can't
explain the concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you=
 are her,
"you" will be phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshippi=
ng lets
say a form, you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full=

glory . Whatever you are worshipping is "you", who is without all the
limi=
tations of Chaman/teddy/car/toy.

Student: So then how do realized souls st=
ay in their bodies post their
realization?

Teacher: Intentional identifica=
tion with the personality by permission
from the power station to fulfill s=
ome higher purpose of the power
station to guide more batteries to realize =
that they are not toys. But
they can leave in an instant, because they know=
 realities that are much
higher than our world.

Student : So what is moksh=
a?

Teacher : It is a concept that is best left alone, if you haven't merge=
d
back with a power station yourself first. You tell me when you have
merge=
d back, how do you know what if feels like to be merged back? You
yourself =
have become one with your source, so "you" don't remain, even
the battery h=
as dissolved, so how do "you" explain it? You wont remember
it, because you=
 are not there.

Student : I can't explain it.

Teacher : We can't, It is l=
ike explaining the color red to a blind man.
You will say mars  is red or t=
he red light is red, he will say I have
been blind from birth I don't know =
what you are talking about. You will
say tomato, he will say fuck off.

Stu=
dent : Yes, so It can't be explained.

Teacher : it can be to an extent, bu=
t it is one ridiculously convoluted
topic. To add to ti, one toy is a teddy=
 bear, one toy is a car, one toy
is a helicopter, one toy is a turtle, mind=
 you battery is the same, but
the car is very different form the toy, thus =
if you explain a high level
concept to both, both will understand different=
ly and have a go at it
with debates and what not, which leads to more confu=
sion. Better is both
realize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that =
you are duracell
first, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You a=
re duracell.
Now time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on =
the road.

Student : What?

Teacher : You thought 4 times.

Student: But I =
will be disgraced.

Teacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you are duracell, they =
will laugh at
Chaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation, you have done this t=
housand
times before, so what??

Student : I hate you.

Teacher : I love yo=
u too.

Student : You are serious on this?

Teacher : Very

Student: : This=
 is why some of the higher ones don't give a shit about
roaming naked and d=
oing wild stuff, just to keep people away from them.

Teacher : Yes, but a =
lot of frauds copy and disgrace the higher ones.

Student : Fine, I will do=
 it. But you will handle my parent's reaction.

Teacher : Done.

After the =
student did the act, nobody seemed to recall the act the next
day, yet ever=
y one saw it that day, and seemed to make faces at the
student for an hour =
or so. How everybody forgot is a different story
altogether.

Do sadhana, b=
efore your battery is pulled out, replugged into another
toy and yet again,=
 your confusion will prevail driving you to do things
that will push you fu=
rther and further down.

Jai Shree Radheya!!
