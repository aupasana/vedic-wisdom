=C2=A0 


Namaste,

Let me try t=
o answer the questions from my perspective, as it stands at this moment. 

=
<<> 6. A common person gives =C3=82 a damn to the concept of liberation. Wh=
en ever i =C3=82 have discussion with people in my office they think =C3=82=
 i am mad . How should one deal with that because i =C3=82 think that peopl=
e =C3=82 who are unaware of this great concept should be taught with this i=
deaology.>>

This cannot be forced, this should not be forced. Yes there ar=
e plenty of people who have no interest in these, so let them be. Someone l=
ikes spirituality, someone else likes something, someone else likes another=
 thing, its all fine. That is how it should be. I used to suffer from this =
compulsive habit of trying to force spiritual discussions on others, now th=
ankfully I am relatively cured. On our part, what we can do is not to fall =
in the trap of thinking that because we are doing some sadhana, or have som=
e interest in these things therefore we are anyway better. Not at all. Ther=
e is beauty in diversity. I have seen rank atheists who have more detachmen=
t and equanimity than many believers. If you want to discuss spirituality, =
find a group of friends with similar inclination and do so. But never try t=
o force it on an unwilling individual. Whenever force is applied, it invari=
able leads to a unpredictable and at times unpleasant reaction at some late=
r
 date. 

One of the people whom I consider as one of my gurus, had told m=
e once, "Duniya banane wala duniya chalana bhi janta hai" (One who made the=
 world also knows how to run the world). Now I believe that statement is ba=
ng on. Feel no pressure. Everything is in safe hands!

<< 5. Why =C3=82 did=
 Gautam Buddha left his wife and his child and even then achieved the statu=
s of God?>>

In my view, we use the term God too loosely. There are Mahatma=
s, great Mahatmas, fantastic spiritual beings, and then there is God. Buddh=
a was a fantastic and super-duper spiritual being.

Now coming to your ques=
tion, there is no fixed rule of how and what can lead a man to liberation o=
r higher states of spirituality. Frankly, there is no path which *guarantee=
s* liberation. All paths have the potential, but realization is an individu=
al's journey, and each such journey will not be a mirror of anyone else's j=
ourney. Broadly there may be similarities, but nuances will differ. For som=
e it is necessary to leave their wife and children to be spiritual, for oth=
ers they may not need to do so. 

Infact, the aim of sadhana is to prepare =
yourself. If and when you experience and realize God, it is going be God's =
sweet will. Sadhana does not guarantee realization, but without sadhana it =
is nearly impossibly, for you are simply not prepared enough to experience.=
 

<<3. I was reading =C3=82 a newspaper that people after having darshan o=
f Mata Vaishno Devi, Kedarnaath, etc =C3=82 , while returning, met with acc=
ident and died. Why does this happen? People have just come from a such a w=
onderful darshan then why tragedy strikes them.>> 

The idea of trying to f=
orce a cause effect relation to everything is an inherent tendency of the m=
ind. It is not necessarily how things are. Neither is it useful.

If a man =
wants to only experience God, then every life-experience, apparently good o=
r apparently bad, is only going to take your forward towards the goal if yo=
u keep your aim fixed. No wonder Lord Krishna stresses so much on detachmen=
t and equanimity in his advice to Arjuna, rather than trying to find out ca=
use-effect relationships of the apparently good or the apparently bad kinds=
. 

Sufferings are a great way of focusing on God. Really. Slowly but surel=
y you realize that the world will run in its own pattern and you cannot do =
much about it, except control what is in your power to control, that is you=
r internal state. 

Krishna gives this advice to Arjuna in the Second Chapt=
er: "Dukhesva Anudhvigna-manah Sukhesu-Vigatasprhah Vita-Raga-Bhaya-Krodhah=
 Sthita-Dhira Munir Uchyate" Gita 2:56 [Miseries do not agitate the mind, i=
n sukha (fleeting happiness) there is no elation, such a one who is free fr=
om attachment, fear and anger, is a sage of steady mind.]

Tough? Sure. But=
 no harm in making an effort. This is something to be tried on a regular ba=
sis, day in and day out.

<<2. Persons who do nothing =C3=82 in the field o=
f spirituality can also meet God, higher saints. How is it possible?>>

Dep=
ends on what we understand by the term spirituality. Many have this notion =
that spirituality only means sitting and doing tough penances ETC. There is=
 more to spirituality than that. Essentially, it is a transformation of min=
d, emotions and body (this bit is nearly impossible) into another state. 

=
Sadhana is needed to prepare the ground - mind/emotions/body. But *meeting =
God* (as you put it) depends on what you mean by God, and on God's sweet wi=
ll. Sometimes, living your daily life with an internal sense of surrender t=
o a Supreme, trying to inculcate equanimity in testing circumstances, tryin=
g to stop the mind from automatically reacting to provocations, seeing othe=
r people's point of views and thus becoming more objective, trying to be co=
mpassionate (but not self-pity or pity in any form, for pity is a degenerat=
ive emotion, while compassion is uplifting) ETC are all sadhanas which can =
be done by anybody. One need not read complex scriptures, or believe in rel=
igion to be able to do these. 

<<1. After effect of Homam can be negative =
also. Is it true?>>

After effect of any sadhana can be negative (or positi=
ve), if your aim is anything materialistic. If your aim is purely spiritual=
 transformation, both so called negative and so called positive will help y=
ou. 

<<Fulfilling the duties of husband is a blockage in the spiritual pat=
h.>>

Dharma is never a blockage. When the time is ripe, the Lord sets the =
path. 

When Lord Krishna send Uddhava - who was a gyani of the first order=
 - to the Gopis, he was amazed to see that the Gopis would spend the whole =
day doing whatever they must do, but they would perform every action, even =
the most mundane like clearing the garbage, with a small prayer in their li=
ps, "Sri KrishNaaya Samarpayami..". 

Patience and surrender to God can be =
inculcated, progressively, in any life situation. Infact, it is the ONLY th=
ing that you can work on. Rest, the world around apart from you, will follo=
w its own rhythm which has been decided by actions performed in the past wh=
ich one may or maynot be aware of. 

Every blockage is an opportunity to in=
crease the sense of surrender to something Higher, and that in turn acts as=
 a powerful internal catalyst for change.

Caveat: These answers are based =
on my current perspective of things. They may not be sacrosanct. In future,=
 I myself may or may-not agree to these answers -:)

-Regards
Rajarshi

When Lord Krishna send Uddhava - who was a gyani of the f=
irst order - to the Gopis, he was amazed to see that the Gopis would spend =
the whole day doing whatever they must do, but they would perform every act=
ion, even the most mundane like clearing the garbage, with a small prayer i=
n their lips, "Sri KrishNaaya Samarpayami..". <br>
<br>
Patience and surren=
der to God can be inculcated, progressively, in any life situation. Infact,=
 it is the ONLY thing that you can work on. Rest, the world around apart fr=
om you, will follow its own rhythm which has been decided by actions perfor=
med in the past which one may or maynot be aware of. <br>
<br>
Every blocka=
ge is an opportunity to increase the sense of surrender to something Higher=
, and that in turn acts as a powerful internal catalyst for change.<br>

 may not be sacrosanct. In future, I myself may or may-not agree to these a=
nswers -:)<br>

 Stotra. After each verse add Swahaa. for example: Swaha after "Sheshaadrip=
atireva cha", Swaha after "Madahavo Bhaktavatsal" and so on till the last v=
erse. Plase note that Whenever you are reciting the Stotra for the last tim=
e during Havan, you need to say "Vaushat" instead of Swahaa after "ShrimatV=
enkatnathaaya Srinivasaaya te namH" (Last Verse).<br>
