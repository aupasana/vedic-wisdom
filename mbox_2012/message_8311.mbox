Please have a look at this - simple, yet extremely efective explanation
of=
 Deities (Dwait) and Supreme Consciousness (Adwait)


[

"If It is non-dual=
 why does It seem to be dual?" said Hemachuda.

"If you look at clear water=
 in a colored glass the water seems

colored. If you look at the universe t=
hrough the ego, the apparently

separate self, it seems to be dual. Transce=
nd or temporarily remove the

ego and duality disappears, revealing only pu=
re Consciousness.

"This nameless, formless Being seems so abstract and

in=
conceivable I have no idea how to relate to It," said Parasurama.

Please t=
ell me how to worship It."

"Worship It in any form you wish," Hemalekha re=
plied.
"Because

the Self is the knowing principle in your own mind, it und=
erstands

your innermost desire and operates through your chosen deity to r=
eveal

Itself to you. As you worship your deity your mind becomes subtler

=
and subtler, quieter and quieter, and at special moments dissolves into

yo=
u, the worshipper...who is none other than the Self. At that point

you fin=
d yourself to be beyond all forms, non-dual, and eternally

aware.
