hi spiritual siblings,

since aparna started this topic i thought it would =
be good to share this with all of you.

please listen to this mantra from t=
his link and chant it as and when you wish to.

http://www.dhyanfoundation.=
com/ancientvedicchants.php

the mantra given in this link is the very power=
ful shree mrityunjay mantra.

intonation is a very important part of chanti=
ng a mantra so it would be good if you listened to it and then chanted it.
=

yogi ashwini is a master in tantra vidya and has inspired people across th=
e world to do havan for the good of the universe. and do lots of charity an=
d service.

hope this helps.

thanks n rgds.
