Namaste Utpal ji,

The meaning of the word "Damn" is rot in hell or condemn=
 in hell. It is a pretty harsh word that even Christians don't use it. My o=
nly request is if someone has any grudges towards god please keep it person=
al. I understand our style of love,devotion all varies but my mind is tuned=
 in such a way that it just can't accept any abusive words for god even tho=
ugh the person is doing it out of love and innocence. 

You did a good job =
knocking at my senses though :-))....surely it will help me in the long run=
. I will work on my weakness.


Many thanks as always,
Priya

=C2=A0

Namaste My dear friend,

Listening alone to the song which i heard for the =
first time....tears are flowing in torrent and i cried like a child who is =
looking for his mother lost in a mela.

Its looks dramatic but its naturall=
y true for the person who has Chanda in Rohini in Pushkara bhaga.

***

Apa=
rna ji...Koi baat nahi...Damn Durga...But develop that disgust to the level=
 of tremendous hatred towards Jagadamba so that, that becomes the Mantra wh=
ich your heart, mind and soul can not live without for a second.

It is my =
deep conviction that Hatred is as much intense as love...probably even a bi=
t more. because once you hate somebody, you cant take out that person from =
you mind easily...It is ruinous if it is for anything else then Divine. For=
 The Mother Durga, hatred is a boon IMHO.

So dont worry and keep going....=
blame her, damn her, yell at her as much as you can and keep doing...you ar=
e surely blessed if you really start hating her.

I have a very humerous sh=
ort story in this regard which has a deep meaning.

there was a person in a=
 village who used to go to a Temple every morning without fail to praise th=
e Lord and then go to his field for work. in the same village there was ano=
ther person who disliked and hated God so much that he also used to visit t=
he temple Lord every day morning without fail, to just yell at lord, abuse =
the deity.

One night, there was a thunderstorm with very hevay rain and in=
 the morning, there was waist deep water around temple and it was still rai=
ning heavily. The gentle man who liked God thought that It is very heavy ra=
in and i can skip my visit to the temple and he didn't go to temple on that=
 morning. He made peace with his mind. The other person though could not st=
op himself. He went ahead, crossed the pool of waist deep water very pain-s=
takingly, with great efforts reached the temple and did his job of abusing =
the deity.

The lord became very pleased with him and gave him Darshana.

*=
**

Aparna ji, this is actually not pointed at you. I know you dont mean wh=
at you wrote and you actually have lot of love for Durga because such words=
 of Damn also come out when you love somebody very dearly in your heart os =
hearts.

This is for the well meaning spiritual people who get hurt by some=
 other spiritual people's temperory disgust and outburst. 


Best Regards,
=

Utpal

Mai na Jaanu, Tu hi jaane....Tu hai meri, main to Tera....

So dont worry and keep going....blame her, damn her, yel=
l at her as much as you can and keep doing...you are surely blessed if you =
really start hating her.<br>
<br>
I have a very humerous short story in thi=
s regard which has a deep meaning.<br>
<br>
there was a person in a village=
 who used to go to a Temple every morning without fail to praise the Lord a=
nd then go to his field for work. in the same village there was another per=
son who disliked and hated God so much that he also used to visit the templ=
e Lord every day morning without fail, to just yell at lord, abuse the deit=
y.<br>
<br>
One night, there was a thunderstorm with very hevay rain and in=
 the morning, there was waist deep water around temple and it was still rai=
ning heavily. The gentle man who liked God thought that It is very heavy ra=
in and i can skip my visit to the temple and he didn't go to temple on that=
 morning. He made peace with his mind. The other person though could not st=
op himself. He went ahead, crossed the pool of waist deep water very pain-s=
takingly, with great efforts reached the temple and did his job of abusing =
the deity.<br>
<br>
The lord became very pleased with him and gave him Dars=
hana.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Aparna ji, this is actually not pointed at you.=
 I know you dont mean what you wrote and you actually have lot of love for =
Durga because such words of Damn also come out when you love somebody very =
dearly in your heart os hearts.<br>
<br>
This is for the well meaning spiri=
tual people who get hurt by some other spiritual people's temperory disgust=
 and outburst. <br>
 <br>
