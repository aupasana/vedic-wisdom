ity/attachment-and-detachment

Have you observed a balloon seller?. He infl=
ates a few balloons, ties a
thread around each one and wraps those threads =
around his fingers. When
someone comes to buy a balloon, he removes one fro=
m one of his fingers and
gives it away. Then he inflates another balloon an=
d ties it to his finger
again.

Our mind is like the balloon seller. Myriad=
 different objects in the world
entice us like balloons and our desires are=
 like the threads that keep our
mind attached to the objects.  The moment o=
ne desired object is acquired,
it gets detached from our mind. But our mind=
 immediately inflates another
one and promptly gets attached to it!

Now, w=
hen does the balloon seller stop this repeated activity of detaching
and re=
attaching balloons to his fingers? Possibly, at the end of his work
day whe=
n he thinks he must go home now. Then he disposes off his last
balloon and =
does not inflate any more balloons. So, now he becomes detached
from the ba=
lloons, but only temporarily. Again, the next morning, he is out
to repeat =
the cycle of inflating, attaching and detaching balloons.
Likewise, we also=
 take a temporary respite when our life ends, but only to
restart the repet=
itive cycle of desires all over again in the next life.

Is there a final e=
nd to this cycle? When the balloon seller becomes old, he
may finally decid=
e that he can no longer continue going out and selling
balloons. So, he wil=
l then hang up his boots and be free from the
repetitive inflate-attach-det=
ach cycle. Similarly, we have to develop a
lasting vairagya bhav =E2=80=93 =
cultivate a strong determination -- that makes us
lose all interest in worl=
dly pursuits driven otherwise by unending desires.
That is when we will be =
released from the repetitive cycle of birth and
death.

It is said that a s=
incere spiritual seeker should cultivate true
detachment. So then, he would=
 tell himself that he should reduce his
attachment, for example, to smoking=
. He may manage it with considerable
effort after some time. But that is on=
ly one attachment gone and we tend to
have so many of them! We can imagine =
the plight of someone trying to detach
himself from good food, sports, ente=
rtainment, hobbies, spouse, children,
grand children, friends and so on. It=
 is like the balloon seller having too
many balloons tied around his finger=
s and their threads getting entangled
with each other, complicating the pro=
cess of detachment.

How does one manage to get detached from the whole of =
samsara without
having to go on trying infinitely to painfully detach from =
many objects one
by one? As we can see, there are so many different objects=
 at the far end
of our attachments. Trying to get rid of those objects one =
by one is indeed
extremely difficult. However, at the near end, there is ju=
st a single
entity involved in all these attachments. That single entity is=
 your
limited bodily identity or ego. That is the driver behind the various=

attachments forming. So, if this single entity is removed, all the many
ob=
jects at the far end will be instantly detached.  Thus, it should be
relati=
vely easier to detach yourself from samsara if you can manage to get
rid of=
 your ego.

It is by our Sadguru=E2=80=99s grace that we can manage to rid =
ourselves of our ego
and develop a durable vairagya bhav that alone can lea=
d us to moksha or
liberation.
