Hi Priyank,

He is a living Buddha I agree. Love the Tibetan teachings- the=
 Tibetan book of living and dying is one of my favourite spiritual books.

=
I've always wanted to see him in Dharamsala but could never get leave from =
work to travel that side when he was there ( he's always traveling). But I =
nearly missed my long awaited chance to be in his presence. I nearly missed=
 my train this morning thanks to Durga's sense of humour. The taxi I booked=
 in advance for the train station unexpectedly didn't show up. It's usually=
 very difficult to get a taxi at the last minute but I tried anyway as I wa=
s desperate, and one was surprisingly available. Anyway, if there are no mo=
re mishaps I will attend his talk "stand up and be the change" this afterno=
on!
  
Take care, and have a nice weekend- I've enjoyed our chat. :)

it still suffers in the form of women. I hasten to add that I am no feminis=

 and even today, women were not allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (w=
hich is to the Goddess). Why aren't there more women saints? The ratio of f=
emale to male saints is probably 1:10. It's bloody disheartening. And what =

 scriptures). If she wants to save us, she will have to create in us the de=
