=C2=A0
However if one needs to a small ganapati homa and one buys=
 5 kgs of ghee of which maybe 200 gms are used and the rest is thrown away,=
 THEN it is a wastage, not of "food", but of material which was bought with=
 a certain intention and left un-used.

Respect Sir,
=C2=A0
If you had the time to read all t=
he accepted Shastras and list down all the instructions given therein, you =
will realize it is impossible to satisfy all conditions. Infact, often they=
 are contradictory. Why? Because each shastras is powerful and valid for a =
particular time, place and cultural setting. At one point it was considered=
 leaving ones "desh" and crossing an ocean was a terrific sin. What is "des=
h"? India the country did not exist. Ones village was ones desh and everyth=
ing around, from the next village to the end of the landmass was all "vides=
h". So if I apply that logic today, how many people in this forum have alre=
ady committed this great "sin"? Nearly everyone. Because the settings have =
changed. 
=C2=A0
The Vedas are considered an eternal book, because the Veda=
 samhitas contain descriptions of spiritual states in allegorical form. The=
y are not a book=C2=A0of good ethical living.=C2=A0Apart from the core-veda=
 samhitas, all dharmic rulebooks are never ment for eternity. In changed sc=
enarios, they too must undergo change. But based on what? A natural sense o=
f right and wrong, proportion and disproportion, arising out=C2=A0of=C2=A0a=
 clear heart. There is no greater rule book for ethical living than ones ow=
n heart. Follow it, and you won't be disappointed. If you keep following yo=
ur heart through thick and thin, the sense of right and wrong (discriminati=
on)=C2=A0will develop in such a fashion=C2=A0that you won't need sanction f=
rom anywhere,=C2=A0but your own self,=C2=A0for your actions. That is creati=
ng a Viveka-chudamani.
=C2=A0
Wasting food anyway is a bad habit. We know i=
t. Feeding the needy whenever possible is always a good habit. That too we =
know.=C2=A0=C2=A0Feed others, human or animal whenever you can, and when yo=
u can't; don't bother. Most important of all, don't bother about violating =
a rulebook and thus committing a 'sin'. That is such a terrific wastage of =
mental energy.

Respected Sirs,
Namasthe,
To my=

<DIV><SPAN>If you had the time to =
read all the accepted Shastras and list down all the instructions given the=
rein, you will realize it is impossible to satisfy all conditions. Infact, =
often they are contradictory. Why? Because each shastras is powerful and va=
lid for a particular time, place and cultural setting. At one point it was =
considered leaving ones "desh" and crossing an ocean was a terrific sin. Wh=
at is "desh"? India the country did not exist. Ones village was ones desh a=
nd everything around, from the next village to the end of the landmass was =
all "videsh". So if I apply that logic today, how many people in this forum=
 have already committed this great "sin"? Nearly everyone. Because the sett=
ings have changed. </SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN> </DIV>
<DIV><SPAN>=
The Vedas are considered an eternal book, because the Veda samhitas contain=
 descriptions of spiritual states in allegorical form. They are not a book&=
nbsp;of good ethical living. Apart from the core-veda samhitas, all dh=
armic rulebooks are never ment for eternity. In changed scenarios, they too=
 must undergo change. But based on what? A natural sense of right and wrong=
, proportion and disproportion, arising out of a clear heart. The=
re is no greater rule book for ethical living than ones own heart. Follow i=
t, and you won't be disappointed. If you keep following your heart through =
thick and thin, the sense of right and wrong (discrimination) will dev=
elop in such a fashion that you won't need sanction from anywhere,&nbs=
p;but your own self, for your actions. That is creating a Viveka-chuda=
mani.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN> </DIV>
<DIV><SPAN>Wasting food a=
nyway is a bad habit. We know it. Feeding the needy whenever possible is al=
ways a good habit. That too we know.  Feed others, human or anima=
l whenever you can, and when you can't; don't bother. Most important of all=
, don't bother about violating a rulebook and thus committing a 'sin'. That=
 is such a terrific wastage of mental energy.</SPAN></DIV>
