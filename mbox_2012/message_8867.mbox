Thanks Narasimhaji and Ranga!! That helps.

I'm pretty sure of the ban as I=
've tried to get the coconut with coir from three different cities (in fact=
 from three different states) in the last 4-6 weeks but got a consistent re=
sponse from the stores on the ban.

Thanks!!

Firewood is expensi=

 from a local firewood person will save money. Also, firewood sold stores c=

Starter wood bags =
are available in several stores. Starter wood pieces are thin and catch fir=

=C2=A0
I am not aware of any dried cop=
ra (dried coconut meat) ban. I know that ICAO (International Civil Aviation=
 Organization) has a ban on it in flights unless one does some special pape=
rwork, because dried copra is "highly combustible" according to them and a =
"dangerous" material.
=C2=A0
Thanks to Anup's mail, my sister-in-law immedi=
ately went to a local Indian store and bought whatever dried copra was in s=
tock. So we have enough supply to last a few months!

If ever dried c=
