Respected Sir,

Couple of things i will like to add.

And when we say that =
there is no paapa and punyas. then we mean to say that there is no need to =
differentiate between paapas and punyas. because both are binding.  one is =
chain of iron and one is change of iron gold. but both bind. 

Ultimately w=
e have to get rid of both. and method of getting rid of both is same. ie ke=
ep following your dharma, stick to your own dharma and keep devoting the fr=
uits to your ishtas. 

So technically there is no difference. But imho it i=
s always better to accumulate more blessings than curses for starters like =
me.  So practically there is difference

Interestingly, Doing karmas with a=
 greed of blessings in mind itself is a curse. :)

I will like to add that =
these blessings and curses can come from non living things, living beings, =
deities and many other beings which exist in nature. 

With the grace of lo=
rd Krishna. 

Regards
