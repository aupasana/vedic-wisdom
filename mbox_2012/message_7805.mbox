*Guest =
editor Deepak
Chopra<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chopra=
> on
why God's future depends upon science, and vice versa - and why sages =
and
scientists should meet.*

Which is more important in shaping your futur=
e,
science<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/science> or
spiritualit=
y? For some this may sound like an empty question. Science has
shaped our a=
ge; religion is a declining force in the West, as it has been
for decades. =
A clock could be placed behind every pulpit, ticking off the
thousands of p=
eople who leave organised faith behind, every hour of the
day. But there is=
 a growing movement that is repairing the rift between
science and religion=
. It has nothing to do with the noisy band of atheists
who continue to fome=
nt discord between faith and reason. Rather, science
has reached a point wh=
ere certain basic mysteries cannot be solved without
resorting to the one t=
hing that
spirituality<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/spiritualit=
y>
has
always specialised in: consciousness.

Science is dominated by mater=
ialism, a worldview that traces all activity,
including our imagination and=
 creativity, to physical processes in the
brain, and these processes are ei=
ther chemically determined or random,
depending on which strain of material=
ism you confront. Spirituality, which
is much broader than religion, is bas=
ed on the assumption that a
transcendent reality exists beyond the physical=
 world. This is the domain
of higher consciousness, or if you are conventio=
nally minded, the home of
the soul and God.

To find a common ground could =
be difficult but one can try. The annual
Sages and Scientists Symposium org=
anised by the Chopra Foundation seeks to
do just that by bringing together =
philosophers and scientists who are
sympathetic with the search for a singl=
e reality that embraces science and
wisdom. The worldwide financial meltdow=
n is matched by a cultural pandemic
of confusion and a desperate search for=
 deeper values. A groundswell of
knowledge and insight has been building. I=
ts shared message is this: There
is something else, a dimension of reality =
beyond the material world. Beyond
us, but in our midst.

Scientists who are=
 willing to venture into speculative thinking, joined by
sages from the wor=
ld's wisdom traditions, who are willing to look beyond
arguments about God,=
 face the same primal questions. Where did the
universe<http://timesofindia=
.indiatimes.com/topic/Universe> come
from? What preceded the Big
Bang<http:=
//timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Big-Bang>,
before there was either "whe=
re" or "when"? A century after the quantum
revolution in Physics, science h=
as to face up to the vanishing act that the
physical universe pulled, as ma=
tter and energy were both seen to emerge
from a timeless state that is eith=
er an empty void (which no one accepts)
or a field of infinite possibilitie=
s, a veritable womb of creation (which
almost everyone is beginning to acce=
pt, however offended science may be by
learning that the world's ancient sa=
ges and spiritual teachers knew about
this timeless domain long before Phys=
ics arrived with its exact measuring
devices).

The reason that your future=
 and mine depends on the settling of these
questions isn't what you might t=
hink. Science can proceed perfectly well in
everyday affairs without thinki=
ng about "metaphysics," as materialists like
to call spirituality. For its =
part, spirituality can keep appealing to
individuals, one at a time as they=
 arrive at personal crises, revelations,
and awakenings. But what will be s=
hortchanged is reality. Ultimately,
worldviews are secondary. If X believes=
 in Buddha and Y in thermodynamics,
their two worlds can sit uneasily next =
to each other or simply not
interact. But reality is a shared concern. It's=
 also a topic we can't
afford to leave to specialists. Where the cosmos cam=
e from means a great
deal, because the answer will tell you where the human=
 mind came from, and
where it's going.

Is the universe conscious? If so, t=
hen our minds are embedded in the cosmic
mind. Is the universe evolving? If=
 so, that casts human evolution in a new
light, along with the origin of li=
fe. These are not specialist questions.
They go to the heart of the human c=
ondition.

Our intention is not to pigeonhole anyone as sage or
scientist<h=
ttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/scientist> or
to join a camp <http:=
//timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/A-Camp> for
ideological reasons. There =
is a struggle going on between science and
spirituality that will shape eve=
ryone's future, and if we each decide to
join in, a blending may occur with=
 magical consequences. What could be more
fascinating? Together a complete =
engagement of the human faculties promises
a more powerful and realistic ba=
sis for humanity's next evolutionary leap.
The third international symposiu=
m of sages and scientists will be held at
La Costa Resort & Spa, Carlsbad, =
California, March 3-5, 2012.
