"The Dharma Manifesto: 
A New Vision for Global Transformation" 
By Sri Dha=
rma Pravartaka Acharya

Historically, a truly revolutionary transition away=
 from the prevailing corrupt order is only accomplished when such change is=
 preceded by a manifesto that outlines the goals and strategy of such chang=
e. There is no significant change within society without such a written wor=
k as a guide. "The Dharma Manifesto" is that book for our era.

The concept=
 that is encapsulated in the word "Dharma", which in the ancient Sanskrit l=
anguage means "Natural Law", is predicated upon the recognized need for the=
 organic and munificent sacralization of culture and of all human concern, =
as well as the manifestation of the highest potentials attainable by each h=
uman person in society. "The Dharma Manifesto" is designed to serve as a sy=
stematic revolutionary manifesto signaling the beginning of a wholly new er=
a in humanity's eternal yearning for meaningful freedom and happiness.
