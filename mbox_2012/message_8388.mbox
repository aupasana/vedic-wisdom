Namaste Priyank ji, Rajarshi ji and Utpal ji,

Many thanks to each of you f=
or the information provided on Aghora, a concept I had never heard of befor=
e, but which sounds very interesting. 

I will follow the advice from all o=
f you and check out Mr Svoboda's books, starting with the first of the tril=
ogy. 

Priyank ji, I will check out the links on Aghora you have advised...=
.have already read a couple of articles such as "who is a Bhairavi?" from t=
he Diaries of a Bhairavi and it sounds interesting. Will also check out the=
 Aghorpir blog. Btw your email about interpretation of stories made me grin=
 a little....I wouldn't dare do any of those Sadhanas (I'm above 18 but def=
initely not realised)!

Rajarshi ji, I will check out Arthur Avalon's book =
Shakti and Shakta as well if I can find it. Many thanks for the detailed em=
ail on Tantra.

Utpal ji, many thanks for the advice you have provided, and=
 for the humour on the forum (hehe :)

Btw are Aghora and Tantra the same?
=

I will explore Amazon tonight and get hold of the first of Svoboda's Aghor=
a trilogy.

Many thanks to all of you for introducing me to this new topic.=


Om Shri Durgayei Namaha (I know She's closely watching to see if I say "D=
amn" again so I'm being good now).

Aparna

Some words of advice:  Don't allow yourself to be imprisoned by life and ci=
rcumstances by living a zombie-like monotonous 9 to 5 life like a slave!  T=
he system is designed to keep you subservient and perpetuate itself.  Life =
is way too short to waste it.  Seek for a way out!  Sorcery and Tantra is a=
bout Freedom, especially freedom from mental shackles.  It will give you th=
e edge you need to get ahead in life.  Seek for freedom from the Matrix and=
 its archons.  Emancipate yourself even if it is only mentally!  You are a =
spark of the Divine and are meant for greater things than this!"

 are couple of FB forum but they mostly dish around sadhanas for solving is=
sues and provide less theory on tantra. one guy post his tantra sadhana jou=
rney, all i can say is that on that path fanatics only reach such high leve=
ls.

 I would love to have a read and educate myself on this, and may be even, a=
dd something to my practice. My only worhip of Durga currently (aside from =
abusing and praising her alternately) is repeating her mantra Om Dum Durgay=
ai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) randomly. (My main mantra that I got=
 intiated into from a Swami of the Sivananda tradition is Om Namo Narayanay=
a.) And I have recently added homams to my practice, albeit only once in 2 =
weeks, and I worship both her and Hari with it (it's not a perfect homam te=
chnique wise, but I try and put a bit of heart in it. And if I can't find a=
ny heart, I blame Durga for not giving me any! She gets a lot of abuse from=
 me I'm afraid, but as she made me, it's her own fault).
