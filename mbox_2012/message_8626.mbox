Hi,
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0My mother has become childlike due to old age so I tell =
her different stories so that her mental energy will remain up.
Few days ag=
o I told her the following story.
One day a Raja said to his minister that =
so many holy man and others say to people-- Do good, help others, help the =
poor. speak truth, walk on moral right path and similar thing but nobody li=
stens. Yet one =A0man says the same thing and everybody will follow him. Wh=
y is this so? The minister said he will answer in one months time.

Few day=
s later, a servant of minister was talking to him. Raja was also standing t=
here. Suddenly minister said to his servant, give this Raja a slap on his f=
ace. Both servant and Raja were taken aback. Minister repeated his command =
2/3 more times but servant did not move a inch. Now the Raja was incensed a=
nd he said to servant give this ******man four slaps.The servant immediatel=
y gave the minister four slaps.

The minister said to Raja,you see that I s=
aid the same thing and you said the same thing and he is my servant but he =
did not listen to me, only listened to you as you have the shakti/power in =
you. The same thing is with holy man.or with anybody else. If they have sha=
kti/power in them people with low shakti will follow them every where and s=
o on. And this shakti is of many types, money shakti, sex shakti, ruling sh=
akti, knowledge shakti. and similar shaktis.

I explained all this and more=
 to my mother.

For me It is Divine Mother who really cares and who is real=
 Shakti. If She gives subtle inner strength and wisdom so we can be useful =
to others and as well to ourselves. Many are born with inner strength due t=
o their previous lifetime, like persons born in rich families where there i=
s no money worry. They may not do spiritual work but when it is needed they=
 use it. Otherwise it is same Arjun same arrow. For me if I cannot light up=
 my own life what use is my telling others.
So this is realty for me.

Than=
ks=A0
LaxmiNarayan
