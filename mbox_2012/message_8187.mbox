Hi,
=A0 =A0 =A0Everyday we eat food to nourish our body. Yet so many subtle=
 energies are in the food. Where it is coming from,
whose has handled it, h=
ow it is made and when we are eating it in what mood we are in and all thes=
e affect its digestion and if it remains undigested it is going to make us =
ill sooner or later.
.
Many times it is necessary to go to a proper clinic =
where a Dr/Vaid/Healer will take all your details and suggest proper remedy=
 which I have done. At home I have taken myself triphala and prunes which N=
arasimha Bhai suggested to someone in another mail. I have also taken nettl=
e tea and detox tea. These days I am drinking 2/3 spoonful amla juice. Some=
times I feel the effect on the body but also sometimes no feeling at all.It=
 is necessary to do yoga and breathing exercises to keep the energy in the =
body moving.

I hope all this will help.
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Respected Laxmi Narayanji,
=A0
Can you pls e=
laborate the followings:
=B7=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Any good Internet link=
s or user manual for EFT through which it can be learned.
=B7=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 Your experiences for EFT techniques usefulness for yourself or=

=B7=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 What are the methods f=

Hello,
=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Several years ago, I was suffering from simi=
lar sort of things and may be much more, but as I kept doing prayers and ja=
p, these were somehow kept at bay. Those days I also used to go to healers =
like reiki and also 
learned different types of healing methods for persona=
l growth. So again it was a great help in reducing stress and mental pain a=
nd wandering.
=A0
What I will suggest that you should check out EFT on inte=
rnet. It is a extremely potent method of self healing and growth and protec=
tion. There are several groups which are offering solutions to different pr=
oblems using EFT.
on you tube etc. Although it is always a very good thing =
if there is a caring family member or friend to give support but many times=
 we have to=A0make certain effort ourselves. In learning EFT on internet yo=
u do not have to pay a single penny.
=A0
If it is possible depending on you=
r physical health do body detox every 2/3 months to clean out inner system.=

I can write certain other methods but it might make you more confused and =
I certainly do not want it.
=A0
What ever you decide , Do not leave your ev=
eryday prayers and jap etc. 
=A0
Thanks

Resp=
ected NARASIMHA ji and other learned scholar,

I am posting my condition wi=
th a hope of getting some relief and solution. Kindly do not judge me based=
 on my condition, rather give me some positive solution and perspective to =
what I am going through.

I am a very strong beloved of god and a very stro=
ng devotee. I love to worship him as much as I can.however, all my passion,=
 interest seems to get drained and discouraged due to my mindset and the he=
ll I go through because of it. I always , always get negative
 & abusive th=
oughts and tie those to the god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see a n=
egative thing, bad or foul my mind relates or ties it to god. My mind start=
 abusing god with the same foul language.
When I do Japam, =A0my mind would=
 not get concentration, but goes into this evil mode with racing thoughts.
=
I can't see directly into the eyes of god with the fear of my mind abusing =
him I can't focus my drishti on god statues. My thoughts are extremely foul=
...most specially foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my wors=
hip, which means I don't give up praying him. I requested him several times=
 to relive me from such pain so that I can increase my devotion and prayers=
. I love him. I want to pray him.=A0
Currently, my mind and it's racing evi=
l & foul thoughts have become a road block in my devotion and trying to kee=
p me away from him as much as possible. At one point of time, they dominate=
d me and I had to stay away from praying him for a while.

Now my questions=
 are
Am I a Maha papi or ghora papi that this is happening to me?
Why does =
it happen to me?
Is it some kind of disorder
Am in incurring wrath of god=
=A0
I am scared to death that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough for=
 some 100 births
What can I do to get out of this perversion and be able to=
 concentrate on him
I want to worship god like every one does
I am highly s=
tressed because of this constant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always =
in pain because of this stress.

Please help me , but do no hate me. Please=
 do not disregard or discard my email. This is a situation I can't disclose=
 to anyone in person with the fear of hatred and resentment. I am hoping to=
 get some relief from learned scholars like yourself.

<div>
<div class=3D"yiv1099334059MsoNormal" style=3D"background:whi=

<br>
I=
 am posting my condition with a hope of getting some relief and solution. K=
indly do not judge me based on my condition, rather give me some positive s=
olution and perspective to what I am going through.<br>
<br>
I am a very st=
rong beloved of god and a very strong devotee. I love to worship him as muc=
h as I can.however, all my passion, interest seems to get drained and disco=
uraged due to my mindset and the hell I go through because of it. I always =
, always get negative
 & abusive thoughts and tie those to the god. For=
 ex, if I hear a foul language, see a negative thing, bad or foul my mind r=
elates or ties it to god. My mind start abusing god with the same foul lang=
uage.<br>
When I do <span class=3D"yiv1099334059mark">Japam</span>,  m=
y mind would not get concentration, but goes into this evil mode with racin=
g thoughts.<br>
I can't see directly into the eyes of god with the fear of =
my mind abusing him I can't focus my
<span class=3D"yiv1099334059mark">dris=
hti</span> on god statues. My thoughts are extremely foul...most specially =
foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my worship, which means I=
 don't give up praying him. I requested him several times to relive me from=
 such pain
 so that I can increase my devotion and prayers. I love him. I w=
ant to pray him. <br>
Currently, my mind and it's racing evil & fo=
ul thoughts have become a road block in my devotion and trying to keep me a=
way from him as much as possible. At one point of time, they dominated me a=
nd I had to stay away from praying him for a while.<br>
<br>
Now my questio=
ns are<br>
Am I a <span class=3D"yiv1099334059mark">Maha</span> <span class=
=3D"yiv1099334059mark">papi</span> or <span class=3D"yiv1099334059mark">
gh=
ora</span> <span class=3D"yiv1099334059mark">papi</span> that this is happe=
ning to me?<br>
Why does it happen to me?<br>
Is it some kind of disorder<b=
r>
Am in incurring wrath of god <br>
I am scared to death that I am ac=
cumulating the greatest sin enough for some 100 births<br>
What can I do to=
 get out of this perversion and be able to concentrate on him<br>
I want to=
 worship god like every one does<br>
I am highly stressed because of this c=
onstant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always in pain because of this s=
tress.<br>
<br>
Please help me , but do no hate me. Please do not disregard=
 or discard my email. This is a situation I can't disclose to anyone in per=
son with the fear of hatred and resentment. I am hoping to get some relief =
from
