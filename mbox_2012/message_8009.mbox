Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Liberation, Control & Love=

 

=C2=A0 
Namaste friends,

I recently finished a specific sadhana of a s=
pecific form of Divine 
Mother. This particular goddess, according to my gu=
ru, attracts others 
to a sadhaka and gives "control and mastery" over othe=
rs.

I want to share what I realized towards the end of sadhana, because th=
at 
realization MAY be helpful to some others.

*        *        *

DIFEER=
ENT TRAJECTORIES

There are beings that can give specific limited things, b=
ut the ultimate 
goal of sadhana is liberation and sadhana of higher beings=
 eventually 
transforms one and takes one closer to liberation. What these =
higher 
beings are supposed to give in tradition is a simplificaation or 
s=
ymbolism of something sublime that takes towards liberation, from 
*differe=
nt angles*.

For example, ability to work very hard (with no expectations o=
f anything 
selfish in return), fine judgment and discrimination (that incr=
eases 
detachment in one's actions), complete surrender to god (and 
whole-=
hearted acceptance of every life situation one finds oneself in), 
ability =
to focus mind (on a mantra or a deity and not let various 
thoughts distrac=
t it), are all useful to a sadhaka. If one develops one 
of these 4 basic q=
ualities, other qualities will eventually develop. 
They all lead to the sa=
me thing - liberation - in the end, but the 
trajectory is different.

Thes=
e four basic paths constitute what are known as karma yoga 
(communion thro=
ugh action), jnana yoga (communion through wisdom), 
bhakti yoga (communion=
 through devotion) and raja yoga (communion 
through [self-]control). Howev=
er, there are many sub-paths.

Basically, different higher beings can incre=
ase a different fine quality 
inside one, which is conducive to liberation.=
 The trajectory is 
different with each deity.

*        *        *

TOO MU=
NDANE?

The higher being I worshipped is supposed to increase control and 
=
mastery over others. While I did the sadhana in the last few months, I 
won=
dered how *that* can lead to liberation. After all, control and 
mastery ov=
er others sounded too *mundane* to me to have anything to do 
with liberati=
on. But a simple realization came towards the end of the 
sadhana.

*      =
  *        *

CONTROL & FRICTION

Whether A is attracted to B or B is attra=
cted to A, the bottomline is 
that objects A and B come together. The abili=
ty to attract others also 
means to come together with them.

One is unhapp=
y with others and thinks of controlling them, when one's 
own agenda is mis=
-aligned with their agenda. The friction between the 
agendas is the basis =
for the entire dynamics of likes, dislikes, 
frustrations etc. Control of t=
hat friction comes when the agendas are 
nicely aligned!

Ability to contro=
l the agenda pursued by someone else has limited use, 
scope and lifetime. =
Such an ability can work only with a limited set of 
people or a limited am=
ount of time. This is like pumping rainwater from 
the fields surrounding a=
 hill to the top of the hill. It requires a lot 
of energy that is proporti=
onal to the area of the field and the amount 
of rainwater.

The best way t=
o avoid the friction, with ALL beings of the cosmos, is to 
eliminate one's=
 own agenda! This is like removing the hill from the 
middle of the field, =
in the above analogy.

If one has no agenda whatsoever, then there is no fr=
iction with anyone's 
agenda. There is no reason to like or dislike anyone =
or find fault with 
or admire anyone. One can just observe others. Because =
one has no 
agenda, one can identify with the agendas of others and relate =
to them 
completely. One can then put oneself completely in the shoes of ot=
hers 
and feel their pleasures, pains etc.

When one has an agenda and anot=
her has another agenda, then there is 
friction and one feels a need to "co=
ntrol" and remove friction. But, 
when one has no agenda and another has an=
 agenda, then there is no 
friction. One can then completely "understand" t=
he perspective of the 
other (because there is no friction from one's own a=
genda stopping one 
from doing so!). What better mastery and control can on=
e have on someone 
else than be able to understand that person completely?!=


Though what I described above is the end, one path to that end is to 
ide=
ntify one's own agenda/conditioning that is resulting in friction, 
wheneve=
r one is not happy with someone, and try to remove/suppress that 
condition=
ing. One can first try this with a few people (e.g. spouse).

*        *   =
     *

LOVE & COMPASSION FOR ALL

Bottomline is this: Control and mastery =
over others does not mean making 
them think and behave in tune with the ag=
enda of one's own limited 
conditioning. Instead, it means overcoming's one=
's own agendas and being 
able to put oneself in the shoes of anybody and u=
nderstand and feel each 
of their feelings and emotions. It means unconditi=
onal love and 
compassion for all.

*        *        *

LOOKING DOWN ON OT=
HERS

When one is doing some sadhana, one of the stages one goes through ma=
y 
be to feel proud of one's sadhana, look at some others doing such a 
sad=
hana favorably or with admiration and look down on others who are not 
doin=
g much sadhana (or doing a different sadhana!) and pursuing mundane 
things=
. This may be a natural tendency, but realize that this is a work 
of the l=
imited personality or ego.

One has to overcome that tendency, for looking =
down on others will 
eventually block one.

*        *        *

LOVING THE=
 DIVINE MOTHER

People talk of loving the Divine Mother. The personality of=
 Divine 
Mother is beyond one's perception. How can one really love Her the=
n?

One may do tremendous sadhana and get tremendous visions and think that=
 
one has grasped the personality of Divine Mother, but what one perceives =

is merely what one's conditioning fancies and is capable of grasping! 
The=
 complete personality of Divine Mother is beyond anybody's 
perception.

Ho=
wever, Divine Mother does manifest in a perceptible way as the cosmos. 
Eve=
ry being in the cosmos is a limited manifestation of Her. Being able 
to lo=
ve every being is the FIRST step in truly loving the Divine Mother.

Loving=
 someone because they are doing some good work (as we see it!) or 
because =
they have something we need (as we see it!) etc, is *egoistic* 
loving. Suc=
h love is *conditioned* by the agendas of a limited ego. Such 
love cannot =
extend to entire cosmos and permanently. The only love that 
can extend to =
entire cosmos and be permanent is unconditional love of 
all beings.

That =
comes only when one has no agenda and no expectations from anyone.

Best re=
gards,
Narasimha
