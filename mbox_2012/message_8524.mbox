Dear Prasanth,

> To those who say that they don=92t believe in any religio=
n


In general, many of those who don't believe in religion or God are bein=
g
more honest than those who do. After all, most people who believe in God
=
look at him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases and
assump=
tions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion
has sim=
ply served to formalize these biases.

While being mired in this word of du=
ality, we think that an ounce of
insincere prayer can undo the whole weight=
 of "paapa" that we engage in
throughout the day. And we lay this bias on o=
ur God. No wonder that others
look at all the suffering in the world and la=
ugh at this concept of God. We
"God believers" are the culprit.

We all hav=
e plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of
asking for t=
he strength to be steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits,
we ask God =
to burn "paapa" and leave the "punya" intact. It is us "God
believers" who =
look at our lives, ignoring all the "paapa phala". We look
at one or two in=
stances of "punya phala" and declare our prayers to be
successful. However,=
 an impartial observer sees it for what it is, and
laughs at us. We "God be=
lievers" are the culprit.

For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we a=
re engaged in spiritual
practices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we =
count the seconds and
minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti=
 is strong, and time
really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our wea=
k spiritual bhakti
and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial obser=
ver sees it for
what it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers" are the cu=
lprit.

The best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at t=
he
"non-believers" and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to
eli=
minate our lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can
transfor=
m ourselves, the world will be served.

If we see God as the limitless powe=
r that he is, he is difficult to define.
It is difficult to capture him wit=
hin a religion. Religion should see
itself as a stepping-stone, and should =
ask each of us to _eventually_ place
our feet on top of it to reach the hig=
her goals. Unfortunately, most
religions ask us to accept them without ques=
tion. They ask us to place our
heads on them with reverence, and try to pre=
vent the spiritually advanced
from going any farther.

sasneham,

   ajit
