Hilarious story Utpal ji - love it. Wish getting Darshan was so easy!

No =
no I don't hate Durga. She and Hari are my two favourite forms of the Divin=
e. I'm even named after her, how can I hate her! But I wish I could live up=
 to my name- Parvati as Aparna did a great tapas- but my tapas is not quite=
 up to the mark. That's why I'm pissed off with her.

There is a generation=
al gap or some gap that has caused this misunderstanding- I'm 29 and belong=
 to this shocking generation of children who are not as polite to their par=
ents and elders as they should be. This lack of politeness (sometimes) exte=
nds to the divine parents also. 

Thanks for the kind words Utpal ji, it's =
much appreciated. I wish you speedy attainment of your Ishta. And you too P=
riya ji and others. :)

Regards,

Aparna
