Respected Narasimha and learned members


Humble pranams!

I request you to please clarify my doubts.  I am attracted  to chant
aghamarshana suktam and durga suktam.  But i got this doubt whether women
can chant these suktas or not.  I am regularly chanting sri suktam
(samputikarana).  So i thought women can also chant durga and aghamarshana
suktams.  With deep devotion towards Divine Mother can women chant these
suktas?

sesirekha.
