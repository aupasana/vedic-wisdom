This is from "Shiva-mAnasa-pUjA" by SrI shankarAcharya and not "yOgA vASish=
Tam"

 

AtmA tvaM girijA matiH sahacarAH prANAH sharIraM gRhaM

tavA-rAdhanaM //

 

You Lord Shiva are my AtmA; my mind is ambikA, the dau=
ghter of the Mountain; my five prANas are the GaNas that serve you; my body=
 is your temple; all my involvement in sensual experience is  your pUjA; my=
 sleep is the samAdhi state; my wanderings on my feet constitute Your prada=
kshhiNa; whatever I talk shall be  your praises; whatever I do O shambho, a=
ll that shall be  a propitiation of You. 

Regards,
-Prasad
