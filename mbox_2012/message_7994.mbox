In Defense of Sanatana Dharma:
Spotlighting an Unknown Bigot

By Sri Dharma=
 Pravartaka Acharya


The technological miracle of the Internet has served =
as a tremendous source of entertainment for untold hundreds of millions of =
cyber-surfers over the last almost two decades. One of the most astonishing=
  features on the Internet has been the overnight democratization (and sadl=
y, also the rapidly qualitatively degenerating nature) of the flow of infor=
mation - both good, as well as fabricated. No longer do statements need to =
be reasonable. No longer do pronouncement need to be proven by fact, logic =
or anything remotely resembling evidence. No longer do words have consequen=
ces.  ...And the degenerative influence of the Kali Yuga continues its incr=
emental descent - with Truth itself as its foremost victim. 

On the upside=
, this radical lack of responsibility in the creation of written content ha=
s also led to some of the most side-splitting humor imaginable. One fantast=
ic example of the type of reality-bending humor that has become very popula=
r recently is the Onion (http://www.theonion.com). The Onion is especially =
known for taking normative reality and turning it completely upside down, r=
eporting the most unimaginably insane stories as if they are real news item=
s, thus leading to many surrealistically funny fake news stories. Some stor=
ies even tricking otherwise intelligent people for at least a little while,=
 until they finally realize that they're only having their leg sardonically=
 pulled. 

What happens, however, when someone approaches you with the most=
 insane of statements, indeed the very opposite of reality, only for you to=
 then slowly and frighteningly realize that the person isn't actually jokin=
g with you at all, but is dead serious in what she is saying? "I believe th=
at the Pope of the Catholic church is in actually a deep undercover Hindu s=
py who is trying to get all Catholics to begin worshiping Lord Krishna and =
to shave their heads! And I believe that Sri Swami Ramdev is actually a Chr=
istian missionary in disguise, only pretending to be a Hindu! After all, ar=
en't Christians anti-gay too; and didn't Jesus have long hair like Swami Ra=
mdev?! You see? He's a Christian! And I know for a fact that Barack Obama, =
the current President of the United States, is actually a space alien in di=
sguise here on a mission to conquer the earth for his fellow aliens!!!" At =
this point in the conversation, of course, any sane person would begin to s=
lowly back away from the troubled individual making these insane statements=
 and try to find safe shelter somewhere. Why? Because any intelligent perso=
n would quickly realize that the statements that are being made are not mer=
ely false, not merely baseless, not merely mistaken, but are in fact so muc=
h the opposite of any recognizable degree of reality that one would not eve=
n know where to begin in attempting to refute them. How, for example, would=
 you personally even begin to disprove that Barack Obama is a space alien? =
How could you disprove that YOU are not a space alien?

Humorously, I have =
myself recently been the victim of just such a surreal scenario from some I=
nternet jokester who no one in the Hindu community apparently has ever hear=
d of before. About a week ago, I was having a phone conversation with one o=
f the national leaders of the Hindu community in the U.K. We were discussin=
g strategies for combating anti-Hindu discrimination when he finally asked =
me if I was aware that there was some unknown person blogging her opinion t=
hat I was not a true Hindu, but only a deep-undercover Christian missionary=
 malevolently bent upon converting innocent Indian Hindu youth to Christian=
ity. We both began laughing on the phone for what seemed to be a minute. Wh=
en we both finally regained our composure, my Hindu friend in the U.K. said=
 to me "Acharyaji, claiming that you are a Christian would be like claiming=
 that Adi Shankara was a actually a hidden Baptist missionary!" But...such =
is the nature of a new claim on the rough and wild frontier adventure known=
 as the Internet.

Again, where does one even begin in attempting to refute=
 a lie so surreal as to defy reality? The following is my humble attempt to=
 inject at least a modicum of reality into the realm of the surreal. I will=
 begin my foray into the upside-down reality of this unknown blogger, whom =
neither I nor my Hindu friend in the U.K. had ever hear of, with the follow=
ing personal statement. 

Mera naam Dharma Pravartaka Acharya hai. Mein Bha=
ratiya naheen huun. LEKIN MEIN HINDU HUUN! My religion is Sanatana Dharma, =
more commonly known as Hinduism. Sanatana Dharma is the only religion I hav=
e ever followed or been a member of in my 48 years of life on this earthly =
plane of Bhudevi. I accept the Vedic scriptures as being the perfect reveal=
ed truth, the most reliable guide to understanding the nature of the cosmos=
 and our place within that cosmos, and as being apaurusheya - eternal and n=
ot created by the mind of man. I accept that any religious or philosophical=
 path that does not accept the absolute authority of the Vedic scriptures i=
s nastika, a necessarily flawed system of belief. I accept the reality of k=
arma and reincarnation. I accept the reality of the devas and devis as real=
 and existing personalities who govern and guide our cosmos in a dharmic ma=
nner. I have been a strict vegetarian for the last 36 years, do not drink a=
lcohol, nor smoke, nor engage in illegal drugs (aspirin, I believe, is stil=
l legal), etc. I personally worship Sriman Narayana as the highest understa=
nding of Brahman and the ultimate goal of Vedanta. On a daily basis, I cond=
uct puja to the murtis of Sri Sri Radha Krishna, engage in mantra meditatio=
n upon the Vedic mantra Aum Namo Narayanaya, practice Yoga, etc. I was init=
iated into the Narayana mantra at the age of fourteen in a Hindu temple in =
New York City. I travelled to India in 1985 to receive direct initiation fr=
om my guru Bhakti Rakshaka Sridhara Swami Maharaja (as is clearly stated in=
 my biographical information on my website, http://www.dharmacentral.com, b=
ut which the Unknown Blogger apparently failed to read), the elder god-brot=
her of the world famous A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. I traveled to =
India again in 1986 to receive brahmana initiation and the sacred thread fr=
om my guru. Thus, I recite the gayatri mantra thrice daily, as instructed b=
y my guru, and live a fully brahminical life. Thus, MEIN HINDU HUUN!

More,=
 as if it even needs to be said at this point (though, apparently for this =
Unknown Blogger at least, it does!), MEIN ISSAI NAHEEN HUUN. I am not, and =
never have been, a Christian. My dad was of Italian heritage; my mom is Spa=
nish. They were both nominal Catholics; i.e., they did not practice the rel=
igion. I was never baptized as a Christian - which is the criterion by whic=
h one is considered to be a formal member of the Catholic church. I believe=
 my parents brought me to a church a total of two times as a child - once f=
or a funeral, the other time for a wedding. I was never a Christian in any =
way, shape or form, either by theological concurrence, in practice, or in m=
embership. When I began practicing Sanatana Dharma at the age of ten, this =
was the first and only religion that I had ever practiced. More, Ms. blogge=
r whom no one in the Hindu community has ever even heard of, and whom I hav=
e never met in my life:  I may not have been "born a Hindu" - but I will di=
e a Hindu, with tilak on my forehead, with the name "Narayana" on my tongue=
, and with Bhagavan Sri Krishna in my heart. MEIN HINDU HUUN.  

As we are =
about to see, our Unknown Blogger offers zero credible evidence that I have=
 been lying to the world for the last 38 years, and am really a Christian s=
ecret agent in disguise. Apparently, the main quibble that the Unknown Blog=
ger had with my work to share Sanatana Dharma with the world was one video =
of a satsang I had conducted in which I explain that, though we Hindus do n=
ot accept the religion of Christianity, we do indeed accept the saintliness=
 and wisdom of Jesus as evidence that he was a great Dharma master. The Unk=
nown Blogger even made the shrieking claim that I was attempting to convert=
 innocent Hindu youth to Christianity with my talk! Well, the very opposite=
, of course, was the case. Of the approximately 100 people in attendance at=
 my satsang that evening, approximately 85 were European-Americans of the J=
udeo-Christian persuasion. The other 15 attendees were European-American fo=
llowers of Sanatana Dharma (and, thus, ex-Christians), whom I had personall=
y introduced to Sanatana Dharma. Not one innocent Indian Hindu youth in sig=
ht. Indeed, my audiences these days are primarily composed of European-Amer=
ican adults. The last time I gave a talk to Hindu youth specifically was al=
most five years ago. And when I did give that talk five years ago, my messa=
ge to this audience of Hindu youth was that they should all be swelling wit=
h pride to be followers of Sanatana Dharma - the most ancient, most relevan=
t, most beautiful spiritual tradition the earth has ever known! 

More, the=
 Hindu perspective on the personality of Jesus that I communicated in my vi=
deo - namely that we respect Jesus as a great guru, but we completely rejec=
t Christianity as a highly flawed theological and organizational system - h=
as been the exact same message given by thousands of other respected Hindu =
gurus and Hindu leaders. The perspective on Jesus discussed in the video is=
 not dissimilar to that taught by Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, Param=
ahamsa Yogananda, Mahatma Gandhi, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, A.C. Bhaktivedanta=
 Swami Prabhupada, etc., etc., etc., etc. I can mention a thousand more nam=
es of other respected gurus who share my same message on this topic, but th=
at would quadruple the length of this article unnecessarily!  Thus, if I am=
 guilty of being a hidden Christian missionary spy because I have conveyed =
the standard Hindu message on the acceptance of Jesus/rejection of Christia=
nity, then so are all of these illustrious gurus, who all shared the same o=
pinion as me. These great Hindu gurus must all be hidden Christian missiona=
ries!  I am very humbled to have been put into such glorious company by our=
 Unknown Blogger. 

The video "Jesus: The Dharma Master" was designed speci=
fically for a Christian audience in order to introduce them to the path of =
Sanatana Dharma. It has served as a highly effective transitional bridge fo=
r thousands of Christians who wish to learn more about the beauty of Sanata=
na Dharma, and to possibly even choose to adopt Sanatana Dharma as their ne=
w spiritual path. This Hindu video will stay up in the service of Sanatana =
Dharma for as long as there is such a vehicle as the Internet in existence.=
 

Another stunningly shocking piece of evidence that our Unknown Blogger d=
eposited upon her readers for my secret Christian identity (I can imagine t=
hat the Unknown Blogger envisions that when my fellow Hindus aren't watchin=
g, I quickly run into a phone booth to then, like Superman,  emerge wearing=
 a cape with a large blue cross emblazoned upon it!) is the fact that...wai=
t for it...wait for it..."He went to a Christian university for his bachelo=
r's degree!!!" Such smoking gun evidence! Of course, what is left out (whic=
h, along with a thousand other details about my life, must be left out by n=
ecessity, since this blogger has never met me, has never spoken to me, and =
knows absolutely nothing about my life other than what she read - and conve=
niently forgot to read - on my own website) is precisely why I attended a C=
atholic university (Loyola University Chicago) for four years of my ten yea=
r college career. A) I was living in Chicago at the time, and Loyola was on=
e of the best universities in the city, B) I was a philosophy major, and Lo=
yola had one of the best philosophy departments in America at that time, C)=
 having already been a practicing Hindu for 17 years before even beginning =
at Loyola, I very purposefully wanted to study the world-view of the opposi=
tion! Being a Hindu whose goal was to eventually teach Sanatana Dharma in t=
he predominantly Judeo-Christian west, I felt it was imperative that I lear=
n as much about the Christian world-view as possible. Which I did. And whic=
h even more Hindu gurus, scholars and leaders should also be doing in their=
 spare time if they want the ability to defend Sanatana Dharma against all =
opposing world-views!

During my four year stay at Loyola University, I was=
 very open and vocal about my religion of Sanatana Dharma. I organized a we=
ekly Bhagavad Gita study group on campus - the very first such Hindu group =
in the history of this Catholic institution of higher learning! I engaged i=
n open, frank and friendly debates with Catholic priests and philosophers d=
efending the dignity of Sanatana Dharma, and more, demonstrating the pre-em=
inence of the philosophical world-view of Sanatana Dharma over and above an=
ything available in the totality of Christian theology. 

On an allied subj=
ect, this Unknown Blogger who has taken it upon herself to proclaim who amo=
ng we mortal creatures is or is not a true Hindu states in her own little b=
iographical blurb that she was "an instructor at a Canadian college" for a =
short time. That she purposefully does not mention the actual name of this =
"Canadian college" makes us doubt the veracity of this claim. More, if she =
were actually associated in any way with the academic world anywhere in Nor=
th America, then Ms. Blogger would have been quite aware that there are usu=
ally many hundreds of Indian Hindu students attending any one Christian uni=
versity in America. Indeed, at Loyola alone there were many hundreds of Ind=
ian Hindu students happily studying medicine, engineering, computer technol=
ogy, and a wide variety of other fields of study. Are all of these hundreds=
 of Hindu students who attended Loyola (and tens of thousands of Hindu stud=
ents combined if we include all the other Christian universities in America=
 that have large Hindu student populations) just like I did now going to ha=
ve their adherence and loyalty to Hinduism arrogantly challenged by Ms. Blo=
gger because they, too, "attended Christian universities"? 

Indeed, as any=
 Indian knows, many millions of good, loyal Hindus in India have attended s=
chools with such names as "St. Joseph's", "St. Mary's", "St. John's". Indee=
d, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada attended a college =
by the name of "Scottish Churches College", which was a college run by a Ch=
ristian church! (Indeed, I suspect that if anyone actually knew who this bl=
ogger is and what her own personal history is, they would, not surprisingly=
, be able to dig up a few photos of our darling little Ms. Blogger as a you=
ng girl, dressed in a Catholic school uniform as she attended St. Bartholom=
ew's Christian Academy or some other such "Christian" school). Does Ms. Blo=
gger now want to apply her "logic" (we're being kind, I know) equally and a=
cross the board and now say that all of these millions of good Hindus who a=
ttended Christian run educational facilities are now no longer Hindus? With=
 friends like Ms. Blogger so eager to convert so many millions of Hindu stu=
dents to Christianity by vicious innuendo, and thus doing more harm to our =
Hindu culture than every Christian missionary in India combined, does the H=
indu world even need any enemies!

And contemporary Sanatana Dharma does in=
deed have more than enough enemies actively seeking its thorough destructio=
n! With Islamic Jihadists threatening to create a caliphate in India, aggre=
ssive Christian missionaries forcing Hindus to abandon their Vedic heritage=
 for the promise of a bag of rice and a free pass out of their Biblical hel=
l, demonic Marxist terrorists seeking to annihilate everything Hindu and re=
place it with a totalitarian atheist state, we have our hands more than ful=
l if our goal is to preserve our ancient Vedic heritage for future generati=
ons to celebrate and honor. What, then, has really motivated our Unknown Bl=
ogger to devote her energy, instead, to waging an unprovoked assault agains=
t an American Hindu who has practiced the Vedic religion for 38 years and d=
evoted his every breath to its preservation? The painfully obvious answer t=
o this question leads us ominously away from the humorous and toward the tr=
uly ugly and malevolent reality of the Unknown Blogger's own personal inner=
 demons. 

The core theme of the Unknown Blogger's vicious personal attack =
has not really been the camouflaged accusation that I am not a real Hindu, =
but rather the ugly insistence that, given my racial and ethnic background,=
 I CANNOT be a real Hindu. In her poorly constructed screed, the Blogger ta=
kes great pains to point out to her small audience that my father is of Ita=
lian ethnic heritage and my mother is of Spanish ethnic heritage. Why was t=
his fact about my racial makeup so importantly highlighted by the Blogger? =
What does the race of my parents, or the color of their skin, or the makeup=
 of their DNA have to do with the fact that their son chose at an early age=
 to devote his life to the religion and culture of Sanatana Dharma? 

In or=
der to forcefully reiterate my ethnic makeup in the minds of her innocent r=
eaders, the bigoted and racist Unknown Blogger gleefully and childishly ins=
isted on referring to me, ad nauseum, by my pre-Hindu name "Frank Morales" =
repeatedly throughout her hate-filled, jumbled article. Apparently this "fo=
rmer instructor at a Canadian College", and thus a purportedly, at least so=
mewhat educated individual, actually believes that being a follower of Sana=
tana Dharma indicates one's physical race! Apparently she believes that the=
re exists somewhere in some abstract realm of ideation a "race" of Christia=
ns; a "race" of Muslims; a "race" of Buddhists; and most obviously she beli=
eves that there exists somewhere in her surreal fantasy world a "race" of S=
anatana Dharmis. Is there a "race" of Communists; a "race" of left-handers;=
 a "race" of unknown bloggers? According to the Unknown Blogger...apparentl=
y so! This sad bigot thus betrays her simple-minded inability to even disti=
nguish between one's genetic inheritance (over which one has no choice) and=
 one's chosen religious identity (which involves nothing but choice). Thus,=
 within the darkly bigoted and racist mind of the Unknown Blogger, Dharma P=
ravartaka Acharya (or conversely: "Frank Morales"/"Frank Morales"/"Frank Mo=
rales", to quote Bloggie) CANNOT be a Hindu - He's the wrong color!

And, a=
s the Unknown Racist Blogger would have it, he has the wrong parents...

Fo=
r those Hindus who are a bit more informed about the philosophical foundati=
ons of Sanatana Dharma than the Unknown Bigot (which is apparently about 98=
% of today's Hindus), of course, we know that Sanatana Dharma is not a race=
. It is not a skin color. It is not an indication of who your parents are. =
It is not a matter of what nation's passport you happen to carry.  Rather, =
Sanatana Dharma is the Eternal Natural Way. It is a spiritual path, a divin=
e culture, a healthy and sane way of living and viewing reality that is ope=
n to all human beings, regardless of whether they are Indian, European, Ame=
rican, Japanese or of any other ethnicity. Sanatana Dharma is a gift from G=
od. Sanatana Dharma is the future salvation of our entire planet.

Indeed, =
one of the most central and basic siddhantas, or philosophical conclusions,=
 of Vedanta teaches us precisely that the very beginning of jnana (spiritua=
l knowledge) is realizing that we are not merely our race, our color, our e=
thnicity, our parentage, our name, our gender, our education level, our age=
, our language, our species, our very body itself, or any other material or=
 physical factor. According to the totality of all the scriptures of Sanata=
na Dharma, we are atman, each and every one of us. We are eternal, blissful=
 units of consciousness. To have a grasp of so fundamental and basic a phil=
osophical concept is merely the beginning of spiritual insight, of nobility=
 (aryatva), and of what it means to be a follower of Sanatana Dharma. Appar=
ently, the Unknown Bigot was asleep in kindergarten during this important, =
basic lesson. 

Over the last 38 years, I have had the greatest privilege o=
f working very closely with tens of thousands of members of the Indian Hind=
u community in America and abroad. In those 38 years, the Indian Hindu comm=
unity has opened its arms to me in warm embrace, with so many inviting me t=
o their homes, sharing their wisdom with me, welcoming me to their temples =
and satsangs, treating me as someone no different from a family member. I h=
ave experienced a degree of genuine love, concern and unhesitating generous=
ness of heart from Indian Hindus so profound as to leave me in tears. I hav=
e seen quiet humility, deep bhakti, innocent piousness, and a pride in thei=
r Hindu religion on the part of many Hindus that has moved me to the core o=
f my being. My gurus, teachers and mentors have been Hindus of Indian desce=
nt. My best friends, colleagues and closest confidents are Indians. Roughly=
 half of my shishyas (students) are proud and courageous Indian Hindus who =
have dedicated their hearts and their very being to the healthy and positiv=
e growth of Sanatana Dharma as an ascendant global force for good. My trips=
 to India have astonished, humbled and amazed me to the grandeur of a natio=
n, a people, and a culture that have kept alive the spirit of the Vedas for=
 over five-thousand years. My trips to India changed my life forever. 

Sad=
ly, while 98% of Indian Hindus understand quite well that Sanatana Dharma i=
s a religion that is open to all sincere seekers of Truth, regardless of th=
eir race or ethnic background, there does remain the tiny, but (as we have =
seen with the Unknown Bigot), very vocal 2% of bigots who see Sanatana Dhar=
ma as the closed property of the few, racially-tested, elite. The Unknown B=
igot has sadly chosen of her own free volition to be the blogger spokespers=
on for the latter, small and truly intellectually lethargic and morally cor=
rupt cabal. 

That an ultimately ignorant and prejudiced bigot should so at=
tempt to ruin the reputation of the vast majority of the Indian Hindu commu=
nity by pretending that her mean-spirited and ugly assault upon an American=
 follower of Sanatana Dharma represents the totality of the Indian Hindu co=
mmunity breaks my heart. If you are an Indian who takes Hinduism seriously,=
 and who loves your spiritual heritage, it should anger your heart. I call =
upon the entirety of the Hindu community, all Sanatana Dharmis globally, wh=
ether Indian, American, European, men and women, young and old, human and D=
eva, to renounce the Unknown Bigot in one loud, united and courageous voice=
. I call upon all leaders, scholars, gurus and activists in the Hindu commu=
nity to bravely denounce the repulsive attacks of this person upon our enti=
re community. We member of the Hindu community WILL defend the dignity of S=
anatana Dharma from all asuras, from all unprovoked assaults, and from bigo=
ted Unknown Bloggers everywhere. We WILL celebrate Sanatana Dharma as a div=
ine, spiritual path open to all sincere seekers, regardless of their race, =
or the race of their parents. We WILL see the reconstruction of Vedic civil=
ization in our very lifetimes. Evam bhavatu.

This will be my only statemen=
t on the embarrassingly sad case of the Unknown Bigot. With the exception o=
f this:

Mera naam Dharma Pravartaka Acharya hai. 
Mein Bharatiya naheen hu=
n. 
LEKIN MEIN HINDU HUN!

Sri Sri Radha Krishna ki jaya!
Sri Gurudeva ki j=
aya! 
Sanatana Dharma ki jaya!


Addendum:  My father was a truly kind and =
gentle soul. My mother and I lost him suddenly and painfully to a heart att=
ack in 2004. He is missed by many. I dedicate this article to his memory.
