Navaratri Sadhana: The Bestower of Celestial Boons 

=





The festivals of Navaratri are auspicious occasions for the purpose of=
 sadhana. They fall around the two main six-monthly equinoctial divisions o=
f the year and have special temporal and spiritual significance. The import=
ance of morning and evening sandhya (specific prayer-rituals) at the junctu=
res of day and night in daily life is also because of this. The wise do not=
 waste this time in eating, sleeping and other mundane affairs. Rather they=
 use this time for prayers and meditation like sandhya-vandan, self-contemp=
lation and self-refinement, because at a subtle level these times are so ch=
arged with harmonizing vibrations that even small effort in sadhana bear ex=
traordinary fruit. 

During this auspicious confluence of seasons, the subt=
le nature undergoes great changes. In the Puranas, it is even held that the=
 seasons remain in a state of menstruation for the nine days. Just as a men=
struating woman has to observe a certain discipline about food, thoughts an=
d conduct, even so during the transitional time-slots of dawn and dusk, one=
 ought to remain in a calm and receptive mental and physical condition. Acc=
ording to arogyashastra (the normative science of health), too, this nine-d=
ay period generates a tidal wave in the physical life force, which nullifie=
s and expels whatever toxic elements had accumulated in the body during the=
 preceding six months on account of irregularities in food and living sched=
ule. Routine bodily imbalances like fever, cough, cold, etc. should be cons=
idered a natural symptom of this elimination process. Similarly, there is a=
n enhanced flow of vital spiritual energy all around during the Navaratri p=
eriod.
 Therefore, sadhana done during this period fructifies with multiple=
 benefits ranging from expulsion of toxic wastes from the body and mind to =
the bestowal of divine gifts of fulfillment of noble aspirations. Those wit=
h intuitive insight (prajna) never miss the special occasion of Shakti- sad=
hana (Shakti - the energy aspect of Divinity) during the Navaratri Parvas. =


This sadhana takes different forms. The devotees of Ram read the Ramayana=
 while that of Krishna, the Gita or Srimadbhagvat. The Devi-worshippers dev=
ote themselves to different forms of Durga-stuti. Ascetics undertake rigoro=
us penance and austeristies. 

In tantric cults, Shava- sadhana (sadhana wi=
th a corpse), Kumari-pujan (worship of a maiden), Kundalini-jagaran (awaken=
ing the kundalini), chakra-vedhan (piercing extra-sensory energy centres) a=
nd other such practices are especially undertaken during this period. The p=
rajna-parijans perform the mini anusthana of Gayatri sadhana in the form of=
 24 thousand mantra-japas. 

It is necessary to grasp the essence of Navara=
tri - anusthana propounded by our rishis. According to them, Navaratri symb=
olizes the nine doors or sense organs, which are situated in the Ayodhya of=
 the human body. Through misuse or abuse, bred by ignorance, they are clogg=
ed with dross. Hence, through anusthana, we have to reflect on all the door=
s (one door each night) and by cleansing them awaken the divine potencies l=
atent in them. Indeed, this is the real meaning of Navaratri - sadhana. For=
 want of self-restraint and discipline, all the inner energy gets drained o=
ut of these outlets making the individual emaciated, feeble and poor. Throu=
gh sadhana, this wasteful discharge of energy is checked and the purpose of=
 Shakti- sadhana fulfilled. 

In the anusthana, the sadhak, with solemn inn=
er determination, conducts himself within a set frame work of discipline an=
d austerities and adopts a specific method of upasana (worship). He thereby=
 engages in refining and purifying his inner-self. In the course of mini Ga=
yatri anusthana of 24 thousand japas, a daily japa of 27 rosaries of the ma=
ntra recitation is prescribed which, at normal pace, is completed in 3 to 4=
 hours. If a novice is unable to recite the full Gayatri mantra, he can sti=
ll complete the requisite number of japas with the five-syllable Gayatri "O=
m bhurbhuva=C2=A1 sva=C2=A1". This takes only one hour daily. The Navaratri=
 - sadhana done with reverential faith (Shraddha) fructifies with miraculou=
s effects with respect to self-elevation. This is because Gayatri is the su=
preme creative energy, which bestows virtuous qualities and enhances the el=
ements of divinity and spirituality in the body, mind and soul of the sadha=
k. This is the royal highway to
 self-realization. 

A question may arise h=
ere that Navaratri is associated with the worship of Durga and so, how is G=
ayatri anusthana related with it. One should know that Durga - Mahakali is =
a form of Gayatri Mahashakti. Durga is the name of the form of the supreme =
force that destroys whatever is base, evil and dark. The worship of Durga i=
n her nine external forms is done precisely with a view that she destroys t=
he vices, which have taken root in our sense-consciousness. It is the sinfu=
l tendencies / instincts of man that are the Mahisasur (the buffalo-demon).=
 In Navaratri, an attempt is made to restrain and throw out of our psyche t=
hose tendencies through mental resolve and regulated conduct. A self-contro=
lled and purified soul is endowed with the power of Durga, Mahakali or Gaya=
tri. This very force, upon refinement of inner consciousness, becomes the d=
estroyer of Mahisasur (mahisasur mardini). 

During Navaratri anusthana, me=
ditation is sought to be intensified and focused with japa to maintain the =
flow of mind towards deeper and higher rages of consciousness. In sakara up=
asana or worship of a visible form of Divinity, contemplation is on the Ido=
l of Gayatri or the Gurusatta, while worshippers of the nirakara (indetermi=
nate or attributeless) concentrate on the Sun and its radiating rays as Gay=
atri Shakti. When the appropriate mood is achieved, the mind turns effortle=
ssly to the Mother-sentiment (Matribhava), lips continue automatically with=
 the japa and the fingers with the beads of rosary, and the mind is absorbe=
d in receiving uninterrupted affection and energy from the Mother. In this =
period, one should specially engage in introspection. The mind should be ke=
pt free from anxieties and distractions as for as possible. In introspectio=
n, there should be an attempt to evaluate the direction of life led so far,=
 to consciously be aware of the
 negativities within oneself and to outline=
 concrete course of action for their rectification through self-refinement =
and penance. A firm resolve should be made to inculcate the qualities of ex=
cellence and goodness in life. An effective programme should be chalked out=
 for integration of the elements of sadhana, svadhyaya (study and contempla=
tion), sanyam (self-control) and seva (service of the needy) in life so tha=
t there emerges a composite way of life in which self-development goes side=
-by-side with due observance of familial and social responsibilities. Thus,=
 if a clearer and better outline of the future course of life could be form=
ed and confidence be generated to implement it during Navaratri sadhana, it=
 should be deemed that one has received an immediate prasada (divine grace)=
 of Mother Gayatri. It should be clearly understood that only through noble=
 deeds could we actualize our higher potentials and be the rightful recipie=
nts of God=E2=80=99s grace. 

Some basic rules of Navaratri sadhana should =
be strictly followed. Important ones among these are fasting, continence, s=
leeping on a hard bed, not taking service from others, and keeping the dail=
y routine well regulated and disciplined. 

These apart, at the mental plan=
e, too, one should try to remain in an exalted state of happiness, goodwill=
, calm, peace and contemplation. Even while engaged in meeting your normal =
daily obligations, the sadhak should remain immersed in Ista-remembrance an=
d keep oneself free from envy, jealousy, idle-gossip and slander. Maintain =
your mental poise even in adverse circumstances. All creatures of the world=
 are the progeny of Mother Gayatri. The Mother indwells all. This awareness=
 should be the basis of all activities of the sadhak while heading the path=
 of sanyam, svadhyaya, sadhana and seva and inspiring others, too, to do th=
e same. 

The Navaratri sadhana completed in this lofty state of mind and w=
ithin the framework of the above mentioned prescriptions will certainly pro=
ve to be the bestower of heavenly blessings of Gayatri Mahashakti and Gurus=
atta on the sadhak. The sadhak must participate in the Havana (offerings in=
to the sacred yagya-fire) on the purnahuti day praying for universal peace,=
 well-being, and happiness with every oblationSource: http://www.akhandjyot=
