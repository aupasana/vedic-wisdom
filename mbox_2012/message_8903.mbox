Hi Priya,

I agree it's a terrible pity India now seems to be under Ravana-=
rajyam instead of Rama rajyam. We are lucky that we still have some good so=
uls in the country who are trying their best to overcome the negative force=
s around them. 

Nice idea to do more Vishnu homams for peace and prosperit=
y of the world, and to give support to the positive sattvic forces. Will do=
 more of these in the new year. 

Happy new year to you and to everyone. :)=
 

Best wishes,

Aparna
