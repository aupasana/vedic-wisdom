Respected Narasimha ji,

Wonderful explanation. Your write ups and classes =
are really helping us to learn astrology.

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir=
,
=C2=A0
I am replying to the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup without revealing you=
r identity.
=C2=A0
1. Not really. It may bear fruit in next life or 10 live=
s later or in THIS life itself too! All are possible.
=C2=A0
Imagine a pipe=
line with a lot of balls in it. If you throw a new ball forcefully into it,=
 it may get stuck and some old ball from long back may come out of it at th=
e other end. However, it really depends on the density of balls stuck in th=
e pipeline! If it's too dense, a ball thrown now may come after hundred bal=
ls. If it's light, a ball thrown now may come out pretty quickly.
=C2=A0
2.=
 Any good or bad karmas done with identification and attachment will give t=
heir fruits (good or bad) and bind one. But karmas done with surrender and =
detachment will not bind one. The goal of life is to keep
 performing good =
karmas to pay off debts incurred earlier and, in the process, reach a state=
 of detachment.
=C2=A0
Action is not the problem. External world is not the=
 problem. But expectation of fruit (reaction from the external world) from =
that action and attachment to it, is the problem. THAT is what binds us.
=
=C2=A0
3. Yes, developing dispassion is the key. Compassion towards others,=
 passion for doing good to others and dispassion towards any results coming=
 from it, is useful. Premature dispassion towards life itself when one has =
many rinas can block one. Instead, dispassion towards the results of action=
s while one still performs best possible actions, is more helpful.
=C2=A0
F=
eelings won't go away easily. It is the job of mind to have "feelings". A g=
ood way to overcome them may be to direct them towards a larger sense of se=
lf than this ballon of blood and flesh (and the names world gives this ball=
on and the stories worlds tells
 about it). Instead of looking at things fr=
om one's perspective, seeing them from the perspective of others and feelin=
g compassion for them may be a better use of the ability (and tendency) of =
mind to have "feelings".
=C2=A0
4. Yes, that is a good way of putting it.
=
=C2=A0
5. Yes, they are "hitting around the bush" and "the root is in our o=
wn self". However, as we cannot normally see the root and can only see the =
bush, it is very useful to hit around the bush. It can eventually show us t=
he root!
=C2=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear PVRNR 

The concept of 'prarabdha kar=
ma' as i understood means all the experiences of the current life is a resu=
lt of actions of our previous lives. The fruits of actions of the
 current =
life will be experienced only in the next life as per this concept. 

If my=
 understanding of the concept is right then i have the=C2=A0 following quer=
ies: 

1. No matter what one does in the current life (like praying for hea=
lth, money, etc.) it will only manifest in the next life. Then is it not ju=
st a coincidence if a prayer is answered or sadhana bears material fruits (=
as it would have manifested anyway even in the absence of any efforts in th=
e current life since it was due from the previous life)? 

2. If our birth =
is only to empty this karma i.e. a man doing good deeds will be born again =
to enjoy its pleasures and suffer pain for bad deeds, is it not necessary t=
o absolutely refrain from any deed either good or bad to avoid re-birth? 

=
3. Is it not enough to focus on 'sanchitha karma'=C2=A0 in the present life=
 and direct all our efforts in developing dispassion towards material exist=
ence and empty the antahkarna of
 all the feelings and dispositions? 

4. D=
oes every spiritual activity merely try to entice the common person with ma=
terial gains but has a hidden purpose of liberating the mind of desires? (w=
hich is the only tangible result experienced from a sadhana) 

5. If the 4t=
h point is true then prayer, homa, devotion, good deeds, austerities, penan=
ce, etc. are all hitting around the bush. The root is in our own self. Abso=
lute vigilance on=C2=A0 self is all that is needed to realise liberty and m=
anifest at will ? 

Thank you for your time and patience
