Vivekananda has some interesting thoughts on the subject of serving our fel=
low human beings. 

He says! 

"Do you love your fellow men? Where should y=
ou go to seek for God -- are not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, God=
s? Why not worship them first? Believe in the omnipotent power of love. Hav=
e you love?-- you are omnipotent."

"Look upon every man, woman, and every =
one as God. You cannot help anyone, you can only serve: serve the children =
of the Lord, serve the Lord Himself, if you have the privilege. If the Lord=
 grants that you can help any one of his children, blessed you are; do not =
think too much of yourselves. Blessed you are that that privilege was given=
 to you when others had it not. Do it only as a worship. I should see God i=
n the poor, and it is for my salvation that I go and worship them. The poor=
 and the miserable are for our salvation, so that we may serve the Lord, co=
ming in the shape of the diseased, coming in the shape of the lunatic, the =
leper, and the sinner!"

Vivekananda's ideal is a great one, but I find, no=
 easy task. Japa is pleasant. But karma yoga, serving people of all sorts..=
..sometimes ungrateful, angry, even dangerous people...with love is one hec=
k of a challenge. 

Here is just one remarkable example of wonderful karma =
yoga. I'm sure there are many other people who do this, without labelling t=
hemselves spiritual. This chap risks his life daily in a war-torn zone for =
the sake of others. Wish I had half his courage.

s/magazine-17314391 

I guess the acid test of spiritual progress is how mu=
ch we do for others. If I do japa all day, while the man next to me is sick=
 and starving, I doubt God would be impressed. Japa cleans the mind. The fr=
uit of japa surely has to be a burning desire to serve humanity. And there =
is no dearth of suffering on this planet, and no lack of opportunity to ser=
ve. 

Don't think it matters whether or not we see fancy visions in meditat=
ion, or hear 'anahata sounds' or anything else. All that stuff is great I g=
uess, but if it's not accompanied by a burning desire to relieve the miseri=
es of our fellow men/women, it probably ain't worth anything much. 

We all=
 talk about meditation and japa....karma yoga is not so fun, but just as vi=
tal. 

Well, at least, Vivekananda seems to think so anyway! I've got a lon=
g way to go before I reach his ideal of a karma yogi....hope you guys are d=
oing better than me! 

Good luck with your karma yoga eveyone. :) 

Aparna =
