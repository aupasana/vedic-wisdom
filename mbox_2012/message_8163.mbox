Hello,
           Several years ago, =
I was suffering from similar sort of things and may be much more, but as I =
kept doing prayers and jap, these were somehow kept at bay. Those days I al=
so used to go to healers like reiki and also
learned different types of hea=
ling methods for personal growth. So again it was a great help in reducing =
stress and mental pain and wandering.

What I will suggest that you should =
check out EFT on internet. It is a extremely potent method of self healing =
and growth and protection. There are several groups which are offering solu=
tions to different problems using EFT.
on you tube etc. Although it is alwa=
ys a very good thing if there is a caring family member or friend to give s=
upport but many times we have to make certain effort ourselves. In learning=
 EFT on internet you do not have to pay a single penny.

If it is possible =
depending on your physical health do body detox every 2/3 months to clean o=
ut inner system.
I can write certain other methods but it might make you mo=
re confused and I certainly do not want it.

What ever you decide , Do not =
leave your everyday prayers and jap etc.

Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Respected N=
ARASIMHA ji and other learned scholar,

I am posting my condition with a ho=
pe of getting some relief and solution. Kindly do not judge me based on my =
condition, rather give me some positive solution and perspective to what I =
am going through.

I am a very strong beloved of god and a very strong devo=
tee. I love to worship him as much as I can.however, all my passion, intere=
st seems to get drained and discouraged due to my mindset and the hell I go=
 through because of it. I always , always get negative & abusive thoughts a=
nd tie those to the god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see a negative =
thing, bad or foul my mind relates or ties it to god. My mind start abusing=
 god with the same foul language.
When I do Japam,  my mind would not get c=
oncentration, but goes into this evil mode with racing thoughts.
I can't se=
e directly into the eyes of god with the fear of my mind abusing him I can'=
t focus my drishti on god statues. My thoughts are extremely foul...most sp=
ecially foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my worship, which=
 means I don't give up praying him. I requested him several times to relive=
 me from such pain so that I can increase my devotion and prayers. I love h=
im. I want to pray him.
Currently, my mind and it's racing evil & foul thou=
ghts have become a road block in my devotion and trying to keep me away fro=
m him as much as possible. At one point of time, they dominated me and I ha=
d to stay away from praying him for a while.

Now my questions are
Am I a M=
aha papi or ghora papi that this is happening to me?
Why does it happen to =
me?
Is it some kind of disorder
Am in incurring wrath of god
I am scared to=
 death that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough for some 100 births
W=
hat can I do to get out of this perversion and be able to concentrate on hi=
m
I want to worship god like every one does
I am highly stressed because of=
 this constant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always in pain because of=
 this stress.

Please help me , but do no hate me. Please do not disregard =
or discard my email. This is a situation I can't disclose to anyone in pers=
on with the fear of hatred and resentment. I am hoping to get some relief f=
rom learned scholars like yourself.

Respected <span class=3D"mark">NARASI=
MHA</span> <span class=3D"mark">ji</span> and other
<span class=3D"mark">le=
arned</span> scholar,<br>
<br>
I am posting my condition with a hope of get=
ting some relief and solution. Kindly do not judge me based on my condition=
, rather give me some positive solution and perspective to what I am going =
through.<br>
<br>
I am a very strong beloved of god and a very strong devot=
ee. I love to worship him as much as I can.however, all my passion, interes=
t seems to get drained and discouraged due to my mindset and the hell I go =
through because of it. I always , always get negative
 & abusive though=
ts and tie those to the god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see a negat=
ive thing, bad or foul my mind relates or ties it to god. My mind start abu=
sing god with the same foul language.<br>
When I do <span class=3D"mark">Ja=
pam</span>,  my mind would not get concentration, but goes into this e=
vil mode with racing thoughts.<br>
I can't see directly into the eyes of go=
d with the fear of my mind abusing him I can't focus my
<span class=3D"mark=
">drishti</span> on god statues. My thoughts are extremely foul...most spec=
ially foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my worship, which m=
eans I don't give up praying him. I requested him several times to relive m=
e from such pain
 so that I can increase my devotion and prayers. I love hi=
m. I want to pray him. <br>
Currently, my mind and it's racing evil &a=
mp; foul thoughts have become a road block in my devotion and trying to kee=
p me away from him as much as possible. At one point of time, they dominate=
d me and I had to stay away from praying him for a while.<br>
<br>
Now my q=
uestions are<br>
Am I a <span class=3D"mark">Maha</span> <span class=3D"mar=
k">papi</span> or <span class=3D"mark">
ghora</span> <span class=3D"mark">p=
api</span> that this is happening to me?<br>
Why does it happen to me?<br>
=
Is it some kind of disorder<br>
Am in incurring wrath of god <br>
I am=
 scared to death that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough for some 10=
0 births<br>
What can I do to get out of this perversion and be able to con=
centrate on him<br>
I want to worship god like every one does<br>
I am high=
ly stressed because of this constant battle. My forehead area, jaws are alw=
ays in pain because of this stress.<br>
<br>
Please help me , but do no hat=
e me. Please do not disregard or discard my email. This is a situation I ca=
n't disclose to anyone in person with the fear of hatred and resentment. I =
am hoping to get some relief from
<span class=3D"mark">learned</span> schol=
