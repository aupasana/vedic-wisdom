Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam in the kitchen while standing
 

=C2=A0 =

Dear all,

I'm afraid I have a very stupid question. Is it okay to do homa=
m while standing up? 

I once did a very simple homam while cooking. While =
the food cooked for 20-30 minutes, I muttered the mantras and tended to a s=
mall homam kunda (basically a brass bowl, with some wooden sticks and ghee =
and basil leaf offerings) that I placed on the table next to the cooking fo=
od. 

It was a very pleasant experience. Far from feeling distracted, the s=
implicity of the whole process made it easier for me to focus on the mantra=
. 

The key thing is I could do this sort of a homam every day, as I cook m=
ost days. And my family would not complain that I am spending too much time=
 away from them doing spiritual things. (It might even give the food a bett=
er flavour as people say that food cooked while repeating mantras with feel=
ing absorbs the mantra...who knows!)

I am thinking of doing an ultra simpl=
e homam while standing in the kitchen. Please tell me if you think this is =
against the scriptures, as I wouldn't want to do it if so.

I know people s=
ay feeling is more important that ritual. This homam procedure gives me a p=
retty good feeling. I'm planning to give it a try again and see how it feel=
s. I was wondering if there is anything in the scriptures that forbids doin=
g homam standing up? If I can generate concentration and feeling while stan=
ding and doing the homam, surely it will be equally effective (I hope so an=
yway). 

Thanks very much in advance. Sorry if it sounds silly! 

Aparna

P=
.S. I am doing a weekly homam the 'proper' way i.e. sitting down and focuss=
ing. Just wanted to do a daily one and this would be the best way for me ri=
ght now. I have read the Agnihotra homam can be done "anywhere" so wonderin=
g about other homams.
