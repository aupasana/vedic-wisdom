Namaste

A few ideas around the question of why jeevanmukta do end up getti=
ng seriously sick such as Paramhans Ramakrishna.

It may be a case where a =
jeevanmukta may have cleared up everything 
and may choose to go anytime, h=
owever it seems that many of 
them do take karmas from their disciples or o=
ther people so that these
disciples of jeevanmukta make a little quicker pr=
ogress in their journey. Case in point Ramakrishna paramhans, Ramana Mahari=
shi and Ranchoddasji Maharaj and many more ...

I also read that a jeevanmu=
kta may have  cleared up everything on his plate but there may be others ar=
ound him, may be accumulated many things like serving the jeevanmukta or ta=
king good care of him etc.
This sanskars a jeevanmukta needs help clear up =
for those people
as once the jeevanmukta merges what would have to those sa=
nskars of other people?

I also read recently a very interesting book that =
described about this jeevanmukta and a great saint suggested that  everyone=
 born
in this world as human being has a lifespan allocated to him or her.
=
But before that lifespan is over and the person accomplishes jeevanmukti, a=
t that point that person can take any form etc.
Some of these jeevanmuktas =
discard the body and negotiate the balance of there lifespan in sukshma sar=
eer (body) and they present themselves at there will and help any sadhaks i=
n spiritual journey.
They do this till there allocated lifespan is over.

B=

 Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better way
