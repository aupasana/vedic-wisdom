Ashwin this may be Ati-prasna.
Did you really, really in your life, faced w=
ith that situation? or is it
only the intellectual curiosity to see how oth=
er person answers when posed
with contraints?
I we go in that line of thoug=
ht, why don't you think that even giving milk
to the child, we are making t=
he calf unfed and the mother cow is crying!!
Even if we give the milk to th=
e calf, the mother cow is grazing the grass
to produce milk thus now grass =
which is also a conscious entity is as
sorrow. These kind of question never=
 ends.

You know the answer for these questions, don't you? If not ask the =
inner
chambers of your heart, you surely know.
Let us just remember this:
W=
hich ever action takes us near to divinity is dharma, whatever takes us
far=
 from the Lord is adharma.

Further, I think, the main theme of this mail c=
hain is this:
Does offering in fire have any purpose?
much better rephrase =
is
*Does offering to Yajneshwara have any purpose?*

and I respect Narasimh=
a-ji for giving best illustrations regarding the
purpose/meaning behind it.=


*Wishing a great time ahead*
*Hari*
