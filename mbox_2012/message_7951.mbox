ubject: [vedic-wisdom] The ways of karma By Sri Sri RaviSankar
 

=C2=A0 
E=
very object in the universe is endowed with four
characteristics: dharma, k=
arma, prema and gyana. Of these, karma is the most
talked about; it is also=
 the most misunderstood. The Gita says: "Gahna
Karmanyo Gathi" -- Unfathoma=
ble are the ways of karma. 
=C2=A0
There are three types of karma: Prarabha=
, sanchita and
agami. The first is latent karma, an impression or seed of a=
ction. The second
is karma as action, and the third is karma as result. Pra=
rabha means 'begun';
the action that is already manifesting and that is yie=
lding its effect right
now. You cannot avoid it or change it, as it is alre=
ady happening. Sanchita is
accumulated karma. It is latent or manifested in=
 the form of a tendency or
impression in the mind. 
=C2=A0
Sanchita karma c=
an be burned off by spiritual practices
before it manifests. Agami karma is=
 the future karma of action; that which has
not yet come and which will tak=
e effect in the future. If you commit a crime,
you may not get caught today=
, but will live with the possibility that one day
you may get caught. 
=C2=
=A0
Karma is also always bound by time, because every action has
a limited =
reaction. If you do something good to people they will come to thank
you an=
d be grateful to you as long as they are experiencing the effect of your
ac=
tion. So, karma has only a limited sphere of its effect, be it good or bad.=
 
=C2=A0
It is often asked, "Why are good people made to
suffer while those=
 who commit injustice go unpunished?" Such questions
arise when we see an e=
vent in its limited framework. No good action will yield
a bad result and n=
o bad action will bring a good result. This is the law of
karma. As you sow=
, so shall you reap. If you sow a mango tree, some thorny
bushes may come u=
p because of the seeds present in the manure brought from
somewhere else. I=
t is not the mango seed that brings up the thorny bush. Your
mango seed wil=
l bring mango fruit, in due course. 
=C2=A0
Karma is that which propels rei=
ncarnation. The stronger the
impression, the greater the possibility of the=
 next life being according to
that. So, often you reincarnate like the pers=
on you hate or love. The mind
which is full of different impressions leaves=
 this body but the impressions
await suitable situations to come back. So t=
he last thought is very important.
Whatever you do throughout your life, in=
 the last moment your mind should be
free and happy. 
=C2=A0
Our perception=
 of suffering, of good and bad, is always
relative. God is absolute reality=
; a witness of all. See God as movie director,
rather than as a judge. He h=
as no ill feeling for the villain and no special
favour for the hero. Each =
one is playing her role. 
=C2=A0
An awareness of dharma helps in comprehend=
ing the strange
ways of karma. Whenever you see bad karma or someone suffer=
ing, you need to
help. That is your dharma. If you do not do your dharma, t=
hen you incur bad
karma for not having done your dharma. Take recourse in y=
our dharma to
transcend the bondage of karma and avoid getting stuck with e=
vents or
personalities. Live with karma; don't be attached to it. 'See acti=
on in
inaction and inaction in action' says the Gita. Awareness, alertness,=
 knowledge
and meditation will help erase past impressions. It has the stre=
ngth to
dissolve and destroy any karma and free you.
