Namaste - When at Iskcon, Srila Prabhupada was asked, who serves Lord bette=
r ? the cook who cooks prasadam ? the cleaner who cleans the temple ? the s=
inger who sings amazing kirtans ? the donors who offer money, etc. 
He ment=
ioned - the one who serves Lord whatever service that is unconditionally is=
 dear to Lord and can serve Lord better.

Most of the poojas have worship o=
f multiple deities and most of the brahmins who do the nitya karma recite g=
ayatri, rudram, purusha / narayana / sri suktam followed by mantra pushpam.=
 

While it is true that serving one master is always easier, depends on if=
 one takes multiple deities as single master or multiple!

Anyways, I will =
let the learned answer this better.
