Pranam,

Wondering if the learned members can enlighten me for Do's and Don=
't for Pooja at Kalahasti temple. 


I am planning to visit Kalahasti templ=
e during Aug'12 with my family and perform Rahu ketu, and Sarpa dosh pooja.=
 I have read
on internet that after performing pooja one shouldn't visit an=
y other temple and directly go to home/hotel.
I will follow this rule, but =
my doubt is --can we go to Tirupati temple first before going to Kalahasti =
temple? Pooja
at Kalahasti would be during rahu kalam- Sunday afternoon/eve=
ning, so can we visit Tirupati temple in Morning or
someone performing Kala=
hasti pooja should not go to any other temple before and after the pooja?

=
I would appreciate all the suggestions/recommendations in this regards.

Th=
anks

Vikram
