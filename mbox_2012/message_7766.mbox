My two cents:

Shivasahasra nama stotram is a rare gem expounded by none ot=
her than Lord
Krishna TO Upamanyu maharshi(Bhishma told Vishnusahasranaamam=
 sitting on
bed of arrows as ordained by lord Krishna). It is very potent s=
totram which
is recommended for chanting during unrest in cities/town/count=
ries or a
simple family unit for restoring peace as told by H.H.Paramachary=
a Of
Kanchipuram.

Do it on Thursday for peace of mind.

Thanks
