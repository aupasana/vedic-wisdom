Dear Narasimhaji,

Ideally what you said is logical that we should keep the=
 lamp burning 24x7. However in cold countries where rooms are heated, it is=
 a bit risky to have all the doors and ventilation closed in the night and =
have a lamp burning as it could cause oxygen depletion in the room.....

He=
nce I would assume that in cold countries, people would have no option but =
to extinguish it before going to sleep.

Regards,
Ram

=C2=A0 
Namaste brother,
=C2=A0
Le=
t me give a simple analogy.
=C2=A0
If you do not want someone to stop eatin=
g because there is no food in his plate, then serve enough food and serve m=
ore when the food in the plate is getting over. But, dragging one away from=
 the plate (even if with "care and humility") when there is still some food=
 left in the plate and one is still eating, is not correct. Same with lamp.=

=C2=A0
But there is some basis for what you heard. Lamp is a symbol of one=
's internal fire that throws light on things and brings clarity. Oil is a s=
ymbol of the lifeforce or praana that keeps the internal fire burning. That=
 way, lamp running out of oil is not good.
=C2=A0
IF one's internal fire do=
es develop a strong link to a specific lamp through resonance over time, th=
en that lamp should ideally not extinguish due to lack of oil, for that wil=
l cause some bad things internally through resonance. However, the solution=
 is not to kill the lamp even when there is oil (which is far worse), but t=
o keep a constant supply of enough oil in it!!
=C2=A0
In fact, in old days,=
 each sadhaka would maintain one lamp that would burn all the time (24x7). =
They would put enough oil in it and keep replenishing it once or twice ever=
yday. With that practice, their internal fire would develop a very deep res=
onance to that lamp over time. When they start fire in homam or fire for co=
oking or light another lamp for pooja, they would always take fire from tha=
t constantly burning lamp as the seed fire. When they die, the same lamp wo=
uld be used by son to light the funeral pyre and the lamp would then finall=
y be put off. Until then, it keeps burning always. THAT may not be possible=
 for most of us today.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Because I give my opin=
ions on dharmik issues, I want to humbly make one thing clear, to remove an=
y wrong impressions.
=C2=A0
I am not very well-read on dharma shastras or a=
n authority in any way. Nor am I recognized by any peethas or mathas or rel=
igious institutions. I speak based on my internal insight and commonsense a=
nd also based on the authority of the command of my guru to me to rely on m=
y internal insight and speak my mind on dharmik matters freely, frankly and=
 firmly. I speak very confidently, because I personally have conviction in =
what I say (I keep quiet in matters where I have no conviction) and in the =
blessings of my gurus on my commonsense. But that may not be good enough fo=
r some.
=C2=A0
Those who have faith in me and value my opinion may follow m=
e, but those who seek opinions of a well-read scholar may want to seek opin=
ion from someone else. Many religious institutions, peethas and mathas do e=
ngage such scholars.

Narasimha

Thanks for this message and ind=

At home, my Father always instructs me to=
 use the flowers in the Pooja=C2=A0 to extinguish the flame and to commit t=

If i have understood your message correct=

Please clarify.

Nama=
ste, 

I visited someone's pradosha pooja when I visited Texas last week. T=
he 
pooja was very nice and sincere and I loved it, but I noticed one bad 
=
practice and honestly told them what I thought. I want to share the same 
w=
ith all of you. 

Showing deepam or lamp to the lord is one of the upachara=
s (services) 
performed in the pooja after the abhishekam (bathing). In som=
e 
traditions, they show multiple lamp setups with multiple numbers of 
wic=
ks, each setup with a specific mantra. While the abhishekam and 
upacharas =
were going on, I was sitting with eyes closed and meditating 
with Gayatri =
mantra. After the showing of various lamps, I felt 
something negative and =
opened my eyes. I saw that one person was 
forcibly extinguishing the fire =
in each wick with a rose petal. 

God knows if the idol or Shiva lingam use=
d in a pooja has divine 
presence or not, but live moving fire DOES have go=
d in it. It is not at 
all a good idea to extinguish fire forcibly. If keep=
ing tens of wicks 
burning is not practical, put very little oil in each wi=
ck so that it 
lights for a small time only. If you can't wait, then don't =
light so 
many wicks. Just light 1-5 wicks and show them with all mantras. =
That is 
far better than showing a lamp with 21 wicks, another lamp with an=
other 
number of wicks and so on and then forcibly extinguishing all the te=
ns 
of wicks. Even if an auspicious material like rose petal is used to 
pr=
ess and extinguish, that does not make it acceptable.
