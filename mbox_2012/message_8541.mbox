Dear Ajit,

<Even if the play goes on, 
different actors may play the part.=
>

Interesting. This did not cross my mind. Variety is the spice of life!

=

<I
 am curious -- do you believe that the universe is maya (the way it it =

commonly portrayed by advaitins), or do you believe that it is "real" 
(th=
e way it is commonly portrayed by dvaitins)? Or perhaps something 
differen=
t altogether?>

I believe that "Maya" means a sort of limited perception du=
e lack of complete information. It exists not just in the physical universe=
, but even in other non-physical states, though the degree maybe different.=
 Is the average waking consciousness real? Yes. Are higher/different states=
 of awareness real? Yes. 

Everything, from the physical world to non-physi=
cal realms exist and is an extension of the Supreme. Maya is nothing more t=
han whatever obstructs an individual's mind from realizing that inherent un=
ity. From an individual (human entity) perspective, the point of maximum st=
illness is the Purusha, what is called atmah/soul, and everything else, fro=
m points of lesser stillness to the external objective reality is Shakti. E=
xtending this principle to the Universe, the purely transcendental non-chan=
ging, non-negotiable reality can be called the "atmah" while everything els=
e, semi-transcendental to the objective reality all around is Shakti. Thus =
in short, using scriptural terms, Nirguna Brahman is the state of mind of G=
od, while the Universe(s)/various realm(s) is the body of God. Both are irr=
evocable linked for all practical purposes.=C2=A0 Maya is whatever inhibits=
 an individual cell (a human being or animal or plant or anything) in the b=
ody of the God - that is
 Universe(s) - from realizing the greater picture.=
 

Am I making sense? -:)

-Regards

Even if the play goes on, diffe=
rent actors may play the part. Every station within this realm can be attai=
ned by "human" effort. It is not simply destined to happen. The Manus, Indr=
as, and *all other beings* are simply roles played by some beings. In Yoga =
Vasistha (2.5.14-16), we are told that this applies to Brahma, Vishnu and S=
hiva as well.

For a moment, let us assume that "freedom from rebirth" exis=

ish, "Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me." X was of course ta=
ken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and more over he had =
no clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the =
garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes).

>The man continued, "My name is =
Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by profession, but lef=
t home long back and have been a wondering sadhu since then." X asked him, =
why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied,=
 "All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is source of all confus=
ion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, reall=
y no one. And God is the reason for all=C2=A0 the religious troubles and ot=
her nonsense." X felt a little irritated, "Why do you have so much bitterne=
ss about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu for long, then h=
ow come you haven't met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?". M=
r Iyengar replied, "Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there is only one genui=
ne man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely different deg=
rees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not accessible to ot=
hers." Mr Iyengar continued, "The root
 of all this problem is this God bus=
iness. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is infinite=
 is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best a man wil=
l only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-powers. If t=
he individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this form by a pr=
ojection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abilities fr=
om this form, and generally be regarded=C2=A0 by others as a man of god. Bu=
t God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying t=
o understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one ha=
s understood correctly." While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-st=
all and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum. Then h=
eld the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke =
in small bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a =
clear mind in your head, don't get
 confused by all these show of spiritual=
ity you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mi=
stakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young man in the lo=
cality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having nothing better t=
o do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God =
really is and how to interact with this thing." As he spoke he reached a tw=
o storied house, and a man, woman and a=C2=A0 young girl came out of the ho=
use. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too come =
inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay at th=
eir house. I will show you something interesting if you join me.

ter an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The w=
oman was bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the youn=
g girl was massaging Mr Iyengar's feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying th=
e hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone els=
e but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a househ=
older and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, h=
e saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folde=
d hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X=
 was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turn=
ed round to see=C2=A0 what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open=
 in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, the=
re sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whol=
e skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up
 t=
he whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, =
with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any more but =
a god sitting in place of what was even five minutes back only a frail, dir=

 the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really means.=
 After providing directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyenga=

 does not understand infinity, art

r nobody  understands infinity. It is a summation of all that we know,=
 all that we can  imagine and all that is impossible for us to imagine=
. It is an incomprehensible force that runs through everything, from the mo=

 everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from living t=
o non-living, as a manifestation of that force and thus learn to love the s=
ame unconditionally without expecting anything in return. No wonder such un=
conditional love is not easy. It needs tremendous effort to change our own =
conditioning of the mind, and work on our inherent biases and prejudices. T=
hat is what the  aim of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, to=
 make one ready to be able to unconditionally love everything. The greater =
number of entities one can love unconditionally, that much little bit close=
r one can come to interacting with the truly infinite. And those few rare h=
uman beings who can love a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly the=
 closest to this supreme and unknowable force. In common language, we call =
them Rishis. </font></div>
