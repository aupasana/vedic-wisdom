Namaste,

Let me try to answer the questions from my perspective, as it =
stands at this moment. 

<<> 6. A common person gives =C2 a damn to the con=
cept of liberation. When ever i =C2 have discussion with people in my offic=
e they think =C2 i am mad . How should one deal with that because i =C2 thi=
nk that people =C2 who are unaware of this great concept should be taught w=
ith this ideaology.>>

This cannot be forced, this should not be forced. Ye=
s there are plenty of people who have no interest in these, so let them be.=
 Someone likes spirituality, someone else likes something, someone else lik=
es another thing, its all fine. That is how it should be. I used to suffer =
from this compulsive habit of trying to force spiritual discussions on othe=
rs, now thankfully I am relatively cured. On our part, what we can do is no=
t to fall in the trap of thinking that because we are doing some sadhana, o=
r have some interest in these things therefore we are anyway better. Not at=
 all. There is beauty in diversity. I have seen rank atheists who have more=
 detachment and equanimity than many believers. If you want to discuss spir=
ituality, find a group of friends with similar inclination and do so. But n=
ever try to force it on an unwilling individual. Whenever force is applied,=
 it invariable leads to a unpredictable and at times unpleasant reaction at=
 some later date. 

One of the people whom I consider as one of my gurus, h=
ad told me once, "Duniya banane wala duniya chalana bhi janta hai" (One who=
 made the world also knows how to run the world). Now I believe that statem=
ent is bang on. Feel no pressure. Everything is in safe hands!

<< 5. Why =
=C2 did Gautam Buddha left his wife and his child and even then achieved th=
e status of God?>>

In my view, we use the term God too loosely. There are =
Mahatmas, great Mahatmas, fantastic spiritual beings, and then there is God=
. Buddha was a fantastic and super-duper spiritual being.

Now coming to yo=
ur question, there is no fixed rule of how and what can lead a man to liber=
ation or higher states of spirituality. Frankly, there is no path which *gu=
arantees* liberation. All paths have the potential, but realization is an i=
ndividual's journey, and each such journey will not be a mirror of anyone e=
lse's journey. Broadly there may be similarities, but nuances will differ. =
For some it is necessary to leave their wife and children to be spiritual, =
for others they may not need to do so. 

Infact, the aim of sadhana is to p=
repare yourself. If and when you experience and realize God, it is going be=
 God's sweet will. Sadhana does not guarantee realization, but without sadh=
ana it is nearly impossibly, for you are simply not prepared enough to expe=
rience. 

<<3. I was reading =C2 a newspaper that people after having darsh=
an of Mata Vaishno Devi, Kedarnaath, etc =C2 , while returning, met with ac=
cident and died. Why does this happen? People have just come from a such a =
wonderful darshan then why tragedy strikes them.>> 

The idea of trying to =
force a cause effect relation to everything is an inherent tendency of the =
mind. It is not necessarily how things are. Neither is it useful.

If a man=
 wants to only experience God, then every life-experience, apparently good =
or apparently bad, is only going to take your forward towards the goal if y=
ou keep your aim fixed. No wonder Lord Krishna stresses so much on detachme=
nt and equanimity in his advice to Arjuna, rather than trying to find out c=
ause-effect relationships of the apparently good or the apparently bad kind=
s. 

Sufferings are a great way of focusing on God. Really. Slowly but sure=
ly you realize that the world will run in its own pattern and you cannot do=
 much about it, except control what is in your power to control, that is yo=
ur internal state. 

Krishna gives this advice to Arjuna in the Second Chap=
ter: "Dukhesva Anudhvigna-manah Sukhesu-Vigatasprhah Vita-Raga-Bhaya-Krodha=
h Sthita-Dhira Munir Uchyate" Gita 2:56 [Miseries do not agitate the mind, =
in sukha (fleeting happiness) there is no elation, such a one who is free f=
rom attachment, fear and anger, is a sage of steady mind.]

Tough? Sure. Bu=
t no harm in making an effort. This is something to be tried on a regular b=
asis, day in and day out.

<<2. Persons who do nothing =C2 in the field of =
spirituality can also meet God, higher saints. How is it possible?>>

Depen=
ds on what we understand by the term spirituality. Many have this notion th=
at spirituality only means sitting and doing tough penances ETC. There is m=
ore to spirituality than that. Essentially, it is a transformation of mind,=
 emotions and body (this bit is nearly impossible) into another state. 

Sa=
dhana is needed to prepare the ground - mind/emotions/body. But *meeting Go=
d* (as you put it) depends on what you mean by God, and on God's sweet will=
. Sometimes, living your daily life with an internal sense of surrender to =
a Supreme, trying to inculcate equanimity in testing circumstances, trying =
to stop the mind from automatically reacting to provocations, seeing other =
people's point of views and thus becoming more objective, trying to be comp=
assionate (but not self-pity or pity in any form, for pity is a degenerativ=
e emotion, while compassion is uplifting) ETC are all sadhanas which can be=
 done by anybody. One need not read complex scriptures, or believe in relig=
ion to be able to do these. 

<<1. After effect of Homam can be negative al=
so. Is it true?>>

After effect of any sadhana can be negative (or positive=
), if your aim is anything materialistic. If your aim is purely spiritual t=
ransformation, both so called negative and so called positive will help you=
. 

<<Fulfilling the duties of husband is a blockage in the spiritual path.=
>>

Dharma is never a blockage. When the time is ripe, the Lord sets the pa=
th. 

When Lord Krishna send Uddhava - who was a gyani of the first order -=
 to the Gopis, he was amazed to see that the Gopis would spend the whole da=
y doing whatever they must do, but they would perform every action, even th=
e most mundane like clearing the garbage, with a small prayer in their lips=
, "Sri KrishNaaya Samarpayami..". 

Patience and surrender to God can be in=
culcated, progressively, in any life situation. Infact, it is the ONLY thin=
g that you can work on. Rest, the world around apart from you, will follow =
its own rhythm which has been decided by actions performed in the past whic=
h one may or maynot be aware of. 

Every blockage is an opportunity to incr=
ease the sense of surrender to something Higher, and that in turn acts as a=
 powerful internal catalyst for change.

Caveat: These answers are based on=
 my current perspective of things. They may not be sacrosanct. In future, I=
 myself may or may-not agree to these answers -:)

-Regards
 Rajarshi
