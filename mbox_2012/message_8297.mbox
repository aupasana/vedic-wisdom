Hi Vikram,

There is some logic if you stay much time in the temple and go =
back
to your home without visiting anything in between. Please read this po=
st:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/8174

But, i donot t=
hink there will be negative impact on visiting Tirupathi ahead. I
strongly =
suggest you that you can very well visit Tirupathi and go to
Srikalahasti. =
Personally i have done it many times and also many does the same as i knew.=


I am unsure that staying inside the temple during earlier night would not=
 be possible. Utmost you can be there till "Ekantha Seva".

You can very we=
ll participate in Ekantha seva and one will have a sound spiritual experien=
ce during it. An idol of Shiva will be procession in a small "Pallaki" (dev=
otees will have chance to lift it)towards "Addala mandapam" near GnanaPraso=
onambika' shrine.Later, an idol of 'GnanaPrasoonambika maa" also will be pl=
aced in the same "Addala mandapam" on an Unjal next to Shivan and the pries=
t will recite the mantras of Ekantha Seva. While coming out of the temple
a=
fter Ekantha seva, priest will invoke Kalabhairava to take care of.

As i h=
eard, Amavasya inline with Sunday + Rahukaalam will be the auspicious time
=
to perform this pooja. Be in ardent of devotion to Rahu-Ketu and
Srikalahas=
teeshwar during pooja.

May Sri Srikalahasteeshwara bless you.

Regards,
Sr=
ini.
