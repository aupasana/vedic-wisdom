Hi LaxmiNarayanji,

I agree everything is due to Divine Grace. 

To answer =
your questions, I do pranayama/asanas erratically....keep meaning to do the=
se more, but feel too tired/lazy after work. I know these are excellent for=
 health, and will try and do more. Thanks for reminding me.

The only 'medi=
tation' I currently do is japa. I focus on the sound, but yes, b I do have =
a picture of Vishnu (as Guruvayoorappan of the famous Kerala temple) to med=
itate on. 

I am travelling to Delhi tomorrow, and then onwards to Rishikes=
h next week. Will definitely stand in water and do a little japa (hope I ca=
n stand the freezing water of Mother Ganga, which is incredibly cold even i=
n peak summer). Thank you for this nice suggestion.

I agree brahmacharya i=
s not easy, although essential in spiritual life. I feel the only way to ge=
t established in this is to offer any lower thoughts such as lust, anger, g=
reed, hatred, envy and pride to the Divine. It's one hell of a battle thoug=
h...

Btw I recently started reading the "Imitation of Christ" by Thomas Ke=
mpis, a famous Catholic monk and saint from 500 years ago. What an inspirin=
g book....his words are so similar to the instructions given by our Indian =
sages. Very interesting and practical instructions for progress on the spir=
itual path. Just wanted to reccommend it to anyone who is interested.

Warm regards,

Aparna
