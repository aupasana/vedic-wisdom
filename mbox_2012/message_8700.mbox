Today is Radhastami, celebrated as the divine advent day of Srimati Radhara=
ni in many Vaisnava traditions.

A quote from the Gospel of Ramakrishna.

S=
RI RAMAKRSIHNA (to M.): "Ah! How wonderful was the yearning of the gopis fo=
r Krishna! They were seized with divine madness at the very sight of the bl=
ack tamala tree. Separation from Krishna created such a fire of anguish in =
Radha's heart that it dried up even the tears in her eyes! Her tears would =
disappear in steam. There were other times when nobody could notice the dep=
th of her feeling. People do not notice the plunge of an elephant in a big =
lake."

M: "Yes, sir, that is true. Chaitanya, too, experienced a similar f=
eeling. He mistook a forest for the sacred grove of Vrindavan, and the dark=
 water of the ocean for the blue Jamuna."

SRI RAMAKRISHNA: "Ah! If anyone =
has but a particle of such prema! What yearning! What love! Radha possessed=
 not only one hundred per cent of divine love, but one hundred and twenty-f=
ive per cent. This is what it means to be intoxicated with ecstatic love of=
 God. The sum and substance of the whole matter is that a man must love God=
, must be restless for Him. It doesn't matter whether you believe in God wi=
th form or in God without form. You may or may not believe that God incarna=
tes Himself as man. But you will realize Him if you have that yearning. The=
n He Himself will let you know what He is like. If you must be mad, why sho=
uld you be mad for the things of the world? It you must be mad, be mad for =
God alone."
