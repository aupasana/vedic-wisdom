Namaste 


Aparna ji, afew of us whom you consider are blessed with the des=
ire to pray her may definitely feel bad to read your mail. The ways of god =
are very mysterious and we humans especially in this yug have no right to a=
sk her ruling. Calling god "damn" hurts especially for those who pray her l=
ike parents. If you don't like god please keep your feelings towards yourse=
lf as this forum is not meant for those who hate god.The=C2=A0 mail that no=
body ji has written is for those who already pray him not for newcomers who=
 have to yet develop love/affection/trust for god...=C2=A0=C2=A0

As I writ=
e this I show no hatred towards you or those people who talk in similar fas=
hion. It is their ignorance and the soul transformation doesn't happen easi=
ly. Hence I will definitely pray for your inner growth. 


Nobody ji has sp=
oken thousand words of wisdom hats off to his thoughts.=C2=A0 When I went t=
o learn car driving the teacher saw me driving with no attention. He yelled=
 at me and I learnt driving in one day. Some students don't listen when exp=
lained gently, some students listen only when the teacher yells so no offen=
ces should be taken by anyone.=C2=A0 


Another thing I always noticed is t=
hat for some reason most of them in this forum talk with great respect to N=
arsimha ji and don't even consider taking advices given by any other devote=
es. We all know Narsimha ji but we don't know which other high raised souls=
 we are talking to. Please talk with respect and consideration towards othe=
r devotees also otherwise our prayers are a complete waste....

Regards,
Pr=
iya

Thanks for the advice to chant till the cremation gro=
und. Sound advice no doubt.

Unfortunately Durga is partial to some of her =
children it seems, and not all of us are blessed with the intense desire to=
 chant as you seem to be. Stop rubbing it in please. 

What is the use of a=
sking us to chant more? Ask her to give us this desire, as she seems to hav=
e done for you. 

Which brings me to ranting a bit about the general injust=
ice of our esteemed Durga. The Atman is sexless, but the Atman in female fo=
rm has been treated worse than the Atman in male form over the centuries...=
even today it is being murdered in the womb (female foeticide), raped, burn=
t in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it is deathless etc, but while in this ignorant =
state, it still suffers in the form of women. I hasten to add that I am no =
feminist but right now, I'm furious with Durga. How outrageous that for cen=
turies, and even today, women were not allowed to be initiated into the Gay=
atri (which is to the Goddess). Why aren't there more women saints? The rat=
io of female to male saints is probably 1:10. It's bloody disheartening. An=
d what is the point of covering us with ignorance (it's her fault, she is t=
he Avidya Maya), and then yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in =
all the scriptures). If she wants to save us, she will have to create in us=
 the desire
 to do japa or whatever. I wash my hands of the whole thing.

S=
o don't tell us to chant, tell her to tell us to chant. Like she told you t=
o. It's not our fault.

Ok rant over. I'm going to control my temper and do=
 some Om Namo Narayanaya repetition now. Who knows when it's time for the c=
remation ground? You did it for a select few, but not for the rest of us mi=
llions- Damn you Durga. 

Aparna
