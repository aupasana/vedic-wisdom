Tell me the meaning of Love

Kali as Krishna
As I understood it, from an ar=
ticle by Devdutt Pattanaik

Kali is dark, Shiva is fair (Karpura, like camp=
hor)
Krishna is dark, Radha is fair.

Shiva did not speak a word until Parv=
ati came to his life.
Radha did not open her eyes until Krishna was born.

=
Parvati once asked Shiva: " What is love"?
Shiva replied:

When you feed me=
 like Annapoorna, asking for nothing in return=85I feel love
When you come =
to me as Kamakhya and are desirous of me=85 asking for nothing in return=85=
I feel love
When you come to me as Gauri, delicate and demure and allow me =
to dominate you=85knowing full well that you cannot be dominated=85 asking =
for nothing in return=85I feel love.
When you come to me as Durga bearing w=
eapons in your hand and protect me, I feel secure and safe and cared for=85=
 asking for nothing in return=85I feel love.
When you come atop me as Kali =
and dance over me, unafraid to be powerful and vulnerable, and unafraid of =
being mocked and judged=85 You make me open my eyes.

I realize Lalita, the=
 beautiful one, who is also Bhairavi, the fearsome one. I realize Mangala, =
the auspicious one, is also Chandika, the violent one. 

I see you totally =
without judgement, and I realize I am capable of seeing the truth. That you=
 allow me to see you fully, without judgement tells me I have become trustw=
orthy=85in joy I dance, I become Nataraja=85

Shakti smiled.
Shiva said: "S=
ince you have done so much for me-I want to do the same for you".

So Shiva=
 became (gori gori) Radha=85
And Radha taught Krishna the meaning of love. =
