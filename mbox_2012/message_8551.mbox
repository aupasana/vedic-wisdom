Dear all,

Many thanks to everyone for their responses. I am glad to hear t=
here is no scriptural reference against doing homams while standing. 

Than=

While the food cooked for 20-30 minutes, I muttered the mantras and tended =
to a small homam kunda (basically a brass bowl, with some wooden sticks and=
 ghee and basil leaf offerings) that I placed on the table next to the cook=
ing food.

Please tell me if you think this is against the scriptures, as I wouldn't w=

that ritual. This homam procedure gives me a pretty good feeling. I'm plann=

 generate concentration and feeling while standing and doing the homam, sur=

P.S. I am doing a weekly homam the 'proper' way i.e. sitting down and focus=
sing. Just wanted to do a daily one and this would be the best way for me r=
ight now. I have read the Agnihotra homam can be done "anywhere" so wonderi=
ng about other homams.
