Namaste Dolly, Please do not ignore such things. How long have you been sa=
ying any mantra at all ? Which one did you start with first ?
Why are you s=
aying all these mantras ? 

Are you doing any pranayama before the mantras =
? Are you doing any other hatha yoga practice in terms of asana etc ?

I ma=
y be able to be a channel of help, please email me on my email ID if intere=
sted. I am not keen on having a discussion in a public forum.
