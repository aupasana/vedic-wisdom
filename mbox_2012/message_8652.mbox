Namaste Mihirji,
Today i just had a feel that i like sudarshan kriya cause =
i went through a very stressful time & apart from that i find myself very u=
neasy feverish & hasty at mental state, this may be the reason i liked SK a=
s it eased down those things atleast for sometime in a day. For people who =
are more stable & eased at mental level for them SK may not be that promisi=
ng & more intense sadhana like homa may be better. I seriously want to expe=
rience homa & will attempt to do it.
Regards
Vinayak
