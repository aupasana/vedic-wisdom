Namaste Sir,
=A0
Here's the second installment.
=A0
4. No, fulfilling respo=
nsibility to wife, children, parents etc is not a blockage of the spiritual=
 path.
=A0
If one's ego gets inflated as a result of that engagement or if =
one's desires start getting multiplied as a result of that engagement, then=
 THAT becomes a blockage in the spiritual path.
=A0
Sadly, one often does n=
ot know how to give, without also taking something back while giving. Even =
as one thinks that one is *giving*, one's mind is more focused on the "taki=
ng" part of the engagement.
=A0
For example, suppose one is not interested =
in wealth, but earns good money because one's spouse wants it and one wants=
 to give that happiness to spouse. Yet, one becomes proud of or attached to=
 that wealth in the process. Eventually, what started as something done for=
 spouse, becomes one's own pursuit.
=A0
As another example, suppose one is =
not interested in sex, but engages in it because spouse wants it. As one en=
gages in it, one may start to enjoy it and focus the mind more on one's own=
 pleasure (than focusing the mind fully on the other person's pleasure and =
trying one's best to give pleasure to other person).
=A0
One may start some=
 voluntary work at a temple and see it as service at first. But pride and a=
ttachment develop and one may expect recognition from others for the "selfl=
ess" work. One may even want a good administrative position at the temple i=
n recognition of one's work. Like that, an engagement started as an act of =
giving becomes entangled with pride, self-worth, desire and attachment and =
becomes more about taking than giving. It becomes about oneself than giving=
 others.
=A0
THIS in a nutshell is the problem with engaging with the world=
. But the bottomline is this: If you have a lot of rinas to others, you can=
not make spiritual progress without engaging with others and somehow managi=
ng to pay off those rinas. So, somehow you have to learn giving others self=
lessly, without making it about yourself in the end! In all your relationsh=
ips, watch out for this tendency to make it about yourself and about what y=
ou are getting and consciously and constantly focus on giving and on others=
.
=A0
5. If one doesn't have strong rinas to one's family members, renounci=
ng them may not block one's spiritual progress. If one has strong rinas, it=
 may block.
=A0
Staying away from objects of this world that are known sour=
ces of attachment, desires, aversion, fears and pride, can be useful for a =
while. But, in the long term, desires, aversion, fears and pride may not be=
 overcome just by avoidance, if there are strong rinas. If you are not Sidd=
hartha, what worked for Siddhartha need not work for you.
=A0
The key is to=
 learn to give without taking, or atleast, without focusing the mind on tak=
ing. We are on earth to give.
=A0
6. You don't feed a 5-day old baby with b=
esan laddoo, though it may be very tasty and protein-rich. Until one is not=
 ready, one need not be rushed into spirituality. At the same time, don't l=
ook down upon them. Everyone will go through their spiritual evolution phas=
es.
=A0
Instead of liberation, talk to them about doing the right thing - d=
harma. Talk to them about love, caring and compassion and doing the right t=
hing fearlessly.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

=A0 
Seeing that you did not get even one version :-( of the answers=
, here are my 2 cents: 
=A0 
1-3: Our actions generate equal and opposite r=
eactions. World gives you back what you give it. Only tricky thing is that =
there is a time lag. What you are getting today is the fruit of your action=
s in the past, from yesterday or from one year back or from a decade back o=
r from last life or from 10 lives back. 
=A0 
Imagine a big pipe containing=
 many balls. You are throwing balls into the pipe and balls come out. Balls=
 don't necessarily come out in the same order in which you throw them in. A=
lso, when you throw a big and heavy enough ball into the pipe, it may resul=
t in some re-arrangement of balls=A0 already in the pipeline. Similarly, bi=
g karmas (good or bad) done now may result in re-arrangement of the karma p=
ipeline. 
=A0 
If the pipe has only good balls, only good balls come out. I=
f the pipe has only bad balls, only bad balls come out. If it has both, any=
 may come out. If a bad ball comes out as soon as you throw a good ball in,=
 it does not mean the ball you threw just now was a bad ball. It means the =
good ball you threw will take some time to come. Moreover, it was YOU who t=
hrew the bad ball that just came out, in the past. 
=A0 
A ritual done with=
 a negative attitude for bad purposes can be a bad karma. However, even if =
one did a good ritual, still that good karma need not give results immediat=
ely. It depends on how dense one's karma pipeline is. If a pipe has very sm=
all balls and a big heavy ball is thrown into it very fast, it may push thr=
ough previous existing balls and come out quickly. But, if a pipe has a lot=
 of heavy=A0 balls, your currently thrown ball will be stuck behind them. S=
o it all depends on one's karma pipeline. 
=A0 
I will answer the rest of t=
he questions in another installment.

Narasimha

Dear All Learned members, 
Following are my questions: 
1. After effec=
t of Homam can be negative also. Is it true? 
2. Persons who do nothing=A0 =
in the field of spirituality can also meet God, higher saints. How is it po=
ssible? 
3. I was reading=A0 a newspaper that people after having darshan o=
f Mata Vaishno Devi, Kedarnaath, etc=A0 , while returning, met with acciden=
t and died. Why does this happen? People have just come from a such a wonde=
rful darshan then why tragedy strikes them. 
4. People who are married and =
have the wife and kid as responsibilities. Fulfilling the duties of husband=
 is a blockage in the spiritual path. You know=A0 what i mean.=A0 =A0
5. Wh=
y=A0 did Gautam Buddha=A0 left his wife and his child and even then achieve=
d the status of God? 
6. A common person gives=A0 a damn to the concept of =
liberation. When ever i=A0 have discussion with people in my office they th=
ink=A0 i am mad . How should one deal with that because i=A0 think that peo=
ple=A0 who are unaware of this great concept should be taught with this ide=
aology. 

Expecting to get the different versions of the=A0 answers...!!!
