imilarly, intellectually knowing that all this is a play and not real, is n=
ot enough. When some really pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL=
 identify with the body and experience something.=A0If Shankara was fully e=
nlightened before that episode (we don't know that for sure), then the acti=

Thus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and doing noth=

 Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an example for future. One's interact=
ion with the world is give & take. We give things to others and take things=
 from them. True renunciation is in renouncing what we take. There is no ne=
ed to renounce giving. As the prevant
 notion of sannyasa was to cut off fr=
om the world, Shankara demonstrated giving others (e.g. mother) sannyasa.=
=A0Swami Vivekananda and Swami Sivananda took this further. They engaged in=
 a lot of service for the society, unlike other sannyasis who lock themselv=

you are "taking" something in return of what you are giving!!!), then a san=
