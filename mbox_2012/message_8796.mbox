I totally agree with Vishal & Rajarshi... Even i started my sadhana with th=
e same question in mind. 

Follow rules or not, my take on it is follow you=
r intuition. Then the question arises how to differentiate between intuitio=
n and wishful thinking? (even i am looking for an answer)

Why not to follo=
w rules?
One might not at all begin his/her sadhana thinking of rules. Sadh=
ana has to be tailored with the normal life till one finds a rythm and conf=
idence. Then the rules will be automatically followed based on the seriousn=
ess of the sadhak.

Why to follow rules?
As pointed out by Rajarshi, the ch=
andipath had so strict rules may be because of the following reason:
1. Som=
e sadhanas give immediate heightened awareness to the sadhak. It means they=
 can smell, taste, hear and see better than normal. The world all of a sudd=
en starts looking beautiful.
2. They can visualize better the details of ev=
erything and every being and get lucid dreams.
3. Normal people are natural=
ly attracted to the sadhak because of his/her composure and grace and there=
 is a beauty in the way they walk and talk that attracts

The downfall:
Des=
pite these changes, one thing would still remain...the "Vasanas" which is a=
 biggest obstacle to any sadhak. The normal world has many trigger points f=
or vasanas which would entice the sadhak and make him lose control over his=
 self. For a male sadhak women would look extraordinarily beautiful and sta=
rt dreaming about them. Their voice, their actions, their laughter would ha=
unt them day n night. Because people are attracted towards sadhak, it boost=
s his ego and he/she forgets the very basic dharmas of life. All this is no=
t the purpose of sadhana and hence the siddhas of past recommended secluede=
d life which protects sadhaka from triggering the vasanas before he attains=
 maturity.
The first 2 sadhanas (mentioned below)though very simple, gave m=
e the experience explained above (including the downfall).
Self-awareness a=
t every waking moment (sometimes sleeping moment also) becomes very essenti=
al to prevent downfall. I cannot put in words the importance of swadhyava (=
self-study)and Ishvara pranidhana (surrender to divine)in this sense. Maybe=
 mantra jap all day long is a good idea (as also suggested in Vignyan Bhair=
ava Tantra)

Sadhana Krama i followed:
1. jog for a kilometer and do Sudars=
hana Kriya
2. jog for a kilometer or more and chant long OM and contemplate=
 on the after-silence
3. Jap of moolamantras of navagrahas
4. Bandhas as gi=
ven in Shiva Samhita
5. Sooryanamaskar and Gayathri Sahasranam Jap (current=
)

The saying: An old patient is better than the new doctor. I have only pr=
esented my view (with some experience)even though i am only a beginner in t=
his path so your guidance will be helpful.

Om tat sat
