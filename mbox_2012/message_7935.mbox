Namaste,

Yes, it is ideal to surrender and pray to one deity mainly. Howev=
er, 
even if you pray to multiple deities, deities are much better at worki=
ng 
together than us, human beings. So, it is not something to worry. 
Howe=
ver, surrendering to (atleast trying to!!) one deity is a better 
approach.=


Thanks,
Narasimha

Namaste Sir,

Yes, any of t=

Vishnu, Shiva, Durg=
a, Chandi, Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Hanuman, are 
certainly capable of =
giving anything. However, as they have a huge 
repertoire of things they ca=
n give and a nice judgment on what is good 
for you, they may or may not gi=
ve you what you asked for right away. 
They may give you something else tha=
t is better for you (from the 
perspective of that deity - this can change =
from one deity to another, 
but all deities have much better judgment than =
you!). Or, they may first 
give you some responsibilities that prepare you =
for using what you asked 
for well, and give you what you asked for later.
=

In comparison, lower beings such as Yakshas and Yakshinis have dominion 
o=
ver specific things and they give them to you if they are pleased. When 
yo=
u approach them, you are taking extra responsibility for what you are 
aski=
ng for and the consequences of getting it. It may work faster, but 
comes w=
ith a risk. It may even compromise your spiritual progress. Most 
of these =
sadhanas will be hidden or corrupted as Kali yuga progresses. 
With sadhana=
 of higher deities, things may not work too fast or be too 
straight-forwar=
d, but there is less risk.

Thanks,
Narasimha

   Namaste,



Of course, one can make offerings in=
 homam to Yakshas. One can even make 
offerings to rakshasas. For example, =
one of the dikpalakas (Nirriti) is 
a raakshasa and we do make offerings in=
 homam.



There are many mantras for Kubera. Find one.



One homam known =
in tradition for Kubera is called "Kubera Paashupata 
Homam". The main mant=
ra is the last verse in standard Mantra Pushpam (OM 
rAjAdhirAjAya prasahya=
sAhine ...  kuberAya vaishravaNAya mahArAjAya 
namaH). There are many other=
 mantras too.



Thanks,

Narasimha
