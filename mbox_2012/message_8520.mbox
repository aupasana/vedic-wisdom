Namaste learned members!

I have got into the habit of doing Ganapathy homa=
 once a week. I can't explain the peace of mind, some sort of uplifting it =
brings me.

During the summer months here sunrise is at 5:30 or so and suns=
et is around 8:50pm.

For "best results" is it necessary to END the ceremon=
y at sunrise / sunset or START it at sunrise / sunset?

If I have to END th=
e ceremony at 5:30 am, I must start it no later than 04:45am, just too earl=
y for me. Some friends who came to know of the ceremony also want to attend=
 the ceremony and the earliest I can start is around 06:30am.

I have never=
 done it in the evening. Does any of you do it in the evening? Am I losing =
anything by not strictly observing the start / end timings?

Thanks for sha=
ring your knowledge.

Ranga
