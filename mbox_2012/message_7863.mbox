Namaste - Well, I still don't get it. So Jeevanmukta is liberated from what=
 ? If he is going through janma, mrityu, jara and vyAdhi, what is he / she =
liberated from ?
The cases / scenarios you mention sound like the person ha=
s totally surrendered to will of the Supreme (Krsna, Siva, Shakti, Mother o=
r whatever) and is in tune with the divine. If by liberation, we mean about=
 the consequences of the actions or other, may be.

Btw, do you call Arjuna=
 jeevanmukta ? at least post viswaroopa darshana !

rAma
