=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 What you have asked is a very relevant question=
. The feeling cannot come if the mind is immersed all the time in unnecessa=

ot. 
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 When the mind is aler=
t and calm, pray to God with utmost sincerity. Ask earnestly for the Love o=

not reacted upon, unless sincerity and longing is present.
=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=
=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 The mind itself is a non intelligent substa=
nce. It has no real existence. It just appears intelligent because of the r=

as you keep praying, the feeling that you mentioned will come. Anything tha=

Thanks to everyone who has replied- I know you're right. Feelin=
g and heart is more important than counting and numbers.

But how does feel=
ing come? Though japa! That is the paradox. Sivananda says, even if it is m=
echanical sometimes, keep doing it. The mind will be purified and one day, =
feeling will come, devotion will arise.

Some of my favourite quotations on=
 the power of japa:

Swami Sivananda
"Religion Means 'To Do.' It is only th=
e one two little acts that you actually do, that constitute religion and sp=
irituality. To rise early and take the name of the Lord for ten minutes is =
what real dharma is."
More from him on japa 

http://www.sivanandadlshq.org=
/teachings/japayoga.htm

Swami Chidananda (ace disciple of Swami Sivananda)=

"One's day should start first with purifying, with cleaning, sweeping, mak=
ing clean! Cleanse, cleanse - by uttering God's Name, by thinking of God. T=
he Name of God is verily God Himself. Supreme Divinity is present here. Nam=
e and God are not two. They are one and the same. Name is God!"

Anandamayi=
 Ma
"Listen! Do not let your time pass idly. Either keep a rosary with you =
and do japa; or if this does not suit you, at least go on repeating the Nam=
e of the Lord regularly and without interruption like the ticking of a cloc=
k. There are no rules or restrictions in this. Invoke Him by the Name that =
appeals to you most, for as much time as you can--the longer the better. Ev=
en if you get tired or lose interest, administer the Name to yourself like =
a medicine that has to be taken. In this way you will at some auspicious mo=
ment discover the rosary of the mind, and then you will continually hear wi=
thin yourself the praises of the great Master, the Lord of Creation, like t=
he never ceasing music of the boundless ocean; You will hear the land and t=
he sea, the air and the heavens reverberate with the song of His glory. Thi=
s is called the all--pervading Presence of His Name."

Priyank, thanks very=
 much for the message. Warren Buffet...cool! I will try and do homam more o=
ften- I really enjoy it. Will schedule one for tomorrow evening after work =
if possible. Good start to the Navaratri (had never heard about this Navara=
tri before). 

Rakesh ji, thanks for the message. You are quite right. Even=
 breathing for God...that would be a great state to be in...no idea when I'=
m going to get there. Anyway peserverence is key. 

I think that nobody but=
 God can get us to do Sadhana. I believe that God walked every step of the =
way on the path for the saints... nay, actually DID the sadhana for them ul=
timately. I know we have to "make an effort" and meet God halfway, but ulti=
mately it is She and He who get us to make the effort. That's why I said "D=
amn you Durga"....because You made some people make that supreme effort....=
You alone were their Sadhana Shakti....and what about the rest of Your wret=
ched children? What sort of partial mother are you hmm? You did it for Mira=
, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, but what about all of us eh? What sort of game is thi=
s? Anyway, it's Her game, that's the bottom line... what can we do except p=
lay along (we have to believe it's ultimately for our own good).

Ok chaps,=
 going to do some japa now. Less talk and more action hey!

Best wishes, an=
d happy Navaratri (let's get in to high gear as Priyank ji says),

was a big fan of japa, and especially of Purascharana (repeating mantra as =
many lakhs as there are syllables in the mantra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllable=

face to face. That would be great! Really wanted to do it...but when I did =

ivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and especially of Pur=
ascharana (repeating mantra as many lakhs as there are syllables in the man=
tra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetition=
s). He went on to say that 14 crore of japa with feeling would result in Da=
rshan of God in physical form, face to face. That would be great! Really wa=
nted to do it...but when I did the maths, I worked out that, at the rate of=
 12 hours japa a day, every single day from now on, it would take me till a=
ge 83 to finish this. :( <br>

o make a start anyway, and began my my first Purascharana of the Om Namo Na=
rayanaya mantra, in January this year, I am doing a measley 11 rounds a day=
, with my mind wandering most of the time (hard core people do hundreds of =
rounds with proper concentration daily). I'm a slow chanter, and need to sa=
y the mantra loudly or in a barely audible whisper. My mental chanting is g=
radually improving but very difficult to do for more than 1-2 minutes. It's=
 gonna take me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to =
take a 3 month break (and do 7 rounds a day), and then start another Purasc=
harana. <br>

 I'm on the phone. While doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and count=
 the japa on my fingers. I get a couple of rounds done during my working da=
y this way (I check carefully to make sure nobody's listening). Also while =
stuck in traffic (while the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pie=
ces on, and pretend I'm chatting to a friend on the phone and do a couple o=
f rounds. <br>

(now please excuse the phrase), is "Toilet japa". When I need to escape to =
do a round or two of japa at work, I excuse myself for a few minutes and lo=
ck myself up in a toilet cubicle. I then very very quietly mutter the mantr=
a to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving, no sound audible, in case anybod=
y hears). I do about 2 sessions of this a day. This allows me to complete m=
y 11 rounds a day, on days when my working hours are long. <br>
