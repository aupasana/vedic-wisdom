Dear Rajarshi Bhai,
How are you doing? About 200 hundred years ago, =
a man made a theory of creation in France. When Napolean asked where is God=
 in it, the guy said, do not talk about God. It makes things complicated.
S=
o is there a place for Divine Mother and Her Love or Grace or Protection in=
 your theory. Is=A0this intermediate zone as you say is created by Her and =
part of Her creation=A0or by=A0somebody else.=A0 Does=A0She needs some visa=
 to go there if she is=A0not the Creater.=A0As you say all higher deity are=
 there but less in ability. Does the deities have even less =A0ability on e=
arth plane.
=A0
I am sure this is not your theory. You have taken it from y=
ogi Aurobindo. Many times when certain person reach a stage in their spirit=
ual path, others think whatever this guy is uttering is=A0complete truth, w=
hen in fact it is=A0far from truth. Once=A0I saw in a article that Aurobind=
o said that Divine Lord who spoke Gita completely forgot it after few minut=
es or so. I could not believe what I was reading. Then my respect for this =
yogi went down the drain.
=A0
Divine Mother, Her Love, Her Grace Her Protec=
tion and other Eternal Divine Beings are outside of our human perception. T=
hey only allow us to know about Themselves what They wish to. For me there =
is a=A0difference between a yogi and devotee.=A0 A devotee rises due to Gra=
ce of Divine Mother or their Ishtdav. where as a yogi rises after a lot of =
huff and fuff, and they get stuck everywhere. I am sure there are only=A0de=
votee in this group. They may be doing haven or japa or other devotional wo=
rk.
So nobody should=A0feel any sort of fear or pressure even for one secon=
d because there is no such hocus pocus zone to cross and there is Grace of =
Divine Mother on all Her children.
=A0
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Disc=
laimer---- My thinking is very different due to Darshan and=A0Grace of Divi=
ne Mother & Divine Lord. Nobody should feel unhappy If I do not agree or fo=
llow the leader.Thanks.

Dear Utpal,

Agre=
ed -:)

If we do not forget the parameters of judgement, then sadhana is fr=
uitful, IMO. Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameters of judgeme=
nt is to objectively see what changes are happening in our surface, day-to-=
day consciousness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc.

The=
 field of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some of =
it can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. =
Most spiritual people have never gone in depth trying to analyse and unders=
tand these things properly, but some pattern is observable.=A0 Not all expe=
riences are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this j=
ungle of experiences, not being able to adequately determine which is genui=
ne and which is non-genuine. This is the world of astral plane, driven by t=
he overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a h=
uman being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping infl=
uence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything=
=A0 is possible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifes=
tation in this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless b=
eings of varies character and hue who can very easily create an
 expereince=
 for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experi=
ence/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker an=
d use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower ex=
treme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface eg=
o driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitions,=
 jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc and a=
t the other extreme this layer can, if properly channalized as is done in g=
enuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda and manife=
st the "antaratmah" as an unfailing guide to the path.

In a nutshell, a ge=
nuine "experience" is good and authentic only to the extent that it helps t=
o modify and transform your waking surface personality. That is the only tr=
ue test. Rest all the range of experiences that come from this realm, and 9=
5 percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound and=
 fury without substance. 

In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it th=
e intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got swe=
pt away by the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot way to cross th=
is realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, is to hang on =
tightly to the fundamentals.

-Regards

Dear Rajarshi,

A sage "sms=
" indeed! Yes direction must be always, always the top most priority. It re=
minded me of simple, yet quite effective day to day example of driving Car.=
 One can not miss/ignore the sight of correct road to the destination even =
for a split second. However, Optimised "controlled" speed (even if very fas=
t by set standards) could be an added advantage while not loosing the sight=
 of the road.

Best Regards,

Utpal

<DIV>Dear Rajarshi,<B=
R><BR>A sage "sms" indeed! Yes direction must be always, always the top mos=
t priority. It reminded me of simple, yet quite effective day to day exampl=
e of driving Car. One can not miss/ignore the sight of correct road to the =
destination even for a split second. However, Optimised "controlled" speed =
(even if very fast by set standards) could be an added advantage while not =
loosing the sight of the road.<BR><BR>Best Regards,<BR><BR>Utpal <BR><BR>--=
