Very nice poem! Made me think.


Too long we have believed that God is eith=
er male or female. What if God is neither of these, but a principle? The pr=
inciple which states that the Highest possibility in anything is God. And t=
he Highest is always better than the best one can conceive. Isn't that what=
 Krshna implies in the Chapter on Vibhuti Yoga in the Bhagawat Gita? 


	1.=
 O Gudakesha (Arjuna), I am the spirit seated in the hearts of all the livi=
ng  beings. I am the beginning, the middle and the end of the all things.

=

	2. I am Vishnu among the Adityas, I am Sun among the lights and radiances=
,, I am  Marichi of the maruts and I am Moon among the heavenly bodies.


	=
3. I am the Samaveda among the vedas, I am the Indra among the gods, of the=
 senses  I am Mind and of the living beings I am Consciousness.


	4. I am =
Shankara among the Rudras, I am Kuber among the yakshas and Rakshasas, I  a=
m Agni among the Vasus, and I am Meru among the mountain peaks.


	5. I am =
Brihaspati among the family priests, O Arjuna, among the war lords I am  th=
e Skandha, I am Ocean among the lakes.


	6. I am Bhrigu among the great Sa=
ges of the sounds, I am the single syllable Aum,  I am the offering of Japa=
 (silently meditating on the deity) meditation among  the offerings (in sac=
rifices), I am Himalaya among the unmoveable things.


	7. I am Ashvatta (P=
ipal tree) among all the trees of the divine sages I am Narada,  amomg the =
gandharvas I am Chitrarath, among those having reached the state of  perfec=
tion (Siddhas) I am Kapil the seer.


	8. Among horses, know me to be Uccha=
ishrava, born of nectar of the king of  elephants I am Airawat, and among m=
en, I am the king.


	9. I am Thunderbolt (Vajra) among the weapons, Iam Ka=
madhenu (the cow of plenty)  among the cows, among the procreators I am Kam=
adeva (Gandarva), I am Vasuki  among the Serpents.


	10. I am Ananta (Shes=
hanaga) among the nagas, of the creatures of water I am Varun  of the depar=
ted ancestors I am Aryama and of those who administer and uphold  laws, I a=
m Yama.


	11. I am Prahlada among the demons, I am time among those who ke=
ep calculations, I  am King (Lion) among the beasts and I am the son of Vin=
ta (Garud) among the  birds).


	12. I am Wind among the purifying agents, =
I am Rama among the those wielding  weapons (warriors), of Fishes I am Alli=
gator, among the Rivers I am Ganga  (Ganges).


	13. I am the beginning, th=
e end and the middle of the creations, O Arjuna of the  sciences I am the s=
cience of the self (brahma-vidya), of those who argue and  debate I am the =
argument.


	14. Of the letters I am Alpha (the beginning =E2=80=98Akaar=E2=
=80=99) of the compound verbs I am  the dual, I am also the imperishable ti=
me and I am the creator and upholder  whose face is turned to all the sides=
. 


	15. I am all consuming and all devouring death, I am the cause (seed)=
 of all that  has to come to be and of feminine being, I am fame, prosperit=
y, speech, memory,  intelligence, steadfastness and patience.


	16. And li=
kewise, I am Brihatsama among the hymns, of the Mantras I am Gayatri, I  am=
 Margashrisha among the months, and I am Spring among the seasons.


	17. I=
 am Gambling among the practitioners of deception, of the glamourous I am t=
he  glamour, I am the victory, I am the enterprise and I am the goodness of=
 the  good.


	18. I am Vasudeva among the Vishnus (they are a branch of Ya=
dava-clan to which  Krishna belonged), I am Dhananajya (literally winner of=
 wealth-name of Arjuna)  among Pandavas, I am Vyasa among the sages and als=
o among poets I am Ushra  (also called Shukracharya "The teacher of the dem=
ons" (Rakshasas).


	19. I am the Rod (danda=C2=A0 meaning both, the chasti=
sement and the rod used in  chastising) of chastisement among those who adm=
inister chastisement, of those  who seek victory I am the wise-policy, I am=
 the silence among secret things and  of the wise I am the wisdom.


	20. A=
nd moreover, I am the Cause (seed) of the creation of all living beings, O =
 Arjuna and nothing, which can move or which cannot move, can exist without=
 me.


	21. O Arjuna, there is no end of my divine manifestation of forms, =
I have stated to  you in an indicative way of my limitless glory.


Having =
understood this, every-time we come across something wonderfuland exception=
al in any field, we can consciously remind ourselves of this one defining p=
rinciple in action. And the most natural mental-reaction one can have with =
this principle is to say "Thank You for everything"!

-Regards

Searching for Mother (a poem)
=
=C2=A0
PVR Narasimha Rao
2012 July 13
=C2=A0
Like a mad man, I was searchin=
g for Mother
Here and there, Everywhere
=C2=A0
I read many books,
I contemp=
lated so much,
I saw many scholars,
I saw many saints,
But I did not find H=
er
=C2=A0
Like a mad man, I was looking for Mother
Here and there, Everywhe=
re
=C2=A0
I went to many temples,
I did many rituals,
I tried many spiritua=
l paths,
I did much meditation,
But I did not find Her
=C2=A0
Like a mad ma=
n, I was looking for Mother
Here and there, Everywhere
=C2=A0
Then I realiz=
ed what was wrong
=C2=A0
I was restricting Mother
To what my mind could con=
ceive - 
A specific form with so many arms,
A specific type of Light,
A spe=
cific type of
 Energy,
A specific ability to do this or that.


While looki=
ng for that form,
I missed out on Her
Though She was right in front of me
A=
nd in fact all around me
In so many beautiful forms -
Some simple, some com=
plex
=C2=A0
What makes a plant grow
And give flowers and fruits,
If not Her=
 energy?
=C2=A0
What makes a flower bloom
And attract the bees,
If not Her =
energy?
=C2=A0
What attracts the bees
To the blooming flower,
If not Her en=
ergy?
=C2=A0
What makes earth and
Planets go around Sun,
If not Her energy?=

=C2=A0
What makes electrons in atoms
Go around the nucleus,
If not Her ene=
rgy?
=C2=A0
What makes zillions of beings,
Zillions of atoms in them,
And z=
illions of sub-aromic particles
Exist in a harmonious balance,
If not Her e=
nergy?
=C2=A0
What makes the us crave things,
What makes the us do
 things,=

What makes the us understand things,
If not Her energy?
=C2=A0
Isn't She i=
n the contentment of a baby
Who just received milk from Mother?
Isn't She i=
n the love of Mother
Who just fed her baby?
Isn't She in the curiosity of a=
 young toddler
About what is on the other side of a door?
Isn't She in the =
laughters & cries,
Hunger & contentment, pleasures & pains
Of zillions of b=
eings in this cosmos?
=C2=A0
Now when I look around me,
I see Her all aroun=
d me.
I marvel at every little thing,
And every big thing,
As things of Her=
 doing
And as signs of Her presence.
=C2=A0
I realized my mistake now..
=C2=
=A0
If you restrict Her to this or that definition,
You may not find Her ho=
wever hard you may try
=C2=A0
She is the Force that creates, sustains & rec=
ycles
Every being, every aspect of every being
And every notion in the cons=
ciousness of every being
In this limitless cosmos!
=C2=A0
I realized my mis=
take now..
=C2=A0
You don't search for air with a microscope,
Air is all ar=
ound us,
You just open your lungs to air and breath it!
=C2=A0
Same with Mo=
ther!
She is all around us,
Just open your heart to Her!
=C2=A0
Best regard=
s,
Narasimha
