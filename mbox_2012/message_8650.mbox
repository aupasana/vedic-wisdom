Namaste Vinayakji and friends,

I rest this comparision chain from my side =
with a couple of very apt quotes from Vimalananda! (and so was also one of =
the prominent teachings by Thakur Ramakrishna who demonstarted that practic=
ally in his life in relation to seekers who came to him)

"
The Rishis have=
 understood our plight and in their great magnanimity have created sadhanas=
 by which we can extricate ourselves from our limitations and make progress=
. The Rishis have created many different sadhanas because there are so many=
 different types of people, each of who has special requirements...."

"Goa=
l of all Sadhana is same, but all Sadhanas are not created Equal"

(The 2nd=
 auote is out of my memory and words may not be exact but essance is)

Sinc=
erely,

Utpal
