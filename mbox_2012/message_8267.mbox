c Wisdom : Scruplous Lecturing On Adhyatma
 

Dear Mr Joshi,

I have underl=
ined wrong preachings by narsimha in Adhyatma which is a replication of pas=
t acts and misuse of Rishi Parashara's name.

I am studying Harri Malla Ji'=
s arguments in views of religious text and w'd comment as I find it right o=
r wrong in same way I found AK Kaul was projecting all wrong things and had=
 not done self study of Vedic Brahman Scriptures and was not aware How Brah=
man Scriptures depcit formation of Rashis by Adjustment of Nakshtras.

On t=
he other, Vedas have clearly refrred to "Pratima" or "Idol" but we have man=
y movements in country stating Vedas don't have "Pratima Upasana" or "Murti=
 Puja", If people start doing self study instead of falling for some Guru, =
We w'd have better culture in place.

Regards,
Lalit Mishra

<div>Whe=

<div>The atttempt to reform our religious festivals is made=
 by many but those who oppose the reform are always winning. Perhaps these =
