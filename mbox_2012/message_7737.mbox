This collection of wisdom teachi=
ngs have been revealed by the highly qualified spiritual teacher Sri Dharma=
 Pravartaka Acharya over a span of several years, ranging from 2008 to 2011=
. In these powerful and enlightening teachings, we gain a precious and rare=
 glimpse of the very essence of Dharma, as well as practical guidance for h=
ow we can practice Sanatana Dharma and Yoga spirituality in an authentic, m=
eaningful and effective way. 

The contents of "Living Dharma: The Teaching=
s of Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya" cover a wide range of topics, both phil=
osophical and practical.  This diversity of topics is by design, since ther=
e is no aspect of the human experience that Dharma does not touch upon dire=
ctly and conclusively.  Thus, while each one of these short wisdom sayings =
will provide a deeply spiritual vision to the reader, some of them also com=
ment upon such seemingly "secular" aspects of human thought as psychology, =
politics, economics, social science, culture, aesthetics and health.  The o=
nly way to truly incorporate the teachings of Sanatana Dharma into your lif=
e is to practice Dharma in every single aspect of your life, without except=
ion.  This book explains how.
