Namaste Guruji,
I consider you as my Guru as you are the one of the 4
promi=
nent people who have influenced & inspired me on spiritual path(whatever
li=
ttle I do) & I find your explanations
very very convincing. As always I fou=
nd this reply too very convincing
& clear. I know you for past 5 years & ha=
ve gone through your emails,
Astrology lessons & your book too.=C2=A0
Wante=
d to do homa read about it, saw the
videos but could not do it yet. I found=
 sudarshan kriya very effective &
moreover need not arrange for things as r=
equired in doing homa. So just was
curious to know the comparision of homa =
& kriya.


Regarding the organization putting a price tag on what they
teac=
h: they are taking the price & doing social service through it,
schools, re=
habilitation etc., For people who cant afford the price tag its free
for th=
em. I personally found sudarshan kriya very effective as also is the same
w=
ith some of my friends. We pay money for doing a course & that money is def=
initely
utilized for good deeds.


I know you know things very well. =C2=A0=
In case you have not experienced the sudarshan
kriya then the answer to thi=
s email will be complete after you practice it for
some time & share your e=
xperience as I find your explanations very precise
up to the level you know=
 it.

One more thing in a video it was said that kriya burns bad
karma. May=
 you please specifically answer to this whether kriya or homa burns
bad kar=
ma or its just for spiritual progress & we have to experience the
bad karma=
 anyway.


I feel very lucky to know you & others who made me do
something =
spiritual.
Regards
Vinayak

      Nam=
aste,
=C2=A0
There are many spiritual practices that increase one's spiritu=
al strength, just as there are many foods that increase one's physical stre=
ngth.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=

=C2=A0
Do you get more strength by eating cas=
hews, raisins, fruits and milk or by eating cooked rice, dal and vegetables=
 or by eating chapati and curries or sandwiches or pasta or so many other s=
tyles of food?
=C2=A0
It is possible to get balanced nutrition through each=
 style. However, if one likes chapati and curries, forcing one to eat pasta=
 may not work. If one likes grilled sandwiches, forcing one to eat rice and=
 dal may not work.
=C2=A0
Similarly, do you get more spiritual strength by =
doing homam with a mantra or japam with a mantra or pranayama with a
 mantr=
a or so many sadhana paths?
=C2=A0
It is possible to get balanced spiritual=
 progress through each path. However, if one likes singing prayers, forcing=
 one to do pranayama may not work. If one likes japam, forcing one to do ho=
mam may not work.
=C2=A0

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
What style of food one eat=
s, how many times a day one eats, how much food one eats each time is secon=
dary (though it matters too). How well one is enjoying food and digesting i=
t is primary.
=C2=A0
Similarly, what sadhana one does, how many years one d=
oes sadhana for and how many hours one spends in sadhana everyday is second=
ary (though it matters too). How involved one is in and how much one is enj=
oying sadhana is primary.
=C2=A0
If one finds a sadhana that one can enjoy =
and engage in without forcing oneself mechanically and if one feels love an=
d attachment to the tools, symbols
 and steps involved in that sadhana, one=
 is lucky. Otherwise, one may engage in a sadhana mechanically for a long t=
ime without making much progress.
=C2=A0
But, realize that one may have to =
try many cuisines before finding what one really loves. Secondly, one may d=
islike a cuisine at first and slowly get hooked. All these variables are th=
ere. But, eventually, one needs to enjoy what one is eating, to digest well=
. Similarly, one needs to eventually start enjoying one's sadhana, to progr=
ess spiritually.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Having said that, fire is som=
ething separate and special. Almost every ancient culture and civilization =
worshipped god in sacred fire.
=C2=A0
No matter what kind of food one eats,=
 eating some ginger can provoke one's appetite and make one digest better. =
Similarly, no matter what kind of sadhana one does, doing some fire worship=
 can
 provoke one's internal fire and make one digest better.
=C2=A0
Also, =
just as a good nutritionist working with one can help one in picking the ri=
ght balance of foods, a good guru or mentor working with one can help one i=
n picking the right balance of sadhanas.
=C2=A0
So a good guru/mentor and c=
ompany of fire are two things that put one in good stead, irrespective of w=
hat else one does.

=C2=A0
I do not like to comment o=
n specific people or organizations. But, I'd *in general* be suspicious of =
anyone who says they have a special and effective spiritual path, then cont=
rols and guards the details tightly and puts a price on it. That is not the=
 way of rishis. That is not the way of Sanatana Dharma.
=C2=A0
But if one t=
ries such a path and benefits, good for them. I'd personally stay away from=
 such organizations.
=C2=A0
BTW, I am
 not a "guruji", though I answered yo=
ur question.
