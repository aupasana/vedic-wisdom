Shri Murahariji,

Namaste!

Thank you for explaining this. However, in ritu=
als such as homams, etc. we do perform offerings to Brahmaji as we do to Vi=
shnuji and Shivaji. So, in the context of what you have written, doesn't th=
at mean that we try and satiate Brahmaji, the cause of duality and othernes=
s, through these other rituals? 

Thanks and best regards,
Manish
