Namaste Aparna,

Take an example of Panchakshari Mantra (Aum Namah Shivaya:=
)japa;

For One minute you can complete 100 times,
For One hour you can com=
plete 6000 times,
For 84 hours you can complete 5 lakhs and 4 thousand time=
s,

If you regularly do japa for 4 hours, within 4200 days (11 years 6 mont=
hs and 20 days) you can complete ONE CRORE times.


Thank you,
Srini.
