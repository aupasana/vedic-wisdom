Hi Aparna Ji

I'm writing to you at the behest of "somebody" who wanted me =
to share certain something with you =96 hence am taking the liberty of writ=
ing to you publicly on this forum. I'm hoping you won't mind it.

I've been=
 told to tell you this with regards to the Aghora books =96 please listen t=
o the song link given below -

http://youtu.be/xFO-BvfRrOU?t=3D3m55s

.....=
if you can remotely understand the essence of this song, it would help you =
understand aghora books better.

I was also asked to mention this to you th=
at the link below  - 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D1TADyXC2K0g

Aghori=
s take this song to the extreme and actually seize the moment, instead of w=
riting or reading about it, they take this birth as an opportunity and cann=
ot at any cost of this mundane life stay away from their deities come what =
may.

All the best for everything!!!!

She asked the same question "Where are the women saints of India?". A Pandi=
