Namaste Narasimha Ji

As I am doing super-short homam I have learned the st=
eps well. I now am studying to do the standard homam as described in the or=
iginal manual. Surprising that after studying for 2-3 days the whole proced=
ure seems very easy. I never know it would seem this clear and easy. I gues=
s once someone learns the basic steps (Anugya, Achamanam, Pranayamam and so=
 on) in short then there is divine bliss and soon he can learn them in deta=
ils also, without much problem.

I have learned anganyasa, karanyasa and so=
me other mudras from your Ganapati Homam video and by reading them on the n=
et I have a clear understanding. However I still have some confusions that =
I couldn't clear up from other sources, hence these questions:

1) While yo=
u are saying "Om shri Maha Ganapati Prana-Shaktyai Namah" you are performin=
g a mudra. If I understand it correctly, then it is -

Middle fingers join =
each other.
Small fingers join thumbs.
Ring fingers join index fingers.

Am=
 I right here to understand it?

2) What is the name of this mudra?

3) Sho=
uld I perform this same mudra while performing invocation of the main deity=
 for other homam also? Such as Sani homam, Lakshmi homam etc. and all other=
s? Or is this mudra for Maha Ganapati homam only?

4) I understand all othe=
r mudras but when you turn the palm downwards to perform samsthapani mudra,=
 are you STILL touching your ring finger's base with thumb's tip, like the =
Avahani mudra? Or are you simply touching your palm with the thumb-tip? Bec=
ause your thumb is not visible from above.

Thanks
Tanvir
