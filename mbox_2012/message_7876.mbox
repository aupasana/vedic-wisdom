During my college days I got to =

I think in India people are unaware=
 of this fact hence give offerings to god. In our old days everything right=

Hello,
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I =
am sure=C2=A0there are several views=C2=A0on Jeevanmukti and its effect and=
 other things but my take is that
if we do not experience certain extraordi=
nary and magical things ourselves all these remain only paper theory.
Those=
 saints who are born to lift human beings have a=C2=A0different inner struc=
ture=C2=A0and=C2=A0they carry out their work through Divine Will but we can=
not always understand their inner feelings.
=C2=A0
Some years back Due to D=
ivine Mother's Grace a Light came and surrounded me one morning. I did not =
know
it has happened but my whole day was filled with deep bliss. I have lo=
t of very difficult pain in my body yet I did 
not feel it on that day.Yet =
the pain was there, it did not go away or diminsh but I did not feel it. Th=
ere were other 
several problems yet I could not feel any tension or stress=
. I spent my day in a normal way yet all the time I was in a bliss. Funny e=
nough I kept thinking that it is a normal everyday thing.
=C2=A0
The Light =
left me next morning.
=C2=A0
As it left only then I realised that I was sur=
rounded by it=C2=A0and yesterday's bliss was=C2=A0directly due to it. I was=
 back to my normal self pain and and stress and all that. If anybody has ev=
er been in a large airconditioned building for several hours and then come =
out on street with heat and dust, the immediate impact on body and mind mig=
ht 
convay those feelings. If that Light had remain permanantly I am sure I=
 would be a Jeevanmukt by now.
=C2=A0
Several year before it, I did prayers=
 to Sri Ganeshji. Every wednesday I would=C2=A0cook myself=C2=A0besan moduk=
 and then offer 
them to SriSri Ganeshji hoping He would cure me of my phys=
ical pain
.I did it nearly a year, then somehow stopped it as I thought not=
hing was happening but kept doing Prayers
Several days later after I had my=
 early morning prayers a similar sort energy came=C2=A0 and surrounded me. =
It was more intense but lasted a very short period . I knew it was SriSri G=
aneshji kripa.
=C2=A0
The thing about white sugar is that when I made those=
 besan Ladoo I used white sugar.=C2=A0 I use white sugar all the time and m=
ake sweet dishes and then offer them to Divine Beings.. Only recently I hea=
rd people saying that it has bone ash in it. Is it really true?? I mean is =
it really true? How much it would be in a one kilo bag of cane or beetroot =
sugar. Is it true only for western countries or India as well. In India in =
all the Temples sweet dishes are made and offered to Deities. Does it mean =
there is bone ash in it if white sugar is used? Is there any way of removin=
g it ?
Thanks

Namaste - Well, I still don't get it. So Jeevanmukta is liberated f=

The cases / scenarios you mention sound like the p=

Btw, do you cal=
