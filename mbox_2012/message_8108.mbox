Respected learned members,
=A0
May be a very basic question, but always con=
fuse me, so wanted to seek 
clarification from learned members.=A0 


I wan=
t to know what is the basic principal and when to observe satyanarayna 
poo=
ja=A0when poornima starts and ends in the middle of day.
=A0
For expample, =
this time Poornima=A0 started in Bay area from 05-APR-12 3:50pm PST=A0 
and=
 ended on 06-APR 12:15pm PST
My question is when do we do Satyanarayna pooj=
a--=A0 05-APR night or on 06-APR 
night
=A0
The confusion is when we look f=
rom what tithi the day started with=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 
--05-APR start=
ed with chaturdasi and 06-APR starts with Poornima,
but if we wait till nig=
ht of 6th april, the tithi changes to pratipada so if we 
do the pooja in e=
vening then it is not poornmia tithi, it is pratipada.
=A0
We performed Sat=
yanarayan pooja on 5th night, since I think tithis are based on 
Moon cycle=
, and during that time it was poornima tithi, but observing fast 
during da=
ytime
when it was chaturdasi didn't sound correct.
=A0
Let me know if it is=
 correct or should we have done it on 6th night as a couple 
of temples did=
.
=A0
Thanks
=A0
Vikram
