Dear Rchalla,

Don't worry, just remember following are hindrances to spir=
itual
growth:

1)      Pride or Guilt

2)      Judging your experiences or =
thoughts

So don't judge your thoughts be good or bad, and don't feel
proud=
 or guilty about it.

Also remember, whatever thoughts you forcefully try t=
o avoid will
persist, so better accept it as not yours, and but don't parti=
cipate
just be an observer.

If type of language, which comes to your mind =
during prayer or japa, is
what you might use in your daily life with your f=
riend or when angry,
then try reducing such language in your routine life, =
but again by just
being aware of it, not forcing hard.

To get rid of negat=
ive energy, you can also try some physical exercise
like jogging or yoga.  =
Also do some pranayama before Kavacham and Japas.

Just remember, Good or B=
ad everything will Pass away.

Regards.

Mihir
