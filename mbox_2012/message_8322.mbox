Hello all, 

I have been following some tantra groups and in tantra there s=
eems to be 3 attitudes. 

1. IShta sadhana - complete surrender
2. Siddhi s=
adhana - for gaining specific siddhi (part bhog part moksha)

3. Material s=
adhana - related to bhog part of life. you do this specifically for the res=
ult you want. here there are sadhanas right from kuber sadhanas to apsara/u=
rvashi to making pact with lot of entities (from ghosts to whatnot).

i am =
wondering "if at all" and "what kind" of karmic liabilities one might be ge=
tting into ?
