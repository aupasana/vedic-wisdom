Namaste PVR Anna,

Thanks for this message and indeed for all the messages from the members of
this group. This is my first mail in this enlightening group.

At home, my Father always instructs me to use the flowers in the Pooja to
extinguish the flame and to commit the action with care & humility. He also
mentions that we should not allow the Deepam to get extinguished on its own
due to lack of oil.  I have seen that even in the temples - after providing
the Deepam, flower & kumkum to the people, the priest simply extinguishes
the Deepam by forcibly waving his hands at its flames.

If i have understood your message correctly -  Is it OK to allow the deepam
to get extinguished on their own sans any external input from the people
... *i.e* allow them to glow until the oil
lighting it up gets completely used up ?.

Please clarify.

Regards,
Saravanan L
