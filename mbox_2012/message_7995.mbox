UPANISHAD GANGA


'Upanishad Ganga' was conceptualized by H. H. Swami
Tejomayananda - Head of Chinmaya Mission Worldwide, with a vision
to take the message of the Upanshads to the masses. Many Acharyas
of Chinmaya Mission as well as Chinmaya International Foundation -
the research wing of the organisation, contributed to the thought
development. It took almost four years of research to build the ideas
for the serial. Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi ably visualized and
scripted the episodes, giving a concrete shape to this monumental
production. Chinmaya Mission is grateful to all the devotees
worldwide, who have supported this project.

*Why did a spiritual organization like Chinmaya
Mission produce a TV serial?*
H. H. Swami Chinmayananda - the founder of Chinmaya Mission,
visualized that just as the Ganges flows from the Himalayas,
nourishing the plains, so too the eternal message of the Rishis would
enrich the lives of all. His life was dedicated towards this. Television
being a powerful medium of communication, H. H. Swami
Tejomayananda - the Head of Chinmaya Mission, envisioned the idea
of 'Upanishad Ganga' - a teleserial, through which the message could
be taken right to the drawing rooms of all.

*Why the name Upanishad Ganga?*
Upanishads contain universal knowledge - relevant at all times,
appeals to all people and is applicable at every stage of life. Ganga is
the perennial flow of purity and nobility that has inspired humanity
(especially the Rishis) since ages. Thus this TV serial was named
UPANISHAD GANGA meaning the perennial flow of knowledge!

It's old, yet new.
It's meant for you.
