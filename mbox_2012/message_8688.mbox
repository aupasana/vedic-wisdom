=C2=A0Namaste,

I have a slightly different view. Aham Brahmasmi - the f=
amous Mahavakya is true, but with riders. One can become God in essence, bu=
t never in Power. And that makes a difference. Just like a water in a glass=
 and water in the ocean may have the same fundamental chemical composition =
- H2O - but the water in a glass cannot create a Tsunami, nor support a who=
le wide and complex ecosystem of organisms from microscopic to the gigantic=
, like an ocean does. That is a big difference.

A man through penances can=
 eventually become a man of god, or godly, not never God. This viewpoint ex=
plains why for example Krishna is an Avatara, and considered a perfection p=
ersonified incarnation of God. 

Ramakrishna used to say, everybody is the =
Divine Mother's essence, but not every one
 has the same amount of Shakti f=
rom the Divine Mother! He made this statement when he met a great reformist=
 Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar.

Namaste all,



Recently, I =
was party to a conversation regarding an avatAr's supremacy over rishi and =
yOgi/jnAni. My mental affiliations are closer to the yOga and advaita-vEdAn=
ta philosophies (needless to mention, the way I understand them). So far, b=
ased on my affiliations and understanding, I'm of the opinion that a Realiz=
ed Being (however he may have realized) is Divine in all its absoluteness (=
i.e. nothing distinguishes them from The Divinity). The way I understand 't=
at tvam asi', mOksha, Atma sAkshAtkAra, yOga, kaivalya, nirvANa etc. 



Wh=
ile their prarabdha may have been different, once they are realized there i=
s nothing that distinguishes them from what we call the Ultimate Divinity. =
So by logical extension, an avatAr is just the re-incarnation of any Realiz=
ed Being irrespective of that Being having attained to the Highest in 1 lif=
e, 10 lives, 100 lives or even a billion lives. Once they are Realized, the=
ir coming back in a future life is based on absolute free will and not by k=
Armic vAsanAs that draw them to a womb. In a nutshell, I saw no reason to d=
istinguish between Divine Descending (as an avatAr) vs. Man Ascending (as a=
 Realized Being). I was also forceful in the conversation that the entire M=
anifest Existence is Divine Descending and used that rationale to further f=
ortify my position that if we discount effects of prArabdha/sanchita, a Hum=
an Ascended yOgi/jnAni can(if willing) be as omnipotent/omniscient as a Div=
ine Descended avatAr. The conversation ended with not much
 conclusion. 


=

The last few days, I had been revisiting this within myself a few times - =
specifically the rationale for such classification in the below three eras.=
 I'd like to hear from the members on this forum regarding their understand=
ing of an avatAr, rishi, jnAni/yOgi etc. Please do mention the 'religious/s=
piritual tradition' you subscribe to, if possible.
