Thanks shoonyakaya, 
Thanks for sharing your methods, understanding and exp=
eriences. It inspired me to follow my intuition and setup my own saadhana r=
outine. 

I've recently started (just a month ago) meditating on different =
mantras, homam and tarpana. I thoroughly enjoyed this thread and as it refl=
ects some of my own doubts. I've not had any experiences but I am a lot cal=
mer and happy after i started. 

Here are a few things I'm doing:
1. Rising=
 up early before sunrise (as compared to 3-4 hours after sun rise)
2. Doing=
 pranayam, suryanamaskar, kapaal bhaanti - all learn from youtube videos (t=
hough i have some previous knowledge)
3. Doing Ram-raksha strotram and Gana=
pati homam and some other strotras that i like in 'Nitya Karma Pooja Prakas=
h' from geeta press.  
4. Following close to satvik diet (least oil, spices=
) only self cooked no outside food. (This is all to aid in saadhana).  

If=
 one you fellow sadhakas or gurus have any tips or comments, I'd be obliged=
. 

Thanks everyone. 
May parampita bless us all. Hari Aum!
