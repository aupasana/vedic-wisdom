please remember one critical thing - although it is a good thing=
 to invite people in homam with noble intentions of collective good, please=
 do not allow people (except very close people like wife, children etc...) =
to offer anything in your havan kund.
It is not at all a good idea to allow=
 people to offer ahutis in your havan kunda. i have suffered myself and i k=

best regards,

utpal
