=C2=A0 
Na=

 sadhakas who are 
> confused!

I beg to differ here albeit only a little. =
The message can actually inspire almost everybody who are some or the other=
 way in to spiritual Sadhana including the people who are truly confused.

=
It is inspiring for the people who are getting pulled in too many direction=
 of life due to various sense weaknesses as well as various responsibilitie=
s,but who still rue the fact that they waste away their time and instead sh=
ould invest that for God. It is also inspiring & eye opener for the people =
who talk big philosopohies and love of God and what may have you but shy aw=
ay from even a little bit of sadhana. It is a spiritual Tamacha which is re=
quired occassionaly to all of us or most of us in varying degree including =
the writer of the message.It is also for the people who are really deep in =
to Sadhana and still want to be better at that. I am of the opinion that th=
is message, in future, will truly inspire some fortunate few and change the=
 course of their lives. As is everybody's experience in life that sometime =
Slap works much faster and better. Bitter medicines cures faster, Harsh tru=
th needs to be spoken sometimes for good and there are so many
 examples wh=
ere it is recorded that many a times, Spiritual Gurus have push very bitter=
 pills for their disciples. 
I sincerely hope that readers do not get depre=
ss or angry/furious or even confuse due to the bluntness of the message. I =
hope also that Ahmkaara does not get hurt. As the basic and important Wisdo=
m goes - not get lost in words but to understand the soul of message - and =
that will happen is my wish. It must bang the door of one's heart so that l=
ittle by little people start cutting down on many unnecessary entertainment=
 and use more time for God or whatever term one like to use. This lecture i=
ncludes Me in the first palce. Shuruat merese Ho!

This is not at all a "Vy=
akti Puja" or something like that....but it is "Message Puja" surely!
That =
message was like "cleansing spirit" on the wound and your response was like=
 a "soothing Malam" and i wrote for shhhhfuuu..shhhhfuuu

Finsihing this, I=
 wish you and everybody, a very happy Gupt Navaratri!

Yours Lovingly,

Utp=

<br>
I beg to differ here albeit only a l=
ittle. The message can actually inspire almost everybody who are some or th=
e other way in to spiritual Sadhana including the people who are truly conf=
used.<br>
<br>
It is inspiring for the people who are getting pulled in too=
 many direction of life due to various sense weaknesses as well as various =
responsibilities,but who still rue the fact that they waste away their time=
 and instead should invest that for God. It is also inspiring & eye ope=
ner for the people who talk big philosopohies and love of God and what may =
have you but shy away from even a little bit of sadhana. It is a spiritual =
Tamacha which is required occassionaly to all of us or most of us in varyin=
g degree including the writer of the message.It is also for the people who =
are really deep in to Sadhana and still want to be better at that. I am of =
the opinion that this message, in future, will truly inspire some fortunate=
 few and change the course of their lives. As is everybody's experience in =
life that sometime Slap works much faster and better. Bitter medicines cure=
s faster, Harsh truth needs to be spoken sometimes for good and there are s=
o many
 examples where it is recorded that many a times, Spiritual Gurus ha=
ve push very bitter pills for their disciples.     <br>
I sincerely hope th=
at readers do not get depress or angry/furious or even confuse due to the b=
luntness of the message. I hope also that Ahmkaara does not get hurt. As th=
e basic and important Wisdom goes - not get lost in words but to understand=
 the soul of message - and that will happen is my wish. It must bang the do=
or of one's heart so that little by little people start cutting down on man=
y unnecessary entertainment and use more time for God or whatever term one =
like to use. This lecture includes Me in the first palce. Shuruat merese Ho=
!<br>
<br>
This is not at all a "Vyakti Puja" or something like that....but=
 it is "Message Puja" surely!<br>
That message was like "cleansing spirit" =
on the wound and your response was like a "soothing Malam" and i wrote for =
shhhhfuuu..shhhhfuuu<br>
<br>
Finsihing this, I wish you and everybody, a v=
ery happy Gupt Navaratri!<br>

Yours Lovingly,<br>
