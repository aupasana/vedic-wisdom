By the Revolutionary Vedic Teacher
Sr=
i Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

"The Dharma Manifesto:
A New Vision for Global=
 Transformation"

The concept that is encapsulated in the Sanskrit word "Dh=
arma" is predicated upon the recognized need for the organic and munificent=
 sacralization of culture and of all human concern, as well as the manifest=
ation of the highest potentials attainable by each human person in society.=
 The Dharma Manifesto serves as the first ever systematic revolutionary blu=
eprint for the nascent global Vedic movement that will, in the very near fu=
ture, arise to change the course of world history for the betterment of all=
 living beings. The Dharma Manifesto signals the beginning of a wholly new =
era in humanity's eternal yearning for meaningful freedom and happiness.

C=
an the Vedic world-view become the guiding principle of the governments of =
the world today, as it once was millennia ago? Can we witness the birth of =
a new global Vedic civilization in today's political environment? The unamb=
iguous answer that "The Dharma Manifesto" gives to these questions is: Yes!=
 And it shows us exactly how!

Early Reviews

"Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya considers=
 the state of the modern world and puts them into the context of cyclic tim=
e as revealed in the Yugas of the Vedas and as discussed by Oswald Spengler=
 in his seminal 'Decline of the West'. He discusses the failure of atheism,=
 the dangers of fundamentalism and the need for genuine Dharma based spirit=
uality. Extending from this Sri Acharyaji considers a very wide range of so=
cial and political issues from a Dharma perspective. You may not agree with=
 all of his perspectives but they will challenge you to reconsider your pos=
ition on many of these issues rather than taking the conventional secular p=
arty line. Sri Acharyaji considers each issue in terms of the Dharma and in=
 relation to the society and the spiritual growth of the individual. This i=
s a fascinating work offering a revolutionary approach to political and soc=
ial issues based within the spiritual framework of Tradition and the Dharma=
. It is certainly thought provoking and invites us to 'think outside the bo=
x' for the betterment of ourselves and mankind."

ine


"Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya is certainly very intelligent and know=
ledgeable in many important areas of modern life and culture. His writing i=
n this book is concise and very clear. As would be expected with any kind o=
f 'manifesto,' the ideas he puts forth in this book are meant to be revolut=
ionary, which he defines as, '=85proactive and constructive in nature, rath=
er than merely utopian or reactionary.' Many folks might be turned off by t=
hat approach to change, but in this work the manner of presenting his views=
 is actually quite balanced and intense, but neither idealistic nor emotion=
al." 

- J.M. Jordan


Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya's most historically gr=
oundbreaking politico-philosophical work, "The Dharma Manifesto", is now of=
fered to the world at a time when its people are most desperately crying ou=
t for fundamental change.
