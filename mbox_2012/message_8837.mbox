"The deeper the self;realization of a man, the more he influences the whole=
 universe by his subtle spiritual vibrations, and the less he himself is af=
fected by the phenomenal flux." These words of Master's often returned insp=
iringly to my mind.

Occasionally I told astrologers to select my worst per=
iods, according to planetary indications, and I would still accomplish what=
ever task I set myself. It is true that my success at such times has been a=
ccompanied by extraordinary difficulties. But my conviction has always been=
 justified: faith in the divine protection, and the right use of man's God;=
given will, are forces formidable beyond any the "inverted bowl" can muster=
. 

The starry inscription at one's birth, I came to understand, is not tha=
t man is a puppet of his past. Its message is rather a prod to pride; the v=
ery heavens seek to arouse man's determination to be free from every limita=
tion.

God created each man as a soul, dowered with individuality, hence es=
sential to the universal structure, whether in the temporary role of pillar=
 or parasite. His freedom is final and immediate, if he so wills; it depend=
s not on outer but inner victories.
