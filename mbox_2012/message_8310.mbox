I am delighted while reading this from the document:

[

If It has the p=
ower to generate this bewitching illusion, It also has

the power to wake y=
ou up."

"So why doesn't It just wake me up and be done with it?"

"Because=
 you have unconsciously been telling It you enjoy

sleeping."

"How?"

"By =
taking the world to be real and trying to get happiness in it.

Because It5=
4 created you free, It assumes that you have chosen to live

the way you do=
. It is only when you are tired of the game of life that

your mind changes=
. By getting to work spiritually, praying sincerely

and working on yoursel=
f, you put God on notice that you want out.

Eventually He responds by lift=
ing you out of your suffering, until you

realize that you were never bound=
, that you have always been free.
