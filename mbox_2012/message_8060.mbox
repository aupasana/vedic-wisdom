namaste,

>  Obviously Arjuna  is not jeevanmukta


Poor Arjuna is taking a beating in this thread !

One's state of mind determines whether or not one is a jivanmukta. And
since we cannot judge someone's state of mind, we cannot make any
assertions about whether or not one is a jivanmukta, be he a saint or a
sinner. Traditionalists say that only a jivanmukta can recognize a
jivanmukta.

I suspected that Vasishtha may have had something to say about Arjuna, and
took a quick look in the Yoga Vasishtha. Indeed, he declares Arjuna to be a
mahAbahu, mahAmuni and a jIvanmukta.

sasneham,

   ajit
