=C2=A0 
Namaste f=
riends,

Happy Guru Pournima and I bow to the Guru Tattva that is present i=
n all 
of you.

On this occasion, I want to clarify one thing, on which I k=
ept quiet for 
many years.

Some people look up to me as a "guru", in eithe=
r astrology or 
spirituality or both.

When it comes to astrology, people w=
ho follow me should have known by 
now that I am still searching for someth=
ing that satisfies me. The 
knowledge/ignorance I keep sharing (because tha=
t is the best I can do 
now) is most likely different from what rishis mean=
t. So there is no 
point in looking up to me as a "guru" and following me w=
ith fervour. Do 
your own search instead (and maximize the chance of someon=
e finding 
truth).

When it comes to spirituality, I am NOT an enlightened =
person and not 
capable of making anyone enlightened. Even if the un-enligh=
tened 
spiritual state I am in is good enough for someone, I do not know ho=
w to 
replicate it in someone, either through writings or talks or thoughts=
. 
In other words, I am capable of giving one NEITHER what one needs in the=
 
long run NOR what I have right now. All I can give others, through my 
wr=
itings, is an understanding that is qualified by their and my 
conditioning=
 (like a white conch exchanged between two people with dirty 
hands may hav=
e the dirty hand prints of the giver or the taker). Yes, I 
can also share =
knowhow of some tools that may help you in your pursuit, 
but that does not=
 make me a guru either.

This is not just some humble talk, but the *unques=
tionable* and honest 
reality. It is better if people who are somehow fasci=
nated with me 
and/or look up to me as a guru and think about me with rever=
ence, divert 
that attention and reverence towards God. Unlike me, God CAN =
make you a 
better astrologer or a better spiritual sadhaka or both.

Happy=
 Guru Pournima again!

Love & regards,
Narasimha
