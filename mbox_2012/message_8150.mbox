Namaste,
 I have heard that during the Upanishad times, there was a certain meditation performed on the AUM mantra. It included mediating on the waking state during the "A", the dreaming state during the "U" and deep sleep during "M".
 Does anyone know where I can find more details on this? 

 Take care,
 Svarupa
