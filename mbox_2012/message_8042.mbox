Dear Rajarshi,
=C2=A0
=C2=A0=C2=A0 I think that Mr.Lalit totally didn't get=
 the big picture, and just started fuming after reading the fact that exper=

rather than a fanciful passing, which he obviously misunderstood.

Namaste,

<<Instead I emphasi=

nment.>>

Very true. Rishi Vasistha says to Lord Rama, "He who is friendly =
(internally) even to one who is about to murder him is a seer of Truth. Ado=
ration of one who has not risen above likes and dislikes (raga and dvesa) i=
s futile. Only he who is free from egoistic and volitional activity and who=
 is utterly non-attached to anything here, is genuinely liberated". 

As Lo=
rd Krishna says in the Gita, 

"56. He whose mind is not shaken by adversit=
y, who does not hanker after 
pleasures, and who is free from attachment, f=
ear and anger, is called a 
sage of steady wisdom.57. He who is everywhere =
without attachment, on meeting with anything good 
or bad, who neither rejo=
ices nor hates, his wisdom is fixed"

The same truth has been repeated thou=
sands of times across scriptures and by different enlightened men across ce=
nturies.=C2=A0 Perfect equanimity in thoughts, words and deeds is the ultim=
ate goal to be attained. Any thing else, any mystical experience etc, is he=
lpful to the extent that it aids this goal. If however, a mystical experien=
ce does not produce internal detachment and results in increasing pride (ev=
en subconscious pride) it can prove detrimental in the final equation.

=C2=A0 
Namaste Lalit,
=C2=A0
Thanks for giving me free publicity by fo=
rwarding a link to what I consider to be one of my best writings ever on sp=
iritual matters:
=C2=A0
> http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/messag=
e/7948
=C2=A0
This particular writing was the culmination of a lot of obser=
vation, contemplation and churning on various issues related to spiritualit=
y over a long time. Of course, there will be some who think it is nonsense,=
 but there will also be some who will like it very much.
 Thanks for forwar=
ding the link to a wide group of people without my asking!
=C2=A0
Just for =
the record, I do not consider myself a "spiritual guru" and nor do I want a=
ny followers.
=C2=A0
My views are obviously not perfect, because they are s=
till evolving.
=C2=A0
I unconditionally put out my views so that anybody wh=
o wants to benefit can benefit and others can just ignore. I said at the st=
art of the above mail, "If you don't like my 2 cents, kindly feel free to i=
gnore me and follow your gurus and others whom you may prefer." 
=C2=A0
Whe=
ther it is my spiritual writings or homam/Satya Narayan vrat/tarpana manual=
s or Jyotish class MP3s or Jyotish software, they are all available to othe=
rs freely and unconditionally and with genuinely no strings attached. Feel =
free to benefit (if you think it is possible at all to benefit) or simply i=
gnore. Very simple.
=C2=A0
BTW, I have not disregarded "experiencing enligh=
tenment". I have intentionally downplayed mystical experiences that may tra=
p one and make one egoistic, so that one does not mistaken them for "englig=
htenment". Instead I emphasized detachment and equanimity, because those ar=
e the TRUE signs of enlightenment.
=C2=A0
Experience
 of equanimity, i.e. e=
xperiencing that one's mind is calm in situations 
in which it would've bee=
n agitated or angry or sad at earlier times, is 
the real "experience" one =
needs to seek and perfect.When that "experience" is perfected, THAT is enli=
ghtenment.
=C2=A0

Narasimha

Spirituality is=C2=A0a pactical subject, based on=C2=A0real =

<div>Dear Audience,</div>
<div=

<div>Spirituality is a pactical subject, based on r=
eal experiences led enlightenment, This scruplous guy not granted expe=
riences is working on a cunning agenda to disregard "experiencing enlighten=
ment" so that crowd may not make efforts to distinctify real and fake in sp=
itiual sadhana, and fakes like him can do the propoganda in a unquestioned =
mannerism.</div>
<div>With no artifical efforts, one can capture true exper=
ience since all true experiences are granted by God irrespective =
of count of mantra or process of sadhana or intelligence. </div>

such ineperienced and craving guys having lust for being branded as sp=

<div>c=
omfortably preaching false things to  the crowd over internet, Agenda =

<div>Very inteliigently, such guys point at your's (audien=
ce) ego and impurities but never at their own, They w'd try entire world to=
 remove ego before their own ego so that they can get satisfaction of being=
 better placed with winning respect while not having to respect anything or=
 anybody including truth and enlightenment. </div>
<div><b></b> <=

<div><b>Shameless Agenda:</b></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Look at hi=

us guy is living with -</div>
<div> </div>
<div><b>//  I recently=
 finished a specific sadhana of a specific form of Divine Mother. This part=
