Namaste

The death of a close relative on my wife's side today and thinking about
that person's life made me to ponder about the following questions:

1. If a person has no children, who will do tarpana/shraddha for the person
after the person's death?

2. If a person has no children, how will that person be reborn in the same
lineage?

How do the masters guide such a soul?

Please excuse me if the questions look silly.

thanks and best regards
Hari
