Hi Aparna Ji

I'm writing to you at the behest of "somebody" who wanted m=
e to share certain something with you =96 hence am taking the liberty of wr=
iting to you publicly on this forum. I'm hoping you won't mind it.

I've be=
en told to tell you this with regards to the Aghora books =96 please listen=
 to the song link given below

http://youtu.be/xFO-BvfRrOU?t=3D3m55s

....i=
f you can remotely understand the essence of this song, it would help you u=
nderstand aghora books better.

I was also asked to mention this to you tha=
t  - 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D1TADyXC2K0g

Aghoris take this song=
 to the extreme and actually seize the moment, instead of writing or readin=
g about it, they take this birth as an opportunity and cannot at any cost o=
f this mundane life stay away from their deities come what may.

I was also=
 asked to mention this to you but in my haste I forgot hence am shooting th=
is to you again that "Aghor is the mode of tantra in which you do things "t=
ill the roof collapses" because you are not happy with mere earthquakes tha=
t only jolt the house".

Good luck again.

 (actually they're the same in my head and are both my goal as my divine pa=

the Sivananda tradition is Om Namo Narayanaya.) And I have recently added h=

 giving me any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I'm afraid, but as she made=
 me, it's her own fault).
