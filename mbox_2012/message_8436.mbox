Subject: [v=
edic-wisdom] Mahamrityunjaya and Divine Namapathy

Greetings,

Hope you're =
all well, and that your sadhanas are going fantastically well (especially a=
fter we all told each other to get verrrry serious). 

I've had a gruelling=
 few shifts in hospital the last few days, including witnessing some unfort=
unately inevitable deaths in very sick people...something that has become p=
art of my daily life as a doctor. It is weird to see how the body loses all=
 importance the moment it dies. It is also strange how a dead body looks ju=
st like an empty house...exactly like someone just left. It certainly makes=
 one think that there must be something more to us than this fleshy cage. T=
his cage that becomes unattractive in old age, filled with appalling miseri=
es in serious illness, and hideous in death. 

It is interesting to think a=
bout what one can do to help the sick and dying, when they reach a stage be=
yond all human aid. It is not pleasant to watch someone die while feeling u=
tterly helpless to relieve suffering. 

Sivananda used to have great faith =
in the Name- he used to call it "Divine Namapathy". While modern medicine, =
Ayurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, he used to say that, Namapathy wa=
s an outstanding way to prevent disease and heal us on all levels- physical=
, mental and spiritual. 

While he said all names of God- Rama, Allah, Budd=
ha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the Mahamrityunjaya mantra speci=
ally for healing purposes. And especially for those who are very sick or dy=
ing.

He says "Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra will remove accidents, incurable dis=
eases and bestow long life and immortality. It is a Moksha Mantra too."

I =
visited the Sivananda Charitable hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu some ye=
ars ago, and the doctors and nurses who work there, start the day with chan=
ting of mantras (including the Mahamrityunjaya) for their patients, each ot=
her and the whole world. I believe it is the same with the little Ashram ho=
spital in Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to start the day.....repeating ma=
ntras with your colleagues. 

I wanted to mention the power of this mantra =
for anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or indeed, if you y=
ourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the blessing of G=
od to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Basically saying "T=
hy Will be done" because You know what is best. Of course it is NOT asking =
for a miracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will of God). 

At any po=
int in time, there are several human beings, animals and various creatures =
who are dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly during the process of dy=
ing. I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra a few times daily to re=
duce their misery. Our sages say it works, and I believe them. 

Here is a =
link for those who are interested in learning more about this great mantra.=
 The article is written by a disciple of Swami Satyananda, a saint of very =
recent times.

Aparna
