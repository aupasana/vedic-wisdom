Namaste Narasimha Garu,

It is in my knowledge that you are in touch with a=
 person who is spiritually very wise and experienced and who spent good amo=
unt of years with his late mentor who was an accomplished Yogi himself. I b=
elieve that the roots of homam/havan movement, which is done by many thousa=
nds today inspired by this list and the manual written by you, traceback to=
 that great yogi. obviously, the person with whom you are intouch with, mus=
t have some valuable knowledge experience related to Agni Sadhana.

with th=
is background, I have sincere request to you. for the clarifications of man=
y, is it possible to ask for his views about this ratio of numbers of Mantr=
a in Ahuti and Japa and Tarpana in detail.

Sincerely,

Utpal

. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recita=
tion of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at=

meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)
