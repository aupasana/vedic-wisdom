Dear Sathya,

Though I do not want to have an extended debate on this topic, I wanted to
share a few thoughts. Much of your anti-parihara logic actually applies to
all karma and all sadhana (though you may not have intended it)

1) Two people may do a parihara for something causing a shortened life.
Person-120 may have a long life, while Person-0 may not. Yet, you cannot
draw any conclusions. Perhaps Person-0's parihara was more effective, and
he will have a long-life in several future births, while Person-120 will
have a longer life in this birth followed by short lives in several future
births.

Any karma done in this life is a single data-point, which mixes in the
kichdi of previous karmas. Over time, through regular sadhana / karma, it
is a good idea to slowly burn all these accumulated "bad" karmas, and
accumulate good karmas which are more conducive to spiritual progress. It
is a good idea to do a parihara without any desire.

In some sense, all sadhana is parihara, and all parihara is sadhana.

2) God may be everywhere ... yet we have to work hard to find him and
realize this.

"Since God is everywhere, there is no need to find him. Since God is
everywhere, there is no need to perform avahana" .... this is a fatalist
neo-vedanta way of thinking.

For most people, God is *not* everywhere, because of our own limitations.
The true notion of God as antaryAmi is not suitable for *most* bhaktas or
karma yogis. It is hard even for those few people who are qualified for
gyana-yoga.

> if God has to bless he will bless any where the person is

This is all fine if you are able to handle the results of all your previous
karmas with a peaceful detached mind. Those who are not will eventually
have to do serious sadhana.

Someone might follow your reasoning and stop going to work. After all, God
will bless that person if he has to. A truly elevated soul will be fine. If
he has to, he will bear poverty and hunger with a smile on his face, and
will progress spiritually. The rest of us are different ... we will suffer
through poverty and hunger, become more attached to this body, and will
regress spiritually.

Be engaged in karma for a given purpose, without any expectations, and with
detachment.

sasneham,

   ajit
