Narasimha Ji

Your reply means a lot to me , will try to watch out. for the=
 pitfalls that you mentioned. The experience is imprinted in my heart const=
antly giving me tears of gratitude...thats all I know ...cannot explain it =
and somehow for the first time in my life not looking for a intellectual ex=
planation of it.

There would be many who would want to meet you on the wes=
t coast and would love to participate in the Satya Narayana Puja. 

Regards=

 due to one's own purity. However, a tangible experience or a Kundalini awa=

 He said that he sought experiences when young, but realized later that one=

creasing one's detachment in actions.

, any members experiencing Kundalini awakening need to take care of their p=
