Well, we accord on some points but not on all.

Many words in samskrita (no=
t 'sanskrit') have multiple layers of meanings. Most common of the meaning/=
interpretations being the charaadi interpretation/meaning, uparicharaadi in=
terpretation/meaning and manvaadi interpretation/meaning. In the same way, =
they have three general effects on the kartru - manvaadi, charaadi and upar=
icharaadi. What you are saying, that is, there is nothing wrong for kids in=
 reciting it. You are right in the broader sense of the sentence, in that, =
the effects would be 'manvaadi'. That is psychological. I mean to say, the =
mind gets cleansed. If the charaadi (that is body.ly effects - such as impr=
ovement in health, kaanti etc.,) and uparicharaadi (that is beyond that com=
posed of the common, - the interpretation/meaning as seen with the help of =
inner eye) effects is to take place, one has to either have 'aparOkshajnaan=
a' or a deep understanding of what is being recited, which can be obtained =
through a guru (again, please note that
 guru means a 'teacher' in the broa=
d sense of the word, but a deeper meaning exists. guru - ---- giratEti gruH=
. One who eats/destroys/removes the ego in the student).

Similar to the ab=
ove interpretations, homa, yoga, tapas all have multiple meanings. Tapas do=
es not mean holding one's breadth for so long and all.. Tapas means "deep t=
hought". It might be anything. If you are trying to understand the meaning =
of AUM (not 'OM') through meditation, then that is tapas (it does not requi=
re us to be seated in front of idols and etc.. the important thing is we sh=
ould be seated infront of 'what we are thinking so deep about'). Again ther=
e are various stages to it, which is another story. Please note that one ca=
nnot comment about these "heavy" words in such a general way.


First, let =
the kid develop a sense of spirituality inside her (again, spirituality is =
not to be confused with doing routine namaskaaras, poojas and so on...., th=
ey only aid the manvaadi saadhane in spirituality). First teach the kid, sa=
mskrita. A desire to learn the scriptures should be developed, from within =
the kid. Teach her Indian Classical music (you can start from bhajans and g=
radually make it to pure classical) and she might discover her own way to p=
erform aahata and anahata naadayoga. Once, a person steps into practicing n=
aada yoga, the rest of the exterior world becomes very simple and transpare=
nt and the hidden meanings of texts in our scriptures open up all by themse=
lves with very little of our focused efforts. As Thyagaraaja rightfully sai=
d, sangeetamaarga is the easiest maarga to moksha (again there are multiple=
 levels of meaning to moksha here....). 

I agree, we are all kids in the f=
ield of spirituality. Infact, when godess Lakshmi herself tells in all humi=
lity that "mama yoniH apsu antaH samudre" (there is one above me who sits i=
n the ocean.....---referring to Lord VishNu), we are all but toddlers in th=
e part of spirituality. But, we have to make our efforts in an efficient ma=
nner, because, the todays, 60 or 80 years of lifetime is too short on the g=
rand scale of time. Directly starting of with hOmas and etc,, is a bit too =
much for the kids and its imprtactical also. If the basement is not built p=
roperly, it is not possible to build a building properly.. It might collaps=
e anytime.

I highly appreciate the parents for having this thought, but my=
 comments should be taken as a word of advice. In our present state of bhar=
atadesha; amongst the people who have abandoned their vedic roots by taking=
 the wrong interpretation of the words "modernization" and "professionalism=
", it is really positive and it gives me immense joy, that parents like the=
 questioner are still there who want to inculcate the vast, deep vedic trad=
ition in their kids. But this does not mean, we can take these "heavy" thin=
gs liberally and do things as we wish.
- With warm regards

Sunil Anandathe=
