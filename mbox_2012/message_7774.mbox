namaste,

This question comes up repeatedly in Sanskrit groups. For example=
, please
see the discussion in the thread below.

http://www.mail-archive.c=
om/sanskrit@.../msg00745.html

The short version is this: many lear=
ned scholars pronounce "brahma" as
'bramha", and as such, both are deemed a=
cceptable. However, it is difficult
to objectively defend the pronounciatio=
n of "brahma" as "bramha".

There is a little bit of confusion because ther=
e is a traditional shloka
which talks about an alternate pronounciation of =
"ha" in some cases (e.g.
brahma, vahni, hyaH etc). This is sometimes used a=
s a justification to
switch the placement of the "h" in brahma and vahni ..=
. but this applies to
"hyaH" too. Just try to pronounce it as "yhaH", and y=
ou will see the
problem with this line of reasoning.

Furthur, "ha" is usua=
lly pronounced from the throat. This alternate "ha" in
the case of brahma, =
vahni etc is said to be aurasya (i.e. from the chest).
No one can authorita=
tively say what this sounds like, and this is
considered "lost knowledge". =
But, we can use some common sense. If you
pronounce "brahma", "vahni" and "=
hyaH" as written, you will see that there
is a tendency to prononce it a li=
ttle lower (a little bit from the chest)
when compared to words like "hAhA"=
. By switching the order from "brahma" to
"bramha", you are are not moving =
it towards the chest ... you are clearly
moving it back upwards to the thro=
at.

sasneham,

   ajit
