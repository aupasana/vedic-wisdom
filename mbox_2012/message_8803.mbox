Trivediji,

I feel to start with your sadhana krama is perfect.

The heigh=
tened awareness is experienced when you dont expect it and therefore the tr=
ue measure of a sadhana is the extent of happiness and calmness that you ga=
rner from it.

Aparnaji,

If you can recall your childhood (or watch any ch=
ild at present) one always had this sense of awe. I feel the sadhana gradua=
lly reduces our prejudices and ego so that the same child with wonder in it=
s eyes surfaces again within us. 

While walking today somebody yelled at m=
e for absolutely no mistake of mine. I got furious but immediately split my=
 mind into two. One mind was furious on the guy who yelled at me and the ot=
her mind was studying the furious mind. This revealed my silly self which w=
anted to kill that person for making some noise. I laughed at this scheme. =
I felt like thanking that person and god for presenting an insight into the=
 designs of my ego and saved me from useless thinking. My mistake or not bu=
t i got something to learn ! So continued my walking meditation with a smil=
e again :)

Om tat sat
