Dear learned members of the group
=A0
I read every post pertaining to perfo=
rming homam just to see if my experience matches that of others. And I alwa=
ys find something that validates my experience. Therefore, thanks to Mr Kin=
g_Tanvir who has found a way to perform the homam in a predominantly muslim=
 country. Congratulations.
=A0
My dilemma. I struggle to keep the fire burn=
ing by adding dried coconut pieces, drops of ghee, other such material whil=
e I recite the various mantras prescribed in the manual. But it bothers me =
that my attention is on maintaining the fire when I should be concentrating=
 on the mantras (I try to guess the real meaning behind the words in the ma=
ntra, I understand some intuitively, some not at all, I take the whole by f=
aith). At times when the fire goes out I feel very bad.
=A0
Espeically towa=
rds the end, when i start to meditate, if I have to worry about the fire dy=
ing out, I feel miserable because this is the most important part of the ho=
mam, according to the manual (well, Mr Narasimha).
=A0
My questions: if I h=
ave a guest witnessing the ceremony, is it proper to let the guest keep the=
 fire burning? But what if he also wants to meditate? And my guests are not=
 of Indian origin, they are not comfortable taking an active part in the ho=
mam. They are interested in observing the proceeding, not so much in partic=
ipation.
=A0
I also notice that at times the drops of ghee falling on a sma=
ll fire actually put it off! So I have started to add the drops to the side=
 of the burning flame, may be on a piece of coconut. I make the ghee at hom=
e, so I do not suspect the quality of the ghee:-))
=A0
What am I doing wron=
g?
=A0
Thanks for any advice from the learned members.
=A0
Regards
Ranga

Namaste Narasimha Ji and other membe=
rs

I have performed a super-short Shani Homam this evening. I thank you fo=
r guiding me so detailed... without your manual it would never be possible.=


Interesting point to note, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed=
 with a Brahmin family for about 10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit w=
as to learn doing homam! However I was disappoint because their procedure w=
as so big that it would take about 3 hours for the homam, and many more mat=
erials also. Of course, they learnt it from 'guru-kulam' and it was their o=
wn tradition. They are not a modern researcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who =
could compare many traditions, research on them, and even come up with a sh=
orter version. They had no idea that a shorter version is possible, or some=
thing can be left out. As an example, they suggested a mantadory japam of 1=
0x times before I do an 'x' times offering in homam, and many more formalit=
ies.

So, I knew in Bangladesh I would never have so much materials needed,=
 and I would not be able to perform a 3 hour homam regularly, so it was of =
no use. 

Much later when I was reading your manual, I remember about Acham=
anan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :-)

Anyway Ji...

Everything was alm=
ost as per recommendation, except I used a melamine spoon to offer ghee, be=
cause I couldn't manage a wooden spoon even after a lot of effort. May be I=
 have to order it... but I will have to work much hard to find a craft-man =
who can make a spoon with wood.

I burnt the fire with mango-wood and jute-=
sticks.

Purnahuti with ghee only.

That WAS the problem. Soon after starti=
ng the fire, I had an idea how fast the woods were burning. So while I was =
moving with the homam, I knew that with a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti=
, the fire will not survive long to allow me meditate even 5 mins. Because =
the woods were burning out fast.

So I could not meditate.

My first Q. - 1=
) Would you have any suggestion how can I make the fire last long so that i=
t burns for at least 10 mins allowing me mediate? I noted even if I had put=
 much wood, they would still burn out fast...

Offering full / half coconut=
 seems to be the only thing that would keep the fire alive for 10-15 mins a=
nd let me meditate.

Another Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and dryin=
g them for last 3-4 days, I can dry them no matter how long it takes, so th=
at I can use them as suggested in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how=
 to I dry a "FULL" coconut so much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? =
I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhe=
re for a few days, will not it be rotten or something? Any procedure? I am =
asking this because here no one has any idea about that, because no one eve=
n thinks of having "burnable" full coconuts. That is why.

Mantras work ver=
y strong for me. But I feel not strong enough for big spiritual or material=
 effects. I have had very strong experiences with homam before while perfor=
ming with others. Even a few times I *arranged* homams for others and I alw=
ays directly felt a strong effect working on me also.

Today with the homam=
, the effect was not that strong. I know why, because it was a super-short =
homam, with many mantras left. Also, I should honestly admit that when I im=
agined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva in the fire, the imagination was no=
t 100% strong. Because, I was worried and nervous about making mistake, so =
I could not 100% focus on their presence. Which I should. I guess it will i=
mprove with time.

I am going to add mantras from the main homam soon, comm=
on mantras which are needed in all homams like Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni=
 Deva prayer etc. Also I guess Avahana-related Sanskrit mantras are very im=
portant.

By the way I did 108 offerings with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and t=
hen 21 offerings with the smallest Shani mantra again.

I am thankful to th=
e ultimate divinity that at least I didn't have any negative experience aft=
er the homam. I was pretty nervous about the possibility. Because long back=
 in 2002-2003 when I started mantras, almost everyday I faced negative ener=
gies for the imperfection of pronunciation and procedures. Sometimes the ne=
gatives were so strong. But I didn't give up and tried to understand the co=
rrect ways because since I saw the power in it, I had to find what's the ri=
ght way to get the pure blessings, avoiding mistakes.

As an example, you [=
Narasimha Ji] instructed to stay in an empty stomach while doing homam. I f=
ind this 100% true from my mantra japam experience. Though no website or al=
most no one instructed me to stay empty stomached in japam, I found that ma=
ntras work very strong with empty stomach. Also, I always got strong negati=
ve effects when I did japam after my dinner. Thus, I learned this from my o=
wn experience but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong practices I =
did]! Now days, I can't eat anything after my lunch... because I do mantras=
 in the evening. At times it becomes very difficult not to eat something as=
 I sometimes hang out with friends etc. at afternoon or early evening. But =
I have no choice.

That is the thing I appreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] =
to make the small [yet very important] things always mentioned.

Same thing=
 about your instruction of minimum movement of the body, I find it very cor=
rect.

Anyway Ji I guess I am stretching my mail very long...

my 3rd Q. - =
3) As per your manual if I take Shani as an expression of the ultimate cosm=
ic power or divinity, I can offer other Gods' mantras in fire too. Can I do=
 a Navagraha homam this way, or at least a homam for 6-7 grahas?

4) If yes=
, should I maintain the graha order such as Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?=


5) Is there any exceptional instruction while doing homam of Rahu and Ket=
u etc., or just like Shani?

Wanted to mention that I am also planning to d=
o homam of Maha Lakshmi and other deities but manuals for those deities are=
 already there, hence these additional questions about graha-homams.

Appre=
ciate your time to answer me.

Thanking you again,
Tanvir

I believe th=
at it doesn't matter if you perform homam for 3hrs or 3 mins and with many =
materials or little materials. Minimum things are always required.All it ma=
tters is the concentration and belief in performing homam and on GOD. We pr=
ay GOD with fear and not with belief and love. 
There is always a mantra in=
 the end 'Kriya heenam...', which says 'Oh Lord please excuse us for wrong =
doing by ignorance and materialize our offerings'. 
Performing japam for 10=
X times is to please GOD. Each GOD has their unique way of pleasing them. D=
oing homam in such short cut ways might not give desired results though in =
many cases it doesn't harm.

-content><BR><BR>Namaste Narasimha Ji and other members<BR><BR>I have perfo=
rmed a super-short Shani Homam this evening. I thank you for guiding me so =
detailed... without your manual it would never be possible.<BR><BR>Interest=
ing point to note, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Br=
ahmin family for about 10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to lear=
n doing homam! However I was disappoint because their procedure was so big =
that it would take about 3 hours for the homam, and many more materials als=
o. Of course, they learnt it from 'guru-kulam' and it was their own traditi=
on. They are not a modern researcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who could comp=
are many traditions, research on them, and even come up with a shorter vers=
ion. They had no idea that a shorter version is possible, or something can =
be left out. As an example, they suggested a
 mantadory japam of 10x times =
before I do an 'x' times offering in homam, and many more formalities.<BR><=
BR>So, I knew in Bangladesh I would never have so much materials needed, an=
d I would not be able to perform a 3 hour homam regularly, so it was of no =
use. <BR><BR>Much later when I was reading your manual, I remember about Ac=
hamanan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :-)<BR><BR>Anyway Ji...<BR><BR>Eve=
rything was almost as per recommendation, except I used a melamine spoon to=
 offer ghee, because I couldn't manage a wooden spoon even after a lot of e=
ffort. May be I have to order it... but I will have to work much hard to fi=
nd a craft-man who can make a spoon with wood.<BR><BR>I burnt the fire with=
 mango-wood and jute-sticks.<BR><BR>Purnahuti with ghee only.<BR><BR>That W=
AS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an idea how fast the wo=
ods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I knew that with a =
big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the
 fire will not survive long to allow=
 me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning out fast.<BR><BR>S=
o I could not meditate.<BR><BR>My first Q. - 1) Would you have any suggesti=
on how can I make the fire last long so that it burns for at least 10 mins =
allowing me mediate? I noted even if I had put much wood, they would still =
burn out fast...<BR><BR>Offering full / half coconut seems to be the only t=
hing that would keep the fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.<BR>=
<BR>Another Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3=
-4 days, I can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can use them=
 as suggested in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a "FULL=
" coconut so much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am dryi=
ng sliced coconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days=
, will not it be rotten or something? Any procedure? I am asking this becau=
se here no one has any idea
 about that, because no one even thinks of havi=
ng "burnable" full coconuts. That is why.<BR><BR>Mantras work very strong f=
or me. But I feel not strong enough for big spiritual or material effects. =
I have had very strong experiences with homam before while performing with =
others. Even a few times I *arranged* homams for others and I always direct=
ly felt a strong effect working on me also.<BR><BR>Today with the homam, th=
e effect was not that strong. I know why, because it was a super-short homa=
m, with many mantras left. Also, I should honestly admit that when I imagin=
ed Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva in the fire, the imagination was not 10=
0% strong. Because, I was worried and nervous about making mistake, so I co=
uld not 100% focus on their presence. Which I should. I guess it will impro=
ve with time.<BR><BR>I am going to add mantras from the main homam soon, co=
mmon mantras which are needed in all homams like Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Ag=
ni Deva prayer etc.
 Also I guess Avahana-related Sanskrit mantras are very=
 important.<BR><BR>By the way I did 108 offerings with Veda-Vyasa Shani man=
tra and then 21 offerings with the smallest Shani mantra again.<BR><BR>I am=
 thankful to the ultimate divinity that at least I didn't have any negative=
 experience after the homam. I was pretty nervous about the possibility. Be=
cause long back in 2002-2003 when I started mantras, almost everyday I face=
d negative energies for the imperfection of pronunciation and procedures. S=
ometimes the negatives were so strong. But I didn't give up and tried to un=
derstand the correct ways because since I saw the power in it, I had to fin=
d what's the right way to get the pure blessings, avoiding mistakes.<BR><BR=
>As an example, you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to stay in an empty stomach w=
hile doing homam. I find this 100% true from my mantra japam experience. Th=
ough no website or almost no one instructed me to stay empty stomached in j=
apam, I found
 that mantras work very strong with empty stomach. Also, I al=
ways got strong negative effects when I did japam after my dinner. Thus, I =
learned this from my own experience but after a lot of troubles faced [for =
the wrong practices I did]! Now days, I can't eat anything after my lunch..=
. because I do mantras in the evening. At times it becomes very difficult n=
ot to eat something as I sometimes hang out with friends etc. at afternoon =
or early evening. But I have no choice.<BR><BR>That is the thing I apprecia=
te about you [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very important] things a=
lways mentioned.<BR><BR>Same thing about your instruction of minimum moveme=
nt of the body, I find it very correct.<BR><BR>Anyway Ji I guess I am stret=
ching my mail very long...<BR><BR>my 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I ta=
ke Shani as an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can o=
ffer other Gods' mantras in fire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way, =
or at
 least a homam for 6-7 grahas?<BR><BR>4) If yes, should I maintain th=
e graha order such as Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?<BR><BR>5) Is there an=
y exceptional instruction while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just =
like Shani?<BR><BR>Wanted to mention that I am also planning to do homam of=
 Maha Lakshmi and other deities but manuals for those deities are already t=
here, hence these additional questions about graha-homams.<BR><BR>Appreciat=
e your time to answer me.<BR><BR>Thanking you again,<BR>Tanvir<BR><BR></DIV=

 com</A><BR>Date: Monday, 26 March, 2012, 3:35<BR><BR>  <BR><BR>Namast=
e Narasimha Ji and other members<BR><BR>I have performed a super-short Shan=
i Homam this evening. I thank you for guiding me so detailed... without you=
r manual it would never be possible.<BR><BR>Interesting point to note, that=
 in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Brahmin family for about =
10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing homam! However =
I was disappoint because their procedure was so big that it would take abou=
t 3 hours for the homam, and many more materials also. Of course, they
 lea=
rnt it from 'guru-kulam' and it was their own tradition. They are not a mod=
ern researcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who could compare many traditions, r=
esearch on them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had no idea =
that a shorter version is possible, or something can be left out. As an exa=
mple, they suggested a mantadory japam of 10x times before I do an 'x' time=
s offering in homam, and many more formalities.<BR><BR>So, I knew in Bangla=
desh I would never have so much materials needed, and I would not be able t=
o perform a 3 hour homam regularly, so it was of no use. <BR><BR>Much later=
 when I was reading your manual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. fr=
om their teaching :-)<BR><BR>Anyway Ji...<BR><BR>Everything was almost as p=
er recommendation, except I used a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I =
couldn't manage a wooden spoon even after a lot of effort. May be I have to=
 order it... but I will have to work much hard to find a
 craft-man who can=
 make a spoon with wood.<BR><BR>I burnt the fire with mango-wood and jute-s=
ticks.<BR><BR>Purnahuti with ghee only.<BR><BR>That WAS the problem. Soon a=
fter starting the fire, I had an idea how fast the woods were burning. So w=
hile I was moving with the homam, I knew that with a big stream of ghee as =
a purnahuti, the fire will not survive long to allow me meditate even 5 min=
s. Because the woods were burning out fast.<BR><BR>So I could not meditate.=
<BR><BR>My first Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can I make the f=
ire last long so that it burns for at least 10 mins allowing me mediate? I =
noted even if I had put much wood, they would still burn out fast...<BR><BR=
>Offering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing that would keep th=
e fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.<BR><BR>Another Q. - 2) I h=
ave sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I can dry them=
 no matter how long it takes, so that I can use

 was not 100% strong. Because, I =

ys because since I saw the power in
 it, I had to find what's the right way=
