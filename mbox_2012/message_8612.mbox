Dear Murali

I had the same question a few months ago when I started to get=
 interested in performing homam at home. But now I perform the homam regula=
rly exactly as descried in the manual by Mr PVR Narasimha Rao. 

My homa ku=
ndam is around 8 inches (each side) and I use dried coconut pieces (flakes =
about an inch long are better, you can simply cut the dried coconut halves =
with a simple knife to get these flakes) as offering. For the first time I =
have used gomay with ghee on each piece. These also cause NO smoke, nor any=
 unpleasant odor after the ceremony).

I control the fire with the amount o=
f dried coconut and ghee I offer in the fire. When the fire is subsiding I =
add a little piece of camphor (karpuram), some dried coconut powder and a d=
rop of ghee. Dropping the ghee directly on the flame seems to dampen it a l=
ittle. Adding a drop just to side of the fire seems to help spread it. Best=
 way is to try and learn. 

In summary, it seems just fine to do the homam =
in an apartment or other such closed spaces.

I hope this helps. Do not wai=
t, start doing it.
