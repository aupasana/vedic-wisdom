Aparna,

If you desire to see Divine thru physical senses, Kundalini awaken=
ing is the best way.

Recently I had undergone Kundalini awakening program =
(called Bhava Spandana) organized by Isha Yoga. Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev cond=
ucted the program and it was very powerful. During the course of Maha Deva =
meditation, one could see the Divine figures in his/ her ajna chakra. It wa=
s amazing experience. After Kundalini awakening, I am not the old I :). 

I=
f you have difficulty for self-realization or Enlightenment in other paths,=
 then Yoga is the way for your Enlightenment. This is the first sentence of=
 the Yoga Sutras written by Patanjali. This has proved to be absolutely cor=
rect in my case. 

Good Luck

Shankar

i (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and especially of Purascharana (repeat=
