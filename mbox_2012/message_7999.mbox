I wrote, Indradi devatas would be summoned on Brahma Hatyaif they had kille=
d Dadichi and taken away the bones. Your point of discussion about Ashwini =
Kumaras and Haya Shira stories is prior to this incident.=A0

Basic rule of=
 Medical science says that one body cannot accept the parts of another one.=
 There are lot of medical practitioners who had understood & experienced th=
is fact. Even though you operate and stitch a Kidney or heart, the body wil=
l always be resisting to the external organ. Donated blood will be rejected=
 in terms of Urine, swet and other excretions within some days. Lot of fore=
ign civilizations knew this fact and they never take other body remains. So=
 you can see in http://www.noblood.org/medical-conditions-treatments/6478-o=
pen-heart-surgery-without-blood-can-done-routinely

Every day this modern s=
cience gives new statements. First they say that external blood supply is m=
andatory in case of blood loss. Then they only warn about the un healthy, c=
ontamination, uselessness of stored blood after some hours etc., Science do=
esn't believes in Paapa, Punya. Then why they used the concept of "Daana" i=
n the name of blood donation and advertised it as a work that gives Punya! =



Only in certain processes like in reproduction, there will be mixture of=
 2 different materials, but body nourishes it as a separate wing and reprod=
uces offspring. Eye donation is another corruption. Cornea which is the out=
er lens of the Eye can only be made fit to a person having Cornea damage. T=
hat too the sizes should match. Its not true that all the eyes which has be=
en donated has been used and a blind got the sight. There are very rare cas=
es who get blindness due to Cornea damage. Just make a trip around Blind sc=
hools & eye banks to understand the actual statistics of blind getting visi=
on!! Cornea transplantation is just like fixing eye lens that we use nowada=
ys. But in the future there may be syntho-organic material that replaces hu=
man donated cornea. 


Remember that any of your organ is not useful if it =
is given to others. Either it will be thrown out after some time by storing=
 banks or its rejected by body after some time.


Its foreign missionaries =
who familiarized this kind of transfusions.=A0 Their science is just a baby=
 stepping now. But our seers had much better vision behind every word & inv=
entions.=A0

Animals also die, decay & perish. Its soul goes according to i=
ts karma. But we are men, not pashu. My suggestion is for the people who be=
lieve and practice Sanatana Bhatiya Dharma and its rituals. Why body is mad=
e into ashes including a detailed proceducre of Shava Samskara with medicin=
al plants, fire and mantras? Why uttara shodasha karma is done such that th=
e worldly desires of atma is seperated, soul is given a divya sharira, sent=
 to pitru lokha and only the daivika part of atma is kept for the welfare o=
f the family and worshipped every yver in terms of Shradda Prakriya? In eac=
h and every part of these rituals there will be a separation of bodily elem=
ents and -ve energies attached to soul such that it shouldn't contact the l=
iving humans or other creatures. Till what level we do this? We wont leave =
ash also. It will be made floated it some of Punya Teertas like Ganga, Yamu=
na, Godavari etc., There is in depth Genetic level explanation hidden in al=
l
 these practices.
