Namaste Narasimha Ji

Could you name us a few such books through which I ca=
n know more about performing homam.

Thanks

ra





  Namaste,

  Dhenu and surabhi both mean cow. So they are the same=
. In Sanskrit, it is common to describe the same thing by multiple names th=
at are synonyms.

  Honestly, I am not an authority on mudras. I learnt dhe=
nu mudra from a homam book that said the thumbs should be touching. But, wh=
en I search on internet now, I find both the ways, i.e. thumbs touching and=
 not touching. Some people seem to make it without thumbs touching also.

 =
 I am not 100% sure. But I will stick to the book I learnt from, as it fini=
shes a few important circuits.

  BTW, while searching on the internet, I f=
ound an interesting website on mudras. Though it doesn't have all the mudra=
s used in homam, it has some interesting mudras that can be useful for solv=
ing health problems. The descriptions and analysis makes sense to me based =
on my understanding of elements, fingers etc. The gentleman seems like a ge=
nuine and knowledgeable person. People may want to check out this website:
=

  http://mudravigyan.com/Mudra.html

  It also has an interesting analysis=
 of dhenu mudras (it also shows with thumbs touching BTW).

  Thanks,
  Nar=
asimha
