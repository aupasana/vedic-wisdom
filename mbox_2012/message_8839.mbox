>From astronomical references in ancient Hindu scriptures, scholars have bee=
n able to correctly ascertain the dates of the authors. The scientific know=
ledge of the rishis was very great; in the KAUSHITAKI BRAHMANA we find prec=
ise astronomical passages which show that in 3100 B.C. the Hindus were far =
advanced in astronomy, which had a practical value in determining the auspi=
cious times for astrological ceremonies. 

In an article in EAST;WEST, Febr=
uary, 1934, the following summary is given of the JYOTISH or body of Vedic =
astronomical treatises: "It contains the scientific lore which kept India a=
t the forefront of all ancient nations and made her the mecca of seekers af=
ter knowledge. The very ancient BRAHMAGUPTA, one of the JYOTISH works, is a=
n astronomical treatise dealing with such matters as the heliocentric motio=
n of the planetary bodies in our solar system, the obliquity of the eclipti=
c, the earth's spherical form, the reflected light of the moon, the earth's=
 daily axial revolution, the presence of fixed stars in the Milky Way, the =
law of gravitation, and other scientific facts which did not dawn in the We=
stern world until the time of Copernicus and Newton."

It is now well;known=
 that the so;called "Arabic numerals," without whose symbols advanced mathe=
matics is difficult, came to Europe in the 9th century, via the Arabs, from=
 India, where that system of notation had been anciently formulated. Furthe=
r light on India's vast scientific heritage will be found in Dr. P. C. Ray'=
s HISTORY OF HINDU CHEMISTRY, and in Dr. B. N. Seal's POSITIVE SCIENCES OF =
THE ANCIENT HINDUS.
