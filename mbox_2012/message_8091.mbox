Hello,
Living outside India and following Santana Dhrama brings different s=
ort of problems. Once I was doing aarti with handbell ringing in my prayer =
room when some body climbed on my first floor window to see what I was doin=
g.=A0
Luckily I did not go out to see as there were several youths standing=
 and it might have turned it to sad situation.
I stopped using that hand be=
ll and purchased a new bell. Up to few years back when my mother's health w=
as good she would do purnimavrat and in the evening do the aarti after doin=
g katha. I would ring the hand bell but was always alert. Over the years we=
 have experienced a lot of aggression but saved by the Grace of Divine Moth=
er.What really can you do ??
Tanvirbhai seems to have some sort of special =
inner wisdom as he went to India just to learn about haven. It is such a bi=
g thing and now he is doing haven on a regular basis. Sooner or later his n=
eighbours or friend will learn what he is doing. Only time will tell what w=
ill then happen.
When I was living in Vrindavan I heard =A0a Swamiji tellin=
g a story. It seems a Muslim man was having a land dispute with Swamiji's a=
shram or some neighbour and there was some court case. One day Swamiji met =
this man in the street and they were talking about this dispute. This man s=
aid, I am a true Muslim and I have plenty of money and I could go to anothe=
r town easily. Then he pointed towards one of the main Temple and said I do=
 not want to leave HIM and I want to stay with HIM here in Vrindavan and th=
en he started to cry.

JadooVo Jo Ser Per Char Kar Bole

Thanks
LaxmiNaraya=
n

NamasteBiswaji,

All I meant was it is hard to perform hi=

ees do homams even in muslim land, that's all, there's no talk of discrimin=
ation here. 


With due respect may I request you to not draw harsh conclus=
ions without clarification. My mere intention was to help that's all. 


I =
realize, while writing even though intentions are good if words are not fra=
med properly it can cause negativity in people's mind. I shall refrain myse=
lf from posting further.=A0 


My apologies if anyone else's sentiments hav=
e been hurted too.=A0
Good luck to all !!


Thank you,
Priya

Dear TanvirJi,

I can add some usef=
ul information on this regard....

1. In India, we kept the mature coconut =
in a dry place... over the time(3 to 6 months) the outside skin of the coco=
nut becomes dry...

2. Full coconut(with skin) resembles the human head, bu=
rning the full coconut resembles the burning of our ego(I-ness)

3. When th=
e "homamkunda" is big enough could burn a full coconut comfortably with woo=
d log... In a small "homamkunda"... its really adventurious! :) simply... i=
t would not burn...

4. Whether dry or not, the coconut slice should burn b=
eautifully with wood log and enough ghee...

Best of luck...

*** "Its amaz=
ing how god makes his devotees do homams even in muslim land" ***

PriyaJi,=
 it hurts me... all we are the child of god! all path ends towords god! if =
the muslim world exist... then there must be some intention of mother! afte=
r all... its her universe...

their own tradition. They are not a modern researcher like you [NarasimhaJi=

 so much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced=
 coconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will no=

 feel not strong enough for big spiritual or material effects. I have had v=

 a few times I *arranged* homams for others and I always directly felt a st=
rong effect working on me also.
> 
> Today with the homam, the effect was n=
ot that strong. I know why, because it was a super-short homam, with many m=
antras left. Also, I should honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesh=
a and Lord Shani Deva in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Bec=
ause, I was worried and nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% f=
ocus on their presence. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.
=

> I am going to add mantras from the main homam soon, common mantras whi=
ch are needed in all homams like Anugya, KalashaSuddhi, Agni Deva prayer et=
c. Also I guess Avahana-related Sanskrit mantras are very important.

rings with the smallest Shani mantra again.

homam. I was pretty nervous about the possibility. Because long back in 200=
2-2003 when I started mantras, almost everyday I faced negative energies fo=
r the imperfection of pronunciation and procedures. Sometimes the negatives=
 were so strong. But I didn't give up and tried to understand the correct w=
ays because since I saw the power in it, I had to find what's the right way=
 to get the pure blessings, avoiding mistakes.

this 100% true from my mantra japam experience. Though no website or almost=
 no one instructed me to stay empty stomached in japam, I found that mantra=
s work very strong with empty stomach. Also, I always got strong negative e=
ffects when I did japam after my dinner. Thus, I learned this from my own e=
xperience but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong practices I did]=
! Now days, I can't eat anything after my lunch... because I do mantras in =
the evening. At times it becomes very difficult not to eat something as I s=

I can add some useful information on this reg=
ard....<br>
<br>
1. In India, we kept the mature coconut in a dry place... =
over the time(3 to 6 months) the outside skin of the coconut becomes dry...=
<br>
<br>
2. Full coconut(with skin) resembles the human head, burning the =
full coconut resembles the burning of our ego(I-<span id=3D"misspell-38" cl=
ass=3D"mark">ness</span>)<br>
<br>
3. When the "<span id=3D"misspell-39" cl=
ass=3D"mark">homam</span> <span id=3D"misspell-40" class=3D"mark">kunda</sp=
an>" is big enough could burn a full coconut comfortably with wood log... I=
n a small "<span id=3D"misspell-41" class=3D"mark">homam</span> <span id=3D=
"misspell-42" class=3D"mark">kunda</span>"... its really <span id=3D"misspe=
ll-43" class=3D"mark">adventurious</span>! :) simply... it would not burn..=
.<br>
<br>
4. Whether dry or not, the coconut slice should burn beautifully=
 with wood log and enough ghee...<br>
<br>
Best of luck...<br>

note, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a <span id=3D"mis=
spell-66" class=3D"mark">Brahmin</span> family for about 10 days and the ON=
LY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing <span id=3D"misspell-67" class=3D=
"mark">homam</span>! However I was disappoint because their procedure was s=
o big that it would take about 3 hours for the <span id=3D"misspell-68" cla=
ss=3D"mark">homam</span>, and many more materials also. Of course, they lea=
rnt it from 'guru-<span id=3D"misspell-69" class=3D"mark">kulam</span>' and=
 it was their own tradition. They are not a modern researcher like you [<sp=
an id=3D"misspell-70" class=3D"mark">Narasimha</span> <span id=3D"misspell-=
71" class=3D"mark">Ji</span>] who could compare many traditions, research o=
n them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had no idea that a sh=
orter version is possible, or something can be left out. As an example, the=
y suggested a <span id=3D"misspell-72" class=3D"mark">mantadory</span>
 <sp=
an id=3D"misspell-73" class=3D"mark">japam</span> of 10x times before I do =
an 'x' times offering in <span id=3D"misspell-74" class=3D"mark">homam</spa=

I would never have so much materials needed, and I would not be able to per=

 Offering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing that would keep th=

. but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rot=

day with the <span id=3D"misspell-89" class=3D"mark">homam</span>, the effe=

 I should honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani D=
eva in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worrie=
d and nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their pres=

 I am going to add mantras from the main <span id=3D"misspell-91" class=3D"=
