Thanks PVR Garu,

I'd look for these books then. They don't seem to be 'in stock' on online
stores.

Initiated or non-initiated - given by guru or not... I'd just want to learn
the science of it! May be if I don't get Moksha this time.. I am sure I'd
not have to start from scratch in next life. ;-)

Swasti!
Ujjwal
