Yes Indeed Rajarashi! Parameters of Judgement is vital. Viveka-Budhhi is re=
quired as to what should be those parameteres and what should not be.

[[An=
d the only parameters of judgement is to objectively see what changes are h=
appening in our surface, day-to-day consciousness.That is are we less angry=
, more equanimous, etc etc.
]]

I myself strongly believe in this. what is =
happening inside heart & Mind is of real importance to guage the evolvement=
 of one's existance. Reduction in anger, lust, greed, arrogance, pretence, =
attachment, jealousy, fear, desires etc... should be judged by oneself to s=
ee if one is in the right direction or strayed over a period of time.

[[
T=
he field of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some o=
f it can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself=
.
]]

I myself is not qualified to say anything as i have no such experienc=
es. However, I am very clear that such experiences or no such experiences, =
the most important is what is happening inside as described earlier.

and t=
he below sounds true! very true!

[[In a nutshell, a genuine "experience" i=
s good and authentic only to the extent that it helps to modify and transfo=
rm your waking surface personality. That is the only true test. Rest all th=
e range of experiences that come from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis g=
et experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound and fury without substa=
nce.]]

Utpal
