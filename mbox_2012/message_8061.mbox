Namaste

I agree completely. Arjuna is held in great respect at other place=
s as well. The whole Kshetra of Badrinath is known as the Nara -Narayana ks=
hetra. Arjuna is the Mahamuni Nara who meditated at the same spot.

One can=
not and should not attempt to determine the state of mind of such a giant b=
ased on a few intrepreted principles.

:) In what way would it help the spi=
ritual development of any other person to measure one's progress using the =
supposed actions of some spiritual giant in another century.Also the story =
gets distorted with time.Like Ajit ji said " Only a Jivanmukta can recogniz=
e a Jivanmukta".
