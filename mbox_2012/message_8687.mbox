=C2=A0Namaste,

I have a slightly different view. Aham Brahmasmi - the fa=
mous Mahavakya is true, but with riders. One can become God in essence, but=
 never in Power. And that makes a difference. Just like a water in a glass =
and water in the ocean may have the same fundamental chemical composition -=
 H2O - but the water in a glass cannot create a Tsunami, nor support a whol=
e wide and complex ecosystem of organisms from microscopic to the gigantic,=
 like an ocean does. That is a big difference.

A man through penances can =
eventually become a man of god, or godly, not never God. This viewpoint exp=
lains why for example Krishna is an Avatara, and considered a perfection pe=
rsonified incarnation of God. 

Ramakrishna used to say, everybody is the D=
ivine Mother's essence, but not every one has the same amount of Shakti fro=
m the Divine Mother! He made this statement when he met a great reformist I=
shwar Chandra Vidyasagar.

-Regards

Namaste all,

Recently, I was party to a conversat=
ion regarding an avatAr's supremacy over rishi and yOgi/jnAni. My mental af=
filiations are closer to the yOga and advaita-vEdAnta philosophies (needles=
s to mention, the way I understand them). So far, based on my affiliations =
and understanding, I'm of the opinion that a Realized Being (however he may=
 have realized) is Divine in all its absoluteness (i.e. nothing distinguish=
es them from The Divinity). The way I understand 'tat tvam asi', mOksha, At=
ma sAkshAtkAra, yOga, kaivalya, nirvANa etc. 

While their prarabdha may ha=
ve been different, once they are realized there is nothing that distinguish=
es them from what we call the Ultimate Divinity. So by logical extension, a=
n avatAr is just the re-incarnation of any Realized Being irrespective of t=
hat Being having attained to the Highest in 1 life, 10 lives, 100 lives or =
even a billion lives. Once they are Realized, their coming back in a future=
 life is based on absolute free will and not by kArmic vAsanAs that draw th=
em to a womb. In a nutshell, I saw no reason to distinguish between Divine =
Descending (as an avatAr) vs. Man Ascending (as a Realized Being). I was al=
so forceful in the conversation that the entire Manifest Existence is Divin=
e Descending and used that rationale to further fortify my position that if=
 we discount effects of prArabdha/sanchita, a Human Ascended yOgi/jnAni can=
(if willing) be as omnipotent/omniscient as a Divine Descended avatAr. The =
conversation ended with not much
 conclusion. 

The last few days, I had be=
en revisiting this within myself a few times - specifically the rationale f=
or such classification in the below three eras. I'd like to hear from the m=
embers on this forum regarding their understanding of an avatAr, rishi, jnA=
ni/yOgi etc. Please do mention the 'religious/spiritual tradition' you subs=
cribe to, if possible. 

Ramayana Era - rAma/paraSu rAma (avatAr), vaSishTa=
/viSvAmitra/agastya (rishis), janaka/ashtAvakra/yAjnavalkya/rishyaSringa (j=
nAnis/yOgis)

20th Century - Shirdi Sai (avatAr), r=

PS: I did ignore all bhaktas and many others who could fall in the ab=
ove categories. I just quoted one/two in each as that suffices the subject =
of the discussion. Please don't take the discussion towards why some one el=
se not mentioned here is or is not an avatAr/rishi/jnAi/yOgi etc.
