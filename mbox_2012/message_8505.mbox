Namaste,

Dried Cowdung caks are very auspiscious to offer in Homam fire.

=
check this message from archives wherein it is mentioned thus: "BTW, you ca=
n also burn dried cowdung cakes/strips (see http://www.agnihotrasupplies.co=
m to buy them in US). Cowdung is auspicious to burn in homam."

http://grou=
ps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/6291

I have used Cowdung cakes mys=
elf on occassions. It does create more smoke in comparision to Dry coconuts=
 and other offerings, however It does not create any bad smell.

Best Regar=
ds,

Utpal
