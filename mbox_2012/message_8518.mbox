Dear LaxmiNarayanji,

I would much like to do more japa of Mahamrityunjaya.=
 I currently do 3-5 repetitions after my sitting down japa every day. But I=
 admit it would be very challenging to do an extra half hour japa every day=
 this month, in addition to my current 45 min sit down japa practice- mainl=
y because of my continuously changing working hours, and lack of consistent=
 routine from week to week.  

However I will join you in your Mahamrityunj=
aya worship to the best of my ability. For the past few weeks, I have been =
thinking about doing a Mahamrityunjaya havan every week for my patients. Yo=
ur decision to do japa of this mantra has inspired me to take some action o=
n this. For the next 4 weeks, while you are doing your japa, I will do Maha=
mrityunjaya havan every weekend- for the wellbeing of my patients and all b=
eings in general. 

In fact, I will make a start with this project this wee=
kend- tomorrow will be the first havan. This is a happy weekend for me in g=
eneral, because I will complete 250,000 repetitions of Om Namo Narayanaya t=
oday- I will be doing a Vishnu havan after this today to celebrate. 

Thank=
s for the inspiration LakshmiNarayanji. :) Please keep us updated on your p=
lans with the Mahamrityunjaya japa....hope it goes well.

Take care,

Aparn=
a
