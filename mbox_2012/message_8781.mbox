Namaste,

Your mail reminded me of a quotation from Swami Sivnanda that I h=
ad read. "Make everything into a sadhana". Golden words!

Doing japa all th=
e time itself is a fine sadhana. Why should there be a harm in it? At the m=
inimum, it will keep purifying your koshas and that have their own great ad=
vantages in sadhana. Eventually the mantra will keep running inside you all=
 the time and yet you will be able to flawlessly perform your daily activit=
ies.


About Purushacharana, yes a certain no of repetations have to be don=
e for a mantra, then 1/10 of that given in Homa etc etc. All that is the te=
chnicality. But until one has done the first most crucial step, a purusacha=
rana will not succeed in the real sense.

Without a Purusa consciousness, a=
 purusacharana effort merely becomes a vehemently rajasik sadhana. At the e=
nd of it one gets one more layer of I-ness that I have done such and such s=
adhana, and also zero mantra-chaitanya comes to a person.. Mantra chaitanya=
 is a very rare things. The mantra will actually reveal itself in all the p=
lanes. It is the real effect of genuine purusacharana. Of course, mantra-ch=
aitanya can come through other methods too. Purusacharana is one method amo=
ng many.

In olden times when a person would *successfully* complete a cert=
ain Purusacharana, they would be conferred a higher level of abhisekh. Nowa=
days, frankly and mostly, all that happens in the name of Purusacharana in =
paramparas is by hook or crook just finish a prescribed number of japa/homa=
 and then be given a title and then feel happy and proud about it internall=
y. I have met some people like that. All have heavy titles attached to thei=
r names, this and that. It does not make the person genuinely spiritual at =
all, for the heart of the purusacharana practice has already been lost.


F=
or ordinary people like us, doing japa, as you mentioned below, more and mo=
re is very good. It purifies us. One can do it at all times, do it under th=
e breath. Eventually it can become a background process in your life. Moreo=
ver, when you do mindful japa, that is even superb. It is a meditation in i=
tself. It can be done even while moving and beauty of the mantra will keep =
tickling in. Not thinking of sadhana in technical terms and rather as a ser=
vice to ones Istha makes the japa even more powerful and beautiful.


Infac=
t, if we mindfully do every action - no doubt difficult initially - then li=
ke Swami Sivananda says, everything becomes an act of sadhana!

-Regards

Namaste Rajars=
hiji,

Thank you for the message....I found it very interesting.

I can acc=
ept that what you say about purascharana is true. I certainly cannot claim =
to have established this Purusha consciousness perfectly within myself. I a=
m therefore not doing a 'true' purascharana in the way you describe.

Based=
 on what I had previously read, I thought 'Purascharana' was a certain numb=
er of repetitions of the Name or Mantra of God, as a supplication or prayer=
, with proper feeling. Even this is difficult for me at times. Sometimes I =
say the mantra with feeling, sometimes with boredom (and checking the clock=
 to see when japa time will be over). Sometimes I barely manage to fit in t=
he number of malas I have set for myself in the day. Luckily, though God's =
grace, I am kind of on track, if only in terms of doing a certain number of=
 repetitions in a certain amount of time.

So basically, I guess I am not d=
oing Purascharana in the way you describe...I guess that I doing a japa pra=
ctice, that involves a certain number of repetitions in a certain period of=
 time.

I feel comforted by this practice, and feel it's the right thing fo=
r me to do. I feel one doesn't have to be qualified to do Japa....the Japa =
gives one all the qualifications that one lack's including proper devotion.=
 

Sivananda says that even mechanical repetition has some effect, though r=
epetition with feeling is ideal. This helps me to do japa, when my mind reb=
els saying "there is no feeling!"....I tell myself, some japa is better tha=
n no japa!

The way I mentally see my sadhana is:

1. Japa with some feelin=
g, devotion- Ideal
2. Japa with no feeling- Not ideal, but still better tha=
n no japa
3. No japa at all during the day- very bad. Worst case scenario. =
:)

Thanks for the information about Purascharana. I hope the Japa qualifie=
s me to do a true Purascharana one day. :)

Om Namo Narayanaya

Namaste Rajarshiji,=
<br>
<br>
Thank you for the message....I found it very interesting.<br>
<br=
>
I can accept that what you say about purascharana is true. I certainly ca=
nnot claim to have established this Purusha consciousness perfectly within =
myself. I am therefore not doing a 'true' purascharana in the way you descr=
ibe.<br>
<br>
Based on what I had previously read, I thought 'Purascharana'=
 was a certain number of repetitions of the Name or Mantra of God, as a sup=
plication or prayer, with proper feeling. Even this is difficult for me at =
times. Sometimes I say the mantra with feeling, sometimes with boredom (and=
 checking the clock to see when japa time will be over). Sometimes I barely=
 manage to fit in the number of malas I have set for myself in the day. Luc=
kily, though God's grace, I am kind of on track, if only in terms of doing =
a certain number of repetitions in a certain amount of time.<br>
<br>
So ba=
sically, I guess I am not doing Purascharana in the way you describe...I gu=
ess that I doing a japa practice, that involves a certain number of repetit=
ions in a certain period of time.<br>
<br>
I feel comforted by this practic=
e, and feel it's the right thing for me to do. I feel one doesn't have to b=
e qualified to do Japa....the Japa gives one all the qualifications that on=
e lack's including proper devotion. <br>
<br>
Sivananda says that even mech=
anical repetition has some effect, though repetition with feeling is ideal.=
 This helps me to do japa, when my mind rebels saying "there is no feeling!=
"....I tell myself, some japa is better than no japa!<br>
<br>
The way I me=
ntally see my sadhana is:<br>
<br>
1. Japa with some feeling, devotion- Ide=
al<br>
2. Japa with no feeling- Not ideal, but still better than no japa<br=
>
3. No japa at all during the day- very bad. Worst case scenario. :)<br>
<=
br>
Thanks for the information about Purascharana. I hope the Japa qualifie=
s me to do a true Purascharana one day. :)<br>
