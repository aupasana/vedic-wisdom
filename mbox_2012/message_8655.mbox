In his own words Aurobindo described his experience of Lord Krishna during =
his incarceration:

It seemed to me that He spoke to me again and said, "Th=
e bonds you had not the strength to break, I have broken for you, because i=
t is not my will nor was it ever my intention that that should continue. I =
have had another thing for you to do and it is for that I have brought you =
here, to teach you what you could not learn for yourself and to train you f=
or my work." Then He placed the Gita in my hands. His strength entered into=
 me and I was able to do the sadhana of the Gita. I was not only to underst=
and intellectually but to realise what Sri Krishna demanded of Arjuna and w=
hat He demands of those who aspire to do His work, to be free from repulsio=
n and desire, to do work for Him without the demand for fruit, to renounce =
self-will and become a passive and faithful instrument in His hands, to hav=
e an equal heart for high and low, friend and opponent, success and failure=
, yet not to do His work negligently. I realised what the Hindu religion me=
ant. We speak often of the Hindu religion, of the Sanatan Dharma, but few o=
f us really know what that religion is. Other religions are preponderatingl=
y religions of faith and profession, but the Sanatan Dharma is life itself;=
 it is a thing that has not so much to be believed as lived. This is the Dh=
arma that for the salvation of humanity was cherished in the seclusion of t=
his peninsula from of old. It is to give this religion that India is rising=
. She does not rise as other countries do, for self or when she is strong, =
to trample on the weak. She is rising to shed the eternal light entrusted t=
o her over the world. India has always existed for humanity and not for her=
self and it is for humanity and not for herself that she must be great.

Th=
erefore this was the next thing He pointed out to me, =97 He made me realis=
e the central truth of the Hindu religion. He turned the hearts of my jailo=
rs to me and they spoke to the Englishman in charge of the jail, "He is suf=
fering in his confinement; let him at least walk outside his cell for half =
an hour in the morning and in the evening." So it was arranged, and it was =
while I was walking that His strength again entered into me. I looked the j=
ail that secluded me from men and it was no longer by its high walls that I=
 was imprisoned; no, it was Vasudeva who surrounded me. I walked under the =
branches of the tree in front of my cell but it was not the tree, I knew it=
 was Vasudeva, it was Sri Krishna whom I saw standing there and holding ove=
r me his shade. I looked at the bars of my cell, the very grating that did =
duty for a door and again I saw Vasudeva. It was Narayana who was guarding =
and standing sentry over me. Or I lay on the coarse blankets that were give=
n me for a couch and felt the arms of Sri Krishna around me, the arms of my=
 Friend and Lover. This was the first use of the deeper vision He gave me. =
I looked at the prisoners in the jail, the thieves, the murderers, the swin=
dlers, and as I looked at them I saw Vasudeva, it was Narayana whom I found=
 in these darkened souls and misused bodies. Amongst these thieves and daco=
its there were many who put me to shame by their sympathy, their kindness, =
the humanity triumphant over such adverse circumstances. One I saw among th=
em especially, who seemed to me a saint, a peasant of my nation who did not=
 know how to read and write, an alleged dacoit sentenced to ten years' rigo=
rous imprisonment, one of those whom we look down upon in our Pharisaical p=
ride of class as Chhotalok. Once more He spoke to me and said, "Behold the =
people among whom I have sent you to do a little of my work. This is the na=
ture of the nation I am raising up and the reason why I raise them."

When =
the case opened in the lower court and we were brought before the Magistrat=
e I was followed by the same insight. He said to me, "When you were cast in=
to jail, did not your heart fail and did you not cry out to me, where is Th=
y protection ? Look now at the Magistrate, look now at the Prosecuting Coun=
sel." I looked and it was not the Magistrate whom I saw, it was Vasudeva, i=
t was Narayana who was sitting there on the bench. I looked at the Prosecut=
ing Counsel and it was not the Counsel for the prosecution that I saw; it w=
as Sri Krishna who sat there, it was my Lover and Friend who sat there and =
smiled. "Now do you fear ?" He said, "I am in all men and I overrule their =
actions and their words. My protection is still with you and you shall not =
fear. This case which is brought against you, leave it in my hand. It is no=
t for you. It was not for the trial that I brought you here but for somethi=
ng else. The case itself is only a means for my work and nothing more." Aft=
erwards when the trial opened in the Sessions Court, I began to write many =
instructions for my Counsel as to what was false in the evidence against me=
 and on what points the witnesses might be cross-examined. Then something h=
appened which I had not expected. The arrangements which had been made for =
my defence were suddenly changed and another Counsel stood there to defend =
me. He came unexpectedly, =97 a friend of mine, but I did not know he was c=
oming. You have all heard the name of the man who put away from him all oth=
er thoughts and abandoned all his practice, who sat up half the night day a=
fter day for months and broke his health to save me, =97 Srijut Chittaranja=
n Das. When I saw him, I was satisfied, but I still thought it necessary to=
 write instructions. Then all that was put away from me and I had the messa=
ge from within, "This is the man who will save you from the snares put arou=
nd your feet. Put aside those papers. It is not you who will instruct him. =
I will instruct him." From that time I did not of myself speak a word to my=
 Counsel about the case or give a single instruction, and if ever I was ask=
ed a question, I always found that my answer did not help the case. I had l=
eft it to him and he took it entirely into his hands, with what result you =
know. I knew all along what He meant for me, for I heard it again and again=
, always I listened to the voice within; "I am guiding, therefore fear not.=
 Turn to your own work for which I have brought you to jail and when you co=
me out, remember never to fear, never to hesitate. Remember that it is I wh=
o am doing this, not you nor any other. Therefore whatever clouds may come,=
 whatever dangers and sufferings, whatever difficulties, whatever impossibi=
lities, there is nothing impossible, nothing difficult. I am in the nation =
and its uprising and I am Vasudeva, I am Narayana, and what I will, shall b=
e, not what others will. What I choose to bring about, no human power can s=
tay."
