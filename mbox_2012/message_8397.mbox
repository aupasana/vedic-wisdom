Hi Balayennannai ji,

I never thought I would actually ever enjoy listening=
 to Eminem, but I really did enjoy those two songs. Very intense lyrics, to=
 say the least.

Thanks :) To you and Somebody ji too...

Look forward to l=
earning about this extraordinary path.

Warm regards, 

Aparna

 once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Hari with it (it's not a perfe=

an't find any heart, I blame Durga for not giving me any! She gets a lot of=
 abuse from me I'm afraid, but as she made me, it's her own fault).
