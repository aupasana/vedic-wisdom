Than=
ks for the advice to chant till the cremation ground. Sound advice no doubt=
.

Unfortunately Durga is partial to some of her children it seems, and not=
 all of us are blessed with the intense desire to chant as you seem to be. =
Stop rubbing it in please. 

What is the use of asking us to chant more? As=
k her to give us this desire, as she seems to have done for you. 

Which br=
ings me to ranting a bit about the general injustice of our esteemed Durga.=
 The Atman is sexless, but the Atman in female form has been treated worse =
than the Atman in male form over the centuries...even today it is being mur=
dered in the womb (female foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes=
 it is deathless etc, but while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in=
 the form of women. I hasten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I'=
m furious with Durga. How outrageous that for centuries, and even today, wo=
men were not allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Godd=
ess). Why aren't there more women saints? The ratio of female to male saint=
s is probably 1:10. It's bloody disheartening. And what is the point of cov=
ering us with ignorance (it's her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then =
yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the scriptures). If sh=
e wants to save us, she will have to create in us the desire to do japa or =
whatever. I wash my hands of the whole thing.

So don't tell us to chant, t=
ell her to tell us to chant. Like she told you to. It's not our fault.

Ok =
rant over. I'm going to control my temper and do some Om Namo Narayanaya re=
petition now. Who knows when it's time for the cremation ground? You did it=
 for a select few, but not for the rest of us millions- Damn you Durga. 

A=
parna
