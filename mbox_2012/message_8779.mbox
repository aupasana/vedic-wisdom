Namaste,

Om Namah Narayanaya

<<
I agree we have to keep striving....'pers=
onal' effort has to 
continue...what a mahabharatha this inner fight is! De=
finitely need God 
as the charioteer for any chance of success.>>

Absolute=
ly! One huge Mahabharata of confusions, errors, failings, again getting up =
and trying, not stopping, changing the gunas of ones sadhana etc etc. Grace=
 is vital.

BUT, and here is a big cause, many times people mistake the wor=
kings of their own lower nature (Apara Prakriti) as some sort of grace. Thi=
s is nothing but an attempt by different parts - of below the surface of th=
e working mind -=C2=A0 to pull back the sadhana and hang on to the old pers=
onality.

The whole of sadhana, in a nutshell, is changing our, stupid, fla=
wed, ignorant surface personality. And once you do so, you WILL be forced t=
o renegotiate your old life-equations. But there is a lower prakirit in man=
 and nature as well, which works through the automated motions of our prana=
 shakti, that needs to be controlled. It has no light of God within it. Lig=
ht is knowledge. At the higher spiritual levels light and will are fused to=
gether. In our plane of existence light, that is correct knowledge, and wil=
l have become separated and distorted. Therefore often you may have the wil=
l to achieve to something but not the right knowledge needed for it. This l=
eads to confusions.

Anyway grace is product of true surrenderance from the=
 mind, from the deeper emotional being and the physical being. These also c=
orrespond to the consciousness working in manomaya-kosha, pranamaya-kosha a=
nd annamaya-kosha. Until this is reached, grace does not come, and even if =
it does, it gets perverted by our lower nature. In Gita Bhagawan calls it A=
para-Prakriti. 

It is one thing to say verbally that all sadhana being don=
e is work of God's Shakti. It is entirely different matter to see it clearl=
y for which one must a) surrender constantly b) reject and withdraw ones lo=
wer nature, or at least keep it clam and checked c) make a sincere call to =
God. Only when these three work together, grace descends. And only grace ha=
s the power to cause a thorough transformation of a sadhaka. Nothing less. =
But you can't demand grace, you can't beg for grace, you can't plead, you c=
an't command, and you can't indulge in self-pity. We have to calmly and pat=
iently wait for it for when the time is right, it calls like a sweet rain o=
n a parched throat, and in a flash it can do more than what we can imagine.=
 Basically, we cannot negotiate with God. Nothing less than a complete hone=
st recoking on what we are, where we are heading, what mistakes lie in our =
nature is a must.

Then slowly you will be made to realize the working of a=
 higher Power that has nothing to do with your little surface personalities=
 push and pulls based on Pavlovian responses to situations incurred over li=
fetimes. It is this Power, once understood, that needs to be unquestioningl=
y submitted to in a progressive manner, while rejecting everything else ins=
ide us that pull us in a different direction and wants to hang on to our ea=
rlier flawed personality. Long, long, long road. Patience is a key.

*=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

A few general thoughts on Purusacharana since th=
ere were a few mails on this topic. Again, just my opinion. Feel free to re=
ject it if needed.

Start with the word. Purusha+acharana. Behaving like a =
man. And what does it mean? Some may say it means being brave, being mental=
ly robust, being aggressive, or being commanding etc. All these are terms t=
hat are often used in colloquial language to indicate a proverbial 'manly' =
behavior. But in sadhana, Purusha is a different concept. Looking inwards a=
nd separating a part of your being, from the mind, from your thoughts, from=
 your emotions, and even from your physcial nature. This part of your being=
 will only stand back and watch, as silent witness, and then either give or=
 reject consent to various movements of your lower nature (lust, anger, jea=
lousy, greed, covetousness, ETC). Once this is firmly installed in your sys=
tem - this Purusha - it will be able to stop and clam down various parts of=
 your being which have the tendency to leap-up in joy (sukha) or get deflat=
ed (dukhkha) at surface appearances and shallow understandings. This is how=
 a Purusha
 works in Yoga. When this kind of Purusha consciounsess is insta=
lled and established, an expansion of the mind happens beyond the rational,=
 the emotional or even the physical nature/consciousness.

After this basic=
 step has been done properly, then the sadhana of purushacharana is to be d=
one. By this method, a progressive 1/10 numerical deduction in the sadhana =
is done for each element. That is for 1000 japas, 100 homas, 10 tarpana, 1 =
marjana and finally feeding people. Each of this will affect a realization =
of the mantra is each of the layers - in reverse order from annamaya-kosha,=
 to pranamaya-kosha, to manomaya-kosha to vigyanmaya-kosha (the spiritual l=
ayers beyond and above the reasoning mind). THAT is the perfect effect of a=
 spotless purushacharana. That is mantra siddhi and mantra chaitanya.

Whil=
e doing a purushacharana, tremenodus amount of obstacles will come in the p=
ath of the sadhaka. To overcome these, while sticking to the exacting rules=
 of the sadhana, one MUST have done the first step properly, that is instal=
led a Purusha consciousness in his/her system, one that is unshakeable in a=
ny adverse conditions. One that is perfectly unmoved by the working of the =
lower nature in man as well as outside man. For example, one may get affect=
ed by high fever, various crisis situations, various attacks from hostile f=
orces etc etc, Many things. But inspite of that the Purusha consciouness, i=
f it has been firmly established, will drive the sadhana without a glitch, =
remaining unmoved. Of course, one must honestly judge how far such a consci=
ousness has been developed. Self-delusion has to be guarded against.

One c=
an try for oneself to do purushacharanas and see how far one succeeds. In m=
y opinion though, 98 % of seekers in this age are unfit to do purushacharan=
a and succeed in this sadhana. For the Purusha consciousness has not been e=
stablished in the system by most people. In the last 6 years among all vari=
eties of sadhakas I have met, of various paths, only two were there who I f=
elt can pull off a genuine purusacharana. Rest no chance.

Doing any sadhan=
a at the same time, same place, using same materials, without breaks for ye=
ars and years is always good. Goes without saying. This too, most people ca=
nnot do flawlessly. Purushacharana is far more complex and demanding. 

The=
n the other option is to develop genuine surrender from the deepest part of=
 your heart. Do sadhana, and wait patiently. Her grace is bound to come and=
 illuminate the path. Meanhile, we can keep working on rectifying the lower=
 nature in ourselves.

Jai Ma Tara.

-Regards

jarshiji,

That is a very interesting way of looking at a yantra. I didn't =
know that before....thanks! I think most of us would agree with your mail, =
that spiritual success depends on personal effort and God's grace.

As an a=
side, it really does feel that our 'personal' effort is also the Grace of G=

 not to work hard on ourselves.

I agree we have to keep striving....'perso=

nitely need God as the charioteer for any chance of success.

      <div>Namaste Rajarshiji,<br>
<br>
That is a very interesting=
 way of looking at a yantra. I didn't know that before....thanks! I think m=
ost of us would agree with your mail, that spiritual success depends on per=
sonal effort and God's grace.<br>
<br>
As an aside, it really does feel tha=
t our 'personal' effort is also the Grace of God..! This is an age old stat=
ement....but of course, not meant as an excuse not to work hard on ourselve=
s.<br>
<br>
I agree we have to keep striving....'personal' effort has to co=
ntinue...what a mahabharatha this inner fight is! Definitely need God as th=
e charioteer for any chance of success.<br>

 One honest question that every sadhaka must ask himself/herself objectivel=
y is, how badly do we want God? If the desire pure and unblemished, or is i=
t also mixed with various other desires, however small they maybe. If we al=
so want other materialistic things along with it - and there is no harm in =
wanting legitimate things - then one can follow all instructions and rules =
set for whatever parampara one is mentally afflicted to and given by his/he=
r Guru(s). <br>
> <br>
> But if one is desirous of ONLY God without a=
ny other desire attached to it, no rule is sufficient, no path is a guarant=
ee, no sadhana is sure-shot way to achieve it.=C3=82  Working on inter=
nal surrender to God and increased detachment in daily life along with and =
through whatever ritual one performs and in whatever manner, can be more he=
lpful in the long run. Human aspiration alone is not enough. When the aspir=
ation is genuine and pure, He/She extends his/her energy to lift the sadhak=
 up.. this dual phenomenon together make a sadhana success. And this simple=
 yet powerful truth is represented by the six-pointed triangle which is the=
 basic yantra of so many deities, and specially one form of the Mother. The=
 upward triangle is our aspiration, the downward is Her grace coming down t=
o transform the sadhak from his/her current state. Together, it makes a com=
plete whole. And grace is purely proportional to the purity of the aspirati=
on, which only God can
