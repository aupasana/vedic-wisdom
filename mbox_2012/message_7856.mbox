Pranamam,
Sri Narasimha garu,=C2=A0
I've even got the similar question as U=
tpal.=C2=A0
So is the state 'Mukta' will mean that the person is no longer =
alive?=C2=A0Also, is the Jeevan Mukta's will attain :Mukti'?
I would assume=
 the answer for Utpal's 2nd question would be that Jeevan Mukta's will cont=
inue to guide people in this world (carrying the will of god) to attain the=
 appropriate states or atleast embark on the path.

    =
  Namaste,



I have gone through both of your postings thoroughly. I have =
a question. Not on your explanation of jeevan Mukta but utility of a jeevan=
 Mukta.



Jeevan Mukta is the one whose chittas is completely emptied and =
there is no conditioning left.

1)Does it mean that a jeevan Mukta would no=
t re-incarnate with a new body after the old body is dropped-off?



2) If =
the above answer is Yes, then what would be the purpose of Indentifying wit=
h new body? In other words, if there is no conditioning left, what purpose =
a jeevan Mukta would serve in the objective world?



I do nit know if i wa=
s clear enough to explain what i want to ask you.



Utpal

<p>Namaste,<br>
<br>
I have gone through both of your postings thoroughly. =
I have a question. Not on your explanation of jeevan Mukta but utility of a=
 jeevan Mukta.<br>
<br>
Jeevan Mukta is the one whose chittas is completely=
 emptied and there is no conditioning left.<br>
1)Does it mean that a jeeva=
n Mukta would not re-incarnate with a new body after the old body is droppe=
d-off?<br>
<br>
2) If the above answer is Yes, then what would be the purpo=
se of Indentifying with new body? In other words, if there is no conditioni=
ng left, what purpose a jeevan Mukta would serve in the objective world?<br=

<br>
I do nit know if i was clear enough to explain what i want to ask yo=
u.<br>
