Extracts from "Autobiography of a Yogi" by Paramhamsa Yogananda

CHAPTER 33=
. BABAJI, THE YOGI−CHRIST OF MODERN INDIA 

The northern Himalayan cr=
ags near Badrinarayan are still blessed by the living presence of Babaji, g=
uru of
Lahiri Mahasaya. The secluded master has retained his physical form =
for centuries, perhaps for millenniums.
The deathless Babaji is an AVATARA.=
 This Sanskrit word means "descent"; its roots are AVA, "down," and
TRI, "t=
o pass." In the Hindu scriptures, AVATARA signifies the descent of Divinity=
 into flesh.
"Babaji's spiritual state is beyond human comprehension," Sri =
Yukteswar explained to me. "The dwarfed
vision of men cannot pierce to his =
transcendental star. One attempts in vain even to picture the avatar's
atta=
inment. It is inconceivable."
The UPANISHADS have minutely classified every=
 stage of spiritual advancement. A SIDDHA ("perfected
being") has progresse=
d from the state of a JIVANMUKTA ("freed while living") to that of a PARAMU=
KTA
("supremely free"−full power over death); the latter has complete=
ly escaped from the mayic thralldom and its
reincarnational round. The PARA=
MUKTA therefore seldom returns to a physical body; if he does, he is an
ava=
tar, a divinely appointed medium of supernal blessings on the world.
An ava=
tar is unsubject to the universal economy; his pure body, visible as a ligh=
t image, is free from any debt
to nature. The casual gaze may see nothing e=
xtraordinary in an avatar's form but it casts no shadow nor makes
any footp=
rint on the ground. These are outward symbolic proofs of an inward lack of =
darkness and material
bondage. Such a God−man alone knows the Truth b=
ehind the relativities of life and death. Omar Khayyam, so
grossly misunder=
stood, sang of this liberated man in his immortal scripture, the RUBAIYAT:
=
"Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane, The Moon of Heav'n is rising o=
nce again; How oft hereafter
rising shall she look Through this same Garden=
 after me−in vain!"
The "Moon of Delight" is God, eternal Polaris, an=
achronous never. The "Moon of Heav'n" is the outward
cosmos, fettered to th=
e law of periodic recurrence. Its chains had been dissolved forever by the =
Persian seer
through his self−realization. "How oft hereafter rising =
shall she look . . . after me−in vain!" What frustration
of search by=
 a frantic universe for an absolute omission!
Christ expressed his freedom =
in another way: "And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I wi=
ll
follow thee whithersoever thou goest. And Jesus saith unto him, The foxe=
s have holes, and the birds of the air
have nests; but the Son of man hath =
not where to lay his head." {FN33−1}
Spacious with omnipresence, coul=
d Christ indeed be followed except in the overarching Spirit?
Krishna, Rama=
, Buddha, and Patanjali were among the ancient Indian avatars. A considerab=
le poetic literature
in Tamil has grown up around Agastya, a South Indian a=
vatar. He worked many miracles during the centuries
preceding and following=
 the Christian era, and is credited with retaining his physical form even t=
o this day.
Babaji's mission in India has been to assist prophets in carryi=
ng out their special dispensations. He thus
qualifies for the scriptural cl=
assification of MAHAVATAR (Great Avatar). He has stated that he gave yoga
i=
nitiation to Shankara, ancient founder of the Swami Order, and to Kabir, fa=
mous medieval saint. His chief
nineteenth−century disciple was, as we=
 know, Lahiri Mahasaya, revivalist of the lost KRIYA art.
[Illustration: BA=
BAJI, THE MAHAVATAR, Guru of Lahiri Mahasaya, I have helped an artist to dr=
aw a true
likeness of the great Yogi−Christ of modern India.=97see ba=
baji.jpg]

The MAHAVATAR is in constant communion with Christ; together the=
y send out vibrations of redemption,
and have planned the spiritual techniq=
ue of salvation for this age. The work of these two fully−illumined
m=
asters−one with the body, and one without it−is to inspire the =
nations to forsake suicidal wars, race hatreds,
religious sectarianism, and=
 the boomerang−evils of materialism. Babaji is well aware of the tren=
d of modern
times, especially of the influence and complexities of Western =
civilization, and realizes the necessity of
spreading the self−libera=
tions of yoga equally in the West and in the East.
That there is no histori=
cal reference to Babaji need not surprise us. The great guru has never open=
ly appeared
in any century; the misinterpreting glare of publicity has no p=
lace in his millennial plans. Like the Creator, the
sole but silent Power, =
Babaji works in a humble obscurity.
Great prophets like Christ and Krishna =
come to earth for a specific and spectacular purpose; they depart as
soon a=
s it is accomplished. Other avatars, like Babaji, undertake work which is c=
oncerned more with the slow
evolutionary progress of man during the centuri=
es than with any one outstanding event of history. Such
masters always veil=
 themselves from the gross public gaze, and have the power to become invisi=
ble at will.
For these reasons, and because they generally instruct their d=
isciples to maintain silence about them, a number
of towering spiritual fig=
ures remain world−unknown. I give in these pages on Babaji merely a h=
int of his
life−only a few facts which he deems it fit and helpful to=
 be publicly imparted.
No limiting facts about Babaji's family or birthplac=
e, dear to the annalist's heart, have ever been discovered.
His speech is g=
enerally in Hindi, but he converses easily in any language. He has adopted =
the simple name of
Babaji (revered father); other titles of respect given h=
im by Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples are Mahamuni Babaji
Maharaj (supreme ecst=
atic saint), Maha Yogi (greatest of yogis), Trambak Baba and Shiva Baba (ti=
tles of
avatars of Shiva). Does it matter that we know not the patronymic o=
f an earth−released master?
"Whenever anyone utters with reverence th=
e name of Babaji," Lahiri Mahasaya said, "that devotee attracts an
instant =
spiritual blessing."
The deathless guru bears no marks of age on his body; =
he appears to be no more than a youth of twenty−five.
Fair−skin=
ned, of medium build and height, Babaji's beautiful, strong body radiates a=
 perceptible glow. His
eyes are dark, calm, and tender; his long, lustrous =
hair is copper−colored. A very strange fact is that Babaji
bears an e=
xtraordinarily exact resemblance to his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya. The simil=
arity is so striking that,
in his later years, Lahiri Mahasaya might have p=
assed as the father of the youthful−looking Babaji.
Swami Kebalananda=
, my saintly Sanskrit tutor, spent some time with Babaji in the Himalayas.
=
"The peerless master moves with his group from place to place in the mounta=
ins," Kebalananda told me. "His
small band contains two highly advanced Ame=
rican disciples. After Babaji has been in one locality for some
time, he sa=
ys: 'DERA DANDA UTHAO.' ('Let us lift our camp and staff.') He carries a sy=
mbolic DANDA
(bamboo staff). His words are the signal for moving with his g=
roup instantaneously to another place. He does
not always employ this metho=
d of astral travel; sometimes he goes on foot from peak to peak.
"Babaji ca=
n be seen or recognized by others only when he so desires. He is known to h=
ave appeared in many
slightly different forms to various devotees−som=
etimes without beard and moustache, and sometimes with
them. As his undecay=
ing body requires no food, the master seldom eats. As a social courtesy to =
visiting
disciples, he occasionally accepts fruits, or rice cooked in milk =
and clarified butter.
"Two amazing incidents of Babaji's life are known to =
me," Kebalananda went on. "His disciples were sitting
one night around a hu=
ge fire which was blazing for a sacred Vedic ceremony. The master suddenly =
seized a
burning log and lightly struck the bare shoulder of a chela who wa=
s close to the fire.
"'Sir, how cruel!' Lahiri Mahasaya, who was present, m=
ade this remonstrance.
"'Would you rather have seen him burned to ashes bef=
ore your eyes, according to the decree of his past
karma?'
"With these word=
s Babaji placed his healing hand on the chela's disfigured shoulder. 'I hav=
e freed you tonight
from painful death. The karmic law has been satisfied t=
hrough your slight suffering by fire.'
"On another occasion Babaji's sacred=
 circle was disturbed by the arrival of a stranger. He had climbed with
ast=
onishing skill to the nearly inaccessible ledge near the camp of the master=
.
"'Sir, you must be the great Babaji.' The man's face was lit with inexpre=
ssible reverence. 'For months I have
pursued a ceaseless search for you amo=
ng these forbidding crags. I implore you to accept me as a disciple.'
"When=
 the great guru made no response, the man pointed to the rocky chasm at his=
 feet.
"'If you refuse me, I will jump from this mountain. Life has no furt=
her value if I cannot win your guidance to
the Divine.'
"'Jump then,' Babaj=
i said unemotionally. 'I cannot accept you in your present state of develop=
ment.'
"The man immediately hurled himself over the cliff. Babaji instructe=
d the shocked disciples to fetch the
stranger's body. When they returned wi=
th the mangled form, the master placed his divine hand on the dead
man. Lo!=
 he opened his eyes and prostrated himself humbly before the omnipotent one=
.
"'You are now ready for discipleship.' Babaji beamed lovingly on his resu=
rrected chela. 'You have
courageously passed a difficult test. Death shall =
not touch you again; now you are one of our immortal flock.'
Then he spoke =
his usual words of departure, 'DERA DANDA UTHAO'; the whole group vanished =
from the
mountain."
An avatar lives in the omnipresent Spirit; for him ther=
e is no distance inverse to the square. Only one reason,
therefore, can mot=
ivate Babaji in maintaining his physical form from century to century: the =
desire to furnish
humanity with a concrete example of its own possibilities=
. Were man never vouchsafed a glimpse of Divinity
in the flesh, he would re=
main oppressed by the heavy mayic delusion that he cannot transcend his mor=
tality.
Jesus knew from the beginning the sequence of his life; he passed t=
hrough each event not for himself, not
from any karmic compulsion, but sole=
ly for the upliftment of reflective human beings. His four
reporter−d=
isciples−Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John−recorded the ineffable d=
rama for the benefit of later
generations.
For Babaji, also, there is no re=
lativity of past, present, future; from the beginning he has known all phas=
es of
his life. Yet, accommodating himself to the limited understanding of =
men, he has played many acts of his
divine life in the presence of one or m=
ore witnesses. Thus it came about that a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya
was pr=
esent when Babaji deemed the time to be ripe for him to proclaim the possib=
ility of bodily immortality.
He uttered this promise before Ram Gopal Muzum=
dar, that it might finally become known for the inspiration
of other seekin=
g hearts. The great ones speak their words and participate in the seemingly=
 natural course of
events, solely for the good of man, even as Christ said:=
 "Father . . . I knew that thou hearest me always: but
BECAUSE OF THE PEOPL=
E WHICH STAND BY I SAID IT, that they may believe that thou hast sent me."
=
{FN33−2} During my visit at Ranbajpur with Ram Gopal, "the sleepless =
saint," {FN33−3} he related the
wondrous story of his first meeting w=
ith Babaji.
"I sometimes left my isolated cave to sit at Lahiri Mahasaya's =
feet in Benares," Ram Gopal told me. "One
midnight as I was silently medita=
ting in a group of his disciples, the master made a surprising request.
"'R=
am Gopal,' he said, 'go at once to the Dasasamedh bathing GHAT.'
"I soon re=
ached the secluded spot. The night was bright with moonlight and the glitte=
ring stars. After I had sat
in patient silence for awhile, my attention was=
 drawn to a huge stone slab near my feet. It rose gradually,
revealing an u=
nderground cave. As the stone remained balanced in some unknown manner, the=
 draped form of
a young and surpassingly lovely woman was levitated from th=
e cave high into the air. Surrounded by a soft
halo, she slowly descended i=
n front of me and stood motionless, steeped in an inner state of ecstasy. S=
he
finally stirred, and spoke gently.
"'I am Mataji, {FN33−4} the sis=
ter of Babaji. I have asked him and also Lahiri Mahasaya to come to my cave=

tonight to discuss a matter of great importance.'
"A nebulous light was ra=
pidly floating over the Ganges; the strange luminescence was reflected in t=
he opaque
waters. It approached nearer and nearer until, with a blinding fl=
ash, it appeared by the side of Mataji and
condensed itself instantly into =
the human form of Lahiri Mahasaya. He bowed humbly at the feet of the
woman=
 saint.
"Before I had recovered from my bewilderment, I was further wonders=
truck to behold a circling mass of
mystical light traveling in the sky. Des=
cending swiftly, the flaming whirlpool neared our group and
materialized it=
self into the body of a beautiful youth who, I understood at once, was Baba=
ji. He looked like
Lahiri Mahasaya, the only difference being that Babaji a=
ppeared much younger, and had long, bright hair.
"Lahiri Mahasaya, Mataji, =
and myself knelt at the guru's feet. An ethereal sensation of beatific glor=
y thrilled
every fiber of my being as I touched his divine flesh.
"'Blessed=
 sister,' Babaji said, 'I am intending to shed my form and plunge into the =
Infinite Current.'
"'I have already glimpsed your plan, beloved master. I w=
anted to discuss it with you tonight. Why should you
leave your body?' The =
glorious woman looked at him beseechingly.
"'What is the difference if I we=
ar a visible or invisible wave on the ocean of my Spirit?'
"Mataji replied =
with a quaint flash of wit. 'Deathless guru, if it makes no difference, the=
n please do not ever
relinquish your form.' {FN33−5}
"'Be it so,' Bab=
aji said solemnly. 'I will never leave my physical body. It will always rem=
ain visible to at least
a small number of people on this earth. The Lord ha=
s spoken His own wish through your lips.'
"As I listened in awe to the conv=
ersation between these exalted beings, the great guru turned to me with a
b=
enign gesture.
"'Fear not, Ram Gopal,' he said, 'you are blessed to be a wi=
tness at the scene of this immortal promise.'
"As the sweet melody of Babaj=
i's voice faded away, his form and that of Lahiri Mahasaya slowly levitated=
 and
moved backward over the Ganges. An aureole of dazzling light templed t=
heir bodies as they vanished into the
night sky. Mataji's form floated to t=
he cave and descended; the stone slab closed of itself, as if working on an=

invisible leverage.
"Infinitely inspired, I wended my way back to Lahiri M=
ahasaya's place. As I bowed before him in the early
dawn, my guru smiled at=
 me understandingly.
"'I am happy for you, Ram Gopal,' he said. 'The desire=
 of meeting Babaji and Mataji, which you have often
expressed to me, has fo=
und at last a sacred fulfillment.'
"My fellow disciples informed me that La=
hiri Mahasaya had not moved from his dais since early the
preceding evening=
.
"'He gave a wonderful discourse on immortality after you had left for the=
 Dasasamedh GHAT,' one of the
chelas told me. For the first time I fully re=
alized the truth in the scriptural verses which state that a man of
self=
722;realization can appear at different places in two or more bodies at the=
 same time.
"Lahiri Mahasaya later explained to me many metaphysical points=
 concerning the hidden divine plan for this
earth," Ram Gopal concluded. "B=
abaji has been chosen by God to remain in his body for the duration of this=

particular world cycle. Ages shall come and go=97still the deathless maste=
r, {FN33−6} beholding the drama of
the centuries, shall be present on=
 this stage terrestrial."
