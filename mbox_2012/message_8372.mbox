Hello, 
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 This letter is to cheer you up and i=
t is=A0a strange but true personal experience.
Divine Mother cares and prot=
ects her children all the time and also plays snakes and ladders and ludo w=
ith them. Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji is one of Dash MahaVidya and Her Swroop=
 is very difficult to look at for me. Her Appearence Day Tithi has just gon=
e by few weeks ago.
=A0
Many years ago when I was living in Brajbhoomi, a s=
adhu came one late evening to my ashram. After some time he took me to a qu=
ite corner and told me certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had =
a glow on his face and had certain powers about him I believed him. Later o=
n he also gave me a Mantra of=A0Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu =
left in the morning and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told m=
e did not happen and this tithi became very upsetting for me.
=A0
Some year=
s back here in London I was coming home in the afternoon. I was in a crowde=
d bus and holding on to railings.Suddenly I rememberd that it was Tithi of =
Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. I started to recite Her mantra\name and try to m=
editate on Her in that crowded bus. I even smiled myself on the strangeness=
 of that situation. After few more minutes I reached home and opened my fro=
nt door and went inside. After going through my Puja room and telling my mo=
ther that I was back, I flopped on sofa in front room which is very near to=
 front gate. Then I heard some noises but I did not get up and slept for ne=
arly one hour. After I got up I got a srrong feeling to open my front door =
although nobody had knocked. The whole area in front of my house was covere=
d in Police lines and tapes. I could not believe it. 
=A0
I asked a policem=
an who was near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were shooting at ea=
ch other and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day I was c=
learly saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky several=
 minutes before the incident and I started Her prayers although there was n=
o reasons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time without knowing a single=
 thing as load of armed policemen were there after those gunman.and whole n=
oises and drama.
What else is this but Personal Grace of Bhagvati Sri=A0Chi=
nnmastaji
=A0
GoodLuck=A0 and Thanks

Aparna ji, afew of us whom you consider are blessed with the desire to=
 pray her may definitely feel bad to read your mail. The ways of god are ve=
ry mysterious and we humans especially in this yug have no right to ask her=
 ruling. Calling god "damn" hurts especially for those who pray her like pa=
rents. If you don't like god please keep your feelings towards yourself as =
this forum is not meant for those who hate god.The=A0 mail that nobody ji h=
as written is for those who already pray him not for newcomers who have to =
yet develop love/affection/trust for god...=A0=A0

As I write this I show n=
o hatred towards you or those people who talk in similar fashion. It is the=
ir ignorance and the soul transformation doesn't happen easily. Hence I wil=
l definitely pray for your inner growth. 


Nobody ji has spoken thousand w=
ords of wisdom hats off to his thoughts.=A0 When I went to learn car drivin=
g the teacher saw me driving with no attention. He yelled at me and I learn=
t driving in one day. Some students don't listen when explained gently, som=
e students listen only when the teacher yells so no offences should be take=
n by anyone.=A0 


Another thing I always noticed is that for some reason m=
ost of them in this forum talk with great respect to Narsimha ji and don't =
even consider taking advices given by any other devotees. We all know Narsi=
mha ji but we don't know which other high raised souls we are talking to. P=
lease talk with respect and consideration towards other devotees also other=
wise our prayers are a complete waste....

PriyaShaantih Shaantih =
