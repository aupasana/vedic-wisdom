One of the major misconceptions about the Higgs Boson is with respect to it=
s name, 'God-particle', which has resulted in so much speculation about it =
being some missing link to God. This is incorrect and grossly misleading. S=
cientists do not look at it that way, neither should we. 


Firstly, how di=
d the name of the Higg's Boson become 'God Particle'? Because practical evi=
dence of this elementary particle's existence was so difficult to come-by (=
it already existed was a mathematical/theoritical reality for long; in mode=
rn physics often mathematical models predict existence of such entities whi=
ch are later proved or disproved through experiment), they called it the "G=
od-dammed Particle", which in colloquial language became shortened into the=
 misleading name of 'God-particle'.

Physics is a sublime subject. So is Go=
d. Instead of waiting for the two to merge using the logic that our puny mi=
nds can fathom, it is better for now to let the two run their apparently di=
vergent courses and let us appreciate each individually for what they mean =
to us. There is no conflict here. 


I love physics. So when I come across =
something beautiful in physics (or for that matter any other subject of int=
erest) which makes me feel joyful, I perform a silent thanksgiving to God, =
for having created such an amazing subject.

Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
Some people wrote to me=
 seeking my view on the recent discovery of "God Particle". Here is a brief=
 comment.

Some people are falsely thinking th=
at science and religion are about to converge finally. That is far from tru=
th. Though it is nice of scientists to think of god when naming this partic=
le, it has nothing to do with god really.
=C2=A0
People believed that atom =
was indivisible. Then they found sub-atomic particles. Now they found an ad=
ditional sub-atomic particle. A few hundred years later, they may find sub-=
sub-atomic-particles that make up the sub-atomic particles. A few thousand =
years later, they may find sub-sub-sub-atomic-particles. And so on. There i=
s no end to
 this.
=C2=A0
Nothing in this cosmos is an indivisible whole un=
it. No material scientific discovery can ever be the be-all-end-all.

=C2=A0
As Maharshi Vasishtha alludes to in "Yoga Vaasisht=
ham", there may even be many worlds inside each particle, with cosmic consc=
iousness assuming various identities that are born, live and die within tha=
t particle!

God is the supreme cosmic force =
that is responsible for the creation, maintenance and recycling of the enti=
re cosmos with all of its worlds and beings. God cannot be restricted to a =
particular object, be it a giant galaxy or a small sub-atomic particle. The=
re is always something bigger than the biggest you can imagine and smaller =
than the smallest you can imagine.
=C2=A0
One will not truly find god as lo=
ng as one looks for god in *matter*, just as one will not find a painter as=
 long as one looks through the paintings by the painter. The paintings MAY =
capture some signature qualities, essence and basic nature of the painter,
=
 but the painter is beyond them. Similarly, the material world around us ma=
y capture some signature qualities, essence and basic nature of god, but go=
d is beyond the material world.

Narasimha
