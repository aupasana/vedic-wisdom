Dear RajarshiBhai,
How are you? You have to complete the story. you have to=
 tell what happened when X went to meet this man in temple.or anything else=
 which happened. It is like somebody gone in kitchen to get rest of meal an=
d not come back.

First I have to thank you for writing that story about Di=
vine Mother SriChinnmastaji. I had developed a fear about Her but 3 times I=
 got spiritual indications over the period of 2 months that I should write =
my story. When you wrote back suddenly my fear about Her melted away and I =
did immediate prayers to Her. Thanks.

The other thing is can I dare to say=
 that I do not agree what is in this thread. Why does this so called spirit=
ual man has to dump his failure on religion. If people do not believe in re=
ligion or God or afterlife, it is their problem. We are not all equal. We a=
ll do not come from same stock. We are born with different conditions, go t=
hrough different life experiences and go where our fate or destiny takes us=
. This world is composed of 3 gunas and there is always going to tension of=
 different sort. Why =C2=A0blame it on religion or God, why not on greed an=
d desire to control others and lord over them using what ever mean.

This s=
tory seems to like I used to read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to =
be a siddha if the story so far is true.and he has the ability to shape shi=
ft and transportation. So what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.=


what does God mean in this tale? Is it Creator God or Divine Lord Of SriV=
rindavan or =C2=A0Divine Mother or =C2=A0Self Realisation or Universal God =
or Jewish God or Formless God or Fire God?? After all there was a dhoni fir=
e there? Or some other God ??

SriVrindavan has a rolling population. They =
are not in confusion. Many people come there only for curiosity, many other=
 come only for Darshan in the Temple and go back home happy. many others co=
me with different desires. It is very wrong to expect from a person who is =
in fifth grade to have knowledge of 15th grade.

Many times people go to te=
mple to pray and ask for certain things and if it does not happen they beco=
me very anti religion and anti God. So what?? It has nothing to do with me =
or you or anybody else. It is their life.

I was very very very ill. Nobody=
 was helping me. Many people were giving me lot of pain. =C2=A0I went from =
Religious place to religious place, temple to temple, holy man to holy man.=
 Nothing seem to worked. Then I took up religious practise of doing mantra =
japa and other things which are in scriptures and Grace of Divine Mother it=
 worked. It is totally religious discipline according to our scriptures.

D=
o you drive a car? Did you pass you exam first time? I do not drive a car. =
It will take me several exams to pass it. Many people pass their test first=
 time and drive successfully. Does it mean I should blame car or exams or e=
xaminer or road for my failure??? .Many people take up spiritual life and i=
f they do not find success quickly they blame religion and God.

I also use=
d to think that a real experience of God would be very powerful thing. but =
there are other aspects to it. If someone is totally dependent on Divine Mo=
ther and calls on Her day and night, but yet he is not ready for certain en=
ergy or his body is not clean enough to receive a new light, then Divine Mo=
ther would appear to him in very gentle way to comfort him and to console s=
o that he remains on the path. She will appear right in front of him but he=
 only sees the Golden Aura and not what is middle of it because he is not y=
et ready. Whenever I think of that moment I am filled with deep bliss and j=
oy and wonderment.

You are a special person doing everyday intense haven t=
o spread the light.Many other people in this group are doing haven everyday=
 to fill their life with light of Divine Beings. This is a complete religio=
us method which is also totally spiritual thing.Please do not get impressed=
 with pseudo spiritual talk and tales of shape shifting. Is everything alri=
ght in your everyday life because I felt a sadness in your mail? I am sure =
I am very wrong in this.

Few days ago Olympic flame passed right outside m=
y road.I did not go out to see it. I kept holding to the Light which comes =
out of Divine Mothers Feet hoping it will become permanent in my life.

Goo=
d Luck and =C2=A0Joy for you.
LaxmiNarayan

Dear Ajit,

I am in complete agreement with your=
 thoughts.=C2=A0 A spiritual man once said, "Religion has been created to s=
hield people from God".=C2=A0

When I first heard this I was not convinced =
and thought it was some fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literall=
y true. Heavy psychological constructs are created by religions to protect =
an average person from the real experience of God, which is so powerful and=
 overwhelming that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurri=
cane in your average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.=



I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. 


An individual=
 - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to stay there for some years. He was sitti=
ng at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged lo=
oking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The=
 sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bri=
ng some sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man =
and said, "Maharaj, please tell us some words of God". The man became angry=
, and retorted back, "Why? Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God =
anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So please continue with your lectu=
res as you were doing before I came in". Everyone became uncomfortably sile=
nt hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his m=
outh, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walking off. After h=
e went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, =
"He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,
 but he has probably=
 lost his mental balance due to smoking too much ganja". Now X, who was sit=
ting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to that ragged man and wen=
t out to see where the guy was going. As he approached the ragged looking m=
an, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear English, "Hello, I was wa=
iting for you to come and join me." X was of course taken aback, did not ex=
pect the man to speak in English and more over he had no clue how the man g=
ot to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saf=
fron clothes). 


The man continued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born nea=
r Chennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have =
been a wondering sadhu since then." X asked him, why did you derive the sad=
hu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actua=
lly this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. No=
t the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the r=
eason for all the religious troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little i=
rritated, "Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc=
? If you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven't met a single=
 genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I ta=
ke Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as con=
fused as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you canno=
t meet that man, he is not accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "Th=
e root of
 all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that=
 man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the h=
uman brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man o=
r a magnified woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhan=
a, one day he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he=
 may even acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be r=
egarded by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I sa=
y the root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finit=
e mind and then stressing that one has understood correctly." While talking=
, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one =
pull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5=
 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You=
 (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don't get
 co=
nfused by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was=
 your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. =
I was an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But=
 then one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3=
 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact with thi=
s thing." As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and =
a young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengari=
nturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I =
come to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interest=
ing if you join me.


After an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bo=
red and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits and sweets for t=
heir food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar's feet as he lay do=
wn on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud=
, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the=
 hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this tho=
ught crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0=
 stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr I=
yengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction=
 to the cot. He too turned round to see what was going on. What he saw made=
 his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that w=
as Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his early tw=
enties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow th=
at lightened up the
 whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding l=
otus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human b=
eing any more but a god sitting in place of what was even five minutes back=
 only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.


X did not know what was happenin=
g. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stand up and come near the =
cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young =
man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he w=
as near a temple, in a remote location with trees and shrubs all around. Ol=
d Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him inside the temple preci=
ncts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitti=
ng in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word,=
 pointed out that meditating man to him and then took X out of the temple. =
That is the man I was talking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow.=
 He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really =
means. After providing directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr =
Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of p=
lace/time and lapsed into
 unconsciousness again. 


When X woke up, he was=
 in the room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, =
his old, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X wen=
t to the temple as directed.

Dear Prasanth,

> To those who say that=
 they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion




In general, many of those w=
ho don't believe in religion or God are being more honest than those who do=
. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a limited being =
to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent when de=
aling with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize these b=
iases.

While being mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce o=
f insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of "paapa" that we engage in t=
hroughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others l=
ook at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We =
"God believers" are the culprit.

We all have plenty of paapa and punya in =
our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast whi=
le we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn "paapa" and leave the "=
punya" intact. It is us "God believers" who look at our lives, ignoring all=
 the "paapaphala". We look at one or two instances of "punyaphala" and decl=
are our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it fo=
r what it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers" are the culprit.

For th=
e most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices=
, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. Wh=
en engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies=
. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our=
 strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and l=
aughs at us. We "God believers" are the culprit.

The best way to bring abo=
ut new waves of bhakti is not to look at the "non-believers" and try to con=
vert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be=
 honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be se=
rved.

If we see God as the limitless power that he is, he is difficult to =
define. It is difficult to capture him within a religion. Religion should s=
ee itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ pl=
ace our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most re=
ligions ask us to accept them without question. They ask us to place our he=
ads on them with reverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced fro=
m going any farther.

Dear Ajit,</span></div><div><br><span></span></div><div><span>I am in compl=
ete agreement with your thoughts.  A spiritual man once said, "Religio=
n has been created to shield people from God". </span></div><div><br><=
/div><div>When I first heard this I was not convinced and thought it was so=
me fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychol=
ogical constructs are created by religions to protect an average person fro=
m the real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if=
 and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in your average =
life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.<br></div><div><br></=
div><div>I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. <br></div>=
<div><br></div><div>An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to
 stay =
there for some
 years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoy=
ing the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes=
, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang,=
 stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking ma=
n. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, "Maharaj, please tell us some =
words of God". The man became angry, and retorted back, "Why? Why waste tim=
e talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run away.=
 So please continue with your lectures as you were doing before I came in".=
 Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets ca=
me, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got =
up and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing,=
 looked at his followers and said, "He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan on=
ce in a while, but he has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking t=
oo much
 ganja". Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt a=
ttracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As=
 he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X=
 in clear English, "Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me." X wa=
s of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and mor=
e over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was d=
ressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). <br></div><div><br></div>=
<div>The man continued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, wa=
s an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have been a wonder=
ing sadhu since then." X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was do=
ing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actually this God =
thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes =
of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all=

 the religious troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irritated, "W=
hy do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you hav=
e been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven't met a single genuine sad=
hu yet, how is it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take Vrindavan=
 alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as any=
body else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that =
man, he is not accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The root of al=
l this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot k=
now God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to=
 comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified=
 woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he=
 will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acq=
uire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded
 by o=
thers as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root o=
f the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and t=
hen stressing that one has understood correctly." While talking, the sadhu =
stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finishe=
d off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, sl=
owly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning X)=
 are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don't get confused by all=
 these show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I =
did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infa=
mous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day=
 having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I s=
lowly realized what God really is and how to interact with this thing." As =
he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a
 young girl=
 came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said =
to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vri=
ndavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesting if you =
join me.<br></div><div><br></div><div>After an hour inside the house, X was=
 feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits =
and sweets for their food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar's f=
eet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man i=
s one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shameless=
ly accepting the hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As =
soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman an=
d the girl  stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards th=
e cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing t=
he opp direction to the cot. He too turned round to see
 what was going on.=
 What he saw made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, rag=
ged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looke=
d in his early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a =
brilliant glow that lightened up the whole room. He had a shaved head, four=
 arms, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It look=
ed not a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even f=
ive minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.<br></div><div><br>=
</div><div>X did not know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured=
 towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X go=
t up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all =
consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote lo=
cation with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held hi=
s hand and took him inside the temple precincts.
 There he saw a dhuni burn=
ing, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all o=
ver his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditating ma=
n to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was talking a=
bout, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindava=
n currently who has an idea what God really means. After providing directio=
ns of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and imme=
diately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into uncon=
sciousness again. <br></div><div><br></div><div>When X woke up, he was in t=
he room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his o=
ld, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to =
the temple as directed. <br></div><div><br></div><div>-Regards</div><div>&n=

      <div>Dear Prasanth,</div><div><br></div><div>&g=
t; To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion<br><div=
><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In general, many of those who don't bel=
ieve in religion or God are being more honest than those who do. After all,=
 most people who believe in God look at him as a limited being to barter wi=
th. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent when dealing with o=
ur Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize these biases.</div>=


<div><br></div><div>While being mired in this word of duality, we think t=
hat an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of "paapa" that =
we engage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder=
 that others look at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this conce=
pt of God. We "God believers" are the culprit.</div>

<div><br></div><div>W=
e all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of ask=
ing for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we=
 ask God to burn "paapa" and leave the "punya" intact. It is us "God believ=
ers" who look at our lives, ignoring all the "paapa phala". We look at one =
or two instances of "punya phala" and declare our prayers to be successful.=
 However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. W=
e "God believers" are the culprit.</div>

<div><br></div><div>For the most =
part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our b=
hakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When enga=
ged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And y=
et, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong=
 worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs a=
t us. We "God believers" are the culprit.</div>

<div><br></div><div>The be=
st way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the "non-believ=
ers" and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lac=
k of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, t=
he world will be served.</div>

<div><br></div><div>If we see God as the li=
mitless power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to cap=
ture him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone,=
 and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to r=
each the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them =
without question. They ask us to place our heads on them with reverence, an=
d try to prevent the spiritually advanced from going any farther.</div>
