****

** **

Scriptures say that reality is eterna=
l, unchangeable, has no distortion and
is beyond distinctions of time, spac=
e and individuality. ****

** **

The Hiranyagarbha or primordial seeds of =
life that self-emanated with the
support of the five elements - ether, air,=
 fire, water and earth - came to
be this vast universe. To understand this =
better we have to know about
transformation of matters. ****

** **

Chetha=
na vastu or that which has life, which has chaitanya or
consciousness, will=
 never get transformed. Any jada vastu or that which is
lifeless will get t=
ransformed. The body is a chethana vastu till the life
breath is present, b=
ut will get transformed once the chaitanya is lost.
Body will get mixed wit=
h mud and could become a plant one day. If we
examine a plant in the pot, t=
he plant will use up all the mud and grow, one
day if we happen to re-pot i=
t we observe that only roots are present; very
little soil is left in the p=
ot. What happened to the soil? Yes, the soil
has been transformed into the =
plant. Are the soil and the plant different?
No, they are one and the same =
in different name and form. ****

** **

Reality can be viewed at three lev=
els: Paramarthika or the absolute,
vyavaharika or what is relative and prat=
ibhasika or the illusory. Reality
of the non-dual whole which is the infini=
te non-dual consciousness of
being, 'I am' is the absolute reality. This is=
 Brahmn, the primordial and
that which has no distortion with respect to ti=
me, space and individuality.
So Vedanta tells all that is present is Brahmn=
 and that Brahmn is reality. *
***

** **

Until such time as when we come =
to know absolute reality, the empirical
world is projected in all its diver=
sity. This makes us feel the existence
of the relative reality. Anything th=
at is relatively real appears to be
real at certain times and under certain=
 conditions, and it ceases or
changes its appearance at other times and und=
er other conditions. Since it
is not real at all times, it is not real even=
 when it appears to be real.
Relative reality is experienced by all as the =
same. ****

** **

Erroneous imagination of something which does not exist =
or illusions and
hallucinations which have no existence apart from the mind=
 that imagines
them is illusory reality. ****

** **

Let us consider clay =
and call it Brahmn, the absolute reality. A potter
makes a pot out of it. N=
ow the pot becomes relative reality. Even though it
is clay we call it pot =
since we see it in the form of a pot. Once the pot
is broken it will go bac=
k to its original form, clay. An individual who has
purchased the pot will =
think he can make use of it by cooking rice in it.
This is illusory reality=
. This is purely one's own imagination, since one
can cook rice or boil wat=
er, or make tea or the pot may even crack before
one puts it on the fire. *=
***

** **

In Vedanta, the oft-repeated analogy is of the rope and snake. =
Originally
the material of the rope is Brahmn - this is absolute reality. D=
ue to its
appearance in the form of a rope we call it rope and this is rela=
tive
reality. In darkness if someone mistakes the rope to be a snake, this =
is
illusory reality. One can imagine a rope to be a coiled snake, piece of
=
stick, or a crack in the ground and this is left to the individual's
imagin=
ation. ****
