Respected  Narasimhaji & other scholars,

Can you kindly shed some light o=
n the rationale behind  Lakshmi as wife of Ganapathi, and evolution of Laks=
hmi ganapathi avatar. I did not realise that Lakshmi was Ganapathi's wife u=
ntil I saw her sitting on his left thigh in one of the temples and was conf=
used and bewildered at the real reason. Are the two lakshmi's (vishnu patni=
 & ganapathi patni) same or different?

Please clarify.

Thanks & Regards,
=
Vasavi
