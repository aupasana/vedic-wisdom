Happy Janam Ashtmi to All.
=

when sole objective is realisation how rule can apply,

did Rama see How S=
habri offered "ber"

Lord Rama accepted Hanuman ji (and Nishad who was from=
 low cast ) though vanars are supposed to be inferior

Lord Krishana gave M=
oksha to Kubja. and many others

Just when one surrenders completely to him=
 and immerse himself IN HIM (Lord). no rule applies.

Lord Krishan says 

"=
Leave all religions and completely surrender unto me. 
Then it is my respon=
sibility O' Arjun to see you through."

when one does bhakti with rules mea=
ns his attention is diverted to some other object.Just accept HIM as ur gui=
de who is inside.

Uski  diwangi mein doob ke dekho.He will take ur  Yog ks=
hem.

He needs " ananya bhakti.

even if if somebody sees inside body physi=
cally we r machine of many wastes and also we have collected many waste at =
mental level.

Still Lord accepts us though we r no use of to HIM
