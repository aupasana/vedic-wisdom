You said

"Once=A0I saw in a article that Aurobindo said t=
hat Divine Lord who spoke Gita completely forgot it after few minutes or so=
. I could not believe what I was reading. Then my respect for this yogi wen=
t down the drain."

Technically what Aurobindo said was right. It is in fac=
t mentioned in Mahabharata. When Pandavas did the Ashvamedha after the Maha=
barata war, Arjuna asks Krishna to tell him the Gita again as the earlier s=
ituation when he heard Gita was full of tension and he needs to reinforce i=
t in his mind. It was then that Krishna reprimands Arjuna for having forgot=
ten and then says that he (Krishna) had forgotten the Gita and cannot tell =
that again. 

But one needs to remember that its all God's play to convey t=
hat  upadesha cannot be given so easily everytime it is asked. But the same=
 Krishna bestows Anu-Gita on Arjuna right after he said he had forgotten. A=
nugeeta is pretty much a good summary of the same Bhagavad-Gita. How did th=
at happen? :-)

And the same Krishna much later during leaving his apparent=
 mortal body behind tells Uddhava-Gita to Uddhava. Uddhava Gita is much mor=
e detailed and also more deep than the Bhagavad Gita that we all have come =
to appreciate. How could the Lord that has forgotten tell more of it to Udd=
hava later? 

Thus it becomes pretty obvious how this drama has to be inter=
preted when we see this incident not as stand alone but in the larger conte=
xt of related events, Mahabharata and Bhagavat.

Regards,
Ashutosh

 Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameters of judgement is to obj=

sness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc.

are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle of=

ng. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (o=
verlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything=A0 is p=
ossible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation i=

 sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experience/a=

him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower extreme =
of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface ego driv=

modify and transform your waking surface personality. That is the only true=

percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound and f=

the intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got s=
