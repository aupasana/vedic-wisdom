Dear All,
=A0 =A0I was reading all the stuff =A0by great learned members. E=
ven Aparna =A0mail was =A0also there. I agree that if =A0she =A0has a =A0pe=
rsonal vendetta against "Maa" she may please put her in own heart. If you a=
re annoyed with your parents you just can't start cursing them. But then i =
thought what happened to "Kansa" and "Ravana". They both hated the "Vishnu"=
 Form and amid there hatred they became so engrossed that they started subm=
erging their=A0consciousness=A0in to the "Vishnu" form respectively. Ultima=
tely either worship Gog or get slayed by God , eventually both the approach=
es =A0gives you the salvation. May be Aparna has taken the reverse approach=
. May be this approach is on unfamiliar territory and most people will just=
 by pass it. But a road is a =A0a road and =A0an approach is a approach.

W=
hat i urge respected members is to follow any approach they like but please=
 do not curse " Maa" in any public forum. Keep their respective thoughts in=
 their own great soul. Please pardon me if i have hurt any one's sentiment.=


Jai Maa Jagdambe!!!
