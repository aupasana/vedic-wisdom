"I offer obeisance to the God and Goddess,
The limitless primal parents of =
the universe.

They are not entirely the same,
Nor are they not the same.
W=
e cannot say exactly what they are.

How sweet is their union!
The whole wo=
rld is too small to contain them,
Yet they live happily in the smallest par=
ticle.

These two are the only ones
Who dwell in this home called the unive=
rse.
When the Master of the house sleeps,
The Mistress stays awake,
And per=
forms the functions of both.

When He awakes, the whole house disappears,
A=
nd nothing at all is left.

Two lutes: one note.
Two flowers: one fragrance=
.
Two lamps: one light.

Two lips: one word.
Two eyes: one sight.
These two=
: one universe.

In unity there is little to behold;
So She, the mother of =
abundance,
Brought forth the world as play.

He takes the role of Witness
O=
ut of love of watching Her.
But when Her appearance is withdrawn,
The role =
of Witness is abandoned as well.

Through Her,
He assumes the form of the u=
niverse;
Without Her,
He is left naked.

If night and day were to approach =
the Sun,
Both would disappear.
In the same way, their duality would vanish
=
If their essential Unity were seen.

In fact, the duality of Shiva and Shak=
ti
Cannot exist in that primal unitive state
>From which AUM emanates.

They=
 are like a stream of knowledge
>From which a knower cannot drink
Unless he =
gives up himself.

Is the sound of AUM divided into three
Simple because it=
 contains three letters?
Or is the letter 'N' divided into three
Because of=
 the three lines by which it is formed?

So long as Unity is undisturbed,
A=
nd a graceful pleasure is thereby derived,
Why should not the water find de=
light
In the floral fragrance of its own rippled surface?

It is in this ma=
nner I bow
To the inseparable Shiva and Shakti.

A man returns to himself
W=
hen he awakens from sleep;
Likewise, I have perceived the God and Goddess
B=
y waking from my ego.

When salt dissolves,
It becomes one with the ocean;
=
When my ego dissolved,
I became one with Shiva and Shakti."

Taken from Amr=
utanubhav, the last composition of Sant Dhyaneshwar Maharaj, one of the G-R=
-E-A-T-E-S-T saints the world has ever known.
