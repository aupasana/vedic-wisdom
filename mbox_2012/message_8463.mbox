dear narasimha ji and spiritual siblings,

this time during the 9 days of d=
urga pooja i wish to
do a purashcharan of gayatri mantra. 

and, it would b=
e kind of you to share with me some tips and also guide me in the same.

si=
nce it is going to be a physically taxing task and very time consuming how =
can i prepare myself for the same.

also, if you think gayatri mantra puras=
hcharan will not be possible
(being a grihastha time is a major constraint =
and gayatri being a long mantra)then please suggest some other devi mantra =
that i can safely complete during the said duration.

looking forward to ge=
tting guidance from you.

thanks n rgds,
dolly.
