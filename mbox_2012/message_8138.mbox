Namaste Sri Challa,

I have no experience in dealing with these issues, but=
 I would like to bring to your attention Chapter 5 which goes something lik=
e "yaa devi sarva bhuteshu  ... " and it goes on to list all the qualities,=
 both good and bad!!! The key point here is all the so called negative qual=
ities also arise from her! There is nothing in the world that she is not th=
e source or origin of! So all your bad thoughts and words all merge into he=
r!

So think about this and just fall at her feet and with a sincere prayer=
 seek her refuge!

This is all I've got to say :).

Be Happy!

-Narayan-
