It reminds me of Ramana Maharshi's reply of find out who is asking the ques=
tion when some one asked him if there was a God.  There is no substitute to=
 Self Inquiry and Knowledge of the Self which burns all impurities in it's =
fire.  Characters in Saptashati are named to be self revealing of the unfol=
dment of one's journey towards one's own True Self.  When one truly gets Sa=
ptashati's message it's about Self Realization which is what Upanishads are=
 about and is the ultimate goal of all human pursuits whether one realizes =
or not.

There is nothing like a better/good/bad dream when one wakes up as=
 it has no relevance to the truth of existence but it may be a great deal d=
uring the duration of the dream.

Regards,
Kris.
