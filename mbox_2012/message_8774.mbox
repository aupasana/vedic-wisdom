Namaste Ashutoshji,
Though I am too small to tell anything on this subject,=
my feeling is this rule is applicable for-
'dashamsa homa' 
Homa which most=
 of us do are for spiritual progress though your views CAN speedup this pro=
cess but it is not "must=C2=A0 be done" as far as my thinking goes.
I may b=
e wrong.
Thanks.
For reference I am pasting one message from another group =
below.

Namaskara, 
=
 
When a mantra 
purascharane is done, this is said to give full phala. 
Th=
ere are certain numbers 
fixed for one purascharane. Or when a mantra is ta=
ken up for japa either for 
some phala or pure hari preeti 
the following p=
rocedure 
is recommended.  
 
If the mantra japa is 
1000, the tarpaNa with=
 milk is 100 and homa 100.  
the tarpaNa should be 
given with the same man=
tra as for japa and when the milk is poured one should 
say ....... tarpaya=
ami.  
For homa svaahaa should 
be added at the end.

For homa aajyaa ( tuppa or  gRita ) only can be taken. And if time and 
e=
fforts permit aShTadravya ( eight substances) can be used. 
 
( 
8 substanc=

There=
 are different numbers of mantras if you are doing purascharaNa. 
So please=
 look up the source texts or ask your guru. For example for one 
nRisiMha m=
antra purascharaNa 32,000 nRisiMha mantra, 3200 nRisimha gAyatri and 
3200 =
nRisimha mAlA mantra are to be completed for japa. Aletrnatively 3200 of N.=
 
mantra, 320 N. gAyatri and 320 N. mAlA mantra can also be done. The tarpa=
Na and 
homa will be one tenth of those numbers.

Sub=
ject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam - Ahuti numbers
  
 
=C2=A0  
 
My pranams to al=
l.
I have been performing weekly havan for more than a year and half.
I wan=
t to point out certain things related to havan so that it can be done as pe=
r shastra by others too.
I am using a conversation that in fact took place =
to bring out these relevant points.

Sometime back there was informal "pras=
hNa" session whose summary I am presenting below: 

[South Indians might be=
 familiar with similar "ashTamangala prashNa" conducted in temples when som=
ething goes wrong - called as dosha.]

PrashNa conductor: There seems to be=
 a dosha... Hmm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing som=
e kind of Agni karya at your home regularly.

Myself: Yes (I was actually v=
ery surprised by this pointed question because I had not told anybody about=
 the havan I did at home)

PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in t=
he agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And=
 your ahuti does not seem to be right.

Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame =
seeds).

PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit o=
f ghee before giving it as ahuti.

Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my =
ahuti apart from that?

PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa before g=
iving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for=
 your regular japa?

Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisi=
te like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?

PrashNa conductor:=
 Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 re=
citation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) o=
r at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra=
 in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)

Myself: Doesnt that only=
 apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody =
in this group is already familiar with that book series)

PrashNa conductor=
: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matte=
r. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictl=
y.

The conversation went onto several other things. Subsequently I went on=
 to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra a=
nd also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentio=
ned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual progress since. 
=

Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I jus=
t wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to perform at least =
10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the "qualification" for t=
he ahuti.

Regards,
Ashutosh

    <div sab=3D"6113">My pranams to all.<br sab=3D"6114">
I have been perfo=
rming weekly havan for more than a year and half.<br sab=3D"6115">
I want t=
o point out certain things related to havan so that it can be done as per s=
hastra by others too.<br sab=3D"6116">
I am using a conversation that in fa=
ct took place to bring out these relevant points.<br sab=3D"6117">
<br sab=
=3D"6118">
Sometime back there was informal "prashNa" session whose summary=
 I am presenting below: <br sab=3D"6119">
<br sab=3D"6120">
[South Indians =
might be familiar with similar "ashTamangala prashNa" conducted in temples =
when something goes wrong - called as dosha.]<br sab=3D"6121">
<br sab=3D"6=
122">
PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm... let me see... =
Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya at your home=
 regularly.<br sab=3D"6123">
<br sab=3D"6124">
Myself: Yes (I was actually =
very surprised by this pointed question because I had not told anybody abou=
t the havan I did at home)<br sab=3D"6125">
<br sab=3D"6126">
PrashNa condu=
ctor: There are certain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to=
 be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.<b=
r sab=3D"6127">
<br sab=3D"6128">
Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds)=
.<br sab=3D"6129">
<br sab=3D"6130">
PrashNa conductor: You should mix that=
 with atleast a little bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.<br sab=3D"613=
1">
<br sab=3D"6132">
Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart f=
rom that?<br sab=3D"6133">
<br sab=3D"6134">
PrashNa conductor: Do you do r=
equired Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same ma=
ntra that you use for your regular japa?<br sab=3D"6135">
<br sab=3D"6136">=

Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No I d=
ont do any pre-defined set of japa?<br sab=3D"6137">
<br sab=3D"6138">
Pras=
hNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is fo=
r every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified fo=
r one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitat=
ions of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)<br sab=3D"6=
139">
<br sab=3D"6140">
Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (bas=
ed on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is already fa=
miliar with that book series)<br sab=3D"6141">
<br sab=3D"6142">
PrashNa co=
nductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesn=
t matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it =
strictly.<br sab=3D"6143">
<br sab=3D"6144">
The conversation went onto sev=
eral other things. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a acc=
omplished seer and reciting that mantra and also using the same mantra for =
my ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ratio only and have been very =
happy with my spiritual progress since. <br sab=3D"6145">
<br sab=3D"6146">=

Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I jus=
t wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to perform at least =
10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the "qualification" for t=
he ahuti.<br sab=3D"6147">
