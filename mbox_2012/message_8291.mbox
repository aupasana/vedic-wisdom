America's First Hindu Think Tank Now Established

The Center for the Study =

of Dharma and Civilization
http://www.dharmacivilization.com


After more =
than a decade of discussions, planning and organizing, the very first credi=
ble and professionally led Hindu think tank in America has now been formall=
y established to serve the Hindu community. 

The Center for the Study of D=
harma and Civilization (CSDC) is the very first academic think tank of the =
Sanatana Dharma tradition ever created in American history. Established by =
Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya in May of 2012, the CSDC brings together seve=
ral of the most prominent Hindu scholars in America with the singular purpo=
se of academically affirming the preeminence of the philosophy, practice an=
d culture of Sanatana Dharma in the intellectual realm. 

The Board of Advi=
sors for this first ever Hindu think tank includes:

Dr. David Frawley, Pro=
fessor Subhash Kak, Professor Ramdas Lamb, Professor Ramesh Rao, Professor =
Parmender Mehta, and Professor Daniel Wilkins.

Our goal is to reveal to th=
e world the unique Vedic perspective on all of the most important philosoph=
ical, social, religious, political and cultural issues of the day. We will =
offer comparative analyses of the Dharma world-view versus every other worl=
d-view of prominence in the 21st century, thus establishing Sanatana Dharma=
 as the philosophical system par excellence designed to solve the many cris=
es and confusions that our world is facing today.

Seeking Paper Submission=
s

We are seeking papers to publish on our website, and that may eventually=
 be published in printed form.

We are exclusively interested in papers tha=
t firmly contrast any civilizational aspect of Sanatana Dharma with any jux=
taposing aspect of a non-Dharmic belief system, theological stance, philoso=
phy, ideology, or idea. The goal of your paper must be to demonstratively e=
stablish the preeminence of Sanatana Dharma over the non-Dharmic philosophi=
cal proposition you are comparing it to. We are not interested in purely hi=
storical, hagiographical, philological, or needlessly abstract papers =96 b=
ut only papers that directly interface Sanatana Dharma with modernity in a =
polemically engaged manner.

You can submit papers online at: http://dharma=
civilization.com/submissions/

We Need Your Help

The CSDC is currently ope=
rating on a limited budget. We will need further funding for larger office =
space rental, internet development and maintenance, possible fellowships fo=
r scholars who we would want to employ full-time, development of multimedia=
 production capacity, etc. If you would like to donate to this important ca=
use, please do so by visiting: http://dharmacivilization.com/donate/
