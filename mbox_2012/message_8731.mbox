Got an sms from a good friend today. Thought I will share it here.

"Progre=
ss has little to do with speed; but much to do with direction. So always co=
ncentrate on your direction, not on speed."

For any genuine spiritual seek=
er, this is one of the sanest advices, ever. In the milieu of spirituality,=
 too many people get caught up in the less important - aka, visions, 'exper=
iences', tough-penances, complex rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while f=
orgetting the goal of real spirituality, that is transformation of mind/emo=
tions/body resulting in greater surrender to the Divine, greater equanimity=
 to life situations, an abiding calm and peace, genuine humility, lessening=
 of lower emotions like lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious a=
ttachments, such that eventually every action of the individual is like a c=
onsecration (sacrifice, yagjya) to the Divine. A life so transformed and so=
 away from our average superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment=
 on its own. God is not the finish line of a bicycle race. It is the progre=
ssive unfolding of a transformation process.

Complex rituals and speedy sa=
dhanas and experiences et al are ok, provided one does not lose sight of th=
e fundamentals. THEN these can be useful. Otherwise one ends up running in =
circles and going nowhere. An experience-chaser is not necessary a spiritua=
l entity. I had to learn this basic truth the hard-way.
