Pranamam,
"In the spiritual path, we are all children." -This is absolutely=
 right..
If the kid has some purva janma vasanas of sadhana..he may pick it=
 up very fast..
My kiddo is 4+ and he can recite 90% of the Mahaganapthi ho=
mam mantras..and he enjoys it..in my opinion..starting early can put them i=
n a much better state in their life..
SubhamasthuKK

      Dear Sunil,
> Homa is n=
ot like reciting another mantra, it has to be according to the rules.


Eve=
rything in our tradition has rules and mantras. How to eat. What to eat. Wh=
en to eat. How to wash your hands after you eat. How many times should you =
shake your hands to dry them off after you eat. How to do homa. Etc.


But,=
 here's the kicker. There isn't one single set of rules. There are many con=
tradicting sets of rules. So, doing anything according to "the" rules is si=
mply not possible. The reality is that there are a set of timeless principl=
es, which have been laid down as many sets of rules.


Many of the people i=
n this list are doing homa according to rules. They may not be the same rul=
es that you are following, but that most certainly does not mean that they =
are rule-less :-)



> wrong pronunciation is very dangerous.=C2=A0> In the=
 airforce, you need to have great experience flying a sports/small aircraft=
,

Our rishis are geniuses. They put in a few safeguards. The intent of the=
 rules, and basic things like pronunciation is akin to putting the key in t=
he plane. Without it, nothing happens, and we can all pretend to fly the pl=
ane. As long as we are pretending, it doesn't matter if it is a small plane=
, or a military jet. It is all totally harmless.


Frankly, "correct pronun=
ciation" is hard. I know basic sanskrit. I have worked on my pronunciation,=
 and it is decent. I have even studied a little bit of the shAstra that und=
erlies pronunciation. And I know that I am nowhere close to "correct pronun=
ciation". Honestly, I have yet to meet a single person with perfect pronunc=
iation. But, I have met some people who are great sAdhakas, who are much fu=
rthur along the spiritual path that me.


Here's another way of thinking ab=
out it. Riding a bike incorrectly is very dangerous. If you go too fast, yo=
u will fall and get hurt. If you go too slow, you will fall and get hurt. I=
f you don't look ahead, you will hit something and get hurt. And yet, we al=
l teach our children how to ride bikes. Every one of them makes every one o=
f these mistakes. But, that is how they learn.


Fundamentally, things like=
 homa, japa, tarpana, dhyana etc are mandated in the shastras from a young =
age. Our munis would not have prescribed these for young children if they w=
ere dangerous. We all know -- children do everything wrong before they do i=
t right. The rishis have taken this into account. In the spiritual path, we=
 are all children.
