Namaste Sir,
=A0
1) The key is to pick a form that one can truly feel love =
and devotion for.
=A0
Unfortunately, current understanding of astrology thu=
mbrules is not good enough to suggest the correct form/deity from the horos=
cope, though we have some basic guidelines. If one has a sadguru, whose con=
sciousness is always established in god, such a person may be able to tell =
the correct form. Otherwise, the best recourse one has is to follow one's h=
eart.
=A0
If one is not sure, one can start off with Ganapathi homam and ev=
entually Lord shows the correct direction.
=A0
In any case, if one does hom=
am just for the pleasure of Lord and has only small dharmik desires, one ne=
ed not worry about too many technicalities.
=A0
2) You can mix it up as you=
 want.
=A0
But, the advantage of sticking to one thing for a considerable t=
ime is that a specific mantra or prayer becomes second nature to one's mind=
 after a period of time. After repeating enough, one may start to chant the=
 prayer at the back of the mind when doing other things. In time, this purg=
es useless thoughts from the mind and creates positive vibrations and peace=
 in the mind. If one is switching between different things all the time, it=
 is more difficult to create such a state of mind.
=A0
3) Currently only Ga=
napathi homam video and audio exist. Because the template and the initial a=
nd final portions are common, it can help no matter which homam one does. I=
n the long run, we will try to add video and audio for all homas. A lot of =
people asked for it.
=A0
Some people see the video a few times, put a print=
out next to them and start. Some people play Ganapathi homam MP3 on a compu=
ter and do homam while pausing and un-pausing. After a few weeks, they get =
the mantras (which are not too many) by heart and do without MP3. One can d=
o whatever is convenient. Eventually, everyone finds their steady state and=
 starts to enjoy it.
=A0
Above all, Fire (Agni) is the greatest teacher and=
 the original purohit of Vedas. If one starts to spend time with Fire, Fire=
 will take care of things and will slowly transform one.
=A0
4) One of the =
final steps in all homas (and all rituals really) is "mantraheenam kriyaahe=
enam bhaktiheenam" mantra. We ask for forgiveness of Lord for errors in pro=
nunciation, procedures, devotion etc. If one does THAT step sincerely and w=
ith humility, all is well. Other errors are forgiven and moreover Lord help=
s one improve those aspects as well, with time.
=A0
In fact, in my humble o=
pinion, people who do not know much Sanskrit and do not have much intellect=
ual understanding, are more likely to please Lord and experience internal t=
ransformation faster, than those who know Sanskrit well and are very intell=
igent. Pride comes easier to the latter group, while humility comes easier =
to the former group (though there can be exceptions). Humility and sincerit=
y in the ritual is far more important than knowledge=A0 and technical perfe=
ction.
=A0
BTW, one word on ugra devatas (this is not for you, as you picke=
d a soumya devata): In general, one should worship an ugra devata only if o=
ne is sure of what one is doing. After all, one can learn something from a =
very tough task master only if one can take the grind! In the process of cl=
eansing our consciousness, ugra devatas are like tough task masters, while =
soumya devatas are like kinder and gentler masters. If one is unsure, soumy=
a devatas are better.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
