Namaste Narasimhaji,

I did my first MahaGanapathi homam this morning of th=
e Vaishakh/Buddha Purnima day. It couldn't have been possible without the b=
lessings and support of Devi Ma, Shri MahaGanapathi, Shri Manish Panditji, =
your kind selves, Shri Utplaji, and Shri Rajeshji. I would sincerely like t=
o thank all of you from the bottom of my heart. 

I must add here that by a=
dding the video recordings of your homam, you have made it easily possible =
for beginners like me to do the homam on our own. I look forward to dong my=
 next homam coming Saturday.

Thank you very much,
Best regards,
Manish
