Hey Aparna, 

After i sent that link mails i got 2 kick-in-face mail that w=
ere very apt. writing this to you is kind of reaffirming that to myself. i =
also over intellectualize so opportunity to answer myself.

Forget all the =
calculation, theories, all literature. 

Is there any manual good enough to=
 teach love and surrender ? Just develop a intense longing love for one for=
m and feel the pangs of longing, develop the intensity so that the longing =
consume you.  the name will repeat itself easily u wont have to worry. Forg=
et the counts god can count. 

Do a homam, 15 min a day, that a open heart =
surgery. the panchopachr puja of offering 5 elements (isnt that tantra) is =
as powerful as biggest tantra sadhana if done with full love/surrender.

Yo=
ur link of ramkrishan about surrendering all emotions was bang on target. n=
ot because it was a great article in itself but because you are doing it.

=
Intellectualize becomes a hurdle which heart is not able to cross. 

You sa=
id you got diksha for a mantra from a monk in shivananda tradition. do you =
know what that means - Thats like warren buffet giving you an addon debit c=
ard to his bank balance.

and as for puruscharan/count and activating a man=
tra many people are able to activate at 1/10 counts, many not able to at ev=
en 10x counts, and many are able to activate seemingly wrong words "hat par=
a (get lost)" as their mantra.  ????

thanks for letting me answer "myself"=



Bhairavi, "Whoever does sadhana with whatever intention, they will achie=
ve that."

regards,

a big fan of japa, and especially of Purascharana (repeating mantra as many=

hey, I decided to make a start anyway, and began my my first Purascharana o=

 11 rounds a day, with my mind wandering most of the time (hard core people=
