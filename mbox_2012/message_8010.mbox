      <div>Namaste friends,<br>
<br>
I recently finished a spe=
cific sadhana of a specific form of Divine <br>
Mother. This particular god=
dess, according to my guru, attracts others <br>
to a sadhaka and gives &qu=
ot;control and mastery" over others.<br>
<br>
I want to share what I r=
ealized towards the end of sadhana, because that <br>
realization MAY be he=
lpful to some others.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
DIFEERENT TRAJE=
CTORIES<br>
<br>
There are beings that can give specific limited things, bu=
t the ultimate <br>
goal of sadhana is liberation and sadhana of higher bei=
ngs eventually <br>
transforms one and takes one closer to liberation. What=
 these higher <br>
beings are supposed to give in tradition is a simplifica=
ation or <br>
symbolism of something sublime that takes towards liberation,=
 from <br>
*different angles*.<br>
<br>
For example, ability to work very h=
ard (with no expectations of anything <br>
selfish in return), fine judgmen=
t and discrimination (that increases <br>
detachment in one's actions),=
 complete surrender to god (and <br>
whole-hearted acceptance of every life=
 situation one finds oneself in), <br>
ability to focus mind (on a mantra o=
r a deity and not let various <br>
thoughts distract it), are all useful to=
 a sadhaka. If one develops one <br>
of these 4 basic qualities, other qual=
ities will eventually develop. <br>
They all lead to the same thing - liber=
ation - in the end, but the <br>
trajectory is different.<br>
<br>
These fo=
ur basic paths constitute what are known as karma yoga <br>
(communion thro=
ugh action), jnana yoga (communion through wisdom), <br>
bhakti yoga (commu=
nion through devotion) and raja yoga (communion <br>
through [self-]control=
). However, there are many sub-paths.<br>
<br>
Basically, different higher =
beings can increase a different fine quality <br>
inside one, which is cond=
ucive to liberation. The trajectory is <br>
different with each deity.<br>
=
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
TOO MUNDANE?<br>
<br>
The higher being I =
worshipped is supposed to increase control and <br>
mastery over others. Wh=
ile I did the sadhana in the last few months, I <br>
wondered how *that* ca=
n lead to liberation. After all, control and <br>
mastery over others sound=
ed too *mundane* to me to have anything to do <br>
with liberation. But a s=
imple realization came towards the end of the <br>
sadhana.<br>
<br>
*     =
   *        *<br>
<br>
CONTROL & FRICTION<br>
<br>
Whether A is attract=
ed to B or B is attracted to A, the bottomline is <br>
that objects A and B=
 come together. The ability to attract others also <br>
means to come toget=
her with them.<br>
<br>
One is unhappy with others and thinks of controllin=
g them, when one's <br>
own agenda is mis-aligned with their agenda. Th=
e friction between the <br>
agendas is the basis for the entire dynamics of=
 likes, dislikes, <br>
frustrations etc. Control of that friction comes whe=
n the agendas are <br>
nicely aligned!<br>
<br>
Ability to control the agen=
da pursued by someone else has limited use, <br>
scope and lifetime. Such a=
n ability can work only with a limited set of <br>
people or a limited amou=
nt of time. This is like pumping rainwater from <br>
the fields surrounding=
 a hill to the top of the hill. It requires a lot <br>
of energy that is pr=
oportional to the area of the field and the amount <br>
of rainwater.<br>
<=
br>
The best way to avoid the friction, with ALL beings of the cosmos, is t=
o <br>
eliminate one's own agenda! This is like removing the hill from =
the <br>
middle of the field, in the above analogy.<br>
<br>
If one has no =
agenda whatsoever, then there is no friction with anyone's <br>
agenda.=
 There is no reason to like or dislike anyone or find fault with <br>
or ad=
mire anyone. One can just observe others. Because one has no <br>
agenda, o=
ne can identify with the agendas of others and relate to them <br>
complete=
ly. One can then put oneself completely in the shoes of others <br>
and fee=
l their pleasures, pains etc.<br>
<br>
When one has an agenda and another h=
as another agenda, then there is <br>
friction and one feels a need to &quo=
t;control" and remove friction. But, <br>
when one has no agenda and a=
nother has an agenda, then there is no <br>
friction. One can then complete=
ly "understand" the perspective of the <br>
other (because there =
is no friction from one's own agenda stopping one <br>
from doing so!).=
 What better mastery and control can one have on someone <br>
else than be =
able to understand that person completely?!<br>
<br>
Though what I describe=
d above is the end, one path to that end is to <br>
identify one's own =
agenda/conditioning that is resulting in friction, <br>
whenever one is not=
 happy with someone, and try to remove/suppress that <br>
conditioning. One=
 can first try this with a few people (e.g. spouse).<br>
<br>
*        *   =
     *<br>
<br>
LOVE & COMPASSION FOR ALL<br>
<br>
Bottomline is this: =
Control and mastery over others does not mean making <br>
them think and be=
have in tune with the agenda of one's own limited <br>
conditioning. In=
stead, it means overcoming's one's own agendas and being <br>
able =
to put oneself in the shoes of anybody and understand and feel each <br>
of=
 their feelings and emotions. It means unconditional love and <br>
compassi=
on for all.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
LOOKING DOWN ON OTHERS<br=
>
<br>
When one is doing some sadhana, one of the stages one goes through m=
ay <br>
be to feel proud of one's sadhana, look at some others doing su=
ch a <br>
sadhana favorably or with admiration and look down on others who =
are not <br>
doing much sadhana (or doing a different sadhana!) and pursuin=
g mundane <br>
things. This may be a natural tendency, but realize that thi=
s is a work <br>
of the limited personality or ego.<br>
<br>
One has to ove=
rcome that tendency, for looking down on others will <br>
eventually block =
one.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
LOVING THE DIVINE MOTHER<br>
<br=
>
People talk of loving the Divine Mother. The personality of Divine <br>
M=
other is beyond one's perception. How can one really love Her then?<br>=

<br>
One may do tremendous sadhana and get tremendous visions and think th=
at <br>
one has grasped the personality of Divine Mother, but what one perc=
eives <br>
is merely what one's conditioning fancies and is capable of =
grasping! <br>
The complete personality of Divine Mother is beyond anybody&=
#39;s <br>
perception.<br>
<br>
However, Divine Mother does manifest in a p=
erceptible way as the cosmos. <br>
Every being in the cosmos is a limited m=
anifestation of Her. Being able <br>
to love every being is the FIRST step =
in truly loving the Divine Mother.<br>
<br>
Loving someone because they are=
 doing some good work (as we see it!) or <br>
because they have something w=
e need (as we see it!) etc, is *egoistic* <br>
loving. Such love is *condit=
ioned* by the agendas of a limited ego. Such <br>
love cannot extend to ent=
ire cosmos and permanently. The only love that <br>
can extend to entire co=
smos and be permanent is unconditional love of <br>
all beings.<br>
<br>
Th=
at comes only when one has no agenda and no expectations from anyone.<br>
<=
br>
