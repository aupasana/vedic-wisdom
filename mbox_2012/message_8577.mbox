=C2=A0 

Happy Janam Ashtmi to All.

when sole objective is realisati=
on how rule can apply,

did Rama see How Shabri offered "ber"

Lord Rama ac=
cepted Hanuman ji (and Nishad who was from low cast ) though vanars are sup=
posed to be inferior

Lord Krishana gave Moksha to Kubja. and many others

=
Just when one surrenders completely to him and immerse himself IN HIM (Lord=
). no rule applies.

Lord Krishan says 

"Leave all religions and completel=
y surrender unto me. 
Then it is my responsibility O' Arjun to see you thro=
ugh."

when one does bhakti with rules means his attention is diverted to s=
ome other object.Just accept HIM as ur guide who is inside.

Uski  diwangi =
mein doob ke dekho.He will take ur  Yog kshem.

He needs " ananya bhakti.

=
even if if somebody sees inside body physically we r machine of many wastes=
 and also we have collected many waste at mental level.

Still Lord accepts=
 us though we r no use of to HIM

 But, I've never been able to answer with conviction whether and to what ex=
tent women can take part in spiritual practices in their menstrual cycle. I=
f you can share your thoughts, that can help me in answering people.<br>

women to take part in external rituals during their menstrual cycle? Is it =
strictly ruled out or acceptable for some rituals and unacceptable for some=
 specific ones? What about internal meditation and naama japa? What about s=

 it depend on deity? Also, some people have long cycles where they see some=
