Dear All,
Namaskar,

First of all apologies for non-Jyotisha content but I believe this is more
important and significant than just merely discussing about Stars !!

Please do share with couple are having trouble conceiving.

I have always been coming like Rahu to know about my toota-foota future and
as such I have never got chance to help anybody.

Today, I am sharing with you some useful and vital information for male
fertility issues.

It shall take care of all problems, try, nothing harm in trying, I would
suggest don't go for anything artificial medicine or surgery.

Why? God has created our body naturally so if there is a problem it has to
be cured naturally.

Yoga + Ayurveda has answers to all grief in our life.

Please find below the yoga and associated medicine for male fertility
issues, if there is a substantial request from women community, I can dig
and give some tips there are well.

1. Male fertility issues are less complicated/complex than women fertility
issues.
2. Do following Yogasan and pranayams everyday.

Kapal-bhati pranayam 15mins
Anulom-Vilom Pranayam 15mins
Sarvangasan 5mins
Halasan 5mins
Madukasan 5mins
Shasthasan 5mins

Don't do "Bhastrika" if you have varicocele, it could worsen the issue.

Following Ayurvedic medicine would help for male fertility issues.

Take white musli + shatavar powder + Ashwagandha powder + kaunch seeds, mix
and make powder, take this powder 3-5gms every morning and night alongwith
small or little spoon of cows milk on empty stomach.
100gms each
Kapikacchu - this herb is also great.
Shilajit - brilliant medicine, 1drop each buy from reliable person only
(right and pure form),mix with milk
Ashwagandha powder is also great.
Chandraphabha vati (1 tablet), Yavanamrut vati ( 1 tablet) everyday.

God bless you all.

Please use it for good, use it for procreation, don't use it for lust.

Thank you for reading.

Regards,
Jim.
