Hi Anoopji,

If you are living in the west, it may be essential to emphasiz=
e that there is only ONE God in Hinduism - Brahman. He is the Nirguna form =
(formless). 


Everything else is his manifestation. So the hierarchy of Go=
ds we have, is based on manifestation of His attributes in a Saguna form (m=
anifested form) either in Full or in part.


It may also be mentioned that =
because we have so many Gods in so many different forms, it is obvious that=
 in Hinduism the form itself is not the Ultimate.

Regards
Ram

Su=
bject: [vedic-wisdom] Hierarchy in Hinduism
 

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir and ever=
yone,

We are trying to prepare a chart to explain to teenagers and childre=
n in our place, the hierarchy of God and beings as taught by hinduism. 

Fo=
r this, we have parabrahman or the formless God at the beginning. Parabrahm=
an takes the 6 forms of higher deities like athi parashakti, narayana, shiv=
a, ganapathi, etc as taught by Shankara. Below these we have the trinity re=
presenting the trigunas, Brahma-Vishnu-Rudra, who take care of the triple t=
ask of creation, sustenance and destruction. Below them we have the Gods be=
ginning with Indra and the remaining 33 main devas referenced in the vedas.=
 

Please advise and correct us if our understanding regarding this is prop=
er.

Our further questions which we need some light from everyone else is:
=
1) Where do other beings and demigods like Gandharva, Yaksha, Kinnaras, Aps=
aras, feature in the scheme of things in this hierarchy. Other than those 4=
 I mentioned are there other types of beings?

2) Where do Rishis and Manus=
hya feature in the scheme of things in the same hierarchy?

3) How about Pi=
shaachas, and other beings? 

Please offer any information you can on this =
for us.

Pranams,
Anoop.
