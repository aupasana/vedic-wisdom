Shri Narasimhaji,

Namaste!

Thank you very much for the tarpana manuals!

=
I want to perform the Deva, Rishi and Pitri tarpana as per the manual prepa=
red by you. However, I missed the Amavasya day. 

1. As per the manual, thi=
s tarpana can be performed on any day, any week, any fortnight, and every m=
onth but there are some special days as well. Is it fine to start from the =
coming Saturday/Sunday and then perform it every fortnight?

2. In the manu=
al, after the Rishi tarpana section, one moves to Divya Manushya tarpana. H=
ere, one is supposed to use the same water pot containing the akshatas as i=
n the earlier Rishi tarpana section?

3. After the Divya Manushya tarpana, =
one moves to the Divya Pitri and Pitri sections. Here, one is supposed to p=
ut some black sesame seeds to the water in the pot. Does this mean that one=
 adds the black sesame seeds to the water already containing the akshatas i=
n the water pot? So, one gives tarpana to Divya Pitris and Pitris with wate=
r containing akshatas and sesame seeds or water containing only sesame seed=
s?

I eagerly await your replies to the above questions.

Thanks and best r=
egards,
Manish
