Dear all,

Those who undergo a study of the vedas in a traditional manner used to
divide the year into two halves. For one half of the year, they would
study their branch of the veda. For the other half of the year, they
would study the vedangas (vyakarana, jyotisha etc). Both of these were
important milestones. The ceremony which marked the commencement of
the vedic study for the year was the 'upaakarma'. The ceremony which
marked the end of the vedic study for the year was the 'utsarjana'.
The two words literally mean 'commencement' and 'abandonment'
respectively.

In time, this practice was discontinued, and vedic study continued
throughout the year. The 'utsarjana' ceremony itself was dropped, and
only the 'upaakarma' was retained. Those who study the Rig and Yajur
vedas perform the 'upaakarma' in the full moon of the shravana month
(i.e. tomorrow). Those who study the Sama veda perform it a little
later in the month.

The one and only purpose behind the 'upaakarma' is to restart the
study of the vedas. Everything else is secondary. Leaving aside the
daily rituals that are supposed to be performed each and every day,
this is what is done on the 'upaakarma' day according to the krishna
yajur veda tradition:

1) To atone for the fact that the 'utsarjana' was not performed, the
'kAmokArShiit' japa is performed.
2) A tarpana to the rishis of the vedic branch is performed, for their
blessings before the vedic study starts.
3) veda vyAsa is worshipped in a kalasha, for his blessings before the
vedic study starts.
4) A homa to the rishis of the vedic branch is performed, for their
blessings before the vedic study starts.
5) In the presence of agni, the student starts learning some mantras
of the veda from his teacher.

Today, many people go to a temple, recite the mahasankalpa, change the
yagyopavita, do the kanda rishi tarpana and then come home. In modern
terms, this is like a student who is excited to go to college. He gets
dressed in new clothes, takes the permission of his parents, but
decides not to go to any of his college classes.

Some people do stay for a "ritual vedArambha", which they perform
every year. This is like a student who enrolls in college every year.
He goes to the first day of classes, drops out, and then comes back
for the first day of classes during the following year.

The upaakarma is a commencement ceremony -- the first day of vedic
classes for the year. Those who are interested should arrange for
vedic classes on a regular basis, from a local vedic scholar. In fact,
it is quite surprising that temples organize upakarma programs, but
don't offer any followup classes.

Maybe a few people can work with their local temples / priests. Take
down the names of interested people during the upaakarma, and work
with some vedic scholars to arrange follow-up classses. That would be
much more productive.

sasneham,

   ajit
