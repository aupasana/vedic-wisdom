Hi Prasad,

I have read the first chapter of this Shiva Trilogy which is av=
ailable
freely at Author's website and attached herewith. Origination of th=
ese
books is due to an interesting though process of Author who probably
wo=
ndered "What if a Shiva like person(The way we see in idols) really
existed=
 few thousand years back. What could be his life, how people could
have sta=
rted worshiping him as God." The books have succeeded because they
are writ=
ten in simplified English and represent Puranic stories in a very
believabl=
e way joining the story with Indus civilization.

Now, a big movie is going=
 to be made on these books. A whole new generation
will be introduced to Sh=
iva like the way we were introduced to Ramayan and
Mahabharat seriels 20 ye=
ars back. If you look a little back, the impact
will be no less than what w=
as of Tulsidas when he wrote Ramcharitmanas in
Local language of that time.=
 I am not exaggerating. Ramcharitmanas was not
same as Original Ramayana an=
d that is not important. The important aspect
is that it maintained the ori=
ginal soul from the base book.

Many of readers/movie watchers will subcons=
ciously discard history books
where Indus Valley civilization is considered=
 separate from development of
Hinduism. Most of them would have very little=
 idea of the story from
Shiva's life, they ofcourse can't read Sanskrit. An=
d here is a movie and
book speaking their language introducing a very inter=
esting character and
making him worthy of worship.

So, I disagree with you=
r statement that it is negative in any ways for
anybody.

Regards
Puneet
