Dear All,

I feel for Vasavi  ji who is clearly in pain BUT it also makes m=
e 100% sure
that these kinds of false guilt inductions(By society) led to f=
all of Vedic
religion. Things would have become so much ritualistic and mec=
hanical which
led many intelligent people astray. Guilt introduced for 1000=
s of acts. For
example, some instructions say If u don't get up early in mo=
rning before
sunrise and take bath in open river, you are doomed etc.. u be=
come Maha
papi. Is it possible to follow this instruction at North Pole?

A=
nd before u judge me, I am a vegetarian myself but I know that many of
pack=
aged food items and many innocuous looking stuffs have animal extracts.
Man=
y a times, it is practically impossible to avoid it when we become
Global c=
itizens of world. If we get into guilt traps, then
*GOD* is definitely goin=
g to be extremely angry. If someone has to be
GUILTY, it should be your GOD=
 who created this unintentional situation for
you. Can you now see the whol=
e situation in a different context?

The deep impressions of mind like Guil=
t and fear will definitely introduce
more Karma than the act itself which i=
n my honest opinion does not deserve
even an iota of *Prayaschit* . It is j=
ust  a happening out of a situation
which was not in your control. There ar=
e only 2 learnings:

1. Be more clear in your instructions. Reconfirm it on=
ce u give order.
2. Tell God, I have learned Point 1), don't put me in same=
 situation again
:-)

Regards
Puneet

your such intense repentance is in itself sufficient for the "P=
