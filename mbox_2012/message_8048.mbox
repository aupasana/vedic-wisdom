Oh No Saranyan Ji,

Lalit Bhai =
saa'b is sending such hate mails since 2 years now. most on the list may no=
t be knowing this fact.

At the moment he does not want to "understand". do=
es not want to "See" the big picture and forcefully convinces himself that =
Narasimha is a very big cheat and all the other who value him are fools who=
 are destined to be doomed.

I pray for him that he becomes free from feeli=
ng of hatred as soon as possible. Burden of hatred is one the most unbearab=
le of all.

baki time pe hi sab kuch hoke rahega.

Best Regards,

Utpal
