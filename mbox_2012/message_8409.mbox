 Sivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and especially of P=
urascharana (repeating mantra as many lakhs as there are syllables in the m=
antra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetiti=
ons). He went on to say that 14 crore of japa with feeling would result in =
Darshan of God in physical form, face to face. That would be great! Really =
wanted to do it...but when I did the maths, I worked out that, at the rate =
of 12 hours japa a day, every single day from now on, it would take me till=
 age 83 to finish this. :(

 and began my my first Purascharana of the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in Ja=
nuary this year, I am doing a measley 11 rounds a day, with my mind wanderi=
ng most of the time (hard core people do hundreds of rounds with proper con=
centration daily). I'm a slow chanter, and need to say the mantra loudly or=
 in a barely audible whisper. My mental chanting is gradually improving but=
 very difficult to do for more than 1-2 minutes. It's gonna take me till Oc=
tober 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to take a 3 month break (=
and do 7 rounds a day), and then start another Purascharana.
