Dear PVR Narasimhaji,

Thanks a million for the manual on the Short version=
 of the Satyanarayana Pooja.
Its just awesome.

I know that you are still w=
orking on the Regular version - but few things that would help novices like=
 me
These may be silly questions - but would help me immensely.


The Appen=
dix G - Arrangement of Peetha.
=A0=A0=A0 Could you please indicate the dire=
ction in which the LSN (idol) should face
=A0=A0=A0 Could you indicate wher=
e the person should sit and face as well.


I dont want to jump ahead - but=
 it would nice if you could include these 

1) Navagraha mantras chanted wh=
ile installing each planetary lord. (like for Sun - Japa kusuma sankasham .=
 . .)

2) Our temple chants Mantra pushpam at the close - it would be cool =
if you could include that as well.

One other question I had was=A0
Our tem=
ple has the Pooja place setting (navagrahas, dikpalas, LSN idol etc) on a r=
aised platform (about 1 foot)

Is it mandatory to raise the whole place set=
ting or is it just that the temple is doing it for better viewing.

Any adv=
ice on where we can find the Idol of Lord Satyanarayana.

My apologies if t=
hese questions sound silly.

Thanks again
Shrikanth
