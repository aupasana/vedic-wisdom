Namaste,

If you say so, I would not argue much on that. You are much more =
learned in Shastras.

My basis was Aghora-3 - Law of Karma (Page 100) and i=
 remember of having read Vivekananda's writing in the same Line.
Vimalanand=
a says thus :"That is why there is only one perfect religion :the Veda. It =
is eternal Dharma because there is no question of sin. show me even a singl=
e mention of distinction of sin in the Veda...."

***
However, even if ther=
e is a mention of Sin (Paapa) in Veda, I have a independant opinion on this=
. I am convinced that it is better to look the whole thing as law of Karma =
or Action & Reaction which is the only law without exception. but that is m=
y opinion and every body else is free to ignore.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 That may be probably one of the reason why Vedas does not have mention abo=
