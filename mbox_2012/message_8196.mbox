Namaste:
One of my uncle explained me in a very easy way: let me try to exp=
lain it.

Dhenu Mudra:

1)Join both the palms together.
2)shift Index Finge=
r of left palm such that the tip of that finger is joined with the tip of m=
iddle finger of Right palm AND move Index finger of Right palm such that it=
 touches the tip of middle finger of the left palm.
3)shift Ring Finger of =
left palm such that the tip of that finger is joined with the tip of little=
 finger of Right palm AND join the tips of Ring finger of Right palm & litt=
le finger of the left palm.
4)Tips of both the thumbs are touching each oth=
er.
5) This is Dhenu mudra. point this mudra down words over "Kalash" fille=
d with water which resembles "Anchal of a Cow".

In short it is described a=
s under:

Left Palm        Right palm

Tip of Thumb - Tip of Thumb
       I=
ndex - Middle
       Middle -Index
       Ring  - little
