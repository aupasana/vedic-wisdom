Namaste Ashutosh ji,

My mail is not for you. I think you should follow wha=
t your heart is saying and what you have been advised to do.

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *

This is a more general comment on one line fo=
rm the mail below. Respectfully yet firmly I disagree on one point.

<<Myse=
lf: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in 
Aghore=
 book - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that 
book seri=
es)

PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular =

chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You 
h=
ave to follow it strictly.>.


It is always good to do japa, but "strict" i=
s too strong a word. There are many in different parts of India, well verse=
d in sadhana as well as respective shastras (respective because no single h=
uman being can known all possible Hindu Shastras, so most study that which =
maybe relevant to his line of spiritual inquiry followed in his tradition) =
who do homas without doing any pre-requisite japa. 

One honest question th=
at every sadhaka must ask himself/herself objectively is, how badly do we w=
ant God? If the desire pure and unblemished, or is it also mixed with vario=
us other desires, however small they maybe. If we also want other materiali=
stic things along with it - and there is no harm in wanting legitimate thin=
gs - then one can follow all instructions and rules set for whatever paramp=
ara one is mentally afflicted to and given by his/her Guru(s). 

But if one=
 is desirous of ONLY God without any other desire attached to it, no rule i=
s sufficient, no path is a guarantee, no sadhana is sure-shot way to achiev=
e it.=C2=A0 Working on internal surrender to God and increased detachment i=
n daily life along with and through whatever ritual one performs and in wha=
tever manner, can be more helpful in the long run. Human aspiration alone i=
s not enough. When the aspiration is genuine and pure, He/She extends his/h=
er energy to lift the sadhak up.. this dual phenomenon together make a sadh=
ana success. And this simple yet powerful truth is represented by the six-p=
ointed triangle which is the basic yantra of so many deities, and specially=
 one form of the Mother. The upward triangle is our aspiration, the downwar=
d is Her grace coming down to transform the sadhak from his/her current sta=
te. Together, it makes a complete whole. And grace is purely proportional t=
o the purity of the aspiration, which only God can judge
 accurately.

=C2=A0 
My pranams to all.
I have been perf=
orming weekly havan for more than a year and half.
I want to point out cert=
ain things related to havan so that it can be done as per shastra by others=
 too.
I am using a conversation that in fact took place to bring out these =
relevant points.

Sometime back there was informal "prashNa" session whose =
summary I am presenting below: 

[South Indians might be familiar with simi=
lar "ashTamangala prashNa" conducted in temples when something goes wrong -=
 called as dosha.]

PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm... =
let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni kary=
a at your home regularly.

Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised by th=
is pointed question because I had not told anybody about the havan I did at=
 home)

PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agni karya you a=
re doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti does no=
t seem to be right.

Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).

PrashNa co=
nductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of ghee before givin=
g it as ahuti.

Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart from th=
at?

PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa before giving ahutis? And d=
o you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for your regular japa?=


Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No I =
dont do any pre-defined set of japa?

PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the =
japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantr=
a via meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it shoul=
d be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one=
 is qualified to give 1 ahuti)

Myself: Doesnt that only apply to puraschar=
aNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is al=
ready familiar with that book series)

PrashNa conductor: No it applies to =
anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is alwa=
ys 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.

The conversatio=
n went onto several other things. Subsequently I went on to get mantra-upad=
esha from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra and also using the s=
ame mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ratio only and =
have been very happy with my spiritual progress since. 

Whether all the ho=
ma-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I just wanted to point t=
his out to all requesting everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa of th=
e mantra used for ahuti to get the "qualification" for the ahuti.

Regards,=

Ashutosh
