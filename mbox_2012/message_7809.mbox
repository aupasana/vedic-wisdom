Subject: Satya Narayana vratam - First cut of super-short manual

Namaste friends,

The progress on the Satya Narayana vratam manual has been slow, for lack 
of time. I realized that I have very little time these days, apart from 
spiritual sadhana, work, driving and other daily activities.

I have uploaded the first cut of a "super-short" manual at

http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/pooja/satya_ss_san.pdf (mantras in 
Devanagari script)
http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/pooja/satya_ss_eng.pdf (mantras in 
English script)

These are works in progress. Please feel free to point out errors by 
private email (pvr@...).

I hope to upload a "short" version in a few days. I am still working on 
it. The "regular" version will most probably take a few more weeks.

The purpose of this upload is to get feedback and also make it available 
to anyone who wants to peruse it for the coming Full Moon. They will 
have a couple of days to go through it and prepare.

Once these are ready, versions with mantras written in Telugu, Kannada, 
Gujarati etc will be prepared. That will take a while.

In the next few months, homam and fire yoga manuals will also be 
re-edited and streamlined. Manual will be split into two manuals giving 
why and how. If you have any suggestions, please send them to me by 
private email (pvr@...).

Best regards,
Narasimha
