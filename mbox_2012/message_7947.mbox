Every object in the universe is endowed with four characteristics: dharma,
=
karma, prema and gyana. Of these, karma is the most talked about; it is
als=
o the most misunderstood. The Gita says: "Gahna Karmanyo Gathi" --
Unfathom=
able are the ways of karma. ****

** **

There are three types of karma: Pr=
arabha, sanchita and agami. The first is
latent karma, an impression or see=
d of action. The second is karma as
action, and the third is karma as resul=
t. Prarabha means 'begun'; the
action that is already manifesting and that =
is yielding its effect right
now. You cannot avoid it or change it, as it i=
s already happening. Sanchita
is accumulated karma. It is latent or manifes=
ted in the form of a tendency
or impression in the mind. ****

** **

Sanch=
ita karma can be burned off by spiritual practices before it
manifests. Aga=
mi karma is the future karma of action; that which has not
yet come and whi=
ch will take effect in the future. If you commit a crime,
you may not get c=
aught today, but will live with the possibility that one
day you may get ca=
ught. ****

** **

Karma is also always bound by time, because every action=
 has a limited
reaction. If you do something good to people they will come =
to thank you
and be grateful to you as long as they are experiencing the ef=
fect of your
action. So, karma has only a limited sphere of its effect, be =
it good or
bad. ****

** **

*It is often asked, "Why are good people made =
to suffer while those who
commit injustice go unpunished?" Such questions a=
rise when we see an event
in its limited framework. No good action will yie=
ld a bad result and no bad
action will bring a good result. This is the law=
 of karma. As you sow, so
shall you reap. If you sow a mango tree, some tho=
rny bushes may come up
because of the seeds present in the manure brought f=
rom somewhere else. It
is not the mango seed that brings up the thorny bush=
. Your mango seed will
bring mango fruit, in due course. *

** **

Karma is=
 that which propels reincarnation. The stronger the impression, the
greater=
 the possibility of the next life being according to that. So, often
you re=
incarnate like the person you hate or love. The mind which is full of
diffe=
rent impressions leaves this body but the impressions await suitable
situat=
ions to come back. So the last thought is very important. Whatever
you do t=
hroughout your life, in the last moment your mind should be free
and happy.=
 ****

** **

Our perception of suffering, of good and bad, is always relat=
ive. God is
absolute reality; a witness of all. See God as movie director, =
rather than
as a judge. He has no ill feeling for the villain and no specia=
l favour for
the hero. Each one is playing her role. ****

** **

An awaren=
ess of dharma helps in comprehending the strange ways of karma.
Whenever yo=
u see bad karma or someone suffering, you need to help. That is
your dharma=
. If you do not do your dharma, then you incur bad karma for not
having don=
e your dharma. Take recourse in your dharma to transcend the
bondage of kar=
ma and avoid getting stuck with events or personalities. Live
with karma; d=
on't be attached to it. 'See action in inaction and inaction
in action' say=
s the Gita. Awareness, alertness, knowledge and meditation
will help erase =
past impressions. It has the strength to dissolve and
destroy any karma and=
 free you.****
