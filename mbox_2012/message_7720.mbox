VARANASI: If you believe that orthodox scenario that has prohibited wom=
en
performing various religious rituals still prevails, you are sadly mista=
ken.
Banaras, which boasts of its religious richness and diversity, is witn=
essing a
good number of women priests.

Increasing number of women helping =
devotees with prayers and rituals on ghats
and temples and performing ritua=
ls of 'karma kand' at various homes and
organisations evidently reflects th=
is fact.

A Durga temple in Dhoopchandi area has been boasting of such wome=
n priests since
time immemorial. According to Radhe Shyam Vishwakarma (57),=
 a local and a
regular visitor to the temple, women are generally the wives=
 of the male priests
and are equally aware of the rituals and tradition of =
leading the puja ceremony
in a Hindu temple.

It is worth mentioning here t=
hat the temple, which already brakes the fanatic
ideology that only Brahmin=
s can have access to the temple and lead the prayers,
is actually looked af=
ter and managed by members from boatmen community. "There
is no methodologi=
cal training that we are provided with which is given at
universities and g=
urukuls. However, the tradition is on since generations and we
follow what =
our elders tell us to do. But, we only know the tradition of
performing rit=
uals at this temple of Goddess Durga and do not go out to perform
similar r=
ituals for the common man," informed Poonam (31), a priests and member
of b=
oatment community.

As many as seven women priests from the same group of b=
oatmen are there in the
temple and take their duty according to a given sch=
edule. "We do not mind giving
the prasad and flowers to women inside the te=
mple. They offer it to the deity
and bless us. Moreover, they are more conc=
erned and systematic as compared to
the male priests," says Jyoti Soni, a d=
evotee.

Kusum Devi, a 64-year-old woman, has been sitting at Kal Bhairo te=
mple for the
past 30 years and has been guiding devotees and helping them w=
ith rituals to
escape various diseases, problems and adversities. "There ar=
e many male priests
too but people trust Kusum Devi more for her effective =
healing prayers," says
Manoj, a flower vendor outside the temple. According=
 to Kusum, the healing
prayers are easy to learn but need proper practice a=
nd concentration. However,
she accepts that they are not very well stocked =
with mythological wisdom.

Apart from less methodological path of attaining=
 priesthood by women, a gurukul
Panini Kanya Mahavidyalaya in the Mehmoorga=
nj is breaking the 5,000-year-old law
of Manusmriti that women cannot perfo=
rm religious rites, enchant hymes or read
Vedas.

According to Acharya Prit=
i Vimarshini of the gurukul, the 40-year-old
institution exclusively for gi=
rls has been imparting Vedic knowledge to as many
as 60 girls every year. "=
The girls are being trained in performing Karma Kands,
Sanskars and are tau=
ght Sanskrit, Vedas, Ashtadhyayi and Indian philosophy,"
says Priti. Moreov=
er, the gurukul follows Vedic system rather than caste system
and girls fro=
m different castes, including dalit, attain priesthood here after
following=
 rigorous hard work and studies.

"We invite girls from Panini Kanya Mahavi=
dyalaya for every ritual at our home.
They follow a systematic method and a=
ll the hymns and rites they perform are
very peaceful and serene," says Rah=
ul Srivastava, a resident of Pandeypur.
"These young girls perform much eff=
ective rites than any male Brahmin or
priest," says Dinesh Barnwal, a resid=
ent of Chowk.
