everything ready for my homam, and got coconut copra and sliced them into p=
ieces. However the white part is juicy and when I experimented with it, it =
does not burn even after staying in the fire for quite a long time! Today i=

ha Ji, you have mentioned that fire can be done with wood instead of coconu=
t. So if I do the fire with twig or wood, the only time I would need coconu=
t is for Purnahuti. Since dry coconut is not available now, can I do purnah=
uti with a big stream of spoonful ghee? Logically it might be acceptable, s=
ince I am offering only ghee as ahuti, so why not a big amount of ghee as p=
urna (full) ahuti? Also I read in the archieve that in deepa-homam, purnahu=
ti can be done with ghee.
