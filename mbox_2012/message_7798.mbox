Narasimha Ji

Could you also explain how the five elements derive from each=
 other and how this can be decoded with respect to the deities.

In Tattwa =
Sadhana

Ether gives rise to Air which gives rise to Water which gives rise=
 to Fire and which gives rise to Earth.Each being an one level less subtle =
than the other.

I suppose the praying to the five elements purifies the in=
ner subtle five elements leading to Bhoota Shuddhi which vimalananda mentio=
ns in his books.
