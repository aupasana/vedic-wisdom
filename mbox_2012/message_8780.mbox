Namaste Rajarshiji,

Thank you for the message....I found it very interes=
ting.

I can accept that what you say about purascharana is true. I certain=
ly cannot claim to have established this Purusha consciousness perfectly wi=
thin myself. I am therefore not doing a 'true' purascharana in the way you =
describe.

Based on what I had previously read, I thought 'Purascharana' wa=
s a certain number of repetitions of the Name or Mantra of God, as a suppli=
cation or prayer, with proper feeling. Even this is difficult for me at tim=
es. Sometimes I say the mantra with feeling, sometimes with boredom (and ch=
ecking the clock to see when japa time will be over). Sometimes I barely ma=
nage to fit in the number of malas I have set for myself in the day. Luckil=
y, though God's grace, I am kind of on track, if only in terms of doing a c=
ertain number of repetitions in a certain amount of time.

So basically, I =
guess I am not doing Purascharana in the way you describe...I guess that I =
doing a japa practice, that involves a certain number of repetitions in a c=
ertain period of time.

I feel comforted by this practice, and feel it's th=
e right thing for me to do. I feel one doesn't have to be qualified to do J=
apa....the Japa gives one all the qualifications that one lack's including =
proper devotion. 

Sivananda says that even mechanical repetition has some =
effect, though repetition with feeling is ideal. This helps me to do japa, =
when my mind rebels saying "there is no feeling!"....I tell myself, some ja=
pa is better than no japa!

The way I mentally see my sadhana is:

1. Japa =
with some feeling, devotion- Ideal
2. Japa with no feeling- Not ideal, but =
still better than no japa
3. No japa at all during the day- very bad. Worst=
 case scenario. :)

Thanks for the information about Purascharana. I hope t=
he Japa qualifies me to do a true Purascharana one day. :)

Om Namo Narayan=
aya

Aparna
