Namaste Utpalji,

I had a great experience with the MahaGanapathi homam tod=
ay!

In the beginning I was a little anxious about being able to do it on m=
y own,
thinking too much about the technicalities. However, fortunately, on=
ce I started
doing the homam, that anxious feeling gave way to feeling of d=
evotion and
surrender to Ganapathi:) I may have made several mistakes but I=
 wasn't bogged
down by them and in the middle as well as in the end, felt p=
eace and happiness!

Many thanks once again,
Best regards,
Manish
