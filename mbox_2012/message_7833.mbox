Dear Narsimha sir,
I am new member of vedic wisdom group. I have read your book "vedic wisdom " ( compilation of questions of sadhakas. By getting inspiration I have started chanting Gayatri Mantra daily for one and half hour early in the morning.( 4.00 am ). Initially I have some starange vision which i cant explain, then one day my whole body was vibrating. This has happened two times. So i am a bit confused what to do next.Now I am not feeling that kind of experience. 
Pls explain how to meditate further on.
Regards,
Amit Acharya
