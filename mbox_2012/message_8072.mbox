Namaste Narasimha Ji and other members

I have performed a super-short Shan=
i Homam this evening. I thank you for guiding me so detailed... without you=
r manual it would never be possible.

Interesting point to note, that in De=
c of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Brahmin family for about 10 day=
s and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing homam! However I was =
disappoint because their procedure was so big that it would take about 3 ho=
urs for the homam, and many more materials also. Of course, they learnt it =
from 'guru-kulam' and it was their own tradition. They are not a modern res=
earcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who could compare many traditions, research=
 on them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had no idea that a =
shorter version is possible, or something can be left out. As an example, t=
hey suggested a mantadory japam of 10x times before I do an 'x' times offer=
ing in homam, and many more formalities.

So, I knew in Bangladesh I would =
never have so much materials needed, and I would not be able to perform a 3=
 hour homam regularly, so it was of no use. 

Much later when I was reading=
 your manual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :=
-)

Anyway Ji...

Everything was almost as per recommendation, except I use=
d a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I couldn't manage a wooden spoon =
even after a lot of effort. May be I have to order it... but I will have to=
 work much hard to find a craft-man who can make a spoon with wood.

I burn=
t the fire with mango-wood and jute-sticks.

Purnahuti with ghee only.

Tha=
t WAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an idea how fast the=
 woods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I knew that with=
 a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire will not survive long to all=
ow me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning out fast.

So I =
could not meditate.

My first Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can=
 I make the fire last long so that it burns for at least 10 mins allowing m=
e mediate? I noted even if I had put much wood, they would still burn out f=
ast...

Offering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing that would =
keep the fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.

Another Q. - 2) I =
have sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I can dry the=
m no matter how long it takes, so that I can use them as suggested in the m=
anual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a "FULL" coconut so much that=
 it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts... =
but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rotte=
n or something? Any procedure? I am asking this because here no one has any=
 idea about that, because no one even thinks of having "burnable" full coco=
nuts. That is why.

Mantras work very strong for me. But I feel not strong =
enough for big spiritual or material effects. I have had very strong experi=
ences with homam before while performing with others. Even a few times I *a=
rranged* homams for others and I always directly felt a strong effect worki=
ng on me also.

Today with the homam, the effect was not that strong. I kno=
w why, because it was a super-short homam, with many mantras left. Also, I =
should honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva=
 in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worried a=
nd nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their presenc=
e. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.

I am going to add ma=
ntras from the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed in all homa=
ms like Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I guess Avahana-=
related Sanskrit mantras are very important.

By the way I did 108 offering=
s with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with the smallest Shan=
i mantra again.

I am thankful to the ultimate divinity that at least I did=
n't have any negative experience after the homam. I was pretty nervous abou=
t the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 when I started mantras, a=
lmost everyday I faced negative energies for the imperfection of pronunciat=
ion and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so strong. But I didn't gi=
ve up and tried to understand the correct ways because since I saw the powe=
r in it, I had to find what's the right way to get the pure blessings, avoi=
ding mistakes.

As an example, you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to stay in an =
empty stomach while doing homam. I find this 100% true from my mantra japam=
 experience. Though no website or almost no one instructed me to stay empty=
 stomached in japam, I found that mantras work very strong with empty stoma=
ch. Also, I always got strong negative effects when I did japam after my di=
nner. Thus, I learned this from my own experience but after a lot of troubl=
es faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now days, I can't eat anything af=
ter my lunch... because I do mantras in the evening. At times it becomes ve=
ry difficult not to eat something as I sometimes hang out with friends etc.=
 at afternoon or early evening. But I have no choice.

That is the thing I =
appreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very important] =
things always mentioned.

Same thing about your instruction of minimum move=
ment of the body, I find it very correct.

Anyway Ji I guess I am stretchin=
g my mail very long...

my 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani a=
s an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer other=
 Gods' mantras in fire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way, or at leas=
t a homam for 6-7 grahas?

4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order suc=
h as Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?

5) Is there any exceptional instructi=
on while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?

Wanted to =
mention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and other deiti=
es but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these additional =
questions about graha-homams.

Appreciate your time to answer me.

Thanking=
 you again,
Tanvir
