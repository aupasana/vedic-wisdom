We live most of our life through three states of consciousness: waking,
dre=
aming and sleeping. ****

** **

In the waking state of consciousness, we e=
xperience the world through the
five senses through which we seek elevation=
 and joy. If any one of the
senses is missing, the entire dimension of that=
 sense is lost. When you
cannot hear you are bereft of the whole arena of s=
ound. Similarly, when you
cannot see you are deprived of all beautiful sigh=
ts and colours. So, the
sense is more important and much bigger than object=
 of sense. ****

** **

The mind is higher than senses; it is infinite, wit=
h many desires but the
capacity of senses to enjoy is limited. Greed wants =
more and more of
sensory objects. Even though you can only enjoy a limited =
amount during a
lifetime, you want all the wealth in the world. ****

** **=


Giving too much importance to sensory objects leads to greed; giving too
=
much importance to the senses leads to lust; and giving too much importance=

to the mind and its desires leads to delusion. ****

** **

We cling to mi=
nd concepts and want things to happen in a certain way. Thus,
they impede u=
s from perceiving infinite consciousness that is part of us.
All mind sense=
s are not bad; learn to discriminate and be aware of what is
happening at a=
ll times so that there is clarity. This is the first step
toward higher sta=
te of consciousness. ****

** **

In the waking state, you are constantly e=
ngaged in looking, eating, working
and other pursuits. Sleeping state is wh=
ere you are completely cut off and
dull. Dullness and heaviness linger even=
 after waking. The more you sleep,
the duller you feel since much energy is=
 expended in sleep. In the dreaming
state you are neither asleep nor awake.=
 Here, you neither feel at rest nor
are aware of your surroundings. ****

*=
* **

Higher state of consciousness is somewhere between the waking, sleepi=
ng and
dreaming states. Here, we know we "are" but we don't know "where" we=
 are.
This knowledge I "am," but don't know "where" I am or "what" I am, is=

called Shiva. This state gives the deepest possible rest that one can
expe=
rience. And you can achieve this through meditation. ****

** **

Meditatio=
n prevents stress from entering the system and also releases
accumulated st=
ress. With the assimilation of meditation into daily life, a
higher, cosmic=
 state of consciousness dawns within. Cosmic consciousness
perceives the wh=
ole universe as part of oneself. Then love flows between us
and the world, =
empowering us to overcome opposing forces and disturbances.
Anger and disap=
pointments become fleeting emotions. ****

** **

Higher state of conscious=
ness will not suddenly happen one fine morning.
The sapling of consciousnes=
s is within you -- nurture it through spiritual
practices like meditation. =
Some coconut trees yield in three years, some in
10 years. And those that a=
re not nurtured never yield, they simply exist. **
**

** **

Attaining hig=
her states of consciousness demands no complicated strategy;
just learn the=
 art of letting go. The confluence of knowledge,
understanding and practice=
 makes life complete. When you grow into higher
states of consciousness, yo=
u are no longer thrown off-balance by situations
and disturbances. You beco=
me strong yet soft -- a delicate and beautiful
individual capable of accomm=
odating different values in life without
conditions. As your consciousness =
opens and you get physically, mentally
and spiritually elevated, life truly=
 becomes worth living. ****
