, Anarchism and the political Left in general are Utopian in nature.
>

eactionary, on the contrary, is primarily past-oriented[5] and looks toward=
 a "better, more ordered time", that is historically usually no more than s=
everal generations previous to the present era, as the archetypal hallmark =
and model for present-day cultural renewal.  As Nicol=E1s G=F3mez D=E1vila =
 explains the mindset of the reactionary: "The reactionary is, nevertheless=
, the fool who takes up the vanity of condemning history and the immorality=
 of resigning himself to it." American reactionaries, for example, tend to =
see the 1950s as the apex of American civilization. As is clear from the te=
rm itself, reactionaries are capable only of reacting to assaults on tradit=
ion that they detect around them, and are usually incapable of proffering p=
ro-active and positive ideas for how to foundationally transform society fo=
r the better in the face of modernity's degenerate encroachment upon tradit=
ional values and culture. Reactionaries are especially known for timidity, =
intellectual incuriosity, lack of vision, as well as narrow parochialism an=
d immaturely expressed xenophobia.  Republicans, Tories, and the conservati=
ve Right in general fall under this general heading. Utopian and Reactionar=
y represent the two furthest opposing extremes of the political spectrum.
>=
 
> Revolutionary, on the other hand, describes a political stance that is =
proactive and constructive in nature, rather than merely utopian or reactio=
nary.  Rather than supporting either unrealistic utopian goals, or merely r=
eacting in an ineffectively knee-jerk fashion to the incessant attacks of i=
ts opponents,  the revolutionary perspective proffers positive systemic cha=
nge designed to transform the basic characteristics of a presently-given so=
cial reality in a wholly original and fundamental way.  Revolutionaries see=
k to alter society, not merely peripherally and incrementally, but foundati=
onally and swiftly.

revolutionary perspective looks at the ancient past (and not merely two or =
three generations back, but millennia back) as the source from which to der=

reate a radically better future. The Dharmic revolutionary subscribes to an=
 archeofuturism, to use Guillaume Faye's instructive terminology.[6] Rather=
 than merely dreaming about an unobtainable future based upon blind faith a=

to the negative occurrences happening around them, revolutionaries seek sys=

> 
> The term "=
Revolutionary" tends to carry with it the stereotyped, and wholly inaccurat=
e, notion of political violence, which is not at all the technical denotati=
on of this word in political science terminology.  Rather, by "Revolutionar=
