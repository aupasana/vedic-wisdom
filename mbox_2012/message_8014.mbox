Namaste Narasimha Rao Ji,

I believe you live in Boston area. I will =
be visiting my inlaws living in Lowell during March school break here in Ca=
nada which is next week. Is it possible to meet you? I usually visit once e=
very year but now since my wifes parents will be moving back to India this =
summer, probably my last trip for the foreseeable future.

Namaste,

Yes, it=

even if you =
pray to multiple deities, deities are much better at working 
together than=
 us, human beings. So, it is not something to worry. 
However, surrendering=

approach.

Thanks,

Namaste Sir,

Yes, any of the higher devatas,=
 like Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Saraswati, 
Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Chandi, Rama, K=
rishna, Narasimha and Hanuman, are 
certainly capable of giving anything. H=
owever, as they have a huge 
repertoire of things they can give and a nice =
judgment on what is good 
for you, they may or may not give you what you as=
ked for right away. 
They may give you something else that is better for yo=
u (from the 
perspective of that deity - this can change from one deity to =
another, 
but all deities have much better judgment than you!). Or, they ma=
y first 
give you some responsibilities that prepare you for using what you=
 asked 
for well, and give you what you asked for later.

In comparison, lo=
wer beings such as Yakshas and Yakshinis have dominion 
over specific thing=
s and they give them to you if they are pleased. When 
you approach them, y=
ou are taking extra responsibility for what you are 
asking for and the con=
sequences of getting it. It may work faster, but 
comes with a risk. It may=
 even compromise your spiritual progress. Most 
of these sadhanas will be h=
idden or corrupted as Kali yuga progresses. 
With sadhana of higher deities=
, things may not work too fast or be too 
straight-forward, but there is le=
ss risk.

Thanks,
Narasimha

Namaste=
,

Of course, one can make offerings in homam to Yakshas. One can even make=
 
offerings to rakshasas. For example, one of the dikpalakas (Nirriti) is 
=
a raakshasa and we do make offerings in homam.

There are many mantras for =
Kubera. Find one.

One homam known in tradition for Kubera is called "Kuber=
a Paashupata 
Homam". The main mantra is the last verse in standard Mantra =
Pushpam (OM 
rAjAdhirAjAya prasahyasAhine ... kuberAya vaishravaNAya mahArA=
jAya 
namaH). There are many other mantras too.

Thanks,

Narasimha
