Hi,
=A0
Don't worry about bothering me and ask such questions when you have=
 them.
=A0
As this reply can be useful to other people also, I am cc'ing it=
 to the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. I am doing it without revealing your ident=
ity.

> as ever?
=A0
Though correct, this is a dangerous not=
ion for most people. True, atma cannot be poluted and is beyond desires and=
 actions. But most people do not identify with atma. They identify with a p=
erishable body. So all the talk of "all is atma and atma is pure" is just t=
heory.
=A0
Atma is like an ocean in which waves and rippes arise and move. =
Ocean does not get shattered when ripples hit each other and stays the same=
. But bodies, minds and other perishable objects arising in atma are like w=
aves and ripples arising and moving in ocean. They increase, decrease, get =
shattered etc. One identifying with the ocean of atma is beyond happiness a=
nd sadness. One identifying with the ripple of a body will experience happi=
ness, sadness etc.
=A0
Suppose one is watching a movie and knows that it is=
 not real and just a movie. Still, when a really scary scene comes, one may=
 be startled. Mere intellectual understanding that it is not real and just =
a movie, is not enough. It has to be ingrained fully in one's instincts. Si=
milarly, intellectually knowing that all this is a play and not real, is no=
t enough. When some really pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL =
identify with the body and experience something.
=A0
If Shankara was fully =
enlightened before that episode (we don't know that for sure), then the act=
ion would not have bound him. Otherwise, it would've created a rina. If he =
experienced some pleasure, he would create a new rina to the queen, to vari=
ous deities (!) who live within one's consciousness and operate various par=
ts of one's body and mind, and to various beings in his virya who may have =
been significantly affected. He would have to pay those debts back later.

There is nothing ab=

 the actor that makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actions are =
more dirty than selfless actions geared at others. More so, the denser and =
more selfish one's conditioning.

=A0
Only still ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Simi=
larly only ummanifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new s=
rishti/creation) does not have any objects and actions within it. Atma duri=
ng a srishti cycle does have many objects within it and many actions betwee=
n them.
=A0
Thus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest an=
d doing nothing. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized pers=
on identifies with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like =
his/her actions. One does not particularly identify with what one's old bod=
y specifically does (based on previous momentum).
=A0
Nature uses such real=
ized people to set good examples for the world. So they do engage in some a=
ctions. They have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do whateve=
r spontaneously occurs to them.
=A0
Shankara performing last rites for moth=
er would've made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an example for future=
. One's interaction with the world is give & take. We give things to others=
 and take things from them. True renunciation is in renouncing what we take=
. There is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant notion of sannyasa wa=
s to cut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated giving others (e.g. moth=
er) sannyasa.
=A0
Swami Vivekananda and Swami Sivananda took this further. =
They engaged in a lot of service for the society, unlike other sannyasis wh=
o lock themselves in isolation.
=A0
Of course, if the act of "giving" incre=
ases pride (i.e. you are "taking" something in return of what you are givin=
g!!!), then a sannyasi better isolate oneself from the world and neither gi=
ve nor take (except absolute essentials for survival). But, when one progre=
sses beyond some level, it is a good idea to "give" what one is in a positi=
on to give others.
=A0
The purpose of life is to give and not to take, thou=
gh some taking is unavoidable in the process of giving. Focus on what you g=
ive and not on what you take.

=A0
Various good and bad thoughts come to mind c=
ontinuously, for it is the nature of mind! As long as one is alive, the for=
ce that runs one's existence creates thoughts in the mind. This force is ba=
sed on the momentum from various notions one was exposed to and various des=
ires one entertained, during various lives. It is called "mental conditioni=
ng".
=A0
Can it be controlled? Yes, in the sense that one can add new notio=
ns and new desires to this driving force and the its direction can be slowl=
y refined over time.
=A0
Mind is the problem and mind is the key to the sol=
ution as well. Use mind to change the direction of mind.

I don't know a=
bout 100%, but I do not know one can modify one's thinking over time.
