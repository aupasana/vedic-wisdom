Dear PVR Narsimha Garu/Or other great sadhakas in the group,

I adore Sapta=
shati and fond of reading/reciting/meditating on it.  I recently came acros=
s something called Navashati.  Some how it did not feel right that some one=
 was trying to find faults with Saptashati.

Here is a link that I found

h=
ttp://navasathi.blogspot.com/2011/11/sri-devi-mahatmyam-chandi-navasati.htm=
l

For me Saptashati feels complete, right and resonates well.  

Please co=
mment if you care to on this Navashati which was raised by one. 

Regards,
=
Kris.
