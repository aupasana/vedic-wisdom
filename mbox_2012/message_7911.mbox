Namaste,

How exactly is it determined that it is being "wasted"? Foo=
d is what you buy to eat and consume, but in the end if you do not consume =
that and throw it away your purpose is defeated, your aim for buying the fo=
od has been lost. THAT is wastage.
=C2=A0
When you buy ghree/til/rice for a=
ny puja -=C2=A0not just homa -=C2=A0are you buying with the intention of co=
nsuming them yourself or for using it in the ritual? If you are using it in=
 the ritual, then=C2=A0it can hardly be called wastage.=C2=A0The ritual pro=
vides spiritual sustenance which is as important as material sustenance, at=
 least for some people. Secondly, coming to consumable food, does "ghee" - =
which is the prime ingredient in any homa - feature among the top intensive=
 edible subtance?=C2=A0Rarely. For most people ghee is consumed as food in =
very, very measuerd proportions, if at all it is consumed. Cooked rice, rot=

, yes. But=C2=A0ghee? Rarely.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
However if one needs to a small =
ganapati homa and one buys 5 kgs of ghee of which maybe 200 gms are used an=
d the rest is thrown away, THEN it is a wastage, not of "food", but of mate=
rial which was bought with a certain intention and left un-used.

Wastage i=
n anything is bad. Over consumption of anything, be it food or clothes, spa=
ce or time is always bad. Nature abhors over consumption.=C2=A0One needs a =
house to stay so buy/rent=C2=A0a house, Fine. Now if I think I have excess =
of money and have nothing better to do with it, so I buy 5 houses just for =
joy of hoarding, that is over consumption. I need one dress, I buy five bec=
ause I like it. Thats over consumption.=C2=A0This is a disease of the age w=
hich drives smaller human behaviour patterns to larger economies. It will c=
rash for sure. One day.
=C2=A0
Someone had once asked me, why spend so much=
 on ghee for homas when you can feed so many people with that money? I repl=
ied that since=C2=A0you are not=C2=A0doing homas, why can't I find the free=
-food service queue for the poor outside your house, from money that you hy=
pothetically saved by not doing any homas? Its all good to lecture from the=
 comfort of a middle-class life. It is entirely another matter to actually =
do something about what ones feels, incase one is genuinely interested.

Respect Sir,
=C2=A0
If you had the time to read a=
ll the accepted Shastras and list down all the instructions given therein, =
you will realize it is impossible to satisfy all conditions. Infact, often =
they are contradictory. Why? Because each shastras is powerful and valid fo=
r a particular time, place and cultural setting. At one point it was consid=
ered leaving ones "desh" and crossing an ocean was a terrific sin. What is =
"desh"? India the country did not exist. Ones village was ones desh and eve=
rything around, from the next village to the end of the landmass was all "v=
idesh". So if I apply that logic today, how many people in this forum have =
already committed this great "sin"? Nearly everyone. Because the settings h=
ave changed. 
=C2=A0
The Vedas are considered an eternal book, because the =
Veda samhitas contain descriptions of spiritual states in allegorical form.=
 They are not a book=C2=A0of good ethical living.=C2=A0Apart from the core-=
veda samhitas, all dharmic rulebooks are never ment for eternity. In change=
d scenarios, they too must undergo change. But based on what? A natural sen=
se of right and wrong, proportion and disproportion, arising out=C2=A0of=C2=
=A0a clear heart. There is no greater rule book for ethical living than one=
s own heart. Follow it, and you won't be disappointed. If you keep followin=
g your heart through thick and thin, the sense of right and wrong (discrimi=
nation)=C2=A0will develop in such a fashion=C2=A0that you won't need sancti=
on from anywhere,=C2=A0but your own self,=C2=A0for your actions. That is cr=
eating a Viveka-chudamani.
=C2=A0
Wasting food anyway is a bad habit. We kn=
ow it. Feeding the needy whenever possible is always a good habit. That too=
 we know.=C2=A0=C2=A0Feed others, human or animal whenever you can, and whe=
n you can't; don't bother. Most important of all, don't bother about violat=

Namasthe,
To my knowledge, i understand that, as per our scriptu=
res=C2=A0one (grihasta)=C2=A0 should take=C2=A0yhe food after serving the n=
eedy (Athithi). So one should wait for the arrival of guest before taking f=

s, how can we fulfill the requirements of the shastras may kindly b advised=
.
With pranams,
Suryanarayanan.M

Namaste Sir,

Thank you for the reply. 

Your message reminded of st=
ory of Saint Tiruvalluvar. He used to place a toothpick and a bowl of water=
 while eating. Whenver a grain of rice fell, he used to pick it up with the=
 toothpick rinse it in water and eat it thereafter.

<DIV><SPAN>If you had the time to read all the accepted Shastras and list =
down all the instructions given therein, you will realize it is impossible =
to satisfy all conditions. Infact, often they are contradictory. Why? Becau=
se each shastras is powerful and valid for a particular time, place and cul=
tural setting. At one point it was considered leaving ones "desh" and cross=
ing an ocean was a terrific sin. What is "desh"? India the country did not =
exist. Ones village was ones desh and everything around, from the next vill=
age to the end of the landmass was all "videsh". So if I apply that logic t=
oday, how many people in this forum have already committed this great "sin"=
? Nearly everyone. Because the settings have changed. </SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><S=

<DIV><SPAN>The Vedas are considered an eternal book=
, because the Veda samhitas contain descriptions of spiritual states in all=
egorical form. They are not a book of good ethical living. Apart =
from the core-veda samhitas, all dharmic rulebooks are never ment for etern=
ity. In changed scenarios, they too must undergo change. But based on what?=
 A natural sense of right and wrong, proportion and disproportion, arising =
out of a clear heart. There is no greater rule book for ethical l=
iving than ones own heart. Follow it, and you won't be disappointed. If you=
 keep following your heart through thick and thin, the sense of right and w=
rong (discrimination) will develop in such a fashion that you won=
't need sanction from anywhere, but your own self, for your actio=
ns. That is creating a Viveka-chudamani.</SPAN></DIV>

<DIV><SPAN>Wasting food anyway is a bad habit. We know it. Feedin=

don't bother. Most important of all, don't bother about violating a ruleboo=
