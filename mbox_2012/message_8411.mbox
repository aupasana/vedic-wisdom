Just found this bare mimimum homam procedure....thanks for posting this Nar=
asimha ji....this is exactly what I was looking for- glad I found it. It's =
the best I can manage at present.

Also many thanks for the various homam m=
anuals online....I'm looking forward trying more of these in the coming mon=
ths and years.

Thought I would highlight this post for any other new membe=
rs who are looking for a brief homam procedure that can be done a few times=
 a week.

Best wishes,

Aparna
