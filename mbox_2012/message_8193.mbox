Dear learned friends,I was going through the video of Ganapati honam on ved=
icastrologer.org so that I could include the mudras in my havan. The Dhenu =
mudra that is used in kalash suddhi is not clear to me. I will be highly th=
ankful if it is clarified to me. Earlier, I had learnt Surabhi Mudra in whi=
ch the little finger touches ring finger of other hand and vice versa, midd=
le finger touches index finger of other hand and vice versa, the thumbs sep=
arated.The mudra that I had learnt appears similar to the dhenu mudra shown=
 in video eccept for the fact that the thumbs are joined at tips in the vid=
eo. Further both Dhunu and Surabhi means cow. Are the same? What is the cor=
rect way of doing this mudra? =A0Waiting for your reply.
Nawal=A0
