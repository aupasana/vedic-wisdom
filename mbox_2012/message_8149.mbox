Namaste Respected members,

Kindly comment on significance of Archana done =
at temples. What is the significance of doing Archana? Whose names/stars al=
ong with gotram should be given when the priest asks before Archana, for ex=
ample, can we give any number of names  belonging to different gotrams or o=
ne should stick with name/star and gotram who paid for the Archana, may be =
add family, or, is it really necessary to give name(s), or, can one give on=
e's parents name, or even just the diety's name to which the archana is bei=
ng offered? Is it necessary to pay separately  for each gotram?

Best regar=
ds,
Aravind
