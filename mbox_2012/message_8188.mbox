=
and then offer tambulam, naivedyam and mangaLa aarathi

 god with turmeric paste, kumkum and pour water. what is the significance a=
nd after which step should this be performed?is it similar to offering kumk=
um and turmeric, if yest, why=A0=A0 should water be used to clean it?

nything else. i am also looking for pranapratishthapan mantras for all abov=
e three . All the books have super mini version of mantra but not detailed.=
