Hello Narsimhaji,

Pranam. 

Thanks for announcing the day for releasing th=
e Satyanarayan vratram manual. I was waiting for this one for a long time. =
Many times I thought to send an email regarding this, but then didn't  do, =
thinking that it was not appropriate to ask Guru to give something, when ti=
me comes Guru would give it by himself, and looks like the time is coming n=
ow.

10-12 years ago you changed the astrology world by offering free softw=
are and free astrology teachings. A few years ago, you started the homam mo=
vement to benefit people and now I see a new movement getting started with =
Satya Narayana Vratam and Pooja manual.

Satya Narayana pooja is the most c=
ommon pooja which most of the people in every part of India do, but with my=
 limited experience in North India, not many people know the exact method o=
f doing it. This pooja is done every month at my house, my dad's house and =
several families do that I know of. All we do is just read the katha bookle=
t and sing the prayer in the end. Better than not doing anything, but not t=
he most right way of doing. I feel with your manual, we would learn the rig=
ht way of doing this pooja and vratam, and I am sure this manual  is going =
to benefit large number of people across the world.

Thanks

Regards

Vikra=
