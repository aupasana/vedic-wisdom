Namaste and pranaams Narasimha,

I am unable to understand your reluctance=
 to answer to the email thread
on Chandi dhanam.

There seems to be a contr=
adiction between what you mentioned in the
email and the Chandi homam manua=
l which authored.

Please don't misunderstand my intention for repeated pro=
mpts for a
reply.  It is only to clear my understanding on the difference b=
etween
your email and the Chandi homam manual.

I hope you will reply.

War=
mest regards..
