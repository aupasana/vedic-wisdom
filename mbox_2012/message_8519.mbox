I just checked out the excellent Shiva homam manual, and found a version of=
 the Mahamrityunjaya mantra "that is particularly good for health and longe=
vity" i.e. 

Om Jum Sah. Trayambakam Yajamahe Sugandhim Pushtivardhanam; Ur=
varukamiva Bandhanan; Mrityurmukshiya Mamritat. Sah Jum Om.

I remember now=
 that this version is what was being repeated at the Mahamrityunjaya havan =
at the Sivananda Ashram in Rishikesh when I was there last year. They do it=
 every week for the wellbeing of everyone. Didn't know exactly what the Sah=
 Jum Om was about then, but do now, thanks to the homam manual.

Very grate=
ful thanks to Narasimhaji and his Guruji for creating manuals, and for enab=
ling ordinary people to do havans at home- will try and make better use of =
them as a demonstration of my thanks! 

Aparna
