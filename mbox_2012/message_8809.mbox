Absolutely agree with what Sri Rajashri said.  I came across this nonsense =
on youtube when searching for any recent lectures on Saptashati.  You may f=
ind some person chanting the so called Navashati written in Telugu if you s=
earch Navasati (probably they don't know to spell it right).  The Navashati=
 blog was poorly written but was trying to put down Saptashati, which I cou=
ld not take it knowing it's value from experience.  Some hallucinatory pers=
on trying to prove that he could come up with something better than the Sap=
tashati which has Rig,Yajur and Sama Vedas as it's own Swaroopam, and for m=
e Saptashati is the Veda.

Thanks Sri Rajashri for taking on this kind of n=
onsensical efforts as it seems they are even selling books with that Navash=
ati name which can mislead gullible people into something undesirable.

Reg=
ards,
Kris.
