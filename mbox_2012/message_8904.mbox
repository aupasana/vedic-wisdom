A long and beautiful writing by Sri Aurobindo.

The yoga we practise is not=
 for ourselves alone, but for the Divine; its aim is to work out the will o=
f the Divine in the world, to effect a spiritual transformation and to brin=
g down a divine nature and a divine life into the mental, vital and physica=
l nature and life of humanity. Its object is not personal Mukti, although M=
ukti is a necessary condition of the yoga, but the liberation and transform=
ation of the human being. It is not personal Ananda, but the bringing down =
of the divine Ananda--Christ's kingdom of heaven, our Satyayuga--upon the e=
arth. Of moksa we have no personal need; for the soul is nityamukta and bon=
dage is an illusion. We play at being bound, we are not really bound. We ca=
n be free when God wills; for he, our supreme Self, is the master of the ga=
me, and without his grace and permission no soul can leave the game. It is =
often God's will in us to take through the mind the bhoga of ignorance, of =
the dualities, of joy and grief, of pleasure and pain, of virtue and sin, o=
f enjoyment and renunciation: for long ages, in many countries, he never ev=
en thinks of the yoga but plays out this play century after century without=
 wearying of it. There is nothing evil in this, nothing which we need conde=
mn or from which we need shrink,--it is God's play. The wise man is he who =
recognises this truth and knowing his freedom, yet plays out God's play, wa=
iting for his command to change the methods of the game.

The command is no=
w. God always keeps for himself a chosen country in which the higher knowle=
dge is through all chances and dangers, by the few or the many, continually=
 preserved, and for the present, in this Chaturyuga at least, that country =
is India. Whenever he chooses to take the full pleasure of ignorance, of th=
e dualities, of strife and wrath and tears and weakness and selfishness, th=
e tamasic and rajasic pleasures, of the play of the Kali in short, he dims =
the knowledge in India and puts her down into weakness and degradation so t=
hat she may retire into herself and not interfere with this movement of his=
 Lila. When he wants to rise up from the mud and Narayana in man to become =
once again mighty and wise and blissful, then he once more pours out the kn=
owledge on India and raises her up so that she may give the knowledge with =
its necessary consequences of might, wisdom and bliss to the whole world. W=
hen there is the contracted movement of knowledge, the yogins in India with=
draw from the world and practise yoga for their own liberation and delight =
or for the liberation of a few disciples; but when the movement of knowledg=
e again expands and the soul of India expands with it, they come forth once=
 more and work in the world and for the world. Yogins like Janaka, Ajatasha=
tru and Kartavirya once more sit on the thrones of the world and govern the=
 nations.

God's Lila in man moves always in a circle, from Satyayuga to Ka=
li and through Kali to the Satya, from the Age of Gold to the Age of Iron a=
nd back again through the Iron to the Gold. In modern language the Satyayug=
a is a period of the world in which a harmony, stable and sufficient, is cr=
eated and man realises for a time, under certain conditions and limitations=
, the perfection of his being. The harmony exists in its nature, by the for=
ce of a settled purity; but afterwards it begins to break down and man upho=
lds it, in the Treta, by force of will, individual and collective; it break=
s down further and he attempts to uphold it in the Dwapara by intellectual =
regulation and common consent and rule; then in the Kali it finally collaps=
es and is destroyed. But the Kali is not merely evil; in it the necessary c=
onditions are progressively built up for a new Satya, another harmony, a mo=
re advanced perfection. In the period of the Kali which has passed, still e=
ndures in its effects, but is now at an end, there has been a general destr=
uction of the ancient knowledge and culture. Only a few fragments remain to=
 us in the Vedas, Upanishads and other sacred works and in the world's conf=
used traditions. But the time is at hand for a first movement upward, the f=
irst attempt to build up a new harmony and perfection. That is the reason w=
hy so many ideas are abroad for the perfection of human society, knowledge,=
 religion and morals. But the true harmony has not yet been found.

It is o=
nly India that can discover the harmony, because it is only by a change--no=
t a mere readjustment--of man's present nature that it can be developed, an=
d such a change is not possible except by yoga. The nature of man and of th=
ings is at present a discord, a harmony that has got out of tune. The whole=
 heart and action and mind of man must be changed, but from within, not fro=
m without, not by political and social institutions, not even by creeds and=
 philosophies, but by realisation of God in ourselves and the world and a r=
emoulding of life by that realisation. This can only be effected by Purnayo=
ga, a yoga not devoted to a particular purpose, even though that purpose be=
 Mukti or Ananda, but to the fulfilment of the divine humanity in ourselves=
 and others. For this purpose the practices of Hatha and Raja Yoga are not =
sufficient and even the Trimarga will not serve; we must go higher and reso=
rt to the Adhyatmayoga. The principle of Adhyatmayoga is, in knowledge, the=
 realisation of all things that we see or do not see but are aware of,--men=
, things, ourselves, events, gods, titans, angels,--as one divine Brahman, =
and in action and attitude, an absolute self-surrender to the Paratpara Pur=
usha, the transcendent, infinite and universal Personality who is at once p=
ersonal and impersonal, finite and infinite, self-limiting and illimitable,=
 one and many, and informs with his being not only the Gods above, but man =
and the worm and the clod below.

The surrender must be complete. Nothing m=
ust be reserved, no desire, no demand, no opinion, no idea that this must b=
e, that cannot be, that this should be and that should not be;--all must be=
 given. The heart must be purified of all desire, the intellect of all self=
-will, every duality must be renounced, the whole world seen and unseen mus=
t be recognised as one supreme expression of concealed Wisdom, Power and Bl=
iss, and the entire being given up, as an engine is passive in the hands of=
 the driver, for the divine Love, Might and perfect Intelligence to do its =
work and fulfil its divine Lila. Ahank=E2ra must be blotted out in order th=
at we may have, as God intends us ultimately to have, the perfect bliss, th=
e perfect calm and knowledge and the perfect activity of the divine existen=
ce. If this attitude of perfect self-surrender can be even imperfectly esta=
blished, all necessity of Yogic kriy=E2 inevitably ceases. For then God him=
self in us becomes the sadhaka and the siddha and his divine power works in=
 us, not by our artificial processes, but by a working of Nature which is p=
erfectly informed, all-searching and infallibly efficient. Even the most po=
werful Rajayogic samyama, the most developed pr=E2n=E2y=E2ma, the most stre=
nuous meditation, the most ecstatic Bhakti, the most self-denying action, m=
ighty as they are and efficacious, are comparatively weak in their results =
when set beside this supreme working. For those are all limited to a certai=
n extent by our capacity, but this is illimitable in potency because it is =
God's capacity. It is only limited by his will which knows what is best for=
 the world and for each of us in the world and apart from it.

The first pr=
ocess of the yoga is to make the sankalpa of =E2tmasamarpana. Put yourself =
with all your heart and all your strength into God's hands. Make no conditi=
ons, ask for nothing, not even for siddhi in the yoga, for nothing at all e=
xcept that in you and through you his will may be directly performed. To th=
ose who demand from him, God gives what they demand, but to those who give =
themselves and demand nothing, he gives everything that they might otherwis=
e have asked or needed and in addition he gives himself and the spontaneous=
 boons of his love.

The next process is to stand aside and watch the worki=
ng of the divine power in yourself. This working is often attended with dis=
turbance and trouble in the system, therefore faith is necessary, though pe=
rfect faith is not always possible at once; for whatever impurity is in you=
, harboured openly or secretly lurking, is likely to rise at first and be r=
epeated so long as it is not exhaustively swept out, and doubt in this age =
is an almost universal impurity. But even when doubt assails, stand by and =
wait for it to pass, availing yourself if possible of the satsanga of those=
 who are already advanced on the path, but when that is absent, still holdi=
ng fast to the principle of the yoga, self-surrender. When distressed withi=
n or assailed from without, remember the words of the Gita,

"By giving thy=
self up in heart and mind to Me, thou shalt cross over all difficulties and=
 perils by My grace,"

and again,

"Abandon all dharmas (all law, rule, mea=
ns and codes of every kind whether formed by previous habit and belief or i=
mposed from outside) and take refuge in Me alone; I will deliver thee from =
all sin and evil,--do not grieve."

"I will deliver",--you have not to be t=
roubled or struggle yourself as if the responsibility were yours or the res=
ult depended on your efforts, a mightier than you is busy with the matter. =
Neither disease nor calamity nor the rising of sin and impurity in you shou=
ld cause any alarm. Hold fast only to him. "I will deliver thee from all si=
n and evil." But the release does not come by a sudden miracle, it comes by=
 a process of purification and these things are a part of the process. They=
 are like the dust that rises in clouds when a room long uncleaned is at la=
st swept out. Though the dust seem to choke you, yet persevere, m=E2 shucah=
.

In order to stand aside, you must know yourself as the Purusha who merel=
y watches, consents to God's work, holds up the Adhar and enjoys the fruits=
 that God gives. The work itself is done by God as Shakti, by Kali, and is =
offered up by her as a Yajna to Sri Krishna; you are the Yajamana who sees =
the sacrifice done, whose presence is necessary to every movement of the sa=
crifice and who tastes its results. This separation of yourself, this renun=
ciation of the kartritva-abhim=E2na (the idea of yourself as the doer) is e=
asier if you know what the Adhar is. Above the buddhi which is the highest =
function of mind is the higher buddhi, or vij=F1=E2na, the seat of the saty=
adharma, truth of knowledge, truth of bh=E2va, truth of action, and above t=
his ideal faculty is the =E2nanda or cosmic bliss in which the divine part =
of you dwells. It is of this vij=F1=E2na and this =E2nanda that Christ spok=
e as the kingdom of God that is within you. We at present are awake, j=E2gr=
at, in the lower movements but susupta, fast asleep, in the vij=F1=E2na and=
 =E2nanda; we have to awaken these levels of consciousness within us and th=
eir awakening and unmixed activity is the siddhi of the yoga. For when that=
 happens, we gain the condition of being which is called in the Gita dwelli=
ng in God, of which Sri Krishna speaks when he says, mayi nivasisyasyeva, "=
Verily thou shalt dwell in Me." Once it is gained, we are free and blessed =
and have everything towards which we strive.

The third process of the yoga=
 is to perceive all things as God. First, as a rule, in the process of know=
ledge one comes to see pervading all space and time one divine impersonal E=
xistence, Sad Atman, without movement, distinction or feature, sh=E2ntam al=
aksanam, in which all names and forms seem to stand with a very doubtful or=
 a very minor reality. In this realisation the One may seem to be the only =
reality and everything else Maya, a purposeless and inexplicable illusion. =
But afterwards, if you do not stop short and limit yourself by the imperson=
al realisation, you will come to see the same Atman not only containing and=
 supporting all created things, but informing and filling them, and eventua=
lly you will be able to understand that even the names and forms are Brahma=
n. You will then be able to live more and more in the knowledge which the U=
panishads and the Gita hold up as the rule of life; you will see the Self i=
n all existing things and all existing things in the Self, =E2tm=E2nam sarv=
abh=FBtesu sarvabh=FBt=E2ni c=E2tmani; you will be aware of all things as B=
rahman, sarvam khalvidam brahma. But the crowning realisation of this yoga =
is when you become aware of the whole world as the expression, play or Lila=
 of an infinite divine personality, when you see in all, not the impersonal=
 Sad Atman which is the basis of manifest existence,--although you do not l=
ose that knowledge,--but Sri Krishna who at once is, bases and transcends a=
ll manifest and unmanifest existence, avyakto 'vyakt=E2t parah. For behind =
the Sad Atman is the silence of the Asat which the Buddhist Nihilists reali=
sed as the sh=FBnyam and beyond that silence is the Paratpara Purusha (puru=
so varenya =E2dityavarnas tamasah parast=E2t). It is he who has made this w=
orld out of his being and is immanent in and sustains it as the infinite-fi=
nite Ishwara, ananta and s=E2nta, Shiva and Narayana, Sri Krishna the Lilam=
aya who draws all of us to him by his love, compels all of us by his master=
ies and plays his eternal play of joy and strength and beauty in the manifo=
ld world.

The world is only a play of his being, knowledge and delight, sa=
t, cit and =E2nanda. Matter itself, you will one day realise, is not materi=
al, it is not substance but form of consciousness, guna, the result of qual=
ity of being perceived by sense-knowledge. Solidity itself is only a combin=
ation of the gunas, samhati and dhriti, cohesion and permanence, a state of=
 conscious being, nothing else. Matter, life, mind and what is beyond mind,=
 it is all Sri Krishna the Ananta-guna Brahman playing in the world as the =
Sachchidananda. When we have this realisation, when we dwell in it securely=
 and permanently, all possibilities of grief and sin, fear, delusion, inter=
nal strife and pain are driven puissantly from our being. We realise in our=
 experience the truth of the Upanishads,

"He who possesses the delight of =
the Brahman has no fear from anything in the world,"

and that other in the=
 Isha Upanishad,

"When all created things become one with a man's self by =
his getting the knowledge (vij=F1=E2na), thereafter what bewilderment can h=
e have or what grief, when in all things he sees their oneness?"

The whole=
 world then appears to us in a changed aspect, as an ocean of beauty, good,=
 light, bliss, exultant movement on a basis of eternal strength and peace. =
We see all things as shubha, shiva, mangala, =E2nandamaya. We become one in=
 soul with all beings, sarvabh=FBt=E2tma-bh=FBt=E2tm=E2, and, having steadf=
astly this experience, are able by contact, by oneness, by the reaching out=
 of love, to communicate it to others, so that we become a centre of the ra=
diation of this divine state, br=E2hm=EE sthiti, throughout our world.

It =
is not only in things animate but in things inanimate also that we must see=
 Narayana, experience Shiva, throw our arms around Shakti. When our eyes, t=
hat are now blinded by the idea of Matter, open to the supreme Light, we sh=
all find that nothing is inanimate, but all contains, expressed or unexpres=
sed, involved or evolved, secret or manifest or in course of manifestation,=
 not only that state of involved consciousness which we call annam or Matte=
r, but also life, mind, knowledge, bliss, divine force and being,--pr=E2na,=
 manas, vij=F1=E2na, =E2nanda, cit, sat. In all things the self-conscious p=
ersonality of God broods and takes the delight of his gunas. Flowers, fruit=
s, earth, trees, metals, all things have a joy in them of which you will be=
come aware, because in all Sri Krishna dwells, pravishya, having entered in=
to them, not materially or physically,--because there is no such thing, Spa=
ce and Time being only conventions and arrangements of perception, the pers=
pective in God's creative Art,--but by cit, the divine awareness in his tra=
nscendent being.

"All this world and every object in this world of Prakrit=
i has been created as a habitation for the Lord."

Nor is it enough to see =
him in all things and beings, sarvabh=FBtesu; you must see him in all event=
s, actions, thoughts, feelings, in yourself and others, throughout the worl=
d. For this realisation two things are necessary: first, that you should gi=
ve up to him the fruit of all your actions, secondly, that you should give =
up to him the actions themselves. Giving up the fruits of action does not m=
ean that you must have the vair=E2gya for the fruits, turn away from them o=
r refuse to act with a given end before you. It means that you must act, no=
t because you want this or that to happen or think it necessary that this o=
r that should happen and your action needed to bring it about, but because =
it is kartavyam, demanded by the Master of your being and must be done with=
 whatever result God is pleased to give. You must put aside what you want a=
nd wish to know what God wants; distrust what your heart, your passions or =
your habitual opinions prefer to hold as right and necessary, and passing b=
eyond them, like Arjuna in the Gita, seek only to know what God has set dow=
n as right and necessary. Be strong in the faith that whatever is right and=
 necessary will inevitably happen as the result of your due fulfilment of t=
he kartavyam karma, even if it is not the result that you preferred or expe=
cted. The power that governs the world is at least as wise as you and it is=
 not absolutely necessary that you should be consulted or indulged in its m=
anagement; God is seeing to it.

But what is the kartavyam karma? It is ver=
y difficult to say,--gahan=E2 karmano gatih. Most people would translate ka=
rtavyam karma by the English word and idea, duty; if asked to define it, th=
ey would say it is the right and moral action, what people understand by ri=
ght and morality, what you yourself conscientiously think to be right or el=
se what the good of society, the nation or mankind demands of you. But the =
man who remains bound by these personal or social ideas of duty, necessary =
as they are for the ignorant to restrain and tame their clamorous desires o=
r their personal egoism, will be indeed what is called a good man, but he w=
ill never attain to the fulfilment of this yoga. He will only replace the d=
esire for one kind of fruit by the desire for another kind; he will strive,=
 even more passionately perhaps, for these higher results and be more bitte=
rly grieved by not attaining them. There is no passion so terrible as the p=
assion of the altruist, no egoism so hard to shake as the fixed egoism of v=
irtue, precisely because it is justified in its own eyes and justified in t=
he sight of men and cannot see the necessity for yielding to a higher law. =
Even if there is no grieving over the results, there will be the labour and=
 strife of the rajasic kart=E2, struggling and fighting, getting eager and =
getting exhausted, not trigun=E2t=EEta, always under bondage to the gunas.
=

It was under the domination of these ideas of personal virtue and social d=
uty that Arjuna refused to fight. Against his reasonings Sri Krishna sets t=
wo different ideas, one inferior for the use of the man bound but seeking l=
iberation, another superior for the liberated man, the Shastra and surrende=
r not only of the fruits of the work but of the work itself to God. The vir=
tue of the Shastra is that it sets up a standard outside ourselves, differe=
nt from our personal desires, reasonings, passions and prejudices, outside =
our selfishness and self-will, by living up to which in the right spirit we=
 can not only acquire self-control but by reducing even the sattwic ahank=
=E2ra to a minimum prepare ourselves for liberation. In the old days the Sh=
astra was the Vedic Dharma based upon a profound knowledge of man's psychol=
ogy and the laws of the world, revealing man to himself and showing him how=
 to live according to his nature; afterwards it was the law of the Smritis =
which tried to do the same thing more roughly by classifying men according =
to the general classes of which the Vedas speak, the c=E2turvarnya; today i=
t is little more than blind mechanical custom and habitual social observanc=
e, a thing not sattwic but tamasic, not a preparatory discipline for libera=
tion, but a mere bondage.

Even the highest Shastra can be misused for the =
purposes of egoism, the egoism of virtue and the egoism of prejudice and pe=
rsonal opinion. At its best it is a great means towards the preparation of =
liberation. It is shabda-brahma. But we must not be satisfied with mere pre=
paration, we must, as soon as our eyes are opened, hasten on to actual free=
dom. The liberated soul and the sadhak of liberation who has surrendered ev=
en his actions to God, gets beyond the highest Shastra, shabdabrahm=E2tivar=
tate.

The best foundation for the surrender of action is the realisation t=
hat Prakriti is doing all our actions at God's command and God through our =
svabh=E2va determines the action. From that moment the action belongs to hi=
m, it is not yours nor the responsibility yours; there is indeed no respons=
ibility, no bondage of Karma, for God has no responsibility, but is in ever=
y way master and free. Our actions become not only like the Shastric man's =
svabh=E2vaniyata, regulated by nature and therefore dharma, but the svabh=
=E2va itself is controlled like a machine by God. It is not easy for us, fu=
ll as we are of the Sanskaras of ignorance, to arrive at this stage of know=
ledge, but there are three stages by which it can be rapidly done. The firs=
t is to live in the spirit of the shloka,

"According as I am appointed by =
Thee, O Hrishikesha! seated in my heart, so I act."

When this has entered =
into your daily life, it will be easier to accomplish the second stage and =
live in the knowledge of the Gita,

"God stands in the heart of all beings,=
 whirling round all, as on a wheel, by the Maya of the three gunas."

You w=
ill then be able to perceive the action of the three gunas in you and watch=
 the machinery at its work, no longer saying, tath=E2 karomi, I do, but gun=
=E2 vartanta eva, it is merely the gunas that work. One great difficulty in=
 these stages, especially before you can distinguish the action of the guna=
s, is the perception of the impurity of the svabh=E2va, the haunting idea o=
f sin and virtue.

You must always remember that, since you have put yourse=
lf in God's hands, he will work out the impurities and you have only to be =
careful, as you cannot be attached either to p=E2pa or punya, sin or virtue=
. For he has repeatedly given the abhaya vacana, the assurance of safety. "=
Pratij=E2n=EEhi," he says in the Gita, "na me bhaktah pranashyati, he who i=
s devoted to Me cannot perish." The third stage comes out of the second, by=
 full realisation of God, or of itself by the grace of God. Not only will t=
he Purusha stand apart and be trigun=E2t=EEta, beyond the three gunas, but =
the Prakriti, though using the gunas, will be free from their bondage. Satt=
wa, as we know it, will disappear into pure prak=E2sha and jyotih, and the =
nature will live in a pure, free and infinite self-existing illumination. T=
amas, as we know it, will disappear into pure shama or sh=E2nti, and the na=
ture will take its firm stand on an infinite and ineffable rest and peace. =
Rajas, as we know it, will disappear into pure tapas, and the nature will f=
low in a free and infinite ocean of divine force. On that foundation of cal=
m and in that heaven of light, action will occur as the spontaneous objecti=
ve expression of God's knowledge, which is one with God's will. This is the=
 condition of infinity, =E2nantya, in which this struggle of bound and limi=
ted sattwa, rajas and tamas is replaced by a mighty harmony of free prak=E2=
sha, tapas and shama. And even before you reach that condition, on the way =
to it, you will find that some mighty force not your own, not situated in y=
our body though possessing and occupying it, is thinking for you, feeling f=
or you, acting for you, your very body as well as your mind and heart being=
 moved by that force and not by yourself. You will enjoy that thought, feel=
ing, action, but will neither possess nor be possessed by it,--karm=E2ni pr=
avil=EEyante, your actions will disappear without leaving in you mark or tr=
ace, as a wave disappears from the surface of the sea, as water falls from =
the lotus leaf.

Your mind, heart, body will not be yours, but God's; you y=
ourself will be only a centre of being, knowledge and bliss through which G=
od works in that Adhar. This is the condition in which one is utterly tacci=
ttah, given up in all his conscious being to God, in which there is utter f=
ulfilment of the description,

"One whose state of being is free from egois=
m and whose understanding receives no stain."

This is the surrender of act=
ion to which Sri Krishna gives so much importance.

"Laying down all action=
s upon Me, with thy whole conscious being in adhy=E2tmayoga, become free fr=
om desire and the sense of belongings; fight, let the fever of thy soul pas=
s from thee."

For this great and complete liberation it is necessary that =
you should be nihspriha, nirdvandva and nirahank=E2ra, without the longing =
and reaching after things, free from the samsk=E2ra of the dualities and fr=
ee from egoism; for these three things are the chief enemies of self-surren=
der. If you are nirdvandva, you can be nihspriha, but hardly otherwise, for=
 every dvandva creates in the mind by the very nature of the mind some form=
 of r=E2gadvesa, like and dislike, attraction and repulsion, whether they a=
re the lowest dualities that appeal to the mind through the body, hunger an=
d thirst, heat and cold, physical pleasure and pain, or the middle sorts th=
at appeal to it through the feelings and desires, success and failure, vict=
ory and defeat, fortune and misfortune, pleasure and displeasure, joy and g=
rief, hate and love, or the highest which appeal to the mind through the di=
scriminating buddhi, virtue and sin, reason and unreason, error and truth. =
These things can only be put under our feet by complete knowledge, the know=
ledge that sees God in all things and thus comes to understand the relation=
s of things to each other in his great cosmic purpose, by complete Bhakti w=
hich accepts all things with joy,--thus abolishing the dvandvas,--because t=
hey come from the Beloved or by perfect action offering up all works as a s=
acrifice to God with an entire indifference to these dualities of success, =
failure, honour, disgrace, etc., which usually pursue all Karma. Such knowl=
edge, such Bhakti, such Karma come inevitably as the eventual result of the=
 sankalpa of self-surrender and the practice of it.

But it is ahank=E2ra t=
hat by making the relation and effect of things on ourselves or on things c=
onnected with us the standard of life, makes the dvandvas a chain for our b=
ondage. Ahank=E2ra in its action on our life and sadhana will be seen to be=
 of three kinds, rajasic, tamasic and sattwic. Rajas binds by desire and th=
e craving in the nature for occupation and activity, it is always reaching =
after action and the fruit of action; it is in order that we may be free fr=
om the rajasic ahank=E2ra that we have the command, "Do not do works from t=
he desire of fruit," m=E2 karma-phala-hetur bh=FBh, and the command to give=
 up our actions to God. Tamas binds by weakness and the craving in the natu=
re for ease and inaction; it is always sinking into idleness, depression, c=
onfusion of mind, fear, disappointment, despondency and despair; it is in o=
rder that we may get rid of the tamasic ahank=E2ra that we are given the co=
mmand, "Let there be no attachment to inaction," and the instruction to pur=
sue the yoga always, whether we seem to advance or seem to be standing stil=
l or seem even to be going back, always with a calm faith and patient and c=
heerful perseverance, anirvinnacetas=E2. Sattwa binds by knowledge and plea=
sure; it is always attaching itself to some imperfect realisation, to the i=
dea of one's own virtue, the correctness of one's own opinions and principl=
es or at its highest, as in the case of Arjuna, opposing some personal idea=
 of altruism, justice or virtue against the surrender of our will that God =
demands of us. It is for the escape from the sattwic ahank=E2ra that we hav=
e to pass beyond the attachment to the duality of virtue and sin, ubhe sukr=
itaduskrite.

Each of the gunas working on the ahank=E2ra has its particula=
r danger for the sadhak who has made the sankalpa of self-surrender, but ha=
s not yet attained to the full accomplishment of the surrender. The danger =
of the rajoguna is when the sadhak is assailed by the pride that thinks, "I=
 am a great sadhak, I have advanced so far, I am a great instrument in God'=
s hands," and similar ideas, or when he attaches himself to the work as God=
's work which must be carried out, putting himself into it and troubling hi=
mself about it as if he had more interest in God's work than God himself an=
d could manage it better.

Many, while they are acting all the while in the=
 spirit of rajasic ahank=E2ra, persuade themselves that God is working thro=
ugh them and they have no part in the action. This is because they are sati=
sfied with the mere intellectual assent to the idea without waiting for the=
 whole system and life to be full of it. A continual remembrance of God in =
others and renunciation of individual eagerness (sprih=E2) are needed and a=
 careful watching of our inner activities until God by the full light of se=
lf-knowledge, j=F1=E2nad=EEpena bh=E2svat=E2, dispels all further chance of=
 self-delusion.

The danger of tamoguna is twofold, first, when the Purusha=
 thinks, identifying himself with the tamas in him, "I am weak, sinful, mis=
erable, ignorant, good-for-nothing, inferior to this man and inferior to th=
at man, adhama, what will God do through me?"--as if God were limited by th=
e temporary capacities or incapacities of his instruments and it were not t=
rue that he can make the dumb to talk and the lame to cross the hills, m=FB=
kam karoti v=E2c=E2lam pangum langhayate girim,--and again when the sadhak =
tastes the relief, the tremendous relief of a negative sh=E2nti and, feelin=
g himself delivered from all troubles and in possession of peace, turns awa=
y from life and action and becomes attached to the peace and ease of inacti=
on. Remember always that you too are Brahman and the divine Shakti is worki=
ng in you; reach out always to the realisation of God's omnipotence and his=
 delight in the Lila. He bids Arjuna work lokasangrah=E2rth=E2ya, for keepi=
ng the world together, for he does not wish the world to sink back into Pra=
kriti, but insists on your acting as he acts,

"These worlds would be overp=
owered by tamas and sink into Prakriti if I did not do actions."

To be att=
ached to inaction is to give up our action not to God but to our tamasic ah=
ank=E2ra.

The danger of the sattvaguna is when the sadhak becomes attached=
 to any one-sided conclusion of his reason, to some particular kriy=E2 or m=
ovement of the sadhana, to the joy of any particular siddhi of the yoga, pe=
rhaps the sense of purity or the possession of some particular power or the=
 Ananda of the contact with God or the sense of freedom and hungers after i=
t, becomes attached to that only and would have nothing else. Remember that=
 the yoga is not for yourself; for these things, though they are part of th=
e siddhi, are not the object of the siddhi, for you have decided at the beg=
inning to make no claim upon God but take what he gives you freely and, as =
for the Ananda, the selfless soul will even forego the joy of God's presenc=
e, when that is God's will. You must be free even from the highest sattwic =
ahank=E2ra, even from the subtle ignorance of mumuksutva, the desire of lib=
eration, and take all joy and delight without attachment. You will then be =
the siddha or perfect man of the Gita.

These then are the processes of the=
 yoga, (1) the sankalpa of =E2tmasamarpana, (2) the standing apart from the=
 Adhar by self-knowledge, (3) the vision of God everywhere and in all thing=
s and in all happenings, the surrender of the fruits of action and action i=
tself to God, and the freedom thereby from ignorance, from ahank=E2ra, from=
 the dvandvas, from desire, so that you are shuddha, mukta, siddha, full of=
 Ananda, pure, free, perfect and blissful in your being. But the processes =
will be worked out, once the sankalpa is made, by God's Shakti, by a mighty=
 process of Nature. All that is indispensable on your part is the anumati a=
nd smriti. Anumati is consent, you must give a temporary consent to the mov=
ements of the yoga, to all that happens inside or outside you as part of th=
e circumstances of the sadhana, not exulting at the good, not fretting at t=
he evil, not struggling in your heart to keep the one or get rid of the oth=
er, but always keeping in mind and giving a permanent assent to that which =
has to be finally effected. The temporary consent is passive submission to =
the methods and not positive acceptance of the results. The permanent conse=
nt is an anticipatory acceptance of the results, a sort of effortless and d=
esireless exercise of will. It is the constant exercise of this desireless =
will, an intent aspiration and constant remembrance of the path and its goa=
l which are the dhriti and uts=E2ha needed, the necessary steadfastness and=
 zeal of the sadhak; vy=E2kulat=E2 or excited, passionate eagerness is more=
 intense, but less widely powerful, and it is disturbing and exhausting, gi=
ving intense pleasure and pain in the pursuit but not so vast a bliss in th=
e acquisition. The followers of this path must be like the men of the early=
 yugas, dh=EEr=E2h, the great word of praise in the Upanishads. In the reme=
mbrance, the smriti or smarana, you must be apramatta, free from negligence=
. It is by the loss of the smriti owing to the rush and onset of the gunas =
that the yogin becomes bhrasta, falls from his firm seat, wanders from his =
path. But you need not be distressed when the pram=E2da comes and the state=
 of fall or clouded condition seems to persist, for there is no fear for yo=
u of a permanent fall since God himself has taken entire charge of you and =
if you stumble, it is because it is best for you to stumble, as a child by =
frequent stumbling and falling learns to walk. The necessity of apramattat=
=E2 disappears when you can replace the memory of the yoga and its objects =
by the continual remembrance of God in all things and happenings, the nitya=
 anusmarana of the Gita. For those who can make the full surrender from the=
 beginning there is no question; their path is utterly swift and easy.

It =
is said in the "Sanatsujatiya" that four things are necessary for siddhi--s=
h=E2stra, uts=E2ha, guru and k=E2la--the teaching of the path, zeal in foll=
owing it, the Guru and time. Your path is that which I am pointing out, the=
 uts=E2ha needed is this anumati and this nitya smarana, the Guru is God hi=
mself and for the rest only time is needed. That God himself is the Guru, y=
ou will find when knowledge comes to you; you will see how every little cir=
cumstance within you and without you has been subtly planned and brought ab=
out by infinite wisdom to carry out the natural process of the yoga, how th=
e internal and external movements are arranged and brought together to work=
 on each other, so as to work out the imperfection and work in the perfecti=
on. An almighty love and wisdom are at work for your uplifting. Therefore n=
ever be troubled by the time that is being taken, even if it seems very lon=
g, but when imperfections and obstructions arise, be apramatta, dh=EEra, ha=
ve the uts=E2ha, and leave God to do the rest. Time is necessary. It is a t=
remendous work that is being done in you, the alteration of your whole huma=
n nature into a divine nature, the crowding of centuries of evolution into =
a few years. You ought not to grudge the time. There are other paths that o=
ffer more immediate results or at any rate, by offering you some definite k=
riy=E2 you can work at yourself, give your ahank=E2ra the satisfaction of f=
eeling that you are doing something, so many more pr=E2n=E2y=E2mas today, s=
o much longer a time for the =E2sana, so many more repetitions of the japa,=
 so much done, so much definite progress marked. But once you have chosen t=
his path, you must cleave to it. Those are human methods, not the way that =
the infinite Shakti works, which moves silently, sometimes imperceptibly to=
 its goal, advances here, seems to pause there, then mightily and triumphan=
tly reveals the grandiose thing that it has done. Artificial paths are like=
 canals hewn by the intelligence of man; you travel easily, safely, surely,=
 but from one given place to another. This path is the broad and trackless =
ocean by which you can travel widely to all parts of the world and are admi=
tted to the freedom of the infinite. All that you need are the ship, the st=
eering-wheel, the compass, the motive-power and a skilful captain. Your shi=
p is the Brahmavidya, faith is your steering-wheel, self-surrender your com=
pass, the motive-power is she who makes, directs and destroys the worlds at=
 God's command and God himself is your captain. But he has his own way of w=
orking and his own time for everything. Watch his way and wait for his time=
. Understand also the importance of accepting the Shastra and submitting to=
 the Guru and do not do like the Europeans who insist on the freedom of the=
 individual intellect to follow its own fancies and preferences which it ca=
lls reasonings, even before it is trained to discern or fit to reason. It i=
s much the fashion nowadays to indulge in metaphysical discussions and phil=
osophical subtleties about Maya and Adwaita and put them in the forefront, =
making them take the place of spiritual experience. Do not follow that fash=
ion or confuse yourself and waste time on the way by questionings which wil=
l be amply and luminously answered when the divine knowledge of the vij=F1=
=E2na awakes in you. Metaphysical knowledge has its place, but as a handmai=
d to spiritual experience, showing it the way sometimes but much more depen=
dent on it and living upon its bounty. By itself it is mere p=E2n\,ditya, a=
 dry and barren thing and more often a stumbling-block than a help. Having =
accepted this path, follow its Shastra without unnecessary doubt and questi=
oning, keeping the mind plastic to the light of the higher knowledge, gripp=
ing firmly what is experienced, waiting for light where things are dark to =
you, taking without pride what help you can from the living guides who have=
 already trod the path, always patient, never hastening to narrow conclusio=
ns, but waiting for a more complete experience and a fuller light, relying =
on the Jagadguru who helps you from within.

It is necessary to say somethi=
ng about the Mayavada and the modern teachings about the Adwaita because th=
ey are much in the air at the present moment and, penetrated with ideas fro=
m European rationalism and agnosticism for which Shankara would have been a=
stonished to find himself made responsible, perplex many minds. Remember th=
at one-sided philosophies are always a partial statement of truth. The worl=
d, as God has made it, is not a rigid exercise in logic but, like a strain =
of music, an infinite harmony of many diversities, and his own existence, b=
eing free and absolute, cannot be logically defined. Just as the best relig=
ion is that which admits the truth of all religions, so the best philosophy=
 is that which admits the truth of all philosophies and gives each its righ=
t place. Maya is one realisation, an important one which Shankara overstres=
sed because it was most vivid to his own experience. For yourself leave the=
 word for subordinate use and fix rather on the idea of Lila, a deeper and =
more penetrating word than Maya. Lila includes the idea of Maya and exceeds=
 it; nor has it that association of the vanity of all things, useless to yo=
u who have elected to remain and play with Sri Krishna in Mathura and Brind=
avan.

God is one but he is not bounded by his unity. We see him here as on=
e who is always manifesting as many, not because he cannot help it, but bec=
ause he so wills, and outside manifestation he is anirdeshyam, indefinable,=
 and cannot be described as either one or many. That is what the Upanishads=
 and other sacred books consistently teach; he is ekamev=E2dvit=EEyam, One =
and there is no other, but also and consequently he is "this man, yonder wo=
man, that blue-winged bird, this scarlet-eyed." He is s=E2nta, he is ananta=
; the Jiva is he. "I am the ashvattha tree," says Sri Krishna in the Gita, =
"I am death, I am Agni Vaishwanara, I am the heat that digests food, I am V=
yasa, I am Vasudeva, I am Arjuna." All that is the play of his caitanya in =
his infinite being, his manifestations, and therefore all are real. Maya me=
ans nothing more than the freedom of Brahman from the circumstances through=
 which he expresses himself. He is in no way limited by that which we see o=
r think about him. That is the Maya from which we must escape, the Maya of =
ignorance which takes things as separately existent and not God, not caitan=
ya, the illimitable for the really limited, the free for the bound. Do you =
remember the story of Sri Krishna and the Gopis, how Narada found him diffe=
rently occupied in each house to which he went, present to each Gopi in a d=
ifferent body, yet always the same Sri Krishna? Apart from the devotional m=
eaning of the story, which you know, it is a good image of his World-Lila. =
He is sarva, everyone, each Purusha with his apparently different Prakriti =
and action is he, and yet at the same time he is the Purushottama who is wi=
th Radha, the Para Prakriti, and can withdraw all these into himself when h=
e wills and put them out again when he wills. From one point of view they a=
re one with him, from another one yet different, from yet another always di=
fferent because they always exist, latent in him or expressed at his pleasu=
re.

There is no profit in disputing about these standpoints. Wait until yo=
u see God and know yourself and him and then debate and discussion will be =
unnecessary.

The goal marked out for us is not to speculate about these th=
ings, but to experience them. The call upon us is to grow into the image of=
 God, to dwell in him and with him and be a channel of his joy and might an=
d an instrument of his works.

Purified from all that is ashubha, transfigu=
red in soul by his touch, we have to act in the world as dynamos of that di=
vine electricity and send it thrilling and radiating through mankind, so th=
at wherever one of us stands, hundreds around may become full of his light =
and force, full of God and full of Ananda. Churches, Orders, theologies, ph=
ilosophies have failed to save mankind because they have busied themselves =
with intellectual creeds, dogmas, rites and institutions, with =E2c=E2rashu=
ddhi and darshana, as if these could save mankind, and have neglected the o=
ne thing needful, the power and purification of the soul. We must go back t=
o the one thing needful, take up again Christ's gospel of the purity and pe=
rfection of mankind, Mahomed's gospel of perfect submission, self-surrender=
 and servitude to God, Chaitanya's gospel of the perfect love and joy of Go=
d in man, Ramakrishna's gospel of the unity of all religions and the divini=
ty of God in man, and, gathering all these streams into one mighty river, o=
ne purifying and redeeming Ganges, pour it over the death-in-life of a mate=
rialistic humanity as Bhagirath led down the Ganges and flooded with it the=
 ashes of his fathers, so that they may be a resurrection of the soul in ma=
nkind and the Satyayuga for a while return to the world. Nor is this the wh=
ole object of the Lila or the Yoga; the reason for which the Avatars descen=
d is to raise up man again and again, developing in him a higher and ever h=
igher humanity, a greater and yet greater development of divine being, brin=
ging more and more of heaven again and again upon the earth until our toil =
is done, our work accomplished and Sachchidananda fulfilled in all even her=
e, even in this material universe. Small is his work, even if he succeeds, =
who labours for his own salvation or the salvation of a few; infinitely gre=
at is his, even if he fail or succeed only partially or for a season, who l=
ives only to bring about peace of soul, joy, purity and perfection among al=
l mankind.
