Namaste Suraj ji,

When I started the homam I used to feel the same way tha=
t rules are not much applicable if there is desire for God in the heart in =
a pure fashion as much as possible. But it is surprising that the process o=
f homam itself has led me to situations that have made me realize I was wro=
ng and thus understand God a little better.  How can I ever thank Homam in =
words? It that has led me progressively step by step and gently through thi=
s.

However my thought about homam becomes clear with 2 analogies below: 
1=
.	High tension power lines are great stuff that transmit power over long di=
stances with lesser power wasteadge. But if one were to connect high tensio=
n power line to a Zero watt bulb, what would be the state of the bulb? I am=
 a zero watt bulb. I know that for sure.
2.	If one were to plant a seed, it=
 should be done such that it is watered frequently, not fed too much fertil=
izer. When the same seed becomes a tree, it wouldn't care about the rules o=
f frequent watering. It can bear all the fertilizers that you feed it. I th=
ink of homama in this way based on my experience this way. I am just a smal=
l plant  that cannot take all the fertilizer straight away. All the pre-req=
uisite Japa done as per the ratio enables me to do the homam (i.e. take the=
 strong fertilizer) with ease.

This is how the meaning of the 10:1 ratio p=
re-requisite has turned out for me rather than the way you have spelt out f=
rom the homam manual.

Having started the homam without caring much about t=
he rules, I have come to a point that the rules might exist for a certain r=
eason and we should not reinterpret them the way we find convenient.  For e=
.g. When Achamana is good, why do we do only 3 times achamana? Why do we gi=
ve  only 3 times surya-arghya in Sandhyavandanam?

The rules should not beg=
et fear. Rather we should think of them as qualifications that one has to m=
eet to proceed ahead. It should make our resolve stronger, submission to Go=
d more.

Regards,
Ashutosh
