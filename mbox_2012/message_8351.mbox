Aparna ji,

i will quote the ayi pathi chap who is lineage bearer for 4 sea=
ts. he was asked the same question you have asked. this chap is 26yrs only.=
 Disciple of Siddh Sri rakkha ram ji.

" Ram/ Krishna / Nanay / Budh aaye p=
ar koi bhi duniya ko na tar saka. duniya apne karmo se hi dukhi,
Only the g=
uys you eliminates desires is jivan mukta and siddhis stand with folded han=
ds in fornt of such person."

so i think its ones own karmas whether you ha=
ve inborn desire or not. everyone had to crank their own wheel at somepoint=
 of time/life. if you see someone for whome it comes easy, he has lifetime =
of effort behind it. so its your personal independent choice to rant or rav=
e. push your own cart, u might get god in a flash and the so called "comes-=
easy" guy might take some time. who knows.

On another note
listen to
http:=
//www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DGvQVxrMZB18 (there is a 18min version)
http://w=
ww.youtube.com/watch?v=3DoHE3V4R_b-4 (rendition by Munni begum is better,
i=
f u find send me also)


Priya ji,
long time, hope u doing great.

from wha=
t i was told - mysterious are the ways of love. "there were gopis who used =
to curse makhan chor for disturbing their peace and spent all the time tryi=
ng to get him out of their mind, and that became their sadhana"

so relax a=
nd enjoy the ride.

regards


PS - posted again to fix the character encodi=
ng issue.
