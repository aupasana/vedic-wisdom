Hi Anup.....

Oak wood is most easily available from the trees themselves.=
  Just go for a walk in the forest. Check online for images of oak tree and=
 bring a nice pair of cutters or a saw and collect the wood the old fashion=
ed way! Of course you have to wait for it to dry but even then you could us=
e your oven for that purpose.

Good luck!

Ajaya

 If ever dried copra is not available or banned, starter wood pieces are a =

unaware of there being any ban on the outer shell of coconut, as all parts =
of coconut are available at the local supermarkets, and the dried coconuts =
being available at the local Indian markets. As far as other alternatives t=

roducing a minimum of smoke. There are many ways to deal with the problem o=
