Namaste Krishna,

Nice to know that you are interested in performing daily=
 homam. I wish you all the best. BTW, below link gives you an info for purc=
hasing havankund. Click on 'Database' (side panel of the webpage) will take=
 you to the contacts of the practitioners who wish to guide you. Unfortunat=
ely,none of them in the list are from B'lore. However, you can very well co=
ntact them over phone.
