Dear respected members,


Owing to health reasons I have been having some a=
nger management issues going on. Couple of my recent posts must have reflec=
ted my behavior. I realized my mistake then and was really looking for an o=
pportunity to apologize. Many thanks Utpal ji,your mail made me realize tha=
t, this is the right time to do so. 

Hence with all my humility I apologiz=
e  to all those whom I have hurt-ed so far. Without an apology I won't be a=
ble to look at my god in his eyes. Thanks all for being so patient and unde=
rstanding and never letting your hurt-ed feelings out. 

I have tried medit=
ation, long morning walks but mind still feels restless. I am going to join=
 yoga classes to see if that works.

Having said that now I can finally rel=
ax and concentrate on my evening prayers without any guilt, 

Many thanks a=
nd regards,

Priya
