e rnas are of the body he or she <br>> >> occupies. He is mukta be=
cause he experiences, actually sees the rnas <br>

 & does he/it have rnas? If these "rnas <br>> >> of body&=
quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, what <br>> &=

Manish: Ok, karmas projected into mind, <br>> >> are acted on and =
may be experienced by body. So, why is a jeevanmukta <br>> >> subj=

 "all". <br>> >> This gives karmas time to work. N=
