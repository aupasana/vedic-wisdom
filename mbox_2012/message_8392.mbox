Narasimhaji and Rajasrshiji hit it on the right spot.

I got into a wee bit=
 of sadhana due to a personal issue and My personal
experience with Maha Vi=
dya sadhana has been very strenuous and emotionally
tiring(Had some small e=
xperiences of Maa though they could not be verified
by a Guru) and is not f=
or everyone. We need to have done some very good
karmas in the past to come=
 into the corridors of Devi. This is said in all
puranas and upapuranas how=
ever to sustain our focus is very difficult
unless we have a very competent=
 Guru. I have spent close to 6 years
searching for a true tantrik practitio=
ner and i found one very sincere
amercian student who is named as Shri Ugra=
nand Saraswathi.  All that is
available on the internet is just to cheat gu=
llible masses. A greatest
master like Ramakrishna took 12 years of intense =
sadhana to get her darshan
with huge punya from his past lives. There is no=
 doubt about it.

Unfortunate part is that you will ofcourse have some expe=
riences out of
this sadhana as it is very powerful but we would not know if=
 it was a mind
trip or hallucination or true divine presence. Please note t=
hat you are not
dealing some one in the hierarchy but the MAHAMAYA who can =
encompass even
the trimurti to maya. We need immense blessings of GaneshJi =
and Lord Shiva
to progress on this path as small time energies will not all=
ow you to
progress in sadhana.

My advice is not to leave HER FEET come wha=
t may.

I remember a parable of Shri RK who says" As long as child is playi=
ng with
toys of the world, she wont come to us, only when we cry for enligh=
tenment
does she come over leaving everything for us".

Love
Sri
