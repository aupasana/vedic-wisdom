=C2=A0Namaste,

<<Eventually if this water in the glass merges with the o=
cean, then it does get the power of the ocean...? (Is this Advaita?)>>

Not=
 even then. The merging is an assimilation of the essence of the entity int=
o a larger being, but never in Power, fidelity and ability. There are many =
saints, who have realized themselves as an essence of the Divine. How many =
of them, if I may ask very humbly, would be able to lift a Mountain with th=
eir little finger, if push came to shove, as Lord Krishna had done to save =
the people from the fury of Indra, that too for seven days?

One more chief=
 cause of confusion is the English word "realization". In Hindu philosophy,=
 there are various kinds of realizations. Each of them are valid in their o=
wn way.

When we speak of Adwaitha, most people mean their understanding of=
 Sri Adi Shankara's Adwaitha. There are other versions of Adwaitha as well.=
 The Tantrik Adwaitha, the Suddha Adwaitha of Sri Vallavacharya, ETC.

My c=
omparison is mostly what I felt after thinking of this. I think it is simil=
ar to Sri Chaitanya's idea of achinta bheda-abheda tattwa. Essentially ever=
ything is one with God, yet nothing ever acquires the full potency of God. =

<br>
While their pr=
