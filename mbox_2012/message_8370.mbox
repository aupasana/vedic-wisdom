(Anyone reading this, bolo govind bolo , bolo hari gopaal bolo, mentally=
)

Mr XYZ,

I couldn't stop myself to replying specifically to you.

Nope i=
ts not bakwaas, its called "viprit bhakti", but problem is not many/or anyo=
ne can do it in a "good enough" manner. The hate has to consume you,lets sa=
y you hate Vishnu so much that all day long you are lost in chanting "vishn=
u ki bhen ki....." , but it has to be all day long, have to be with a passi=
on that consumes your entire existence. You have to have so much anger ever=
y time you hear Vishnu's name, you go into a murderous rage.

It happened w=
ith a certain Mr Hiranyakasipu, and guess what???
The lord himself came.

O=
h the blessing!!!!!
He died in mere maalik's lap, what would I not give giv=
e to have that....... What a fine death. The ripping up of the intestines i=
n most photos you see holds a very different meaning than most people inter=
pret it as.

Hell due to his hatred, bhagwaan had to himself come to take h=
im. Whether he came to teach Mr Sipu's (nick name) a lesson or not, it stil=
l must have been a fine darshan. Point is the lord comming.

Hell due to Ra=
avan's madness, the lord in his form of the incharge of preservation and th=
e form incharge of destruction had to go to collect him. Not many understan=
d Ravan, he is infact far beyond us to understand. His penance was so inten=
se, that, khair chuck it, whats the point, it will lead to more misinterpre=
tation.

The esoteric meaning of the  story of Mr Hiranyakasipu is mentione=
d in a book, I think people who have read the book will know which one it i=
s. Its the 2nd part of a trilogy that I consider to be on and above par wit=
h any religious/spiritual text out there, provided you understand ts true m=
eaning, which takes a lot of effort than merely reading the books.

Anyways=
, So does that mean you keep on abusing god???
Nope I am not advocating tha=
t BUT
You can if you wish to, but do it so, that with your rage you destroy=
 "yourself", which is the point of any sadhana ,any ritual anyways. But no =
- one barring a few are intense enough these days to do that, and the inten=
se ones are too much in love and don't have a reason to consider this.

Poi=
nt of Mr Utpal's story is something else all together,
its with dedication =
and discipline that man reached over to the temple to hit god, no matter wh=
at came he still went to hurl his choicest abuses, the devotee didn't go to=
 worship on that stormy day. The abuser's devotion to abuse is much higher =
than that of the devotee's worship.

Thought the devotee is dear to god, th=
e abuser's devotion to abuse brought the lord down from his abode. Same dev=
otion Meera has that for Lord Krishna. Where will Krishna hide, if somebody=
 has that kind of devotion.

Its called the "paagal kutta" way. You know ho=
w paagal kutte are?? If they catch hold of your pyjama, no matter you burst=
 its head open with a stick it will not let go without tearing you pant off=
, kuch bhi karlo nahin chhore ga. After all pagal hain If you become a paga=
l kutta for god, no matter if god destroys "your" money, "your" family, "yo=
ur" everything and yet you still hang on, you, my son will be made.

Become=
 a paagal kutta either with anger or love, same thing, point is to not let =
go.

Bete, try to understand the madness behind that man's (Story) anger, d=
evelop that madness tab toh baat hai nahin toh lage raho bhagwaan ki photo =
ko laat maarne, paer hi tutega aur kuch nahin hoga.
He could have chosen no=
t to go because of the storm, like the devotee. The devotee chose his own c=
omfort, ignored his lord's comfort, but the abuser, hell no. He went alrigh=
t.

I'll tell you one story more story, interpret it the way you wish to , =
I don't care.
There was a man in Benaras, one day right before his daily ho=
mam, when he was cutting gola naariyal for the homam, the knife slit throug=
h his entire palm, and severed one nerve. It was a pool of blood.Hell there=
 was so much blood,his sister freaked out, but that man was thinking of off=
ering it to his mother. What the fuck, you must be thinking?? In his pain h=
e was thinking of his mother who is known to accept blood.
What next, he go=
t into a ritual to offer that blood, then went to the nursery home to get s=
titches, and when he got back he did his homam, with one hand totally in ba=
ndage and paining like a bitch.

Mentally he told god ,"""" kya aapko kya l=
aga aisle hi chor doonga????, nahin kakaji, aise nahin, hum bhi aashiq sadi=
yon puraane, chaen tu maane ya na maane """

But then that's why the world =
calls him insane.

Nobody is a fool in spending time to love god, understan=
d the point of the story, and not get lost in the words.

""
Absolute stupi=
dity,please don't preach any further leave it for the wise they know better=
. """
Get us a wise person on this board please. We(members) already have M=
r Rao, Mr nandy,and a couple more, we'll enjoy more company, please get us =
more.
Anyways, Utpal is far more wiser than many of us(members) combined.
N=
ow utpal will come in and say "no, no, no", but that was the whole story to=
 begin with , ha!!

Un Paagal kuton ki jai ho jo bhagwaan ke pyjama phaarne=
 mein lage huein hain!!!
la ilaha illa allah!!!

Namaste,
nobody
