Is there a "proper" or a "correct" way to recite Vishnusahasranamam?

Some =
people play the CD while doing their daily chores and others sit at a place=
 and read aloud or silently in concentration as the CD plays. Yet others re=
cite it from memory.

What is the most "effective" way?

Thanks
Ranga
