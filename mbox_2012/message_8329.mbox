Dear Rajarshi,

What you said makes perfect sense. That link i had given fo=
r general info only. 

You summarised it well, guess a high level direct te=
acher is must.

"A fair exchange is never a robbery, as Vimalananda says. T=
heoretically, when the *right person* performs many of the things mentioned=
 in that blog, (and some of the stuff there is not exactly accurately portr=
ayed), he/she will know how to balance the karmic impact well. In the hands=
 of an immature individual, it can lead to disaster."

This is the kind of =
sadhana site that crops up time n again.

Thankyou soren f=
or the link. 

Regards,
Priyank
