=C2=A0 
A shor=
t conversation between a student and teacher.
Chant as you read along. Chan=
t any name.

If you find it tough to chant, play this another tab/window
ht=
tp://youtu.be/SIqag-x5gqI

Teacher : You are Duracell.

Student : err=E2=80=
=A6.. what?

Teacher : *while smoking* or energizer or everyday or nippo.

=
Student : =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. hain? *scratches head*, you=
 have lost it.

Teacher : I lost "it", a long time ago its time for you to =
loose it ,
LOL

Student : How am I Duracell or any of those damn battery co=
mpanies you
just mentioned?

Teacher : What do I get, if I prove it?

Stude=
nt : What do you want?

Teacher : That you intentionally make a fool of you=
rself in front of
people who have not lost it.

Student : okay, deal done. =
Prove it.

Teacher : Think twice.

Student : I have thought 4 times.

Teach=
er : Ho ho ho, what a fun day I will have.

Student : Yeah, right. *rolls e=
yes like a supermodel saying whatever*

Teacher : Have you ever seen a batt=
ery powered toy? Especially the one
which is modeled in the form of a bear,=
 and claps its hands as soon as
it is powered on. Its hands hold two plates=
 which strike each other ,
the bear's eyes light up as soon as the battery =
is put in, and boom, we
are ready to go.

Student : Yes, yes, I have seen t=
hose. There are other types also, like
when you put batteries in a car mode=
l, it suddenly starts operating, and
going bonkers, or the teddy bear one, =
which starts repeating some cuddly
lines. It is loved by girls.

Teacher : =
Yes, exactly. You, right now, are the teddy bear, which girls
and everybody=
 loves.

Student : =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. the fuck?

Teacher=
 : aww!! How cute , my little child is thinking in terms of
profanities. Do=
 you know why you are here?

Student : *thinks in mind about all the philos=
ophical stuff he has read,
and knew this question was widely discussed and =
asked, and thus becomes
happy"=E2=80=A6. why?

Teacher : Because , somebody=
 fucked somebody, LOL. But anyways, leave
this fucking business aside for a=
 moment. Lets go back to the
discussion, the end of which will be very fun.=


Student: we were on the topic that I am a teddy bear.

Teacher : Don't tw=
ist my words, I said right now you are akin to a teddy
bear. You have been =
that car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear who
claps, basically all the=
 battery powered toys earlier. In philosophical
terms they are called "birt=
hs".

Student : How may I ask?

Teacher : What is your name?

Student : Cha=
man Sharma ( name changed due to security & other humorous
reasons)

Teache=
r : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma
as the bear (the battery po=
wered toy) who claps and claps and claps,
that "I am Chaman Sharma, I am a =
male, I own a house, I am 20 years old
, i like this girl, I love playing s=
ports, I live here, I read this, I
hate that, I this, and I that", okay?

S=
tudent : Go on.. * feeling a bit ridiculous about himself*

Teacher : So wh=
en Chaman dies, which is going to happen sooner than
later, do you know wha=
t happens or what that means?

Student : I die, but in reality "I" don't di=
e.

Teacher : Very good, you have read that off of a book, ever realized it=
?
Are you not afraid of death?

Student : No, I am not afraid of death.

Th=
e lights turn off in the room, there is total darkness, for 5 minutes
there=
 is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified, and then a pair of deep
red eyes a=
ppear in the dark, and in the most ghastly voice ever asks Mr
Chaman, "why =
are you so afraid? the basis of all fear is death, and only
the lights have=
 gone out, I haven't even started with you yet, if you
say you are not goin=
g to die, then why so scared?"

Suddenly the lights turn back on, the teach=
er is laughing his ass off,
with Chaman shivering.

Teacher : You said you =
were not afraid.

Student : I never meant it, like that.

Teacher : Then in=
 what way did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that
practical stuff in this=
 spirituality business is far greater than all
your books combined. You get=
 lost while reading, you think you are
different. To me you are no worse th=
an the thousand others I meet,
in-fact they are better off without the text=
s you have studied.

Student : Agreed, but don't scare me like that. Again.=


Teacher : I will, if you make such ridiculous claims again. Anyways,
wher=
e were we? The death of the teddy bear. Yes. But mind you the teddy
remains=
, the outer shell remains, but teddy is dead. The outer shell is
either bur=
ied or burnt, in essence done away with, because it is of no
use. Right?

S=
tudent : Right

Teacher : Wrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this, w=
hen you
remove the battery from the toy, what happens? The toy is literally=

useless, it can't clap, it can't shout, it can't cry, it can't do shit.
Th=
us, at death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman's body. You
never d=
ie, you are only the battery powering this personality which
leads to power=
ing your body.

Student: How can you even=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6

Teacher : Lets=
 consider that you are two batteries, two aa sized ones.
When you plug the =
batteries into a car, suddenly the car comes to life,
without the battery t=
he car is idle, but as soon as I put the battery
in, the car goes=E2=80=A6=
=E2=80=A6.. beep beep honk honk, move, I am a car.

Student : sits in silen=
ce knowing well that interrupting now will be the
biggest mistake ever.

Te=
acher :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it into
lets=
 say a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,
or act=
s mushy. And when I pull the battery out?

Student : Teddy is idle, literal=
ly useless.

Teacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same battery that pow=
ered the
car, it was the same battery that powered the teddy bear, and it i=
s the
same battery that can power any toy, correct?

Student : Correct

Tea=
cher : While the battery is in the car, it believes itself to be the
car. I=
t believes "yesssss, i am a car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 mm
torque, top spe=
ed 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the back, hot woman in my
passengers seat, =
I am the king baby, look at how hot I am"

Student: Oh dear god=E2=80=A6.

=
Teacher : Then I take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a
useles=
s piece of metal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly it
believes=
 itself to be the teddy, it goes " yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,
I am mushy=
, I am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am, I can
even clap my =
hands ", and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy
is=E2=80=A6..

St=
udent : Useless, and dead.

Teacher : Thats a useless conclusion, it is kno=
wn by the world, not
realized. Every tom dick and harry knows that, Lets go=
 deeper. The point
is the battery confuses itself to be the teddy or the go=
d damn car.

Student : So the battery is the soul?

Teacher : *smacks on th=
e student's head* Who said that?

Student : You did.

Teacher : *another ph=
atek on the head of the student* When did I say?
You read it in one of your=
 fancy articles and commentaries and satsangs
that people do, genius, and y=
ou read it all too wrong, you read it and
thus think you 'know', you never =
practiced, fools you people are. Most
of the time you people are fed bullsh=
it and you gobble it up like pigs
in mud. That reminds me we haven't had a =
pepperoni  pizza in a long
time, lets order one. LOL

Student : Sorry=E2=80=
=A6

Teacher : Don't be, you are my child, I love you. Anyways , back to ou=
r
discussion on toys. The confusion of the battery. And thus Chaman, you
co=
nfuse yourself to be Chaman. This is the 67432th time , you have been
plugg=
ed into a a toy (read body) and the confusion prevails. Focus on
the "confu=
sion" aspect.

Student : Then who am I?

Teacher : You are the ever lasting=
 consciousness, the universal bliss,
the infinite, the ever pervading light=
 of the universe!!! Breathe in and
out and feel the bliss!!

Student : Yess=
!!! this is what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*
*Smells huge amounts=
 of odor*=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6 What is that smell?

Teacher : I just farted, f=
eels so blissful, did you feel your bliss too?

Student : Ewwwww=E2=80=A6.
=

Teacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we guys are fools who have spent lives
i=
n search of who we are, and you will know just by breathing in and out,
and=
 thinking you are the ever lasting consciousness and all that???
Befkuf!! C=
haman kahin ka!!

Student : But you only said that  "You are the ever lasti=
ng
consciousness, the universal bliss, the infinite, the ever pervading
lig=
ht of the universe!!! Breathe in and out and feel the bliss!!"

Teacher : I=
t is called a test, and needless to say you have scored a
compartment.

Stu=
dent : Hey ram=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.

Teacher : So back to who you ar=
e, you are just like the battery who is
the source of that body and the per=
sonality and confuses itself to be "
I am Chaman Sharma, age 20, resident o=
f vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,
am a male, love to party, own a mercedez=
, worship a a little, interested
in god and whatever "

Student : So who am=
 I?

Teacher : You are duracell=E2=80=A6..How do they write post a mathemat=
ics
solution=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6Q.E.D or hence proved. QED =3D  quit=
e easily done.

Student : Thats one more self identification of being durac=
ell

Teacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.

Student: *Feels quite =
proud*

Teacher : And THAT is one more self identification.

Student : Hey =
Ram!!

Teacher : Ram Ram.

Student : So I theoretically understand it , but=
 how do I actually
realize it?

Teacher : You do Sadhana.

Student : Sittin=
g in a yogic pose and focusing on the lotus and all?

Teacher : I will fuck=
ing beat you to your death if you repeat this
bullshit ever again.

Student=
: Sorry=E2=80=A6

Teacher : No need to be. That is what is meant by Sadhana=
 to most
people. But does anyone know what is Sadhana?

Student : You shed =
some light on it?

Teacher: What do you think I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, al=
l sadhana is
basically in essence, and mark these all important words.
" YO=
U trying to convince yourself that "you" are not YOU "

Births are spent on=
 this my boy, births not lives, it takes a lot of
effort to tell and convin=
ce yourself that you are just not you.

Student : and how do you do that?

=
Teacher : By sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You
eventually=
 yourself become the form of the mantra that you chant, thus
realizing the =
deity( the big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the
one (the source of =
all the Big and small batteries). A mantra means man
ki tarana, does it not=
?

Student : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the battery and not
t=
his personality?

Teacher : Yes, but the day "you" realize, "you" will go d=
ead, to
yourself.

Student: I am beginning to understand a little, can you =
explain where
does a deity stand in this whole battery concept?

Teacher : =
If you are the battery, the battery has to have a source, you
are not svaya=
mbhu that you exist on you own. The deity is like a huge
power station in y=
our comparison. It is almost infinite, but since it is
a power station it i=
s bound to have a boundary somewhere, but to you, aa
sized battery it is en=
dless. Chaman's source is his parents, but
chaman's actual source's (batter=
y) parent is the power station.

Student : Hmmm=E2=80=A6.. that's why she i=
s worshipped as ma?

Teacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a girl who h=
as realized that
he/she himself is the battery and then went on to become o=
ne with a
power station and thus sees himself/herself in everything because=
 the
power station is the source of everything , of all batteries. And sinc=
e
he/she actually knows that all elements too are currents and everything
e=
lse too, he/she actually sees it as that. And thus, the "miracles". Let
say=
 I fully well don't see a difference between me and this table, thus
I am t=
his table, thus If i wish to make it fly, I can do it, because I
am actuall=
y it. To you it is a table, to me it is just a current, who is
just "me".

=
Student: Oooohhhhhhhh=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.

Teacher : He maybe sai baba to yo=
u, but thats how your eyes perceive him
to be as, an old man with frail clo=
thing, belongs to shirdi etc etc, but
inside he is far beyond what you or I=
 can comprehend. He first realized
he was a battery by doing penance, thus =
killing himself in the process,
the he realized that the battery is as good=
 as the power station because
the current is the same, so he became one wit=
h that, and then he went
beyond and came back to guide as he was chosen, ju=
st like many others
are, like my great teacher, guru nanak dev, Ramakrishna=
 and all
others=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6

Student : And the source of the=
 power station is?

Teacher : The one- Satya shri akaal , he/she/it can't b=
e put into words
because he is infinite and the words are finite. It is pur=
ely on
defining him religious wars, riots between religions , and intellect=
ual
discussions and debates on this thing called internet happen, but
he/sh=
e/it is far beyond comprehension. Many people focus on that , and
get lost,=
 but focus on the power station (deity) and it will take you to
big daddy.
=
Imagine an endless field of current in comparison of the power station ,
an=
 endless current which exists and all others are a figment of it. The
power=
 stations are a part of it, the current has taken the form of one
concentra=
ted zone.. But even this contains error of speech, so chuck it.
The ultimat=
e is only realized when you are one with the power station so
lets focus th=
ere.

Student : So the one has taken forms of different power stations to h=
elp
the batteries who are spread out to help unite back with it?

Teacher :=
 Brilliant.

Student: So all our lives we debate/fight and cut each other o=
ff to
claim which power station (deity) is more powerful over the other and=

superior to all others, when in truth our eyes perceive them(deities) to
b=
e different, when they are in essence one(Satya shri akaal) and
laughing ba=
ck at us?

Teacher : ho ho ho=E2=80=A6.. Go on.

Student : And we try to wo=
rship 10 different ones and always think that
we should worship as many to =
get maximum benefit for our mistakingly
confused identities of teddy , the =
car and all other toys?

Teacher : *smokes slowly*=E2=80=A6 I am listening.=


Student: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in debates and
pseud=
o breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with peacock feathers
and pun=
ches to the spine, reading stuff and debating on concepts which
they don't =
know a thing about?

Teacher: Yes,Speaking of Kundalini, she is basically y=
ou, she is the
battery. the stupidest thing in the world is this concept of=
 "my
kundalini", err=E2=80=A6. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Any=
ways ,
many make this error, but it is essential because other wise you can=
't
explain the concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are her,
=
"you" will be phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets
sa=
y a form, you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full
glory . W=
hatever you are worshipping is "you", who is without all the
limitations of=
 Chaman/teddy/car/toy.

Student: So then how do realized souls stay in thei=
r bodies post their
realization?

Teacher: Intentional identification with =
the personality by permission
from the power station to fulfill some higher=
 purpose of the power
station to guide more batteries to realize that they =
are not toys. But
they can leave in an instant, because they know realities=
 that are much
higher than our world.

Student : So what is moksha?

Teache=
r : It is a concept that is best left alone, if you haven't merged
back wit=
h a power station yourself first. You tell me when you have
merged back, ho=
w do you know what if feels like to be merged back? You
yourself have becom=
e one with your source, so "you" don't remain, even
the battery has dissolv=
ed, so how do "you" explain it? You wont remember
it, because you are not t=
here.

Student : I can't explain it.

Teacher : We can't, It is like explai=
ning the color red to a blind man.
You will say mars  is red or the red lig=
ht is red, he will say I have
been blind from birth I don't know what you a=
re talking about. You will
say tomato, he will say fuck off.

Student : Yes=
, so It can't be explained.

Teacher : it can be to an extent, but it is on=
e ridiculously convoluted
topic. To add to ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one=
 toy is a car, one toy
is a helicopter, one toy is a turtle, mind you batte=
ry is the same, but
the car is very different form the toy, thus if you exp=
lain a high level
concept to both, both will understand differently and hav=
e a go at it
with debates and what not, which leads to more confusion. Bett=
er is both
realize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that you are du=
racell
first, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You are duracel=
l.
Now time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on the road.
=

Student : What?

Teacher : You thought 4 times.

Student: But I will be di=
sgraced.

Teacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you are duracell, they will laugh=
 at
Chaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation, you have done this thousand
ti=
mes before, so what??

Student : I hate you.

Teacher : I love you too.

St=
udent : You are serious on this?

Teacher : Very

Student: : This is why so=
me of the higher ones don't give a shit about
roaming naked and doing wild =
stuff, just to keep people away from them.

Teacher : Yes, but a lot of fra=
uds copy and disgrace the higher ones.

Student : Fine, I will do it. But y=
ou will handle my parent's reaction.

Teacher : Done.

After the student di=
d the act, nobody seemed to recall the act the next
day, yet every one saw =
it that day, and seemed to make faces at the
student for an hour or so. How=
 everybody forgot is a different story
altogether.

Do sadhana, before your=
 battery is pulled out, replugged into another
toy and yet again, your conf=
usion will prevail driving you to do things
that will push you further and =
further down.

Jai Shree Radheya!!

le smoking* or energizer or everyday or nippo.<br>
<br>
Student : =E2=80=A6=
=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. hain? *scratches head*, you have lost it.<br>
=
<br>
Teacher : I lost "it", a long time ago its time for you to loose it ,<=
br>
LOL<br>
<br>
Student : How am I Duracell or any of those damn battery c=
ompanies you<br>
just mentioned?<br>
<br>
Teacher : What do I get, if I pro=
ve it?<br>
<br>
Student : What do you want?<br>
<br>
Teacher : That you int=
entionally make a fool of yourself in front of<br>
people who have not lost=
 it.<br>
<br>
Student : okay, deal done. Prove it.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Think=
 twice.<br>
<br>
Student : I have thought 4 times.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Ho ho=
 ho, what a fun day I will have.<br>
<br>
Student : Yeah, right. *rolls eye=
s like a supermodel saying whatever*<br>
<br>
Teacher : Have you ever seen =
a battery powered toy? Especially the one<br>
which is modeled in the form =
of a bear, and claps its hands as soon as<br>
it is powered on. Its hands h=
old two plates which strike each other ,<br>
the bear's eyes light up as so=
on as the battery is put in, and boom, we<br>
are ready to go.<br>
<br>
Stu=
dent : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There are other types also, like<br>
wh=
en you put batteries in a car model, it suddenly starts operating, and<br>
=
going bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which starts repeating some cuddly<br=
>
lines. It is loved by girls.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes, exactly. You, right =
now, are the teddy bear, which girls<br>
and everybody loves.<br>
<br>
Stud=
ent : =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6. the fuck?<br>
<br>
Teacher : aw=
w!! How cute , my little child is thinking in terms of<br>
profanities. Do =
you know why you are here?<br>
<br>
Student : *thinks in mind about all the=
 philosophical stuff he has read,<br>
and knew this question was widely dis=
cussed and asked, and thus becomes<br>
happy"=E2=80=A6. why?<br>
<br>
Teach=
er : Because , somebody fucked somebody, LOL. But anyways, leave<br>
this f=
ucking business aside for a moment. Lets go back to the<br>
discussion, the=
 end of which will be very fun.<br>
<br>
Student: we were on the topic that=
 I am a teddy bear.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Don't twist my words, I said right n=
ow you are akin to a teddy<br>
bear. You have been that car, the helicopter=
 , the teddy, the bear who<br>
claps, basically all the battery powered toy=
s earlier. In philosophical<br>
terms they are called "births".<br>
<br>
St=
udent : How may I ask?<br>
<br>
Teacher : What is your name?<br>
<br>
Stude=
nt : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security & other humorous<br>
=
reasons)<br>
<br>
Teacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma<br>=

as the bear (the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and claps,<br>
t=
hat "I am Chaman Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 years old<br>
=
, i like this girl, I love playing sports, I live here, I read this, I<br>
=
hate that, I this, and I that", okay?<br>
<br>
Student : Go on.. * feeling =
a bit ridiculous about himself*<br>
<br>
Teacher : So when Chaman dies, whi=
ch is going to happen sooner than<br>
later, do you know what happens or wh=
at that means?<br>
<br>
Student : I die, but in reality "I" don't die.<br>
=
<br>
Teacher : Very good, you have read that off of a book, ever realized i=
t?<br>
Are you not afraid of death?<br>
<br>
Student : No, I am not afraid =
of death.<br>
<br>
The lights turn off in the room, there is total darkness=
, for 5 minutes<br>
there is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified, and then =
a pair of deep<br>
red eyes appear in the dark, and in the most ghastly voi=
ce ever asks Mr<br>
Chaman, "why are you so afraid? the basis of all fear i=
s death, and only<br>
the lights have gone out, I haven't even started with=
 you yet, if you<br>
say you are not going to die, then why so scared?"<br>=

<br>
Suddenly the lights turn back on, the teacher is laughing his ass off=
,<br>
with Chaman shivering.<br>
<br>
Teacher : You said you were not afrai=
d.<br>
<br>
Student : I never meant it, like that.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Then =
in what way did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that<br>
practical stuff i=
n this spirituality business is far greater than all<br>
your books combine=
d. You get lost while reading, you think you are<br>
different. To me you a=
re no worse than the thousand others I meet,<br>
in-fact they are better of=
f without the texts you have studied.<br>
<br>
Student : Agreed, but don't =
scare me like that. Again.<br>
<br>
Teacher : I will, if you make such ridi=
culous claims again. Anyways,<br>
where were we? The death of the teddy bea=
r. Yes. But mind you the teddy<br>
remains, the outer shell remains, but te=
ddy is dead. The outer shell is<br>
either buried or burnt, in essence done=
 away with, because it is of no<br>
use. Right?<br>
<br>
Student : Right<br=
>
<br>
Teacher : Wrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this, when you<b=
r>
remove the battery from the toy, what happens? The toy is literally<br>
=
useless, it can't clap, it can't shout, it can't cry, it can't do shit.<br>=

Thus, at death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman's body. You<br>
=
never die, you are only the battery powering this personality which<br>
lea=
ds to powering your body.<br>
<br>
Student: How can you even=E2=80=A6=E2=80=
=A6<br>
<br>
Teacher : Lets consider that you are two batteries, two aa siz=
ed ones.<br>
When you plug the batteries into a car, suddenly the car comes=
 to life,<br>
without the battery the car is idle, but as soon as I put the=
 battery<br>
in, the car goes=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.. beep beep honk honk, move=
, I am a car.<br>
<br>
Student : sits in silence knowing well that interrup=
ting now will be the<br>
biggest mistake ever.<br>
<br>
Teacher :And when I=
 take the same batteries out of a car and put it into<br>
lets say a teddy =
bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,<br>
or acts mushy. =
And when I pull the battery out?<br>
<br>
Student : Teddy is idle, literall=
y useless.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same battery t=
hat powered the<br>
car, it was the same battery that powered the teddy bea=
r, and it is the<br>
same battery that can power any toy, correct?<br>
<br>=

Student : Correct<br>
<br>
Teacher : While the battery is in the car, it b=
elieves itself to be the<br>
car. It believes "yesssss, i am a car, red col=
our, 198 bhp, 70 mm<br>
torque, top speed 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the =
back, hot woman in my<br>
passengers seat, I am the king baby, look at how =
hot I am"<br>
<br>
Student: Oh dear god=E2=80=A6.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Then I=
 take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a<br>
useless piece of m=
etal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly it<br>
believes itself =
to be the teddy, it goes " yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,<br>
I am mushy, I =
am soft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am, I can<br>
even clap my =
hands ", and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy<br>
is=E2=80=A6..=
<br>
<br>
Student : Useless, and dead.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Thats a useless c=
onclusion, it is known by the world, not<br>
realized. Every tom dick and h=
arry knows that, Lets go deeper. The point<br>
is the battery confuses itse=
lf to be the teddy or the god damn car.<br>
<br>
Student : So the battery i=
s the soul?<br>
<br>
Teacher : *smacks on the student's head* Who said that=
?<br>
<br>
Student : You did.<br>
<br>
Teacher : *another phatek on the hea=
d of the student* When did I say?<br>
You read it in one of your fancy arti=
cles and commentaries and satsangs<br>
that people do, genius, and you read=
 it all too wrong, you read it and<br>
thus think you 'know', you never pra=
cticed, fools you people are. Most<br>
of the time you people are fed bulls=
hit and you gobble it up like pigs<br>
in mud. That reminds me we haven't h=
ad a pepperoni  pizza in a long<br>
time, lets order one. LOL<br>
<br>
Stud=
ent : Sorry=E2=80=A6<br>
<br>
Teacher : Don't be, you are my child, I love =
you. Anyways , back to our<br>
discussion on toys. The confusion of the bat=
tery. And thus Chaman, you<br>
confuse yourself to be Chaman. This is the 6=
7432th time , you have been<br>
plugged into a a toy (read body) and the co=
nfusion prevails. Focus on<br>
the "confusion" aspect.<br>
<br>
Student : T=
hen who am I?<br>
<br>
Teacher : You are the ever lasting consciousness, th=
e universal bliss,<br>
the infinite, the ever pervading light of the univer=
se!!! Breathe in and<br>
out and feel the bliss!!<br>
<br>
Student : Yess!!=
! this is what I read, * breathes in and out deeply*<br>
*Smells huge amoun=
ts of odor*=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6 What is that smell?<br>
<br>
Teacher : I just=
 farted, feels so blissful, did you feel your bliss too?<br>
<br>
Student :=
 Ewwwww=E2=80=A6.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we guys are fo=
ols who have spent lives<br>
in search of who we are, and you will know jus=
t by breathing in and out,<br>
and thinking you are the ever lasting consci=
ousness and all that???<br>
Befkuf!! Chaman kahin ka!!<br>
<br>
Student : B=
ut you only said that  "You are the ever lasting<br>
consciousness, the uni=
versal bliss, the infinite, the ever pervading<br>
light of the universe!!!=
 Breathe in and out and feel the bliss!!"<br>
<br>
Teacher : It is called a=
 test, and needless to say you have scored a<br>
compartment.<br>
<br>
Stud=
ent : Hey ram=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.<br>
<br>
Teacher : So back to who=
 you are, you are just like the battery who is<br>
the source of that body =
and the personality and confuses itself to be "<br>
I am Chaman Sharma, age=
 20, resident of vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,<br>
am a male, love to pa=
rty, own a mercedez, worship a a little, interested<br>
in god and whatever=
 "<br>
<br>
Student : So who am I?<br>
<br>
Teacher : You are duracell=E2=
=80=A6..How do they write post a mathematics<br>
solution=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=
=E2=80=A6Q.E.D or hence proved. QED =3D  quite easily done.<br>
<br>
Studen=
t : Thats one more self identification of being duracell<br>
<br>
Teacher :=
 Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.<br>
<br>
Student: *Feels quite proud*=
<br>
<br>
Teacher : And THAT is one more self identification.<br>
<br>
Stud=
ent : Hey Ram!!<br>
<br>
Teacher : Ram Ram.<br>
<br>
Student : So I theoret=
ically understand it , but how do I actually<br>
realize it?<br>
<br>
Teach=
er : You do Sadhana.<br>
<br>
Student : Sitting in a yogic pose and focusin=
g on the lotus and all?<br>
<br>
Teacher : I will fucking beat you to your =
death if you repeat this<br>
bullshit ever again.<br>
<br>
Student: Sorry=
=E2=80=A6<br>
<br>
Teacher : No need to be. That is what is meant by Sadhan=
a to most<br>
people. But does anyone know what is Sadhana?<br>
<br>
Studen=
t : You shed some light on it?<br>
<br>
Teacher: What do you think I am a b=
ulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana is<br>
basically in essence, and mark these =
all important words.<br>
" YOU trying to convince yourself that "you" are n=
ot YOU "<br>
<br>
Births are spent on this my boy, births not lives, it tak=
es a lot of<br>
effort to tell and convince yourself that you are just not =
you.<br>
<br>
Student : and how do you do that?<br>
<br>
Teacher : By sadha=
na aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You<br>
eventually yourself beco=
me the form of the mantra that you chant, thus<br>
realizing the deity( the=
 big daddy battery)/ the specific form of the<br>
one (the source of all th=
e Big and small batteries). A mantra means man<br>
ki tarana, does it not?<=
br>
<br>
Student : So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the battery and=
 not<br>
this personality?<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes, but the day "you" realiz=
e, "you" will go dead, to<br>
yourself.<br>
<br>
Student: I am beginning to=
 understand a little, can you explain where<br>
does a deity stand in this =
whole battery concept?<br>
<br>
Teacher : If you are the battery, the batte=
ry has to have a source, you<br>
are not svayambhu that you exist on you ow=
n. The deity is like a huge<br>
power station in your comparison. It is alm=
ost infinite, but since it is<br>
a power station it is bound to have a bou=
ndary somewhere, but to you, aa<br>
sized battery it is endless. Chaman's s=
ource is his parents, but<br>
chaman's actual source's (battery) parent is =
the power station.<br>
<br>
Student : Hmmm=E2=80=A6.. that's why she is wor=
shipped as ma?<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a girl wh=
o has realized that<br>
he/she himself is the battery and then went on to b=
ecome one with a<br>
power station and thus sees himself/herself in everyth=
ing because the<br>
power station is the source of everything , of all batt=
eries. And since<br>
he/she actually knows that all elements too are curren=
ts and everything<br>
else too, he/she actually sees it as that. And thus, =
the "miracles". Let<br>
say I fully well don't see a difference between me =
and this table, thus<br>
I am this table, thus If i wish to make it fly, I =
can do it, because I<br>
am actually it. To you it is a table, to me it is =
just a current, who is<br>
just "me".<br>
<br>
Student: Oooohhhhhhhh=E2=80=
=A6=E2=80=A6.<br>
<br>
Teacher : He maybe sai baba to you, but thats how yo=
ur eyes perceive him<br>
to be as, an old man with frail clothing, belongs =
to shirdi etc etc, but<br>
inside he is far beyond what you or I can compre=
hend. He first realized<br>
he was a battery by doing penance, thus killing=
 himself in the process,<br>
the he realized that the battery is as good as=
 the power station because<br>
the current is the same, so he became one wi=
th that, and then he went<br>
beyond and came back to guide as he was chose=
n, just like many others<br>
are, like my great teacher, guru nanak dev, Ra=
makrishna and all<br>
others=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6<br>
<br>
Student : =
And the source of the power station is?<br>
<br>
Teacher : The one- Satya s=
hri akaal , he/she/it can't be put into words<br>
because he is infinite an=
d the words are finite. It is purely on<br>
defining him religious wars, ri=
ots between religions , and intellectual<br>
discussions and debates on thi=
s thing called internet happen, but<br>
he/she/it is far beyond comprehensi=
on. Many people focus on that , and<br>
get lost, but focus on the power st=
ation (deity) and it will take you to<br>
big daddy.<br>
Imagine an endless=
 field of current in comparison of the power station ,<br>
an endless curre=
nt which exists and all others are a figment of it. The<br>
power stations =
are a part of it, the current has taken the form of one<br>
concentrated zo=
ne.. But even this contains error of speech, so chuck it.<br>
The ultimate =
is only realized when you are one with the power station so<br>
lets focus =
there.<br>
<br>
Student : So the one has taken forms of different power sta=
tions to help<br>
the batteries who are spread out to help unite back with =
it?<br>
<br>
Teacher : Brilliant.<br>
<br>
Student: So all our lives we deb=
ate/fight and cut each other off to<br>
claim which power station (deity) i=
s more powerful over the other and<br>
superior to all others, when in trut=
h our eyes perceive them(deities) to<br>
be different, when they are in ess=
ence one(Satya shri akaal) and<br>
laughing back at us?<br>
<br>
Teacher : =
ho ho ho=E2=80=A6.. Go on.<br>
<br>
Student : And we try to worship 10 diff=
erent ones and always think that<br>
we should worship as many to get maxim=
um benefit for our mistakingly<br>
confused identities of teddy , the car a=
nd all other toys?<br>
<br>
Teacher : *smokes slowly*=E2=80=A6 I am listeni=
ng.<br>
<br>
Student: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in debate=
s and<br>
pseudo breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with peacock f=
eathers<br>
and punches to the spine, reading stuff and debating on concept=
s which<br>
they don't know a thing about?<br>
<br>
Teacher: Yes,Speaking o=
f Kundalini, she is basically you, she is the<br>
battery. the stupidest th=
ing in the world is this concept of "my<br>
kundalini", err=E2=80=A6. you a=
re her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyways ,<br>
many make this error, but=
 it is essential because other wise you can't<br>
explain the concept in sp=
eech. And if you do fully realize you are her,<br>
"you" will be phat dead =
in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets<br>
say a form, you in ess=
ence , are worshipping yourself, in your full<br>
glory . Whatever you are =
worshipping is "you", who is without all the<br>
limitations of Chaman/tedd=
y/car/toy.<br>
<br>
Student: So then how do realized souls stay in their bo=
dies post their<br>
realization?<br>
<br>
Teacher: Intentional identificati=
on with the personality by permission<br>
from the power station to fulfill=
 some higher purpose of the power<br>
station to guide more batteries to re=
alize that they are not toys. But<br>
they can leave in an instant, because=
 they know realities that are much<br>
higher than our world.<br>
<br>
Stud=
ent : So what is moksha?<br>
<br>
Teacher : It is a concept that is best le=
ft alone, if you haven't merged<br>
back with a power station yourself firs=
t. You tell me when you have<br>
merged back, how do you know what if feels=
 like to be merged back? You<br>
yourself have become one with your source,=
 so "you" don't remain, even<br>
the battery has dissolved, so how do "you"=
 explain it? You wont remember<br>
it, because you are not there.<br>
<br>
=
Student : I can't explain it.<br>
<br>
Teacher : We can't, It is like expla=
ining the color red to a blind man.<br>
You will say mars  is red or the re=
d light is red, he will say I have<br>
been blind from birth I don't know w=
hat you are talking about. You will<br>
say tomato, he will say fuck off.<b=
r>
<br>
Student : Yes, so It can't be explained.<br>
<br>
Teacher : it can =
be to an extent, but it is one ridiculously convoluted<br>
topic. To add to=
 ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a car, one toy<br>
is a helicopter=
, one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is the same, but<br>
the car is ver=
y different form the toy, thus if you explain a high level<br>
concept to b=
oth, both will understand differently and have a go at it<br>
with debates =
and what not, which leads to more confusion. Better is both<br>
realize it =
themselves. So you focus on realizing that you are duracell<br>
first, mr c=
haman, everything else comes later. Thus, You are duracell.<br>
Now time fo=
r my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on the road.<br>
<br>
Stude=
nt : What?<br>
<br>
Teacher : You thought 4 times.<br>
<br>
Student: But I =
will be disgraced.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you are duracel=
l, they will laugh at<br>
Chaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation, you have=
 done this thousand<br>
times before, so what??<br>
<br>
Student : I hate y=
ou.<br>
<br>
Teacher : I love you too.<br>
<br>
Student : You are serious o=
n this?<br>
<br>
Teacher : Very<br>
<br>
Student: : This is why some of the=
 higher ones don't give a shit about<br>
roaming naked and doing wild stuff=
, just to keep people away from them.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Yes, but a lot of =
frauds copy and disgrace the higher ones.<br>
<br>
Student : Fine, I will d=
o it. But you will handle my parent's reaction.<br>
<br>
Teacher : Done.<br=
>
<br>
After the student did the act, nobody seemed to recall the act the n=
ext<br>
day, yet every one saw it that day, and seemed to make faces at the=
<br>
student for an hour or so. How everybody forgot is a different story<b=
r>
altogether.<br>
<br>
Do sadhana, before your battery is pulled out, repl=
ugged into another<br>
toy and yet again, your confusion will prevail drivi=
ng you to do things<br>
that will push you further and further down.<br>
