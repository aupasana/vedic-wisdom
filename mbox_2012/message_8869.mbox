Hi Anup.....

Oak wood=
 is most easily available from the trees themselves.  Just go for a walk in=
 the forest. Check online for images of oak tree and bring a nice pair of c=
utters or a saw and collect the wood the old fashioned way! Of course you h=
ave to wait for it to dry but even then you could use your oven for that pu=
rpose.

Good luck!
