Dear Nobody and Priyank,

you both explained elaborately what I actually me=
ant to say. evertything you wrote in your messages were looked as if you re=
ad my mind on the message. Thank you for this as you saved me from that eff=
orts of writing.

central idea of the story is that one should dedicatedly =
be in-touch with Supreme...either by Bhakti or even by Veeparit Bkhakti !

=

Best regards,

utpal
