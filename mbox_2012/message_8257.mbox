Namaskara....


Continuing my journey in aahaTa nAda yOga, one of the tasks=
 i have assigned to myself is to use carnatic classical music to express hu=
man emotions which, which otherwise cannot be expressed through words.=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Please find here a video where, the emotions of "crying", "=
deep sorrow" is expressed through a tAnam played by me on Saraswati Guitar =
Veena, in the raaga bAshpavruShTi.=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 It is a raaga disovered b=
y me and the name literally means "shower/rain of tears" (baashpa - tear an=
d vrushTi - shower/rain).

A personal note on this track: 1). Images contai=
ned in the video change whenever the music transits to a different setting,=
 either in style or pace. 2). Please watch till the end because, the music =
starts to climax as the end nears.

ve at it. Thank you
