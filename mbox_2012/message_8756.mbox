Namaste,

Below is a portion from an mail that Sri Aurobindo had written to=
 a struggling sadhaka, elucidating the nature and symptoms of the problems =
which can effect a sadhaka as long as he/she has not been able to cause a t=
ransformation of the lower nature, which Sri Aurobindo describes as "lower =
vital". In contrast the "higher vital" is more connected to elevated levels=
 of consciousness and expresses itself a joy, love, happiness, surrender, h=
umility etc. Generally, the deeper and positive qualities. 

The advices be=
low are real for all of us (I found it particularly useful for myself) for =
all of these are things that can and very often do happen to sadhaks, even =
potentially excellent sadhaks. Those who do not find it useful can ignore i=
t safely.

*   *   *

"Whatever there may be in these higher parts (of man)=
, aspiration to the Truth, devotion, or will to conquer the obstacles and t=
he hostile forces, it cannot become integral, it cannot remain unmixed or u=
nspoilt or continue to be effective so long as the lower vital and the exte=
rnal personality have not accepted the Light and consented to change. 

It =
was inevitable that in the course of the sadhana these inferior parts of th=
e nature should be brought forward in order that like the rest of the being=
 they may make the crucial choice and either accept or refuse transformatio=
n. My whole work depends upon this movement; it is the decisive ordeal of t=
his yoga. For the physical consciousness and the material life cannot chang=
e if this does not change. Nothing that may have been done before, no inner=
 illumination, experience, power or Ananda is of any eventual value, if thi=
s is not done. If the little external personality is to persist in retainin=
g its obscure and limited, its petty and ignoble, its selfish and false and=
 stupid human consciousness, this amounts to a flat negation of the work an=
d the sadhana.

The difficulty in the lower vital being is that it is still=
 wedded to its old self and in revolt against the Light; it has not only no=
t surrendered either to a greater Truth or to myself and the Mother, but it=
 has up to now no such will and hardly any idea even of what true surrender=
 is. When the lower vital assumes this attitude it takes its stand upon a c=
onstant affirmation of the old personality and the past forms of the lower =
nature. Every time they are discouraged, it supports and brings them back a=
nd asserts its right to freedom - the freedom to affirm and follow its own =
crude and egoistic ideas, desires, fancies, impulses or convenience wheneve=
r it chooses.

In the nature the resistance [of the lower nature to change]=
 takes certain characteristic forms which add to the confusion and to the d=
ifficulty of transformation. It is necessary to outline some of these forms=
 because they are sufficiently common, in some in a less, in others in a gr=
eater degree.

1. A certain vanity and arrogance and self-assertive rajasic=
 vehemence which are a deformation of the vital force and habit of leading =
[others] and domination that certain qualities in the higher vital gave the=
m. This is accompanied by an excessive amour-propre [Feelings of excessive =
pride] which creates the necessity of making a figure, maintaining by any m=
eans position and prestige, even of posturing before others, influencing, c=
ontrolling or "helping" them, claiming the part of a superior sadhak, one w=
ith greater knowledge and with occult powers..... It is the Divine Shakti f=
rom whom they [all powers] come and must use them only as the Mother's inst=
rument and according to her directions; if it intervenes with the claim of =
its ego and puts itself between her and the work or between her and other s=
adhaks, then whatever its natural power, it deviates from the true way, spo=
ils the work, brings in adverse forces and wrong movements and does harm to=
 those whom it imagines it is helping. There is no better way of calling in=
 hostile forces into the general work or of vitiating and exposing to their=
 influence one's own sadhana. On a smaller scale these defects of vanity, a=
rrogance and rajasic violence are present in most human natures.

2. Disobe=
dience and indiscipline. This lower part of the being is always random, way=
ward, self-assertive and unwilling to accept the imposition on it of any or=
der and discipline other than its own idea or impulse. Its defects even fro=
m the beginning stand in the way of the efforts of the higher nature to imp=
ose on the [lower] nature a truly regenerating tapasya. This habit of disob=
edience and disregard of discipline is so strong that it seems to be immedi=
ate, irresistible and instinctive. Thus obedience to the Mother is repeated=
ly promised or professed, but the action done or the course followed is fre=
quently the very opposite of the profession or promise. This constant indis=
cipline is a radical obstacle to the sadhana and the worst possible example=
 to others. 

3. Dissimulation and falsity of speech. This is an exceedingl=
y injurious habit of the lower nature. Those who are not straightforward ca=
nnot profit by the Mother's help, for they themselves turn it away. Unless =
they change, they cannot hope for the descent of the supramental Light and =
Truth into the lower vital and physical nature; they remain stuck in their =
own self-created mud and cannot progress. Often it is not mere exaggeration=
 or a false use of the imagination embroidering on the actual truth that is=
 marked in the sadhak, but also a positive denial and a falsifying concealm=
ent of facts. This he does sometimes to cover up his disobedience or wrong =
or doubtful course of action, sometimes to keep up his position, at others =
to get his own way or indulge his preferred habits and desires. Very often,=
 when one has this kind of vital habit, he clouds his own consciousness and=
 does not altogether realise the falsity of what he is saying or doing.

4.=
 A dangerous habit of constant self-justification. When this becomes strong=
 in the sadhak, it is impossible to turn him in this part of his being to t=
he right consciousness and action because at each step his whole preoccupat=
ion is to justify himself. His mind rushes at once to maintain his own idea=
, his own position or his own course of action. This he is ready to do by a=
ny kind of argument, sometimes the most clumsy and foolish or inconsistent =
with what he has been protesting the moment before, by any kind of mis-stat=
ement or any kind of device. This is a common misuse, but none the less a m=
isuse of the thinking mind; but it takes in him exaggerated proportions and=
 so long as he keeps to it, it will be impossible for him to see or live th=
e Truth. 

And the worst suggestions and most dangerous deception come when=
 this spirit of demand and desire is dissimulated in a spiritual garb and t=
akes a form which makes it seem to the sadhak a part of the yoga. There is =
only one way of escape from this siege of the lower vital nature. It is the=
 entire rejection of all egoistic vital demand, claim and desire and the re=
placement of the dissatisfied vital urge by the purity of psychic [inner-so=
ul/Godward] aspiration. Not the satisfaction of these vital clamours nor, e=
ither, an ascetic retirement is the true solution, but the surrender of the=
 vital being to the Divine and a single-minded consecration to the supreme =
Truth into which desire and demand cannot enter. For the nature of the supr=
eme Truth is Light and Ananda, and where desire and demand are, there can b=
e no Ananda."

-Regards
 Rajarshi
