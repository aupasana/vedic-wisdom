Namaste,

Thank you and there are other mentions of Paapa. Like in Durga Sa=
ptashati. "PapaapaHarinim Devi Bhukti Mukti Pradaayinim..."

IMO the concep=
t of Paapa varies according to Desh-kaala-patra (like cooked rice). For Gre=
at Sage Narada it is one for somebody-else may be other.
However Karma & It=
s unfailing reactions is Universal and does not depend upon D/K/P (like Unc=
ooked rice). That may be probably one of the reason why Vedas does not have=
 mention about this.

Best Regards,

Utpal
