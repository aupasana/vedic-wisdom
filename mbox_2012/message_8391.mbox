Pranam Krishna ji,

Many thanks for the link. I checked it out and it conta=
ined a lot of very useful information. 

Will have to give spirituality a p=
roper go now (seems that the past easy days of getting realisation by just =
being a dutiful wife are over....women have to do the hard work themselves =
now...dear dear, I better get started then)!

Best wishes, 

Aparna

 So it is not that those who followed the path of Ma Durga never had women =
saints. Infact, they had more women in their folds who were accorded the hi=
ghest spiritual status than in mainstream Hinduism. But since Tantra itself=
 was never popular, neither were these saints popular. And things like fema=
le foeticide were unheard of in places where the worship of the Goddess was=
 popular. Even the misguided thugees - infamous worshipers of Ma Kali - who=
 were guilty of rampant human-sacrifices, would never dare to offer a woman=
 as a sacrifice to Ma Kali, for they feared of Her wrath since Tantras stri=
ctly forbid harming the female of any specifies for a worshiper of the Godd=
ess. So if blame has to be laid for mistreatment of women, objectively it w=
ould not fall on those whose chief worship was of Durga or Kali or one of H=
er forms.
