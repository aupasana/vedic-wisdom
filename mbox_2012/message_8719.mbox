Hi
=A0 =A0 =A0Once I saw a article about the teacher/guru of the person who=
 started the aryasamaj movement and was blind. When he was young he heard f=
rom a pandit that standing in the Gangaji and doing the Gaytari mantra give=
s certain siddhis. So he would come to Haridawar and stand in water and wou=
ld do Gaytarijapa. How long ago this happened I do not know,150 years and m=
ore may be. One day he heard that somebody was saying to him,--Your japa ha=
s been successful. I am pleased with you. you can go now. So his desires we=
re fulfilled.

Again I saw in a book written by a jyotishi in Pune area per=
haps, that he would do Gaytarijapa in the river near his town.

In 2000 I w=
as in Vrindavan=A0 a old Vaidji told me that during Sun eclipse, he would s=
tand in the water of certain pond and try to get siddhi of those mantra by =
which he could help childless couple.

So it is a genuine method of making =
spiritual progress fast but it is not for everybody. I would not ask others=
 to do. If people get cold or pneumonia or other illness then what? When I =
was doing it I felt very good Once you get in water and go chest deep, wate=
r feel hot. Only the air which is hitting the face and head is very cold. A=
nd you feel so much peace and joy which is amazing.Yes, you again feel very=
 cold when you come out and wear dry clothes.=A0

And there are other diffi=
cult things as well.
One day when I was in water I smelled smoking. I turne=
d round and saw a man was standing at a distance and staring at me and smok=
ing as well. Although he was quite far away but because the air was so puri=
fied, it was affecting me. I could not concentrate on japa and became nervo=
us, came out of water and changed in to dry clothes and went to get some te=
a. I did not speak to him and he did not say a thing, just kept staring at =
me. Later a priest told me about him saying he had left home and wanted to =
become a sadhu. But on that day for some unknown reason he blocked my path.=


Another time I was in a different place where lot of people were taking t=
heir dip in water. I had heard that 4/5 men and women were in water, when s=
ome local boys ran away with their clothes. They had to go to police statio=
n in their wet cloths.So I was nervous myself and came out of water quickly=
. Immediately a young man who was standing near my clothes said, you did no=
t spend much time in water today. I guess he was keeping a eye on me and I =
was saved by The Grace on that day.

Thanks
LaxmiNarayan
