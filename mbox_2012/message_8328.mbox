Namaste Harishji,

Thank you very much for your message.

I live in Norwich=
, but used to live in London till last year (I used to work in Herfordshire=
 actually- was a doctor at Watford general hospital). I still travel to Lon=
don frequently to visit family- and perhaps we could meet up in Hitchin/Lon=
don one of these days when I travel that side. Also if by some chance, you =
travel to these remote parts (Norforlk), do let me know! 

In the meantime,=
 it would be good to speak on the phone if you're willing. I'd be intereste=
d to know about your homam practice so far, and your experiences with it.  =
It's great to hear that you live locally and also do this practice. Hope we=
 can build some sort of homam at home support group in time. 

Regards,

Ap=
arna
