Just wanted to add 2 cents before anybody takes this name equivalence liter=
ally and goes on a wild goose chase.

The arithmetic of one name being equi=
valent to 1000 other names are just phala shruti/artha-vada. Hence they are=
 never meant to be taken literally ever. They are meant to encourage the de=
votee to pursue a particular path.

1. The Rama Rameti shloka tells one Ram=
a name equals 100 names of Vishnu. (This shloka is from Padma Purana)

2. N=
ext we have Brahmanda Purana that says:
sahasra-namnam punyanam, trir-avrtt=
ya tu yat phalam;
ekavrttya tu krsnasya, namaikam tat prayacchati

one Kris=
hna Japa =3D  3 Rama Japa

3. What more, the same anushashasana parva in wh=
ich Vishnu Sahasra Nama is present in Mahabharata has Krishna saying this :=


yO mAm nama sahasrena stotumicchati pandava
yohamekena shlokena stuta eva=
 na samshaya 

By saying this Krishna is implying that one can get the same=
 punya os saying entire Vishnu sahasra nama just by saying one shloka of Vi=
shnu Sahasra nama..  Now each shloka of VSN is equivalent to entire VSN its=
elf.. 
Now we have circular reference in the equation that can never be sat=
isfied !! (Much like GNU stands for GNU is not UNIX !!)

Hence this one nam=
e being equivalent to N other names is a wild goose chase. As PVRji said, i=
ts all in the state of mind.

But there is a specific meditation technique =
that can be specifically applied to Vishnu Sahasra nama and it is mentioned=
 in preface of VSN itself (yaani naamaani gauNani vikhyaataani mahatmanah).=
 Here gauNa does not mean minor. It means "being related to guna". It means=
 each name extolls one (several actually) attributes of Vishnu. One can pon=
der over that quality of Vishnu as that name comes up. It takes up time to =
practice such technique and requires quite a bit of cross reference reading=
. It is to be slowly developed over time. But it is very effective.

Regard=
s,
Srikanth
