Om Harih Om
Namaste friends,

A lot of people asked in the past how to know if they are making 
spiritual progress with their sadhana or not. This is a loaded question, 
but I will share a few random thoughts on this and several related 
topics. More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I will be writing 
on how NOT to try to recognize it!

If you don't like my 2 cents, kindly feel free to ignore me and follow 
your gurus and others whom you may prefer.

*        *        *

MATERIAL RESULTS

One obvious thing is that some people get material benefits, like 
marriage, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That reinforces or increases 
faith in the initial stages and makes one continue sadhana.

However, that may not happen to everyone. Moreover, such material 
results do not necessarily show spiritual progress. So, how do we 
identify spiritual progress?

*        *        *

GOAL OF SADHANA

Spiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized in 
scriptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, it all 
boils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, 
attachments and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the 
mind. How free we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist and 
overcome this innate conditioning.

Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama in "Yoga Vaasishtham" that 
Self-realization means overcoming conditioning. Patanjali defined Yoga 
(Communion with Self) in "Yoga Sutras" as "yogaH chitta vRtti nirodhaH" 
(Communion is resisting the working of conditioning).

This conditioning inflates ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, 
we can deflate the ego completely and then identify with the entire 
universe, instead of a single entity with a single agenda.

*        *        *

IDENTIFYING CONDITIONING

Innate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determines our 
likes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or dislike) 
some people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some things 
though our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) those 
things. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated 
over many lives.

When someone praises us, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner 
voice tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. When someone puts us 
down, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice tells us so) 
and yet we may feel offended and feel like doing something about it. All 
this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated over many 
lives.

Idnetifying the conditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, 
calculations and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key 
is to learn to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the 
inner voice of conscience is telling us one thing and we are impelled 
from inside to do otherwise, we can conclude that that is the work of 
conditioning. We often suppress the inner voice of conscience and obey 
the inner voice of our conditioning.

If we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - physical or mental 
- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it means our 
conditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful measure of 
spiritual progress. This may in general be difficult for others to 
judge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.

The tricky thing is that our self-analysis and self-judgment is also 
controlled by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action against 
my inner voice. Suppose I want to analyze what just happened and whether 
I violated my inner voice of conscience. That whole process is governed 
by the conditioning too. Depending on how deeply I am conditioned to 
think that I am a good person doing the right thing and not making a 
mistake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voice of conscience 
as a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance. Instead, it 
will focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts out from 
inside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that I did the 
right thing.

The grip of conditioning is too tight to overcome in a day or two! But, 
the inner voice of conscience does tell everyone when one is doing 
something wrong under the influence of conditioning. If one keeps 
trying, it can oneday help one identify and overcome conditioning.

*        *        *

SPECIAL EXPERIENCES

Sometimes, as one makes spiritual progress, one may have super-normal or 
mystical or out-of-body experiences, visions and dreams.

For example, one person I know started to feel very light in the head 
with a vision of bright light of a particular color, when he meditated 
with a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a big fire at 
the base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire (he actually 
felt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific mantra. Another 
person saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity talked to him. 
Interestingly, the same deity was seen by another person who was also 
sitting there at the same time and that person had a totally different 
(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same deity at the same 
time. Another person felt like he became very light and was floating in 
air and there was an inexpressible happiness. In another case, one 
sadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense that his job was done 
on earth and he could now leave. He thought, "let me leave and let me 
take some more with me". He felt like he was a point moving up with a 
tremendous speed. At the same time, another person who was meditating a 
few feet away in front of a homam fire felt like somebody was pulling 
that person forcibly through a cave and felt really overwhelmed.

There are so many possible experiences. But the key point is that 
experiences are secondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT for 
spiritual progress. I had my share of experiences, progress and setbacks 
and I am 100% sure of the above. You'll do well to remember this 
sentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences or desire them 
consciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little later on the 
grave dangers of desiring experiences.

*        *        *

EXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION

We say that god can be known only by experience and not by reading 
books. That is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply desirous of an 
experience, one may experience an aspect of god's Delusory Power instead 
of god and that may increase false pride (a true experience of god will 
instead produce infinite humility). Not all experiences are equal.

There is a famous quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton of 
theory. Though that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of 
experience is useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of 
theory may actually be better if it actually reduces one's ego to a 
pound or an ounce!

The issue is not whether one needs practical experience or theoretical 
understanding. That is secondary. The primary thing is what is happening 
to one's ego. Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT is undoubtedly 
the main issue. If reading books, satsanga, rituals, theoretical 
understanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal, from a quintal to 
a pound and from a pound to an ounce, even without a direct experience, 
that's awesome. That is better than getting a ton of experience and ego 
being inflated from a pound to a quintal.

Though it is true that ego does not become complete zero without an 
"experience" of god in the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that 
"experience" when one's ego is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce it 
to as small a quantity as you can. Experience of god will then come by 
itself.

In the famous Indian movie "3 Idiots", there is a nice line: "Don't 
chase success, but chase capability. Success will follow automatically." 
Similarly, don't chase experiences, but chase detachment and deflation 
of ego. Experience will automatically follow. Chasing experience without 
trying to reduce ego is like putting the cart before the horse. To use 
the analogy from the movie "3 Idiots", one then runs the risk of 
becoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Ramalingam (alias Silencer) 
of that movie, who chased success, ended up with huge ego from limited 
success and failed in the end!

*        *        *

EXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING

As said above, it is a bad idea to seek an "experience" when one's ego 
is still a ton or a quintal. In other words, when one's conditioning is 
dense enough, a pre-occupation with experiences can be 
counter-productive. The reason is that any experience will be 
interpreted (and absorbed into one's system!!!) through the color of 
one's conditioning.

If I go into the open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see 
that Sun is orange. But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass 
windows of a house. Or suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through 
green eyeglasses. In either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am 
experiencing the real Sun, but I will get the wrong knowledge that "Sun 
is green".

Similarly, even a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN 
generate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one's conditioning is 
conducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).

The key is not just to experience, but the ability to interpet, *digest* 
and absorb the experience into one's system well. One's conditioning 
influences how one digests various life experiences, including spiritual 
experiences and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the 
above example!

*        *        *

DIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES

In ayurvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic 
buildup in the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various 
tissues and create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look and 
feel healthy despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one 
develops serious diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts 
of the body. The ama may even interfere with the digestion of good food 
being taken in and the working of even medicines one may take in. When 
too much ama has accumulated and destabilizes the system, one may need 
to go through a painful de-toxification process.

Similarly, spiritual experiences one cannot digest well become spiritual 
ama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can slowly build up, get 
absorbed into various aspects of one's being and create various diseases 
in the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and feel 
spiritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritual 
ama accumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can 
eventually affect one's entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for 
de-toxification) may be far more difficult than the physical 
pancha-karma.

*        *        *

EXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS

To illustrate what I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a 
*hypothetical* example.

Suppose someone sits still for a few hours everyday and meditates. 
Suppose one starts to get some special inner experiences and some 
seemingly supernatural things start happening externally around one. 
Suppose these experiences give one the impression that one is special 
and one is making excellent spiritual progress. Suppose one reads some 
spiritual books and fantasizes "becoming like Shiva" mentioned in those 
books. Then one may start to think "may be, I have become like Shiva" 
and slowly convince oneself that one HAS become like Shiva. Suppose one 
reads a spiritual book that claims "If one becomes like Shiva, the whole 
universe connives against one who causes an offense to him".

Of course, there is a context behind every statement and no statement is 
absolute. If one misses the nuances, one may digest and absorb it into 
one's system incorrectly. After all, one could have also said, "if one 
becomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully co-operates with one and 
there is no way anyone can really cause offense to that person".

Anyway, one in the process of convincing oneself that one has indeed 
become like Shiva may then look for examples of someone causing offense 
and suffering bad things. Of course, just as one can find any shapes in 
clouds, one can find any correlations in things happening around one. 
One will find a few examples. That may reinforce the delusion that one 
has become like Shiva. When good and bad happen to people around one, 
one may start correlating them to good and bad done by those people to 
one and/or to things one has done. Over time, the delusion may become so 
deep that it just feels so natural and obvious. This is like a serious 
disease developing from a toxic buildup of undigested or badly digested 
food. Inability to fully understand the spiritual experiences one had, 
the fantasy of becoming like Shiva, the pre-exising pride (like 
pre-existing ama) and the not-so-well-digested notion that offense to 
Shiva causes harm, have together created spiritual ama buildup that now 
resulted in a serious disease.

Though original experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming 
later on MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from the 
ill-digested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is 
conducive to creating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of 
the system can spread to others.

As said before, the key issue is: Is the ego getting inflated or 
deflated. If ego is getting inflated, then one is on the wrong track. 
One is either deluding oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences due 
to pre-existing conditioning and delusions (spiritual ama). In either 
case, whatever one is experiencing is not being digested well and is 
weakening the system instead of strengthening it. If, on the other hand, 
ego is getting deflated, then one is on the right track. Whatever one is 
experiencing is being digested well and strengthening the system.

*        *        *

SHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIRACLES

This emphasis on ego deflation may make some people wonder about the 
prominence given in some books to accumulation of shakti, siddhis and 
miracles. For example, some books describe what a being like Shiva or 
someone less but still with high enough shakti, can do.

Yes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings close to enlightenment MAY 
have a lot of spiritual shakti and be able to do some special things. 
But, no book said that you get those abilities by being proud or 
pursuing something that can make one proud.

In fact, if one looks at those abilities described in books and adores 
them from one's *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is quite akin 
to looking at a "green Sun" from green eyeglasses and admiring the 
greenness of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole point. 
One with dense conditioning can't even understand what that shakti or 
ability really means or comes from. In order to understand what shakti 
is, to accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUST 
deflate one's ego.

Bottomline is this: Most scriptures of most religions are unanimous in 
teaching the importance of humility, compassion and ego deflation. No 
scripture talks about the glory of pride and ego inflation. It's as 
simple as that.

*        *        *

GODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS

We encounter some people who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses 
and also conversations with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime 
coming from the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine 
beings supposedly said is well within what one consciously or 
sub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.

This may remind one of the encounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character 
played by Sanjay Dutt in hit bollywood movie "Lage Rahe Munnabhai". In 
that movie, the visions are due to "chemical imbalance" in Munnabhai's 
mind and the Gandhi he sees and can talk to, cannot answer questions 
that Munnabhai himself does not know (but real Gandhi should know). So 
the conclusion is that the person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a 
character in his own mind constructed based on what Munnabhai 
understands of Gandhi.

In the case of divine encounters, it may be a little different from this 
movie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied meeting based on all 
that one consciously and sub-consciously knew already, OR it may be a 
real being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her actions are 
interpreted strictly based on one's conditioning, like the "green Sun" 
in our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, what divine 
beings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one consciously or 
sub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.

In the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning having a 
real divine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mother or 
father, and there is a real flow of divine and sublime understanding and 
wisdom.

Again, the key is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be 
de-conditioned enough to really benefit from it!

*        *        *

KUNDALINI AWAKENING & RISE

One more thing people often talk about is Kundalini awakening and rise. 
Kundalini shakti is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this 
is "I"). Kundalini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra means one does not 
even question who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties 
self down to the physical body and physical senses. However, 
self-awareness rising above this does not necessarily mean spiritual 
progress or enlightenment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of 
a long process. If one's conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle 
ideas of who one is (e.g. I am a great spiritual soul who saved the 
world many times in the past and came back to save it), an awakened 
Kundalini may take one's notion of self beyond the physical body, but 
will get stuck somewhere else. In fact, one's subtle notions of self may 
become aggrandized when Kundalini reaches conducive regions and one may 
experience things that aggravate and strengthen those notions. One may 
get badly stuck.

As mentioned above, any spiritual experience can create spiritual ama 
when not digested properly. Any pre-existing conditioning may make it 
difficult to digest anything complex. Instead of eating a heavy-duty 
protein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxic buildup in the 
system, one is better off eating simple food that one's own system can 
process and digest well.

To be clear, whether one's Kundalini is awakened or not, and where one's 
Kundalini is currently, is NOT a measure of one's spiritual progress. As 
Kundalini does not rise through a single path, as the rise is not linear 
and as the obstructions are not uniform in all people, one cannot 
compare two people based on Kundalini experiences.

One can cling to the body and overcome all conditioning slowly and 
oneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the way to Sahasrara. Another 
person may awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck somewhere where it is 
extremely difficult to overcome the corresponding conditioning.

The bottomline is that how much conditioning is overcome and how reduced 
one's ego is is the correct measure of spiritual progress and not 
whether Kundalini is awakened and where Kundalini is.

*        *        *

CORRELATIONS GALORE

Do not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or may 
not mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, "wow, I was 
just thinking about you". Or suppose you say something and someone says, 
"wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as though you read 
my mind." Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings in some region of 
the world, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad happened 
there. Or suppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did some 
sadhana and the desire was fulfilled.

In several such cases, correlating a result with something you did can 
often increase pride and your sense of self-worth. And, doing that will 
not enable you to do your dharma any better.

Keep thinking your thoughts and desires, keep doing your actions and 
keep doing your sadhana. That's it. Don't correlate actions and results 
and think that you made X or Y result happen. We engage in actions and 
god gives results. The sense of "I made X happen" is conducive to pride 
and ego inflation. Moreover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether 
action A or B caused result X or Y, because the action-result pipeline 
has variable delay!! So, why even bother to correlate and run the risk 
of ego inflation?

*        *        *

BOTTOMLINE

Don't run after special experiences and special abilities or anything 
that makes you special (as you imagine currently, based on your dense 
conditioning). Spiritual progress is not about becoming "special", but 
about becoming humble. Special experiences and abilities do not matter 
at all. In fact, they can distract one and give false pride. God makes 
one special AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost completely.

Also, stop correlating things happening to or around you, with your 
actions, and think that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actions is 
your sacred duty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time is 
god's prerogative. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe 
in one's thinking.

Remember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful measure of 
spiritual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble you become 
(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have really become 
internally). It is how well you are able to resist the temptations of 
following the voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and how 
well you can follow the voice of conscience.

When inflations in ego occur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice 
it, bring it to the attention and perhaps even be ruthless in belling 
the cat [of ego]. But most gurus now-a-days may not do that well. So, 
you have to do your best to avoid any serious ego inflations.

Unfortunately, the path of spiritual progress and self-realization IS 
very very very likely for most of us to include many many many 
opportunities for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict 
watch on your ego.
