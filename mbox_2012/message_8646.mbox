Namaste Vinayak,

No I don't think you are considering Narasimha ji as Gur=
u.  How many
of us will ask their Guru to try out different Spiritual Pract=
ice and
give a comparative study? I think you are treating him as Spiritual=

Consultant.

Anyway, as Narasimha ji has said it is finally individual pre=
ference. So
even he try out on request, what do you expect him to say one i=
s 80%
effective, same, or 110% effective. He will still say that this is my=

comparative judgment but it may be different for you.  So best you try
out=
 and read his post on spiritual progress and judge what works better
for yo=
u, or you want both.

Now on my experience, I learnt SK in 2002 and within =
25 days learnt PS. 
I have practiced both regularly for 1 years and SK alon=
e for 7 years. I
have done Advance course 8 times. Also have listen Narad B=
hakti Sutra,
Astavakra Geeta etc. As you mentioned that AOL service is cons=
idered
very important part, I had also done lots of volunteering activities=
 in
AOL including being Administrator for Primary School. Since 2009, I hav=
e
stopped practicing SK, as I felt that I after initial couple of years of
=
progress, I did not find progressing much on spiritual level. I found
reall=
y helpful in stress relief and mental calmness, but considered
commodity/re=
tail spirituality.

Now from last 10 months, by taking Ganapathi as Guru, I=
 have started
doing japa every day and homam every weekend. I have not spen=
t equal
amount of time in Homam as in SK practice to give you comparison. Y=
es,
it will take longer than SK to master the technique, and initially mind=

is more occupied in maintaining the fire.

So can only say, if you like in=
 the reasoning and explanation of
Narasimha ji, better try yourself and see=
 how you feel. Anyway, AoL also
teaches Agnihotra, and also homam in their =
Veda school. During Navaratri
in Bangalore ashram there are all the homam d=
one. So  Homam is not
contradiction to AOL.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Mi=
hir.
