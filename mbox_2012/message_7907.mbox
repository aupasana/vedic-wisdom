Namaste,

atleast a couple spiritual giants emphatically said that there is=
 no word called "Papa" (Sin) in Vedas!
It is all karmas & Its reactions! de=
fine it as Paapa, Punya or something else which suits ones mental condition=
ing. Definition strongly depends upon desh kaala patra.
If at all there is =
one Sin, It is weakness in us.
***
Ashvin asked about What about Ghee etc..=
.poured in Havan.

It is very simple! All which is offered in Havan is for =
feeding various deities. It is also feeding some higher souls albeit at dif=
ferent level.
Hence it is not wastage but most definitely a desirable Karma=
. It is a ritual out of strong faith in Shastras.
Best Regards,

Utpal
