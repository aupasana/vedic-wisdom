Shri Narasimhaji,

Namaste!

With ParamAtman's Grace, I have decided to sta=
rt a homam. In the beginning, I intend to do it every Saturday. I will star=
t with the MahaGanapathy homam, and then let MahaGanapathy guide me along t=
he path, as you have said many times. Shrimaan, I was thinking of starting =
from the beginning of the New Year in Chaitra Masa, which happens on March =
23rd this year. The very auspicious Vasant/Chaitra Navaratri also starts th=
e same day. I was thinking of starting from either Chaitra Pratipada - Marc=
h 23rd, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvitiya -March 24th, Shanivara. Do you reckon=
 this to be a good time to start the homam? and which is a better day - Cha=
itra Pratipada, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvitiya, Shanivara? 

I look forward =
to your guidance.

Thanks and best regards,
Manish
