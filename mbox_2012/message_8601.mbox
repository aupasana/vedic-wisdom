I do not find adequate words for the gratitude i felt for this master Piece=
.

Was reading and re-reading Vimalananda's teachings compiled in Kundalini=
 and this conversation compiled by you is "Sone pe Suhaagaa" kind of feelin=
g! It was a fresh breather in otherwise outright boredom of Internet Spirit=
uality. jab "State of battery" itself is not realised, reading-talking abou=
t other concepts felt like somebody is hammering the head.

67432 baaton ki=
 ek baat, Sadhana, Sadhana and Saa-dhanaa!

Jagadamba! Jagadamba!
