edic-wisdom] Homam - Ahuti numbers
 

=C2=A0 
My pranams to all.
I have bee=
n performing weekly havan for more than a year and half.
I want to point ou=
t certain things related to havan so that it can be done as per shastra by =
others too.
I am using a conversation that in fact took place to bring out =
these relevant points.

Sometime back there was informal "prashNa" session =
whose summary I am presenting below: 

[South Indians might be familiar wit=
h similar "ashTamangala prashNa" conducted in temples when something goes w=
rong - called as dosha.]

PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... H=
mm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agn=
i karya at your home regularly.

Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised=
 by this pointed question because I had not told anybody about the havan I =
did at home)

PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agni karya=
 you are doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti d=
oes not seem to be right.

Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).

Pras=
hNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of ghee before=
 giving it as ahuti.

Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart f=
rom that?

PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa before giving ahutis?=
 And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for your regular=
 japa?

Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that?=
 No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?

PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictl=
y the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a=
 mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it=
 should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditatio=
n, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)

Myself: Doesnt that only apply to pur=
ascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group=
 is already familiar with that book series)

PrashNa conductor: No it appli=
es to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule i=
s always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.

The conve=
rsation went onto several other things. Subsequently I went on to get mantr=
a-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra and also using=
 the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned ratio onl=
y and have been very happy with my spiritual progress since. 

Whether all =
the homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I just wanted to p=
oint this out to all requesting everybody to perform at least 10 times Japa=
 of the mantra used for ahuti to get the "qualification" for the ahuti.

gards,
