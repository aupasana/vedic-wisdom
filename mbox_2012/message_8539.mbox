Even if the play goes o=
n, different actors may play the part. Every station
within this realm can =
be attained by "human" effort. It is not simply
destined to happen. The Man=
us, Indras, and *all other beings* are simply
roles played by some beings. =
In Yoga Vasistha (2.5.14-16), we are told that
this applies to Brahma, Vish=
nu and Shiva as well.

For a moment, let us assume that "freedom from rebir=
th" exists. Let us also
assume that some beings are "eligible" for such a m=
oksha. Even in this
case, some beings may not choose this path. With an ext=
remely light
conditioning, they may choose to remain in the world.


> Is t=
here any stopping from coming back?


I am curious -- do you believe that t=
he universe is maya (the way it it
commonly portrayed by advaitins), or do =
you believe that it is "real" (the
way it is commonly portrayed by dvaitins=
)? Or perhaps something different
altogether?

sasneham,

   ajit

the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the rea=
son for all=A0 the religious troubles and other nonsense." X felt a li=

 Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man=
 here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely different degrees o=
f confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not accessible to others.&=

business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is infin=
ite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best a man =
will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-powers. I=
f the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this form by a=
 projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abilities=
 from this form, and generally be regarded=A0 by others as a man of god. Bu=
t God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying t=

ea-stall and bought some ganja,
 and in one pull finished off the chillum. =
Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the =
smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning X) are a young m=
