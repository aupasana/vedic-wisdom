Respect Sir,
=C2=A0
If you had the time to read all the accepted Shastras a=
nd list down all the instructions given therein, you will realize it is imp=
ossible to satisfy all conditions. Infact, often they are contradictory. Wh=
y? Because each shastras is powerful and valid for a particular time, place=
 and cultural setting. At one point it was considered leaving ones "desh" a=
nd crossing an ocean was a terrific sin. What is "desh"? India the country =
did not exist. Ones village was ones desh and everything around, from the n=
ext village to the end of the landmass was all "videsh". So if I apply that=
 logic today, how many people in this forum have already committed this gre=
at "sin"? Nearly everyone. Because the settings have changed. 
=C2=A0
The V=
edas are considered an eternal book, because the Veda samhitas contain desc=
riptions of spiritual states in allegorical form. They are not a book=C2=A0=
of good ethical living.=C2=A0Apart from the core-veda samhitas, all dharmic=
 rulebooks are never ment for eternity. In changed scenarios, they too must=
 undergo change. But based on what? A natural sense of right and wrong, pro=
portion and disproportion, arising out=C2=A0of=C2=A0a clear heart. There is=
 no greater rule book for ethical living than ones own heart. Follow it, an=
d you won't be disappointed. If you keep following your heart through thick=
 and thin, the sense of right and wrong (discrimination)=C2=A0will develop =
in such a fashion=C2=A0that you won't need sanction from anywhere,=C2=A0but=
 your own self,=C2=A0for your actions. That is creating a Viveka-chudamani.=

=C2=A0
Wasting food anyway is a bad habit. We know it. Feeding the needy w=
henever possible is always a good habit. That too we know.=C2=A0=C2=A0Feed =
others, human or animal whenever you can, and when you can't; don't bother.=
 Most important of all, don't bother about violating a rulebook and thus co=
mmitting a 'sin'. That is such a terrific wastage of mental energy.

Respected Sirs,
Namasthe,=

To my knowledge, i understand that, as per our scriptures=C2=A0one (grihas=
ta)=C2=A0 should take=C2=A0yhe food after serving the needy (Athithi). So o=
ne should wait for the arrival of guest before taking food & if non arrives=
 the grihastha can have his foodafter noon. The food that remains can be gi=

With pranams,
Sury=

Namaste Sir,

Thank you for the reply. 

Your message reminded of story of Saint Tiruval=
luvar. He used to place a toothpick and a bowl of water while eating. Whenv=
er a grain of rice fell, he used to pick it up with the toothpick rinse it =
in water and eat it thereafter.
