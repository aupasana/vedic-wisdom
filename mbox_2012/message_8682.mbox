The greatest mystery of existen=
ce is existence itself. There is the
existence of the universe and there is=
 the existence of the awareness of
existence of the universe. Were it not f=
or this awareness, even if the
universe existed as an external reality, we =
would not be aware of its
existence, so it would for all practical purpose =
not exist. Traditional
science assumes, for the most part, that an objectiv=
e observer independent
reality exists; the universe, stars, galaxies, sun, =
moon and earth would
still be there if no one was looking. However, modern =
quantum theory, the
most successful of all scientific creations of the huma=
n mind, disagrees.
The properties of a particle, quantum theory tells us, d=
o not even exist
until an observation takes place. Quantum theory disagrees=
 with
traditional, Newtonian physics. Most scientists, although respecting
=
quantum theory, do not follow its implications. The result is a kind of
sch=
izophrenia between what scientists believe and what they practice. When
we =
examine this hypothesis of traditional science, we find it more a
metaphysi=
cal assumption than a scientific assertion.

How can we assert that an obse=
rver-independent reality exists if the
assertion itself is dependent on the=
 existence of a conscious observer?
This raises the additional dilemma of w=
ho or what is the observer and where
is this observer located? When scienti=
sts in general describe empirical
facts and formulate scientific theories, =
they forget that neither facts nor
theories are an insight into the true na=
ture of fundamental reality apart
from any observer. What we consider to be=
 empirical facts are entirely
dependent on observation, in agreement with q=
uantum theory. The scientific
observer in this case is an activity of the u=
niverse called Homo sapiens
usually with a Ph.D. in physics, biology, neuro=
science or other branches of
science. However, many scientists have never r=
eally asked the question "Who
am I"?

Most neuroscientists who still don't =
believe that quantum theory has
anything to do with the brain, would assert=
 that "I", the conscious
observer, is solely an epiphenomenon of the brain;=
 that consciousness is
produced by the brain, just as gastric juices are pr=
oduced by the stomach
and bile is produced by the gall bladder. The problem=
 with this of course,
is that any neuroscientist worth his/her tenure will =
tell you that there is
no satisfactory theory in neuroscience that explains=
 how neurochemistry
translates into conscious experience. How do electroche=
mical phenomena in
the brain create the appreciation of the beauty of a red=
 rose, the taste of
garlic, the smell of onions, the feeling of love, compa=
ssion, joy, insight,
intuition, imagination, creativity, free will, or awar=
eness of existence of
self and the universe? There is no physicalist theory=
 based on classical
physics to explain these subjective experiences. Nor, i=
s there any obvious
means for coming up with one.


When traditional scienc=
e finds itself in such an impasse it might be time
to question some of the =
basic assumptions about so called
independently-existing reality. We must r=
evisit the idea that science is a
methodology and not an ontology. Current =
science however is based on a
physicalist ontology. This is the basic belie=
f that reality is physical and
mind is an epiphenomenon of matter (the nerv=
ous system). Nonetheless we are
baffled when asked to explain how matter be=
comes mind. We suggest here a
fundamental revision in our most cherished sc=
ientific assumptions. We
boldly suggest that matter, force fields, particle=
s, waves, even the fabric
of space and time are not denizens of fundamental=
 reality but that they are
perceptual and cognitive experiences in consciou=
sness. Actually what we
propose, would be in agreement with what most of th=
e great physicists who
founded quantum theory almost a hundred years ago wo=
uld hold. But we are
also going beyond, taking the statements of quantum th=
eory to the next
level: All of physical reality is a perceptual experience =
in consciousness
alone. The experience may turn out to be different for dif=
ferent species.

What is physical reality to a bat, a honey bee, a nematode=
, a whale, a
dolphin, an eagle, an insect with numerous eyes? There is no f=
ixed physical
reality, no single perception of the world, just numerous way=
s of
interpreting world views as dictated by one's nervous system and the
s=
pecific environment of our planetary existence. We propose that the
worldvi=
ew of current science as its is being practiced, which operates from
the as=
sumption that human perception and particularly facts emanating from
observ=
ations made with human scientific methods are the only fundamental
truth, i=
s clearly flawed. Furthermore the subject / object split that is
the basic =
premise of the current scientific methods has led to the creation
of arguab=
ly detrimental technologies including mechanized death, petroleum
products =
in our food, genetically modified foods, global warming,
extinction of spec=
ies, and even the possible extinction of the human
species. Building on the=
 quantum view of the cosmos, which accepts a
non-local, entangled reality t=
hat includes observers as fundamental, we
suggest the next natural step, a =
new science rooted in consciousness, one
that strives to interpret the enti=
re universe, with all its observers, all
modes of observation, and all obje=
cts observed as nothing other than
consciousness and it's manifestations!
R=
ejecting what we believe is the most reasonable and rational approach
propo=
sed here, will lead nowhere and force us to accept randomness and lack
of p=
urpose as the hallmarks of the universe. Such a view is, ultimately,
leadin=
g to no meaning for our own very existence. We suggest that
perceptual obje=
cts experienced in consciousness, including our very brains,
are not the so=
urce of consciousness. We suggest rigorous testing of this
radically differ=
ent ontology. We feel a holistic science that does not
separate observer fr=
om that which is observed would lead to the unraveling
of the mysteries of =
the universe which at presently seem beyond reach,
leading to an understand=
ing of a conscious universe in which all are
differentiated activities of a=
 single field that is an undivided wholeness
and in some sense bridges exte=
rnal reality with inner being.
