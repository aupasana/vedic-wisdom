Dear Tanvir Ji,

I can add some useful information on this regard....

1. I=
n India, we kept the mature coconut in a dry place... over the time(3 to 6 =
months) the outside skin of the coconut becomes dry...

2. Full coconut(wit=
h skin) resembles the human head, burning the full coconut resembles the bu=
rning of our ego(I-ness)

3. When the "homam kunda" is big enough could bur=
n a full coconut comfortably with wood log... In a small "homam kunda"... i=
ts really adventurious! :) simply... it would not burn...

4. Whether dry o=
r not, the coconut slice should burn beautifully with wood log and enough g=
hee...

Best of luck...

*** "Its amazing how god makes his devotees do hom=
ams even in muslim land" ***

Priya Ji, it hurts me... all we are the child=
 of god! all path ends towords god! if the muslim world exist... then there=
 must be some intention of mother! after all... its her universe...

Biswaj=
it

ote, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Brahmin family f=
or about 10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing homam!=
 However I was disappoint because their procedure was so big that it would =
take about 3 hours for the homam, and many more materials also. Of course, =
they learnt it from 'guru-kulam' and it was their own tradition. They are n=
ot a modern researcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who could compare many tradi=
tions, research on them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had =
no idea that a shorter version is possible, or something can be left out. A=
s an example, they suggested a mantadory japam of 10x times before I do an =
'x' times offering in homam, and many more formalities.

Bangladesh I would never have so much materials needed, and I would not be =

make a spoon with wood.

was moving with the homam, I knew that with a big stream of ghee as a purna=
huti, the fire will not survive long to allow me meditate even 5 mins. Beca=
use the woods were burning out fast.

first Q. - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can I make the fire last lo=

nut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I can dry them no matter how =
long it takes, so that I can use them as suggested in the manual. HOWEVER, =
my question is - how to I dry a "FULL" coconut so much that it becomes BURN=
ABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts... but if I keep a =
full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rotten or something? =
Any procedure? I am asking this because here no one has any idea about that=

o.
> 
> Today with the homam, the effect was not that strong. I know why, b=
ecause it was a super-short homam, with many mantras left. Also, I should h=
onestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva in the =
fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worried and nervo=
us about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their presence. Which=
 I should. I guess it will improve with time.

> I am going to add mantra=
s from the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed in all homams l=
ike Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I guess Avahana-rela=

 didn't have any negative experience after the homam. I was pretty nervous =
about the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 when I started mantra=
s, almost everyday I faced negative energies for the imperfection of pronun=
ciation and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so strong. But I didn'=
t give up and tried to understand the correct ways because since I saw the =
power in it, I had to find what's the right way to get the pure blessings, =
avoiding mistakes.

y in an empty stomach while doing homam. I find this 100% true from my mant=
ra japam experience. Though no website or almost no one instructed me to st=
ay empty stomached in japam, I found that mantras work very strong with emp=
ty stomach. Also, I always got strong negative effects when I did japam aft=
er my dinner. Thus, I learned this from my own experience but after a lot o=
f troubles faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now days, I can't eat any=
thing after my lunch... because I do mantras in the evening. At times it be=
comes very difficult not to eat something as I sometimes hang out with frie=
nds etc. at afternoon or early evening. But I have no choice.

manual if I take Shani as an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or div=
