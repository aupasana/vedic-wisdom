First of all, to anyone reading this , please chant mentally while
reading,=
 time is running out, who knows when you will reach the
cremation ground, c=
hant and chant. For those who don't have anything to
chant, please chant ra=
m, waheguru, allah or any name, mentally. Recite
any mantra, anything, ever=
y waking moment should be devoted to god,
because its the only worthwhile t=
hing to do as a human.
Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo

To Mr Rao,
"You make me =
curious. Are you by any chance SA from Delhi?"
Good question, but I don't h=
ave an answer to that Maalik.
I don't know whether I am SA or not
I am shen=
shah - e- Befkuf, mere se zyada koi befkuf nahin is dharti pe
iss time par.=

Trillions of me can be created with dust of my teacher's aka god's
thumbna=
il, its irrelevant who I am.
Don't thank me for my writing's ,they are not =
mine.
Plus I am not me, eventually.

Meri Sarkaar, you are cent percent cor=
rect (you have to be, not because
of you, But because of your mentor who is=
 far different from most people
know him as, Khair chhoro) about all the ch=
ildren of mumma, who are at
different stages of their progress.
Point well =
taken. I don't ever look down upon anyone, it was written to
impart somethi=
ng I have felt long after wandering on this board for a
long period of time=
. It was written in such a manner ,that it may have
sounded like I am looki=
ng down/scolding everyone else, but nope, they
too are my mother, eventuall=
y.
Khair, Chuck it, again point well taken, thank you.

You are brilliant.
=
Now you will say, you are not, your mother is, but I never was referring
to=
 Mr Rao in the first place ;)

---------------------->>>>>>>>>>>
Haanji you=

To Utpal Saab

A=
 form of god, that someone worships in the fire, always answers " Bhai

bhai sahi=

peshi??"".

e=
very - time you say maza aa gaya , you remind me of that very form.
Thank y=
ou for reminding.

Ek batli kya chaar batli maaro maalik, bas bhagwaan ke n=
aam ki ;)
Perennial repetition of god's name is the ultimate scotch, nasha =
hi
nasha, koi hangover bhi nahin, oye hoye!!!

One day I heard a man in Del=
hi singing to his ma in a cremation ground,

Tera Naam Loon Zubaan Say, Ter=
e Aagay Sir Jhuka Doon,
Mera Ishq Keh Raha Hai, Mein Tujhe Khuda Bana Loon,=

Tera Naam Mere Lab Per, Mera Tazkara Hai Dar Dar,
Mujhay Bhool Ja'ay Duniy=

Mere Dil Mein Bus Rahe Hain, Tere Bepanaah J=
alwe,
Na Ho Jiss Mein Noor Tera, Woh Chiragh Hi Bujha Doon=85=85

And then =
he continued

Tumhara Husn Agar Benaqaab Ho Jaaye,
Her Ek Chehra Khuda Ki K=
itaab Ho Jaaye,
Jo Qaide Sa Na Ho To Fazool Hai Sajda,
Adab Ke Saath Khata =
Bhi Sawab Ho Jaaye,
Sharabiyo Ko Aquidadt Hai Is Qadar Tum Se,

And then further,

tu jo chhoo le pyaar se

aaja chanda bahoo mein

And he was crying.
I bowed to that man. And touched his feet.

Live mu=
sic always sways me and my teacher, we both are suckers for good
music.
In =
fact, watch this, while keeping god in mind,(chant to the music)
http://you=
tu.be/Q-4ONntmhMY?t=3D1m30s

And only keep god in mind, your chosen form, o=
ho, what ecstasy can be
had, not even scotch can give one such joy. Fantast=
ic rendition.
If Thakur ji sang/heard this, coupled with his devotion, he w=
ould be
lost in mahabhava samadhi in seconds. Listen around 5 minutes in,  =
a man
who is properly "cooked" in "god's ghee" cannot remain in the right
s=
enses after that=85=85=85=85

--------------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>=

Oh Bhaisaab, you there, haanji chikni chameli, bhai chant kar lo parte -=

parte, time naa waste karo. Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo

To Priyank  Mahara=
j,

A little pointer,
"they do sadhana for all gods"
For all forms sounds b=
etter, and I always prefer to do for one form
first, paagal kutton ki tarah=
 till that form runs after the devotee to
perform worship because now he/sh=
e can't afford to be away from the
devotee. It becomes a play, a play of th=
at only those two lovers can
understand.

A little point about love these d=
ays, One day a man who is in love with
the sun, was doing homam on , a sund=
ay afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an
open field with no shade, in a temperatur=
e of 47 degree centigrades and
was sweating profusely as expected. He was g=
etting irritated with the
sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun aske=
d him, bete do you want
me to hide so that you are comfortable???
The man l=
ooked down in shame upon himself and asked himself,
we all can't stand him =
in summers, I want him to  go away this very
moment, just because my body i=
s trying to cool itself down with sweat.
All of us look out for him in the =
winters calling him, coming out to
sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse hi=
m, we wish to drive him away, we
don't wish to see his face, is this my fuc=
king love??? And to all that
look at his love, he wants to hide, "wah pitaj=
i" ,the man said.

The man was humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun f=
orgave him
because after all, you know, he is the sun, the man only could s=
ay back
"shine on, I love "you", no matter what." The temperature went up t=
o 48.
(That last line was a joke.)

In winters we all sing songs of loving =
the sun, yet in summers we hate
him, that is not love, its mere usage, and =
since that orb is so
magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all =
because of him
there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads t=
o all of us
breathing, he is god's foremost proof. Without him, this planet=
 won't
exist, which leads to no economies, no mba's , no gdp, no play.
Hell=
, he burns for us, just because he loves us, true love it's called.

Yet wh=
at do most of us do, we don't give one shit for him for all our
births comb=
ined.
I am talking about people outside of all this worship business. And
t=
here are quite a few.

These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn't re=
spond favorably,
automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because sh=
e didn't give
the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.

I'll t=
ell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in
love wit=
h a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met
him, infac=
t is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to
actually care( Do=
n't ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself
don't know) He is ridi=
culously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,
I asked him if you so lo=
ve her why don't you ask of her from god.
Well, he slapped me. He told me y=
ou forgot Gorakhnath's rule????? My
mother will decide her daughter - in- l=
aw, meri kya aukaad ki main ink
bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who =
chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa
chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is=
 far more insane than
quite a lot of people I have met.

Then he went on, t=
hat who told you that you are sure to get the one you
love????
You love the=
n claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another
slap!!
You people lo=
ve, to get. I love for love's sake. All I can ask from God
is to look out f=
or her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment
I ask, i am screwed=
, because I know it will be delivered, but then
what's the fun in that, and=
 when did i become big enough to know whats
best for me???? yeh toh meri ma=
a ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love
should be so intense, that god he=
rself should come and tell me "you, my
son, deserve her.", and I'd rather p=
refer that she (god) tells me first
"You , my son, deserve me.", because if=
 I have her, i already have that
girl, who is eventually her.
To top it all=
 he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can then
he say anything =
to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you
have surrendered, the=
n it should be total, not partial. That doesn't
mean you sit on your ass wa=
rming it up and saying what do I need to do,
everything god will do, kyun b=
hai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari
hui hai??

Surrender is you do your=
 duty, even if the results are "bad", they are
god's, the results are "good=
", they are god's, who are you in between.
If you actually manage to surren=
der, you won't ever need a disprin or a
counselor, believe you me. Its a bl=
issful life post the surrender, be it
in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet=
 house, one and the same thing.

One of the greatest men, the greatest, eve=
r to grace this planet, has
always maintained be god's dog. A dog will brea=
k his tail off by wagging
when he sees his master, that is devotion and lov=
e. He doesn't ask the
master , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. Hi=
s master brings,
doggy is happy, his master doesn't bring, still the tail i=
s wagging,
doggy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthou=
ght.

Equate doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????
We=
 are never happy with what the master brings, because we were
expecting but=
ter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.

(Haanji madame waale hero, phir c=
hant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar
lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)

We a=
ctually don't want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and
then w=
e claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I only want him,
yeah rig=
ht!!
If you only want him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????=

We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so
th=
at masterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that
blanket, =
that milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn't
wag at his th=
ought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read
about the great d=
ogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but
nope. That is mental =
masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.

Sir, if you become dog's dog=
, and then you walk on the left handed path,
oye hoye sir, the ethereal wor=
ld will salute you. They do to Mr Rao's
mentor.

Maalik, main shehennshaye =
- e - befkuf aap jaise sant mahagyaani logon
ke kya jawaab doonga, mujhe ku=
ch nahin aata, main gadha hoon aur sada
rahoonga. It all my teacher aka my =
baapji aka my god aka my mother aka
my father aka my universe, who is respo=
nsible for all that you perceive
about me. i am useless, its all my mother.=


If anyone has any questions, ask god. Ask sincerely answers will be
provi=
ded. Ask god when you invite him/her.it in the fire, baaten karo
unse, woh =
bare kamaal ki cheez hain, bahut hi mast, unke peeche par
jaao, pagal kutte=
 ki tarah jo ki pyjama phaar ke hi dum leta hain, aur
phir dekho ki kya hot=
a hai.


Ask Mr Rao, ask Rajarshi, ask guys who are actually doing worship,=
 me
toh is busy gawking at beautiful girls.

Yaar type karke, aur baith bai=
th ke, dard ho gaya hain pichware mein,
aur main yeh soch raha hoon ki agar=
 itna effort bhagwaan ke baare mein
sochne mein lagayaa hota, toh behtar ho=
ta. Khair koi nahin ab aap(jo bhi
par raha hain), jitni der ho sake, bhagwa=
an ke saath bitao, bahut par
liya.


Jai Shree Shenshah - e - Shamshaan!!!

Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo


P.S. Just as I was posting this , ms jha has g=
iven me a nice kick in the
face. Yay!! Feels nice Ms Jha, no actually there=

long lecture, Jo aap samajh gayin hain us lecutre se,=
