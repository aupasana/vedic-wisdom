Dear LN ji,
=A0
actually one person =
did reply to this post.
but only one.
=A0
i guess the rest must have got so=
me or the other=A0indications
like you did ;)
=A0
or some people must have =
just ignored it, after all
it doesnt teach u anything nor prods you into
fi=
nding God with more chants and other things.
=A0
some people must be just t=
oo busy with their jobs,
homes and other challenges of life to stop by and
=
answer someone else's query.
=A0
so, everyone must be tied with their own r=
easons
and so my post attracted no replies.
=A0
however,=A0we should jus st=
op by for a moment and give one thought
to the fact that just by sharing a =
few experiences 
of our lives we can make life easy for so many
other peopl=
e.
=A0
rendering service to others and being charitable
with all that you c=
an is also=A0a way of finding God.
=A0
however, cant force ppl to reply to =
posts.
=A0
to each his own!
=A0
i dont no what you saw in that prog that st=
ops you from
sharing with me ur bit but if you dont want to, its ok.
=A0
an=
d yes that coconut milk and 
coconut water thing is a fact. i have seen tha=
t with
my sister. her husband and she are both dusky
and she has a son whom=
 nobody believes is
someone from Bihar. people mistake him to be=A0a Kashmi=
ri :)
so that indeed is the mahima of coconut water.
=A0
people please come=
 ahead and share with me ur bit.
your knowledge could mean a world of joy t=
o others.
=A0
(NB: sorry for replying like this. there seems to be some pro=
blem
with my system)
=A0
thanks n regards,
dolly.
