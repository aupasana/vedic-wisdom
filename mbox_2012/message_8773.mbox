Namaste Ashotosh ji,

To be clear, I have a strong feeling that most of us =
in this list are doing Havan for Spiritual progress and probaly many do not=
 fear of ignoring some rules (like Japa Mantra to Ahuti Mantra ratio etc...=
).

I myself never worried for all these years,about ignoring any such rule=
s as the desire is for the spiritual progress.

However now there is a sinc=
ere desire to have a opinion of any person who has some level of *realisati=
on* to give opinion out of real experience for these Japa-Havan ratio if at=
 all that is valuable.

wish to sincerely know that if one's only desire (i=
n conscious mind) for havan is for spiritual progress (which is by far the =
most desirable desire than any other desire), then whtether or not, observi=
ng the rule of Japa-Ahuti becomes critical even then.

Let us wait! if Moth=
er Jagadamba deems it right to provide answer out of realisation and not bo=
okish knowledge.

Best Regards,

Utpal

wish to understand about "Chandi Path verses" which are recited while offer=
