Namaste Vasavi ji,

When u took every care in placing order and still it happened, then it
gives u further reasons to not have any Guilt trap. Lets look at few
probable scenarios:

 1. *Scenario 1*: U helped cow to pay back its Rna. Possible that only way
for cow to get rid of it's past births Rna was to be eaten by you, someone
who revered it. Maybe, you helped it tremendously.

2. *Scenario 2*: In some medical conditions, Ayurveda recommends meat
eating (Red meat). Perhaps, Nature/God/Deity wanted to help your body and
created this situation as voluntarily you would never had eaten it. Then
instead of guilty, you should be thankful to it.

The hypothetical scenarios above show that happening is a happening and we
should neither have a guilt or should Gloat over it. Now, I will describe a
real scenario.

I had a discussion with a *Guru* about food and if Saatvik food is best.
His viewpoint was that excess of Satva is not right. According to him, It
should be a balance between all three Gunas. Specifically about me, he
mentioned a lack of Rajas. He infact suggested me to start eating Non-veg
(Fish and Egg white). I could not implement his suggestion as I simply
can't. But, I wanted to share it to make a point that spirituality linked
to Vegetarianism is a Limited way of thinking.

Regards
Puneet
