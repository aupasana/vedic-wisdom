Hilarious story Utpal ji - love it. Wish getting Darshan was so easy!

No =
no I don't hate Durga. She and Hari are my two favourite forms of the Divin=
e. I'm even named after her, how can I hate her! But I wish I could live up=
 to my name- Parvati as Aparna did a great tapas- but my tapas is not quite=
 up to the mark. That's why I'm pissed off with her.

There is a generation=
al gap or some gap that has caused this misunderstanding- I'm 29 and belong=
 to this shocking generation of children who are not as polite to their par=
ents and elders as they should be. This lack of politeness (sometimes) exte=
nds to the divine parents also. 

Thanks for the kind words Utpal ji, it's =
much appreciated. I wish you speedy attainment of your Ishta. And you too P=
riya ji and others. :)

Regards,

Aparna

Hilarious story Utpal ji - love it. Wish getting Darshan=
 was so easy!<br>
<br>
No no I don't hate Durga. She and Hari are my two fa=
vourite forms of the Divine. I'm even named after her, how can I hate her! =
But I wish I could live up to my name- Parvati as Aparna did a great tapas-=
 but my tapas is not quite up to the mark. That's why I'm pissed off with h=
er.<br>
<br>
There is a generational gap or some gap that has caused this m=
isunderstanding- I'm 29 and belong to this shocking generation of children =
who are not as polite to their parents and elders as they should be. This l=
ack of politeness (sometimes) extends to the divine parents also. <br>
<br>=

Thanks for the kind words Utpal ji, it's much appreciated. I wish you spee=
dy attainment of your Ishta. And you too Priya ji and others. :)<br>
