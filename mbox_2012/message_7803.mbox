Namaste Narasimha - I wanted to know if you or Manishji would be fine for a=
nyone reading books that they do not agree with ! For ex: I was looking at =
the new Amazon marketplace in India (www.junglee.com) and found one of thes=
e books and when I try to look at the author and other details, got this; h=
ttp://shivatrilogy.com/the-secret-of-the-nagas/shiva.html

>From what I lear=
nt, God has not become God; He/She is eternally God. 

Q: Do reading books,=
 out of curiosity, like these that equate God to a great warrior or super h=
uman, destroy the consciousness in understanding the Lord as he is.
