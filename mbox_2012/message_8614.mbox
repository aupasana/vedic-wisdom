Abou Ben Adhem 

-by James Leigh Hunt

Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increa=
se!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,

And saw, within the moonl=
ight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,

An angel writi=
ng in a book of gold:=97
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,

And to t=
he Presence in the room he said
"What writest thou?"=97The vision raised it=
s head,

And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered "The names of t=
hose who love the Lord."

"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"
Repl=
ied the angel. Abou spoke more low,

But cheerly still, and said "I pray th=
ee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow men."

The angel wrote, and=
 vanished. The next night
It came again with a great wakening light,

And s=
howed the names whom love of God had blessed,
And lo! Ben Adhem's name led =
all the rest.
