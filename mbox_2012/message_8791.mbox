Ram Ram Bachha Singh Ji,

Bhai jaan, I understand all the points you mentio=
ned intellectually as well as emotionally. applying rationale, logic, commo=
nsense and emotions guide one to the same conclusions.

However, My whole p=
oint is to hear from a person who has spoken to The Pavaka. Undisputed real=
isation, Commands from ones own Kundalini.

Remember, Vivekananda asking ev=
ery other spiritual people if they have seen God and when he asked Thakur t=
he same question during their earliest meetings, thakur replied with a soli=
d faith that YES I have seen god, I have talked to HIM. more intimately the=
n anybody else.

You get my point. I now need answers from realisation and =
not intellectual as well as basic emotional level.

Not at all to desrespec=
t anybody. No no. just not. you know how mcuh i like your messages as well =
as from others.

Happy Vijaya Dashami to all!

Best regards,

Utpal
