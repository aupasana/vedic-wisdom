Hi Dolly,

Here is a link on Gayatri purascharana by Swami Sivananda..=
..hope you find it useful.

http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=
=3Ddisplaysection&section_id=3D1087

24 lakh japa is a lot to do in 9 days.=
..but kudos for thinking of it! You need to work out how many repetitions y=
ou can do in one hour, and how many hours japa you can do. I would keep a d=
iary and a careful record of how many malas you do every day.

You can gaug=
e your capacity now before Navaratri....work out the maximum number of mala=
s you can do in one day....and then see if the purascharana is possible.

S=
ome people do a shorter anusthana in 9 days, which is supposed to be a mini=
mum of one lakh. This is also tremendously effective. 

Perhaps you could d=
o one lakh japa of Gayatri in 9 days. And then, if interested, continue the=
 japa (at a reduced or same number of malas per day) for a longer period wi=
th the aim of doing a full purascharana. 

My purascharana of the Om Namo N=
arayanaya mantra is going to take me nearly two years because of my work co=
mmitments. A purascharana is ideally to be done while following certain rul=
es to maximise benefit (eg solitude, strict sattvic diet etc). It is not pr=
actical for me to follow these rules all the time due to work and home cond=
itions, though I do my best. Despite this I am doing it anyway.... I was en=
couraged to do so by a disciple of Swami Sivananda at the Rishikesh Ashram,=
 who basically said "do what you can" and "something is better than nothing=
". 

As Sivananda says, an ounce of practice is worth tons of theory. 

Thi=
s is a very helpful article by Swami Chidananda (disciple of Sivananda). At=
 the bottom of the page you will find an excellent timetable showing precis=
ely how many days it can take to do purascharana of different mantras. 

ht=
tp://www.dlshq.org/download/initiates.htm

All the very best. 

Aparna
