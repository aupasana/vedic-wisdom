Respected NARASIMHA ji and other learned scholar,

 to what I am going through.

I am a very strong beloved of god and a very =
strong devotee. I love to worship him as much as I can.however, all my pass=
ion, interest seems to get drained and discouraged due to my mindset and th=
e hell I go through because of it. I always , always get negative & abusive=
 thoughts and tie those to the god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see =
a negative thing, bad or foul my mind relates or ties it to god. My mind st=
art abusing god with the same foul language.
When I do Japam, =A0my mind wo=
uld not get concentration, but goes into this evil mode with racing thought=
s.
I can't see directly into the eyes of god with the fear of my mind abusi=
ng him I can't focus my drishti on god statues. My thoughts are extremely f=
oul...most specially foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my w=
orship, which means I don't give up praying him. I requested him several ti=
mes to relive me from such pain so that I can increase my devotion and pray=
ers. I love him. I want to pray him.=A0
Currently, my mind and it's racing =
evil & foul thoughts have become a road block in my devotion and trying to =
keep me away from him as much as possible. At one point of time, they domin=
ated me and I had to stay away from praying him for a while.

Now my questi=
ons are
Am I a Maha papi or ghora papi that this is happening to me?
Why do=
es it happen to me?
Is it some kind of disorder
Am in incurring wrath of go=
d=A0
I am scared to death that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough fo=
r some 100 births
What can I do to get out of this perversion and be able t=
o concentrate on him
I want to worship god like every one does
I am highly =
stressed because of this constant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always=
 in pain because of this stress.

Please help me , but do no hate me. Pleas=
e do not disregard or discard my email. This is a situation I can't disclos=
e to anyone in person with the fear of hatred and resentment. I am hoping t=
o get some relief from learned scholars like yourself.
