Hi,
=A0=A0=A0 I assume you are staying at the ashram.There is a=A0bridge ne=
xt to it. If you go for a walk to other side you might see a Temple of Gang=
aji at the banks very near there. When I was there, one day few people came=
 there as they were getting ready to make a temple. I asked them what they =
are doing and the man said I should take part in the Bhoomipujan. I could n=
ot believe it. 
I was total stranger to them and there are so many holy man=
 and sadhu live there. I think the other person was manager of that trust t=
hat owns that land who took part.Next day I saw they were putting gold and =
silver coins in the hole for the start of Temple.
=A0

Hi LaxmiNarayanji,

I agree everything is =
due to Divine Grace. 

To answer your questions, I do pranayama/asanas erra=
tically....keep meaning to do these more, but feel too tired/lazy after wor=
k. I know these are excellent for health, and will try and do more. Thanks =
for reminding me.

The only 'meditation' I currently do is japa. I focus on=
 the sound, but yes, b I do have a picture of Vishnu (as Guruvayoorappan of=
 the famous Kerala temple) to meditate on. 

I am travelling to Delhi tomor=
row, and then onwards to Rishikesh next week. Will definitely stand in wate=
r and do a little japa (hope I can stand the freezing water of Mother Ganga=
, which is incredibly cold even in peak summer). Thank you for this nice su=
ggestion.

I agree brahmacharya is not easy, although essential in spiritua=
l life. I feel the only way to get established in this is to offer any lowe=
r thoughts such as lust, anger, greed, hatred, envy and pride to the Divine=
. It's one hell of a battle though...

Btw I recently started reading the "=
Imitation of Christ" by Thomas Kempis, a famous Catholic monk and saint fro=
m 500 years ago. What an inspiring book....his words are so similar to the =
instructions given by our Indian sages. Very interesting and practical inst=
ructions for progress on the spiritual path. Just wanted to reccommend it t=
o anyone who is interested.

ks/new2/ImitationOfChrist-mcrst.pdf


Warm regards,

Aparna

Some years ago there was a Hindi author who was well off and had a Temple i=

I recently started reading the "Imitation of Christ" by Thomas Kempis, a fa=

his words are so similar to the instructions given by our Indian sages. Ver=

myself. May be it will help you.<BR>> <BR>> 1--- Everything works bec=
ause of Divine Grace. It is not our <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-29 class=3Dmark>jap=
a</SPAN>, <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-30 class=3Dmark>tapa</SPAN>, haven or other s=
piritual work which is cause of <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-31 class=3Dmark>Darshan=
</SPAN>. No, it is Divine Grace which shows us the path. Everything comes u=
nder it.<BR>> 2-- Are you doing any <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-32 class=3Dmark>=
pranayam</SPAN> or breathing exercises on a regular basis. <SPAN id=3Dmissp=
ell-33 class=3Dmark>Rebirthing</SPAN> exercise is lot
 like <SPAN id=3Dmiss=
pell-34 class=3Dmark>sudershankriya</SPAN> but much softer. Doing this or o=
thers will clear the <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-35 class=3Dmark>nadis</SPAN> in th=
e body and will bring new light even once a week.<BR>> <BR>> 3--- Are=
 you doing any meditations in your very busy and responsible life.  Yo=
ga <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-36 class=3Dmark>nidra</SPAN> is a very good meditati=
on and many times combining breathing exercises and meditations even in 10/=
15 days works wonder.<BR>> <BR>> 4--- I hope very much that you have =
a focus of your <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-37 class=3Dmark>japa</SPAN> like a Beau=
tiful Picture of Divine Lord.<BR>> <BR>> 5--- Next time you go to <SP=
AN id=3Dmisspell-38 class=3Dmark>Rishikesh</SPAN>, try to do some <SPAN id=
=3Dmisspell-39 class=3Dmark>japa</SPAN> standing in <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-40 =
class=3Dmark>SriGangaji</SPAN> after doing prayers to Her. But please do no=
t take any risks. When I did it on opposite bank, in month of December
 peo=
ple kept a eye on me. Being a woman brings it own problem if there is no ma=
n there to support. But you do not have to do it if you do not want it.<BR>=
> <BR>> 6---You might notice feeling of sex increases as the <SPAN id=
=3Dmisspell-41 class=3Dmark>japa</SPAN> increases. It is a very difficult p=
roblem. You are a lucky person because you have women teachers in your ashr=
am with whom you could talk. It is not that you need any advise because peo=
ple come to you for that. But it is a very difficult problem to deal with i=
n spiritual life<BR>> <BR>> 7---Please do not put blockage by saying =
that you want <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-42 class=3Dmark>Darshan</SPAN> even with =
inner eye. Let Them decide. After all you want to see Them and They want to=
 see you. <BR>> <BR>> 8--- Relax. I hope you are not in any phys=

 the <SPAN id=3Dmisspell-47 class=3Dmark>Sivananda</SPAN> Ashram in <SPAN i=

 class=3Dmark>Narayana</SPAN> i.e. see Him in the form described =
in all our scriptures with 4 arms, holding the conch, discus, mace and lotu=
