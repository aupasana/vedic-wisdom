Hi,
Thanks for writing. It was the reason why some people in my childhood n=
ever ate sugar in India.But they never told us=C2=A0why.
Your start of Ekad=
asi vrat is a very good thing. I hope Divine Grace will come to you in leap=
s and bounds, although it is already here, I guess.
If I am correct you wro=
te in another post that you=C2=A0always cook your food and do not even eat =
at anybody's place. This is a strong thing. Do the otherpeople like relatio=
ns or friends not mind? 
I am also very careful when I buy foodstuff and re=
ad the label for ingrediants=C2=A0several times to make sure I am buying th=
e right thing.Several years ago I was living in Brijbhomi and doing spiritu=
al sadhana. I was careful not to eat when somebody would give sweets saying=
 it is prasad. I was also very alert that I should not hurt their feelings.=
=C2=A0I was living among them and=C2=A0it is normal thing that people share=
 their offerings in a temple=C2=A0with others standing nearby.
One day when=
 I went to a Temple very first time Pujari gave me sugar candy and other th=
ing from the plate he was giving to others. I took it and kept it in my han=
d and and when I came out carfully sliped it in to my pocket thinking that =
when I would reach my ashram I will feed it to a cow. Afterall it was templ=
e prasad and I was not going to throw it away.
But it disappeared from my t=
rouser pocket. There was no hole in it and I had put it there and I kept lo=
oking and looking. I suddenly realized I had to take=C2=A0prasad from that =
temple. So when ever I went there I ate the prasad without hesitation.
Seve=
ral months later I had Darshan of Divine Lord there.
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Hello,
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0 I am sure=C2=A0there are several views=C2=A0on Jeevanmukti and it=
s effect and other things but my take is that
if we do not experience certa=
in extraordinary and magical things ourselves all these remain only paper t=
heory.
Those saints who are born to lift human beings have a=C2=A0different=
 inner structure=C2=A0and=C2=A0they carry out their work through Divine Wil=
l but we cannot always understand their inner feelings.
=C2=A0
Some years b=
ack Due to Divine Mother's Grace a Light came and surrounded me one morning=
. I did not know
it has happened but my whole day was filled with deep blis=
s. I have lot of very difficult pain in my body yet I did 
not feel it on t=
hat day.Yet the pain was there, it did not go away or diminsh but I did not=
 feel it. There were other 
several problems yet I could not feel any tensi=
on or stress. I spent my day in a normal way yet all the time I was in a bl=
iss. Funny enough I kept thinking that it is a normal everyday thing.
=C2=
=A0
The Light left me next morning.
=C2=A0
As it left only then I realised =
that I was surrounded by it=C2=A0and yesterday's bliss was=C2=A0directly du=
e to it. I was back to my normal self pain and and stress and all that. If =
anybody has ever been in a large airconditioned building for several hours =
and then come out on street with heat and dust, the immediate impact on bod=
y and mind might 
convay those feelings. If that Light had remain permanant=
ly I am sure I would be a Jeevanmukt by now.
=C2=A0
Several year before it,=
 I did prayers to Sri Ganeshji. Every wednesday I would=C2=A0cook myself=C2=
=A0besan moduk and then offer 
them to SriSri Ganeshji hoping He would cure=
 me of my physical pain
.I did it nearly a year, then somehow stopped it as=
 I thought nothing was happening but kept doing Prayers
Several days later =
after I had my early morning prayers a similar sort energy came=C2=A0 and s=
urrounded me. It was more intense but lasted a very short period . I knew i=
t was SriSri Ganeshji kripa.
=C2=A0
The thing about white sugar is that whe=
n I made those besan Ladoo I used white sugar.=C2=A0 I use white sugar all =
the time and make sweet dishes and then offer them to Divine Beings.. Only =
recently I heard people saying that it has bone ash in it. Is it really tru=
e?? I mean is it really true? How much it would be in a one kilo bag of can=
e or beetroot sugar. Is it true only for western countries or India as well=
. In India in all the Temples sweet dishes are made and offered to Deities.=
 Does it mean there is bone ash in it if white sugar is used? Is there any =
way of removing it ?
Thanks

Namaste - Well, I still don't get it. So Jeevanmukta =

The cases / scenarios you mention so=

<DIV style=3D"RIGHT: auto">Thanks for writin=

<DI=
