hi=C2=A0

kishore,

i am saying that Astrology doesn't work, Astrology is g=
ood, some half boiled Astrologers are Fools and=C2=A0their=C2=A0predictions=
 are foolish.=C2=A0

As Mr. Narasimhan rightly said, oxygen is good at a ce=
rtain place. i agree to this comment.=C2=A0

where as these days if you see=
 Many temples around Kumbakonam, the priest are Greedy,=C2=A0=C2=A0they do =
not perform the rituals, pranayama, sadana etc, which is rightly needed for=
 the profession, when these priest when they perform anything to God, it is=
 aswell the pooja doing by a non-professional, so nowadays there is no not =
much power in these temples,=C2=A0

i believe in sarvaantheryami, God is pr=
esent everywhere, you can pray to him anywhere sitting,=C2=A0

even if you =
are in America, India, Europe, anywhere you call him "avahayami" he is pres=
ent you can offer prayers, homam, gifts, food etc., even you can do parihar=
ams also. God will be pleased,=C2=A0

if you think if i go there and do par=
iharam then only God will=C2=A0accept there, here he will not accept and af=
ter accepting you should straight go home. if you go else where what ever y=
ou have done pariharam will return back to God.=C2=A0

what an idea!

pls t=
hink those days are gone. Americans do not believe in any pariharams, thyey=
 just pray and do the things rightly, till today they are the richest in th=
e world, they have the best Cars, Best houses, Tall building see their dres=
s code, body style, most of them are healthy. Most of the Priest here aroun=
d Kumbakonam have a big belly stomach, like they are pregnant, Most 90% of =
the priest don't have a healthy body, they don't do any pranayama, exercise=
 etc., . many=C2=A0Priest are unfit in Health. learn little are the western=
s also =C2=A0which is good, don't go by the old beliefs, =C2=A0Belief shoul=
d be there, there should be some logic behind rational thinking.

rest it i=
s left to individual thinking, since this matter is not serious, it is just=
 oral thinking, it is just a belief and age old tradition which we are foll=
owing from many years, atleast now we have to think globally, during those =
days our elders had no media to see and analyse, whatever resources they ha=
d and in that little knowledge they have done this, now it is the time to w=
ake up, see the world and to take a decision globally.

Rest the things is =
left to God.

Namaste Sathya,


> God is every where, he is=
 antheryami, he is everywhere,=C2=A0

If God is everywhere, why should one =
seek an astrologer's help and go to temples.=C2=A0One's Antheryami lens vie=
w says all places, life events and actions are Antheryami and leave results=
 to Antheryami. Game over.=C2=A0


Before calling astrologer foolish and gr=
eedy, could it be possible that Antheryami in astrologer or those old peopl=
e, knowingly or unknowingly, suggested Ganesh to go to one temple in the ho=
pe that he will put complete faith in Antheryami at Navagraha temple.

If G=
anesh insisted on visiting multiple temples, they might have hoped his memo=
ry holds the last place best and hence suggested to visit navagraha temple =
at the end of trip.=C2=A0

I don't know much about these temple around Kumb=
akonam. It seems like there is some value in spending few minutes listening=
 to those aged people in Coimbatore and understand their beliefs before dis=
pelling them with broad theories. What do you think?

Regards,
-Kishore
