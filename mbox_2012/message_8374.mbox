Namaste Rajarshi ji,

Thank you for the very interesting information abou=
t tantra, a subject I know very little about. 

It sounds fascinating. Maki=
ng an idol of Durga from the mud collected from the house of a widow and a =
prostitute! I interpret that ritual to demonstrate that Durga abides in the=
 heart of a prostitute as much as she does in the heart of a saint, and so =
the soil from both their houses is equally sacred. 

I'm glad to hear you s=
ay that tantra has so many women of high spiritual calibre...that's very in=
spiring. What a pity we don't hear much about them.

I recently read a wond=
erful book about the women saints of India, called "Daughters of the Goddes=
s", written by an American devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen). She aske=
d the same question "Where are the women saints of India?". A Pandit ji rep=
lied, "just because they don't stand on public stages and give seminars, do=
esn't mean they don't exist!". Linda then went on a pilgrimage to India and=
 met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anandi Ma and other living realised saints in the=
 female form. I've met Amma, but would love to meet some of the yoginis and=
 Bhairavis you mention.

I'm curious about tantra and would like to learn m=
ore about it. I like Japa as my main spiritual practice,  but I'm open to l=
earning about other paths (tantra probably includes Japa for all I know). A=
nd learning more about Goddess worship would be great. I see Durga as my sp=
iritual guide, keeping me on the path, doing the Sadhana with me (because I=
'm too lazy to do it on my own), and Hari as the goal (actually they're the=
 same in my head and are both my goal as my divine parents). The cowherd gi=
rls of yore, clever girls, knew that the Goddess alone could give them Hari=
...as we all know, they famously worshipped Katyayani asking for Krishna, a=
nd She gave Him to them! 

Please could you reccommend some articles/books =
on tantra. I would love to have a read and educate myself on this, and may =
be even, add something to my practice. My only worhip of Durga currently (a=
side from abusing and praising her alternately) is repeating her mantra Om =
Dum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) randomly. (My main mantra =
that I got intiated into from a Swami of the Sivananda tradition is Om Namo=
 Narayanaya.) And I have recently added homams to my practice, albeit only =
once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Hari with it (it's not a perfec=
t homam technique wise, but I try and put a bit of heart in it. And if I ca=
n't find any heart, I blame Durga for not giving me any! She gets a lot of =
abuse from me I'm afraid, but as she made me, it's her own fault). 

Thanks=
 again for the message, and here's to tantra, the path that treats women as=
 equals! 

Aparna

Infact, they had more women in their folds who were accorded the highest sp=
iritual status than in mainstream Hinduism. But since Tantra itself was nev=
er popular, neither were these saints popular. And things like female foeti=
cide were unheard of in places where the worship of the Goddess was popular=
. Even the misguided thugees - infamous worshipers of Ma Kali - who were gu=
ilty of rampant human-sacrifices, would never dare to offer a woman as a sa=
crifice to Ma Kali, for they feared of Her wrath since Tantras strictly for=
bid harming the female of any specifies for a worshiper of the Goddess. So =
if blame has to be laid for mistreatment of women, objectively it would not=
 fall on those whose chief worship was of Durga or Kali or one of Her forms=

a bit about the general injustice of our esteemed Durga. The Atman is sexle=
ss, but the Atman in female form has been treated worse than the Atman in m=
ale form over the centuries...even today it is being murdered in the womb (=
female foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it is deathless et=
c, but while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in the form of women.=
 I hasten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I'm furious with Durg=
a. How outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women were not allowe=
d to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess). Why aren't th=
ere more women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is probably 1:10.=
 It's bloody disheartening. And what is the point of covering us with ignor=
