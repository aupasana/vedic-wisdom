Namaste,

Very authentic questions! Allow me to add some perspective to it,=
 which may or may-not be helpful.

<<How outrageous that for centuries, and=
 even today, women were not 
allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (whic=
h is to the Goddess). Why 
aren't there more women saints? The ratio of fem=
ale to male saints is 
probably 1:10. It's bloody disheartening. And what i=
s the point of 
covering us with ignorance (it's her fault, she is the Avid=
ya Maya), and then yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the=
 
scriptures).>>

I assume from your words that you have been exposed to so=
me standard view-points about Durga, (Avidya/Maya and all that stuff). In s=
ome branches of the Adwaitha philosophy it is said that Shakti (Durga) is M=
aya and Avidya. Irony being that, adherents of these branches were hardly t=
he folks, historically speaking, who chief deity was Ma Durga.

The path th=
at *actually* worshiped Her, was/is Tantra, which believes, there is no "Av=
idya" at all. Brahman/the-state-called-Atman is true, and so is the world o=
f duality which is but a manifestation/projection of that core. In the path=
 of Tantra, which was neither mainstream nor geographically widespread, the=
re was never any restriction to females with respect to sadhana. Not only w=
ere women initiated, but there were fantastic women of exceptional spiritua=
l caliber, and they used to be classified based on the levels they had achi=
eved as "uttara-sadhikas", "bhairavis" and "yoginis". While mainstream Hind=
uism was busy burning widows alive in the name of some dubious rules, Tantr=
as boldly declared Sati-daha as an abomination, rejected the caste-system t=
otally, and allowed women the status of spiritual preceptors when they coul=
d attain certain states. One of the Gurus of Sri Ramakrishna was a Bhairavi=
 who taught him Tantra. The first person to worship
 UgraTara south of the =
Vindya Hills was the wife of a disciple of Sri Ramana Maharishi, who was in=
itiated into this worship by a Bhairavi in Mithila. If a Bhairavi has the c=
aliber to teach a Ramakrishna, would she not have the caliber to act as gur=
us for average folks? Sure. But then, history does not even record her real=
 name. Why? Because, the system of Tantra as well as those who followed the=
 path - both men and women - were firmly rejected by mainstream brahminical=
 Hinduism; thus they never gained any popularity, except for the wrong reas=
ons. 


Every worship of Durga that happens anywhere today is India is stil=
l a watered-down version from the Tantras. The concept of ChanDi Homa was f=
irst mentioned in the Damara and Katyayani Tantras. In Bengal every rule of=
 Durga Puja is from the various Tantric schools. [For example, when creatin=
g an idol of Durga, the mud has to be collected from 4/5 different places s=
uch as from home of a prostitute, a river-bed, a widow's house, etc etc.] 
=


So it is not that those who followed the path of Ma Durga never had women=
 saints. Infact, they had more women in their folds who were accorded the h=
ighest spiritual status than in mainstream Hinduism. But since Tantra itsel=
f was never popular, neither were these saints popular. And things like fem=
ale foeticide were unheard of in places where the worship of the Goddess wa=
s popular. Even the misguided thugees - infamous worshipers of Ma Kali - wh=
o were guilty of rampant human-sacrifices, would never dare to offer a woma=
n as a sacrifice to Ma Kali, for they feared of Her wrath since Tantras str=
ictly forbid harming the female of any specifies for a worshiper of the God=
dess. So if blame has to be laid for mistreatment of women, objectively it =
would not fall on those whose chief worship was of Durga or Kali or one of =
Her forms.

Thanks f=
or the advice to chant till the cremation ground. Sound advice no doubt.

U=
nfortunately Durga is partial to some of her children it seems, and not all=
 of us are blessed with the intense desire to chant as you seem to be. Stop=
 rubbing it in please. 

What is the use of asking us to chant more? Ask he=
r to give us this desire, as she seems to have done for you. 

Which brings=
 me to ranting a bit about the general injustice of our esteemed Durga. The=
 Atman is sexless, but the Atman in female form has been treated worse than=
 the Atman in male form over the centuries...even today it is being murdere=
d in the womb (female foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it =
is deathless etc, but while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in the=
 form of women. I hasten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I'm fu=
rious with Durga. How outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women =
were not allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess)=
. Why aren't there more women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is=
 probably 1:10. It's bloody disheartening. And what is the point of coverin=
g us with ignorance (it's her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yell=
ing at us for not being wise (as she does in all the scriptures). If she wa=
nts to save us, she will have to create in us the desire
 to do japa or wha=
tever. I wash my hands of the whole thing.

So don't tell us to chant, tell=
 her to tell us to chant. Like she told you to. It's not our fault.

Ok ran=
t over. I'm going to control my temper and do some Om Namo Narayanaya repet=
ition now. Who knows when it's time for the cremation ground? You did it fo=
r a select few, but not for the rest of us millions- Damn you Durga. 

Apar=
na
