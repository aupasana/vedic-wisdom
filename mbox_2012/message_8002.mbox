The Life of an American Acharya

"Sri Acharyaji represents the Sankalpa [th=
e will] of the Hindu people and the cause of Sanatana Dharma. I urge all Hi=
ndus everywhere to give him your full support, assistance, and encouragemen=
t in his crucial work. He needs and deserves our help." - Vedacharya Sri Va=
madeva Shastri (Oct. 14, 2007)


>From the Skyscrapers of New York to the Fe=
et of God

Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya is a spiritual master in the ancie=
nt tradition of Sanatana Dharma, a Vedic philosopher, and a Hindu religious=
 leader.  He is widely renowned for his unapologetically authentic, traditi=
onal and fearless approach to teaching the spiritual truths of the Vedic tr=
adition. Whether speaking to an audience of thousands, or having a heart-fe=
lt discussion with only one person, Sri Acharyaji vividly conveys a deeply =
moving sense of personal compassion, peace, humility, integrity and spiritu=
al insight that has endeared him to thousands of students and admirers thro=
ughout the world. He is the real thing:  An enlightened and exceedingly qua=
lified spiritual master. 

Sri Acharyaji was born in New York City. He is a=
 European-American of Italian and Spanish descent. Sri Acharyaji has been s=
tudying and practicing the ancient tradition of Sanatana Dharma and Yoga sp=
irituality intensely for over 38 years. He has been teaching the Vedic way =
of life to the world since 1988. 

The dedicated pursuit of self-realizatio=
n and for a direct experience of God began for him at a very early age. He =
chose to follow the path of Sanatana Dharma specifically when he first read=
 the Bhagavad Gita, the most important philosophical scripture of the Sanat=
ana Dharma tradition, at the tender age of ten. As a philosophically inquis=
itive and deeply contemplative child, Acharyaji then began collecting and s=
tudying a vast number of books relating to Dharma spirituality, Vedanta, Ve=
dic civilization, meditation and Yoga. He also proceeded to intensely pract=
ice various forms of Yoga, pranayama (breathing exercises), and meditation =
soon after this first encounter with the Bhagavad Gita.

At the young age o=
f 14, Sri Acharyaji formally visited a Hindu temple for the first time. Thi=
s was the famous Ganapati Temple in Flushing, Queens, the very first Hindu =
temple built in North America. So awed was he with the majestic beauty and =
spiritual power that he encountered in this historic temple that, on the sp=
ot, he surrendered his life at the feet of Sriman Narayana (God) and decide=
d to devote every fragment of his life to the path of Vedic spirituality. I=
t was at this time that he was first initiated into the Vedic mantra Aum Na=
mo Narayanaya. Soon after this transformative experience, Sri Acharyaji liv=
ed the life of a highly disciplined celibate Hindu monk for six years in se=
veral ashrams throughout New York, as well as in the Bay Area, London and I=
ndia. Sri Acharyaji was formally ordained in India as an orthodox Vedic bra=
hmana (a spiritual teacher and Vedic priest) in 1986 by his guru, the world=
 famous Vaishnava Acharya Bhakti Rakshaka Sridhara Swami. 

His full Sanskr=
it name is Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya. "Dharma-Pravartaka" means "He Who=
 Sets Dharma in Motion." He is known today to his many students and followe=
rs affectionately as Sri Acharyaji. 

Sri Acharyaji has been working tirele=
ssly to "set Dharma in motion" for all of his adult life. He began formally=
 teaching Sanatana Dharma, Yoga spirituality and meditation in Chicago in 1=
988, and presently teaches the most authentic and spiritually compelling fo=
rm of Sanatana Dharma and Classical Yoga spirituality available anywhere in=
 the world today.

Spiritual Realization Coupled with Academic Achievement
=

In addition to being an accomplished spiritual practitioner and a globally=
 recognized Hindu guru, Sri Acharyaji coupled his personal spiritual practi=
ce with a formal regimen of rigorous academic training. Sri Acharyaji earne=
d a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy and Theology, magna cum laude, fr=
om Loyola University Chicago in 1994. While there, he studied the theologic=
al, intellectual and philosophical foundations of Western civilization, as =
well as the Medieval Scholastic method of philosophical disputation, under =
the brilliant tutelage of Jesuit (an order of Catholic priests) professors.=
 While at Loyola, Sri Acharyaji was inducted into five national academic ho=
nor societies. In May of 1999, Sri Acharyaji earned a Master of Arts degree=
 in South Asian Languages and Literature. In December of 2002, Sri Acharyaj=
i earned a Ph.D., summa cum laude, in Languages and Cultures of Asia at the=
 University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a focus on Religious Studies and Phi=
losophy of Religion. His entire academic career from start to finish was fi=
nancially secured by a variety of academically awarded scholarships and fel=
lowships that recognized his academic genius. As a scholar, Sri Acharyaji s=
pecialized in Philosophy of Religion, Sanskrit, Vedic Studies, and South As=
ian Affairs. He served briefly as an Adjunct Professor with Antioch Univers=
ity. 

He has written for numerous academic journals, magazines and antholo=
gies, as well as presented talks at many formal academic conferences, inclu=
ding the American Academy of Religion (AAR). Sri Acharyaji has guest lectur=
ed at dozens of major universities, including such prestigious institutions=
 as Harvard, Columbia, Rutgers, Cornell, Northwestern, and the University o=
f Virginia. He has also served as a religions consultant for many Fortune 5=
00 corporations, including Ford Motor Company, Global Health Corporation an=
d Lucent Technology. In early 2002, just a few short months after the 911 t=
errorist attacks, for example, Sri Acharyaji was commissioned by Ford Motor=
 Company to address over 1000 of its employees as the representative of the=
 Hindu religion at a company organized interfaith conference. 

Explaining =
very early on at his first meeting with his doctoral adviser in 1995 that "=
I don't want to just study the history of religion=85My ultimate aim is to =
make religious history", Sri Acharyaji eventually left academia to devote h=
imself exclusively to spiritual teaching and to the preservation of the gre=
at tradition of Sanatana Dharma.

The Real Thing: An Authentic Guru

Sri Ac=
haryaji is currently recognized as one of the world's foremost scholars of =
the Vedic religion, the Yoga tradition, Dharma, and meditation, as well as =
being one of the precious few truly authentic and enlightened gurus (spirit=
ual teachers) fully capable of leading his sincere disciples to enlightenme=
nt. Sri Acharyaji is one of the very few non-Indian spiritual teachers on e=
arth today to be fully accepted by both the orthodox Indian Hindu community=
, in addition to the large community of Western spiritual seekers, as being=
 a fully authentic and recognized spiritual teacher (Acharya). He is the Pr=
esident and Acharya of the International Sanatana Dharma Society, a world-w=
ide movement dedicated to teaching Dharma spirituality. Sri Acharyaji's man=
y students and supporters come from both Indian and non-Indian communities =
and number in the multiple thousands. 

The form of Dharma spirituality tha=
t Sri Acharyaji both practices and teaches is the most ancient, traditional=
 and effective of all Dharma traditions. Sri Acharyaji's depth of knowledge=
 about the Yoga tradition, his authentic and personal approach to teaching =
others, and his own exalted level of personal achievement in meditation and=
 self-realization, have become legendary in the Yoga and Hindu communities =
throughout the world. Sri Acharyaji's teachings stress the achievement of s=
elf-realization (atma-jnana) and God-consciousness (brahma-vidya) through t=
he practice of devotional meditation (bhakti), Yoga, and directly experienc=
ing the presence of the Divine. Another overarching aspect of Sri Acharyaji=
's teachings focuses on the importance of spiritual love, meaningful compas=
sion, and service toward all living beings.

Sri Acharyaji teaches the anci=
ent philosophy of Sanatana Dharma in a way that is both understandable and =
inviting to the modern mind. Sri Acharyaji has delivered many hundreds of l=
ectures, satsangs, and seminars throughout North America, as well as writte=
n countless published articles, on many key aspects of Yoga philosophy and =
Dharma spirituality. In addition, he has been the keynote speaker at severa=
l very large national Hindu events, each with audiences in the multiple tho=
usands. In June, 2007, as one example, Sri Acharyaji was the keynote speake=
r at the largest single gathering of Hindus in American history. During the=
 "Swadhyay" event in Washington, D.C., Sri Acharyaji spoke to an estimated =
20,000 Hindus about the benefits of Dharma spirituality. 

Sri Acharyaji wa=
s formally appointed as the Resident Acharya (Spiritual Preceptor) of the H=
indu Temple of Nebraska (2007-2009), which represents the first time in Ame=
rican history that a Hindu temple had ever made such an esteemed appointmen=
t.

His Ph.D. dissertation, the 408 page The Vedic Way of Knowing God, was =
published in book form for the public November, 2010, with laudatory forewo=
rds by Professor Klaus Klostermaier and Dr. David Frawley. 

His thus far r=
eleased books include: 

The Vedic Way of Knowing God

Sanatana Dharma: The=
 Eternal Natural Way

The Shakti Principle: Encountering the Feminine Power=
 of God

The Art of Wisdom: Affirmations for Boundless Living

Radical Univ=
ersalism: Are All Religions the Same?

Living Dharma: The Teachings of Sri =
Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

Taking Refuge in Dharma: The Initiation Guideboo=
k

His most recent book is destined to be his most ground-breaking and revo=
lutionary work yet, the 410 page work "Sanatana Dharma: The Eternal Natural=
 Way", which was published in August, 2011. An all-in-one guide to the worl=
d of Yoga, Vedanta, meditation and Hinduism, this book is a celebration of =
the tradition of Sanatana Dharma. This magnum opus work is a comprehensive =
summary of this profound spiritual tradition. It is the first English langu=
age systematic theological compendium (summa theologica) and philosophical =
exposition of the entire world-view of Sanatana Dharma ever produced.

Sett=
ing Dharma in Motion

Sri Acharyaji is recognized by many contemporary Hind=
u leaders as being the most innovative, forward-thinking, dynamic and brill=
iant spiritual leader in the world Hindu community today, instigating many =
ground-breaking projects designed to preserve Vedic spirituality in its mos=
t pristine form, to strengthen and expand the world's understanding of the =
philosophy and culture of Sanatana Dharma, and to teach the life-enhancing =
yogic techniques of the Vedic tradition to all sincere spiritual seekers. 
=

Clarification of Terminology

Beginning in the late 1980s, for example, Sr=
i Acharyaji began a single-handed campaign to encourage the gradual abandon=
ing of such incorrect terms as "Hinduism", and "Hindu" and to encourage ins=
tead the more proper use of the respective terms "Sanatana Dharma" and" Dha=
rmi". As Sri Acharyaji explains the issue in his book "Sanatana Dharma: The=
 Eternal Natural Way"

"The word "Hinduism" is not found anywhere in either=
 Vedic or classical Sanskrit, nor in any of the recognized sacred scripture=
s (shastra) of this spiritual path.  Rather, the proper name of this spirit=
ual tradition, the name that is found throughout the scriptures of the trad=
ition, is Sanatana Dharma, or the Eternal Natural Way.  Additionally, follo=
wers of Sanatana Dharma are not properly referred to as "Hindus", but as "D=
harmis", or followers of Dharma."  (Pg. 16)

At the time that Sri Acharyaji=
 began this campaign, he was one of the very few Hindu leaders even using t=
he term "Sanatana Dharma"; almost every other leader of the tradition was s=
till unthinkingly using the incorrect term "Hinduism". Indeed, he was initi=
ally greeted with a degree of opposition and push-back from many less-knowl=
edgeable Hindu leaders when he first began this important campaign. The sit=
uation today, of course, has now dramatically changed. As of 2012, over two=
 decades after Sri Acharyaji began his concerted campaign as a lone voice i=
n the wilderness, multiple millions of followers of the Vedic way have now =
begun to use Sri Acharyaji's preferred terms "Sanatana Dharma" and "Dharmi"=
.  More, those very same Hindu leaders who at first challenged the wisdom o=
f re-adopting our religion's true name are now themselves using the correct=
 name with ever-increasing frequency, thus helping to make the term "Sanata=
na Dharma" a veritable household term. We have none other than Sri Dharma P=
ravartaka Acharya to thank for this gradual shift in terminology in the las=
t two decades, and for the reclaiming of our spiritual tradition's true and=
 beautiful name:  Sanatana Dharma. 

Reclaiming Dharma

While the term "Dha=
rma" has become an increasingly well-known word in the West in recent years=
, the actual philosophical concept of Dharma has remained little understood=
 among most spiritual circles.  Dharma, or Natural Law,  represents the dee=
pest metaphysical and philosophical essence of the Vedic world-view and way=
 of life. As Sri Acharyaji explains the concept of Dharma in his book "Sana=
tana Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way":

"The principle of Dharma is by far =
the most ancient, important, universal, and powerful concept in existence t=
oday.  Being at one time in history an ideology whose influence spanned muc=
h of the globe, Dharma represents the most ancient and prevalent philosophi=
cal concept in the entirety of religious history.  Dharma is a weltanschauu=
ng [world-view] like none other, because no other world-view has been as lo=
ng-lasting, universal in application, and culturally all-encompassing."  (P=
age 39)

Despite the clearly Vedic origins of Dharma, however, the daily us=
e of the term "Dharma" had severely declined in recent years among most fol=
lowers of Vedic spirituality and "Hinduism". Indeed, the term "Dharma" had =
eventually become so divorced from its Vedic origins that the term has now =
become more associated in the popular mind with the later, derivative relig=
ion of Buddhism than with the actual religion of its birth, which was Sanat=
ana Dharma.  All too many Westerners falsely associate Dharma as being excl=
usive to Buddhism, even though Buddhism itself acknowledges that it adopted=
 the concept of Dharma from the much earlier Vedic religion! Sri Acharyaji =
understood that, if the world was going to understand the profundity of the=
 ancient Vedic path, it needed to first understand the meaning of Dharma as=
 the foundational teaching of the Vedic path. The Vedic religion, he unders=
tood, needed to boldly reclaim the use of the term Dharma.  

Sri Acharyaji=
 embarked on the task of both reclaiming Dharma, and educating the world on=
 the deepest philosophical profundities of this fundamental Vedic concept. =
Sri Acharyaji's many writings include some of the most in-depth and intelle=
ctually rich explanations of the philosophical world-view of Dharma from th=
e original Vedic perspective available anywhere in any written language on =
earth today. In the last several decades, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya has=
 reestablished the clear understanding that Dharma is, first and foremost, =
a Vedic concept. Dharma represents the very essence of the Vedic path.  Mor=
e, Sri Acharyaji has insisted more than any other Vedic guru in the world t=
oday that Dharma is a spiritual path that is welcoming of any sincere pract=
itioner, regardless of their ethnicity, language, national origin, or the r=
eligion that they were born into. Dharma is not the possession of any one n=
ation.  It is God's gift to all sentient beings.  If we can understand the =
deepest meaning of Dharma, Sri Acharyaji assures us all, then we can perfec=
tly understand the totality of the Vedic world-view. 

Radical Universalism=


A similar campaign that was designed to re-instantiate authentic Sanatana=
 Dharma in the philosophical realm was dramatically initiated by Sri Achary=
aji in 2005. It was in that year that his now world famous "Radical Univers=
alism" thesis was first published for the world to see. Originally released=
 as a long 44 page philosophical essay, and now rendered in an expanded boo=
k form, Acharyaji's innovative "Radical Universalism: Does Hinduism Teach t=
hat all Religions are the Same" thesis went on to be read by over one-milli=
on Dharmis in its first year alone, and has now changed our understanding o=
f Sanatana Dharma forever. In this important work, Acharyaji explained in a=
n unassailable philosophical manner that Sanatana Dharma never taught the i=
llogical claim that all religions are the same, or that "all paths are one"=
, and that this false proposition is a thoroughly modern and Western notion=
 that was superimposed upon traditional Sanatana Dharma for the last two ce=
nturies. Commenting upon Sri Acharyaji's work, Dr. David Frawley has stated=
 the following:

"In his critique of radical universalism, Sri Acharyaji ha=
s boldly addressed this complex issue with depth, clarity, comprehensivenes=
s and sensitivity and, most importantly, with a profound rationality based =
upon the great principles of Vedanta. He shows how the Hindu tradition does=
 not teach such a blind equation of all religions, but instead emphasizes a=
n enlightened pluralism that not only allows for the existence of many path=
s but insists that only a path as sharp as the edge of a razor can take us =
to the highest goal.  There can be no compromise about truth if one wants t=
o realize the Divine Self within, which is the real aim of all religious an=
d spiritual striving. Sri Acharyaji restores this older and deeper approach=
 of the Hindu mind which combines tolerance with truthfulness, and insists =
upon a philosophical clarity to one's views, regardless of whether others m=
ight agree or not."

As was true with his campaign to revive the Vedic trad=
ition's original name of "Sanatana Dharma", at first there was a modicum of=
 resistance from less-knowledgeable quarters. Today, however, Sri Acharyaji=
's Radical Universalism thesis is accepted by the vast majority of authenti=
c and more knowledgeable Vedic and Hindu leaders as the philosophical norm =
in understanding the relationship of Sanatana Dharma in comparison to the o=
ther religions of our world. Sri Acharyaji's ground-breaking work on this i=
ssue has changed the world's understanding of the very nature of Sanatana D=
harma. We have Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya's tireless efforts to thank fo=
r this positive philosophical transformation. 

Bridging the Gap

Sri Achar=
yaji was the very first Sanatana Dharma guru and scholar to write and publi=
cally speak about the unfortunate divide that exists between the two separa=
te Vedic communities of A) Indian Hindus, and B) Western Yoga practitioners=
. Sadly, Indian Hindus and Western yogis rarely communicate with each other=
, have too often found it challenging to relate to one another, have vastly=
 different approaches to Vedic spirituality, and have remained two radicall=
y distinct communities. As he has describe this problem in his article "Bri=
dging the Gap: Uniting the Indian Hindu and 'Hidden Hindu' Communities", 

=
"The gap between the two communities of Indian Hindus and "Hidden Hindus" [=
Western Dharmis] in America and Europe needs to be bridged.  Together, as o=
ne, united Vedic community - Indians and Americans, Nepalis and British, Sr=
i Lankans and Australians - let us endeavor to exhibit in our own personal =
lives and actions the spiritual qualities that form the very essence of San=
atana Dharma, and to work tirelessly together to preserve our common spirit=
ual heritage for all future generations."

Sri Acharyaji has boldly proclai=
med, with an authoritative power that only someone of his spiritual caliber=
 can, that Sanatana Dharma is not Indian. It is not American. It is not the=
 possession of any nationality or region.  Rather, Sanatana Dharma is God's=
 gift to the entire world. "Bridging the Gap" between these two separate co=
mmunities, with the eventual creation of one, united and global community o=
f followers of the Sanatana Dharma tradition, has been one of Sri Acharyaji=
's most important projects in the last several decades. In his writings, ta=
lks and projects on this on-going issue, Sri Acharyaji has done more to bri=
ng the Indian Hindu and Western Yoga communities to a greater sense of unit=
y than any other guru in the world today.  

Women Awarded the Brahmana Thr=
ead

Brahmanas are individuals who have the qualities necessary to be Vedic=
 teachers, scholars, priests, philosophers, and guardians of Vedic culture.=
  To be a brahmana is one of the highest callings in human society. Despite=
 this, however, very few in the present-day Vedic community would dispute t=
he clear fact that the brahmana profession has severely degenerated over th=
e last several centuries to being now only a mere shadow of what it once wa=
s.  Over the last few decades, Sri Acharyaji has taken it upon himself to r=
eintroduce the very highest of brahminical standards to the Vedic world, as=
 well as to reassert the foundational understanding of what constitutes an =
authentic brahmana.  Reintroducing the orthodox teaching that a brahmana is=
 known exclusively by his or her individual qualities, and not by birth or =
"caste", Acharyaji has waged a fearless campaign against the anti-Vedic, mo=
dern social perversion known as the "caste" system.  Indeed, he has waged t=
his campaign against the unjust "caste" system often at very great personal=
 sacrifice to himself and his teaching mission. As Sri Acharyaji has explai=
ned, "Being a brahmana is not determined by one's birth, by one's parents, =
by one's name, or by one's so-called 'caste'.  Being a brahmana is a callin=
g that an individual person either has the inward ability to follow or not.=
"

In addition, with the historical degeneration of the original Vedic brah=
mana system, the awarding of brahmana threads to women was also eventually =
discarded many centuries ago.  Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya has now active=
ly revived the orthodox Vedic practice of the awarding of brahmana threads =
to qualified women.  Beginning in 2008, Sri Acharyaji yet again made histor=
y as the very first qualified Vedic Acharya in over 2000 years to award the=
 brahmana thread to Western women, having now invested several of his femal=
e disciples with brahmana threads in orthodox Vedic ceremonies.  As Acharya=
ji himself explains his bold actions: "I know that this historic precedent =
is only the beginning of the reclamation of an ancient and important Vedic =
tradition. My hope is that this represents only the first of many thousands=
 of women who I will see awarded the sacred thread in my lifetime."

In the=
se, and multiple other ways, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya has proven himse=
lf to be at the very cutting-edge of authentic Vedic revival. Sri Acharyaji=
's courageous life has been a living testament to what it truly means to "s=
et Dharma in motion".

la Patterson


"Once more I would like to commend Sri Dharma Pravartaka Ach=
arya for his clear exposition of current problems surrounding Sanatana Dhar=
ma and Hinduism. Even though one may not agree fully, the audacity of the
e=
xplanations and his ability to articulate profound truths in few
words with=
out mincing them makes him nowadays a prophet of the cause
of Hinduism.

Th=
at these thoughts come from a western Hindu, and specifically an
American o=
ne, is quite significant but not surprising. The defect
that Sri Acharyaji =
defines as Impossibility-Thinking is rooted in the
very fabric of Hindu soc=
iety in India, basically in the upper classes
and more significantly in man=
y of the influential circles of
professors of famous universities. As the s=
aying goes: "in the house
of the ironsmith=85wooden knife". A western Ameri=
can Hindu is above and
beyond the inhibitions of class and society in India=
, what
corroborates the often-repeated assertion that not only Sanatana
Dha=
rma is patrimony of the world, but that its role in it is far from
over, an=
d finally that America and American Hindus will play a
critical role in thi=
s revival." - Arvind Sharma

"I admire the work done by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acha=
rya himself. His selfless strive is towards presenting Hinduism in its true=
st form." - Dinesh Menon


"Acharyaji, Your teachings on Hinduism are incre=
dibly inspiring. Keep up your good work. The rest of us also need to keep o=
ur courage. With truth as the guiding light as well as love for and service=
 to others as our guiding principles we need to keep moving forward. The tr=
uths of the Vedas belong to everybody, our goal must be to shed true light =
on them and educate others. Satyam eva jayate na anritam satyena panthaa vi=
tato devayaanah (Mundak Upanishad 3:1:6). Truth always ultimately prevails,=
 not lies; truth is the path that devas, and generous and noble persons fol=
low and encourage others to follow. With warm regards." - Sudhir Anand
