Dear Ajit,

<<As Narasimha mentioned, moksha and bandha are irrevocably lin=
ked.>>

Yes, finally this makes a lot of logical sense to me today. For som=
e reasons I had to spend nearly the whole day studying parts of Mahabharata=
 and other literature on Krishna - not exactly from a devotional perspectiv=
e - but rather for an objective understand of the man that was Krishna. And=
 then I realized - actually it was like a epiphany, a sudden burst of clari=
ty in the mind - moksha is not about going to some other plane, or not taki=
ng rebirth (which too can happen), ETC. It is infact making our awareness f=
ree from the chains which bind it, namely the 8 snares, and thus distort it=
. Had moksha been something reserved for another world and another space an=
d time, then a being like Krishna would not have bothered to come down to e=
arth and do the things He did, in the manner He did. What a Hero! It=C2=A0 =
is through life itself that one must gain freedom, else the whole world and=
 everything in it is meaningless, and everybody should have then stopped do=
ing
 everything and waited for death to transport us to some other hoary re=
alm.

A happy=C2=A0 Janmasthami to whoever is reading this mail.


-Regards=

=C2=A0Rajarshi

Dear Rajarshi,

I had to re-read=
 this a few times, but I think I'm finally understanding what you are tryin=
g to convey. Thanks for explaining.=C2=A0

As Narasimha mentioned, moksha a=
nd bandha are irrevocably linked. The 'status' of the world is right in the=
 middle of the two. We are all looking at this from different points of vie=
w, based on our own conditioning.

I can't pull myself out of the dream ana=
logy. All of us dream. We are creators of the dream world, and it is our co=
nsciousness alone that forms the material for the dream world. Once created=
, a portion of ourselves gets projected into the dream world, and we become=
 subject to our own maya. We interact with so many other created beings, an=
d interact based on the rules of this dream world. Inside the dream world, =
for the duration of it's existence, everything appears true.=C2=A0

The wor=
ld that is created is based on the thoughts that went through our mind at t=
he moment we fell into deep sleep. At some point, once we have experienced =
enough, we naturally wake up. We spend some time in the "real world", and t=
hen the cycle repeats.

Our experiences inside our created dream world have=
 an impact on us when we wake up. From time to time, we remember our dreams=
 and reflect on them. The experiences certainly carry on into our waking st=
ate to some extent, and then back into the next dream experience.

By looki=
ng at every question from three points of time, we get three different answ=
ers.=C2=A0The dream world is real for it's duration, unreal between cycles =
and is conditionally real when looking across cycles. Freedom is interactin=
g with the world with no attachment from inside the world; realizing the ab=
solute unreality of the world from outside; and is both of these when looki=
ng across cycles.

>From all points of view, the thinning of the accumulated=
 conditioning (vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key.

sasneham,

>>An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to=C2=A0 stay there for s=
ome=C2=A0 years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying th=
e discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, come=
s over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopp=
ed and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man. The=
n he did a pranam to the man and said, "Maharaj, please tell us some words =
of God". The man became angry, and retorted back, "Why? Why waste time talk=
ing of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So pl=
ease continue with your lectures as you were doing before I came in". Every=
one became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, th=
e man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and=
 started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looke=
d at his followers and said, "He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in =
a
 while, but he has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking too mu=
ch=C2=A0 ganja". Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt a=
ttracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As=
 he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X=
 in clear English, "Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me." X wa=
s of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and mor=
e over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was d=
ressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). 
>>
>>
>>
>>The man conti=
nued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by p=
rofession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu since th=
en." X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang? M=
r Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is so=
urce of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not ord=
inary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all=C2=A0 the religio=
us troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little irritated, "Why do you hav=
e so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadh=
u for long, then how come you haven't met a single genuine sadhu yet, how i=
s it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there=
 is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, me=
rely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is no=
t accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "The root
 of all this probl=
em is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever=
. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend.=
 At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with =
super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create=
 this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire superna=
tural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded=C2=A0 by others a=
s a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the p=
roblem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then str=
essing that one has understood correctly." While talking, the sadhu stopped=
 at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off t=
he chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly re=
leasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, "You (meaning X) are a =
young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don't get
 confused by all these=
 show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a =
lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous y=
oung man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day havin=
g nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly =
realized what God really is and how to interact with this thing." As he spo=
ke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a=C2=A0 young girl =
came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said t=
o X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrin=
davan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesting if you j=
oin me.

>>After an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bore=
d and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits and sweets for the=
ir food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar's feet as he lay down=
 on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, =
he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the h=
ospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thoug=
ht crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 s=
tood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iye=
ngar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction t=
o the cot. He too turned round to see=C2=A0 what was going on. What he saw =
made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar th=
at was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his earl=
y twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glo=
w that lightened up
 the whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holdi=
ng lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a hum=
an being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even five minutes =
back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.

>>X did not know wha=
t was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stand up and =
come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto the cot =
and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When he woke u=
p, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with trees and shrubs =
all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him inside th=
e temple precincts.=C2=A0 There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an o=

 did not say a word, pointed out that meditating man to him and then took X=
 out of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. You shoul=
d meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an i=

 unconsciousness again.

Yes, finally this makes a lot of logical sense to me today. For some reason=

 t=

oksha been something reserved for another world and another space and time,=
 then a being like Krishna would not have bothered to come down to earth an=

      <div>Dear Rajarshi,</div><div><=
br></div><div>I had to re-read this a few times, but I think I'm finally un=
derstanding what you are trying to convey. Thanks for explaining. </di=
v><div><br></div><div>As Narasimha mentioned, moksha and bandha are irrevoc=
ably linked. The 'status' of the world is right in the middle of the two. W=
e are all looking at this from different points of view, based on our own c=
onditioning.</div>

<div><br></div><div>I can't pull myself out of the drea=
m analogy. All of us dream. We are creators of the dream world, and it is o=
ur consciousness alone that forms the material for the dream world. Once cr=
eated, a portion of ourselves gets projected into the dream world, and we b=
ecome subject to our own maya. We interact with so many other created being=
s, and interact based on the rules of this dream world. Inside the dream wo=
rld, for the duration of it's existence, everything appears true. </di=
v>

<div><br></div><div>The world that is created is based on the thoughts =
that went through our mind at the moment we fell into deep sleep. At some p=
oint, once we have experienced enough, we naturally wake up. We spend some =
time in the "real world", and then the cycle repeats.</div>

<div><br></div=
><div>Our experiences inside our created dream world have an impact on us w=
hen we wake up. From time to time, we remember our dreams and reflect on th=
em. The experiences certainly carry on into our waking state to some extent=
, and then back into the next dream experience.</div>

<div><br></div><div>=
By looking at every question from three points of time, we get three differ=
ent answers. The dream world is real for it's duration, unreal between=
 cycles and is conditionally real when looking across cycles. Freedom is in=
teracting with the world with no attachment from inside the world; realizin=
g the absolute unreality of the world from outside; and is both of these wh=
en looking across cycles.</div>

 the Universe, the purely transcendental non-changing, non-negotiable reali=

the objective
 reality all around is Shakti. Thus in short, using scriptura=

 Rama's city as Hanumana with his yogic prowess guarded 
the gates of the c=

dropped his ring throug=

d Hanumana to the subterranean realm where he 
found countless number of ex=

"Whenever a ring falls here, a Hanumana fol=

time for a Rama to leave his body. Such rings ha=

 in future. As long as

 To work on oneself, to make one ready to be able to unconditionally love e=
