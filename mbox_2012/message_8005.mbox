Namaste friends,

I recently finished a specific sadhana of a specific form of Divine 
Mother. This particular goddess, according to my guru, attracts others 
to a sadhaka and gives "control and mastery" over others.

I want to share what I realized towards the end of sadhana, because that 
realization MAY be helpful to some others.

*        *        *

DIFEERENT TRAJECTORIES

There are beings that can give specific limited things, but the ultimate 
goal of sadhana is liberation and sadhana of higher beings eventually 
transforms one and takes one closer to liberation. What these higher 
beings are supposed to give in tradition is a simplificaation or 
symbolism of something sublime that takes towards liberation, from 
*different angles*.

For example, ability to work very hard (with no expectations of anything 
selfish in return), fine judgment and discrimination (that increases 
detachment in one's actions), complete surrender to god (and 
whole-hearted acceptance of every life situation one finds oneself in), 
ability to focus mind (on a mantra or a deity and not let various 
thoughts distract it), are all useful to a sadhaka. If one develops one 
of these 4 basic qualities, other qualities will eventually develop. 
They all lead to the same thing - liberation - in the end, but the 
trajectory is different.

These four basic paths constitute what are known as karma yoga 
(communion through action), jnana yoga (communion through wisdom), 
bhakti yoga (communion through devotion) and raja yoga (communion 
through [self-]control). However, there are many sub-paths.

Basically, different higher beings can increase a different fine quality 
inside one, which is conducive to liberation. The trajectory is 
different with each deity.

*        *        *

TOO MUNDANE?

The higher being I worshipped is supposed to increase control and 
mastery over others. While I did the sadhana in the last few months, I 
wondered how *that* can lead to liberation. After all, control and 
mastery over others sounded too *mundane* to me to have anything to do 
with liberation. But a simple realization came towards the end of the 
sadhana.

*        *        *

CONTROL & FRICTION

Whether A is attracted to B or B is attracted to A, the bottomline is 
that objects A and B come together. The ability to attract others also 
means to come together with them.

One is unhappy with others and thinks of controlling them, when one's 
own agenda is mis-aligned with their agenda. The friction between the 
agendas is the basis for the entire dynamics of likes, dislikes, 
frustrations etc. Control of that friction comes when the agendas are 
nicely aligned!

Ability to control the agenda pursued by someone else has limited use, 
scope and lifetime. Such an ability can work only with a limited set of 
people or a limited amount of time. This is like pumping rainwater from 
the fields surrounding a hill to the top of the hill. It requires a lot 
of energy that is proportional to the area of the field and the amount 
of rainwater.

The best way to avoid the friction, with ALL beings of the cosmos, is to 
eliminate one's own agenda! This is like removing the hill from the 
middle of the field, in the above analogy.

If one has no agenda whatsoever, then there is no friction with anyone's 
agenda. There is no reason to like or dislike anyone or find fault with 
or admire anyone. One can just observe others. Because one has no 
agenda, one can identify with the agendas of others and relate to them 
completely. One can then put oneself completely in the shoes of others 
and feel their pleasures, pains etc.

When one has an agenda and another has another agenda, then there is 
friction and one feels a need to "control" and remove friction. But, 
when one has no agenda and another has an agenda, then there is no 
friction. One can then completely "understand" the perspective of the 
other (because there is no friction from one's own agenda stopping one 
from doing so!). What better mastery and control can one have on someone 
else than be able to understand that person completely?!

Though what I described above is the end, one path to that end is to 
identify one's own agenda/conditioning that is resulting in friction, 
whenever one is not happy with someone, and try to remove/suppress that 
conditioning. One can first try this with a few people (e.g. spouse).

*        *        *

LOVE & COMPASSION FOR ALL

Bottomline is this: Control and mastery over others does not mean making 
them think and behave in tune with the agenda of one's own limited 
conditioning. Instead, it means overcoming's one's own agendas and being 
able to put oneself in the shoes of anybody and understand and feel each 
of their feelings and emotions. It means unconditional love and 
compassion for all.

*        *        *

LOOKING DOWN ON OTHERS

When one is doing some sadhana, one of the stages one goes through may 
be to feel proud of one's sadhana, look at some others doing such a 
sadhana favorably or with admiration and look down on others who are not 
doing much sadhana (or doing a different sadhana!) and pursuing mundane 
things. This may be a natural tendency, but realize that this is a work 
of the limited personality or ego.

One has to overcome that tendency, for looking down on others will 
eventually block one.

*        *        *

LOVING THE DIVINE MOTHER

People talk of loving the Divine Mother. The personality of Divine 
Mother is beyond one's perception. How can one really love Her then?

One may do tremendous sadhana and get tremendous visions and think that 
one has grasped the personality of Divine Mother, but what one perceives 
is merely what one's conditioning fancies and is capable of grasping! 
The complete personality of Divine Mother is beyond anybody's 
perception.

However, Divine Mother does manifest in a perceptible way as the cosmos. 
Every being in the cosmos is a limited manifestation of Her. Being able 
to love every being is the FIRST step in truly loving the Divine Mother.

Loving someone because they are doing some good work (as we see it!) or 
because they have something we need (as we see it!) etc, is *egoistic* 
loving. Such love is *conditioned* by the agendas of a limited ego. Such 
love cannot extend to entire cosmos and permanently. The only love that 
can extend to entire cosmos and be permanent is unconditional love of 
all beings.

That comes only when one has no agenda and no expectations from anyone.

Best regards,
Narasimha
