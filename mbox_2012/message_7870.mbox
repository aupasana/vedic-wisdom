Hey Ram,
There is no sin, bhai sahab. If you have eaten more it will produc=
e gas not sin. The gift of food is the best gift of all, please donate as m=
uch as you can this time around as in this birth, because now you know abou=
t food. There is no such thing as "sin". When Narasimha wrote sin, he didn'=
t mean it in a traditional definition of sin. Bhavanaon ko samjho, angreji =
ko nahin. Un logon ko khana khilao jinko zaroorat hai. Aur bohton ko sach m=
ein hai!!
