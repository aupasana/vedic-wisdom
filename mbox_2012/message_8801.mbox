Dear Rajarshi,

Thanks a million for this account of beloved Noren of Thaku=
r Ramakrishna.

{
I have learnt that every individual, however degraded he =
may appear in my eyes, is God involved, and therefore cannot be lost for ev=
er. We should look upon him with respect and if possible give him a lift Go=
dward, not by condemning his perverted ideal and by cruelly tearing it away=
 from his heart but by gently replacing it by a true one suited to his temp=
erament and culture. 
}

Warm Regards,

Utpal
