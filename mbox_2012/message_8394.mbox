=C2=A0Dear Srikanth,

<<Unfortunate part is that you will ofcourse have s=
ome experiences out of 
this sadhana as it is very powerful but we would no=
t know if it was a 
mind trip or hallucination or true divine presence.>>

=
Yup.

It takes a LOT of time and maturity to figure out which is which. It =
is not a foolproof method of judgement. Sometimes internal experiences are =
accompanied by external changes, sometimes not. Either way, a accurate corr=
elation is difficult to find and even more difficult to recreate at will. R=
efer to an email which Narasimha had written some months back on these line=
s. This is NOT a foolproof method of judging progress. It is dicey and tric=
ky.

Also, I repeat myself again. There is absolutely no genuine informatio=
n on real Mahavidya sadhana on the internet. Those who have succeeded and a=
re thus in a real position to provide authentic information stay away from =
making these public and for a very good reason. What you find in blogs and =
other discussion forums is mostly limping half-baked stuff, posted by folks=
 who have never experienced the real stuff, and followed by those who have =
not yet realize the futility of searching for it over the internet.

In las=
t 6 years, I had the good/bad fortune of meeting plenty of such Mahavidya s=
adhaks and Tantra sadhakas of all hues, from the western to the Indian, fro=
m internet babas to traditionally decorated 'guru' with mighty epithets. Of=
 these, I have found only 3 genuine people. Two of them do not know or care=
 to open an internet, probably do not even have an email id. The third one =
keeps his real sadhana so beautifully hidden that the average thrill seeker=
 will pass him by a hundred times and yet not notice.

This age is weird an=
d severely corrupted. Names designations do not mean much. There are people=
 with Purnabhisekh shakta dikshas who cannot sit still without fidgeting, e=
ven if their life were to depend on it, while performing a ritual. For 99.9=
9 % people until the body is still, the mind will never be still. Until the=
 mind is still, the mantra will not bear it real fruits. In previous ages, =
a PurnaAbhisekh Diksha meant a person who is able to awaken the Kundalini S=
hakti at will to a higher chakra. Today it has degraded into a mere fancy d=
ecoration. Dressing up a corpse when the spirit is dead.

Simple bhakti, co=
ntemplation, and inculcating detachment and objectivity is much better than=
 all this in my opinion.

-Regards

=C2=A0 
Narasimhaji and Rajasrshiji hit it on th=
e right spot.

I got into a wee bit of sadhana due to a personal issue and =
My personal experience with Maha Vidya sadhana has been very strenuous and =
emotionally tiring(Had some small experiences of Maa though they could not =
be verified by a Guru) and is not for everyone. We need to have done some v=
ery good karmas in the past to come into the corridors of Devi. This is sai=
d in all puranas and upapuranas however to sustain our focus is very diffic=
ult unless we have a very competent Guru. I have spent close to 6 years sea=
rching for a true tantrik practitioner and i found one very sincere amercia=
n student who is named as Shri Ugranand Saraswathi.=C2=A0 All that is avail=
able on the internet is just to cheat gullible masses. A greatest master li=
ke Ramakrishna took 12 years of intense sadhana to get her darshan with hug=
e punya from his past lives. There is no doubt about it.

Unfortunate part =
is that you will ofcourse have some experiences out of this sadhana as it i=
s very powerful but we would not know if it was a mind trip or hallucinatio=
n or true divine presence. Please note that you are not dealing some one in=
 the hierarchy but the MAHAMAYA who can encompass even the trimurti to maya=
. We need immense blessings of GaneshJi and Lord Shiva to progress on this =
path as small time energies will not allow you to progress in sadhana.

My =
advice is not to leave HER FEET come what may.

I remember a parable of Shr=

 come to us, only when we cry for enlightenment does she come over leaving =
everything for us".
