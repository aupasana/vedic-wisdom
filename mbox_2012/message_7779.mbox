Namaste Friends,

On coming Somavara (Monday, 23rd Jan 2012), there is stil=
l Amaavasyaa for many Asian countries. for e.g. Indian subcontinent, Gulf c=
ountries. The Amaavasyaa is called Somavati-Amaavasyaa.
Auspiciousness of A=
maavasyaa for Pitri-Trpana is all the more increased as it falls on Soma-da=
y.

I wish to also add some astrological value to this. If possible, I sugg=
est starting the ritual exactly at the Sun-Rise time, which has unique feat=
ure as 7 out of 9 Grahas are attaining MahaYogada status at that time.

Let=
 we all get blessings of our Pitris by trying our bit to release them from =
our kaarmik link.
