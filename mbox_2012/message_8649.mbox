Namaste Mihirji,
Thank you so much for sharing your view. Sorry if i sounde=
d offensive but my intention was not at all so. Good to know that you alrea=
dy have done SK for 7 years & have now switched over to homa. I am practici=
ng it for about a year & found it to be very good in stress relief & am una=
ble to state about my spiritual progress before & after SK.=C2=A0
I was so =
much miserable in 2005 that i learned few stotras & mantras & recited them =
for about a year daily for one year. Now I recite only on Monday & Saturday=
. May be cause of that itself i came to know about the spiritual masters & =
my misery reduced. And now after 7 years although much of family & fincanci=
al issue are still there but I feel very contented & calm. The calm I feel =
after SK i also feel the same after the mantra & stotra recitation I do. Bu=
t the effect of SK stay through out the day.

Regards
Vinayak

      Namaste Vinayak, 
N=
o I don't think you are considering Narasimha ji as Guru.=C2=A0 How many of=
 us will ask their Guru to try out different Spiritual Practice and give a =
comparative study? I think you are treating him as Spiritual Consultant. 
A=
nyway, as Narasimha ji has said it is finally individual preference. So eve=
n he try out on request, what do you expect him to say one is 80% effective=
, same, or 110% effective. He will still say that this is my comparative ju=
dgment but it may be different for you.=C2=A0 So best you try out and read =
his post on spiritual progress and judge what works better for you, or you =
want both. 
Now on my experience, I learnt SK in 2002 and within 25 days le=
arnt PS. =C2=A0I have practiced both regularly for 1 years and SK alone for=
 7 years. I have done Advance course 8 times. Also have listen Narad Bhakti=
 Sutra, Astavakra Geeta etc. As you mentioned that AOL service is considere=
d very important part, I had also done lots of volunteering activities in A=
OL including being Administrator for Primary School. Since 2009, I have sto=
pped practicing SK, as I felt that I after initial couple of years of progr=
ess, I did not find progressing much on spiritual level. I found really hel=
pful in stress relief and mental calmness, but considered commodity/retail =
spirituality. 
Now from last 10 months, by taking Ganapathi as Guru, I have=
 started doing japa every day and homam every weekend. I have not spent equ=
al amount of time in Homam as in SK practice to give you comparison. Yes, i=
t will take longer than SK to master the technique, and initially mind is m=
ore occupied in maintaining the fire. 
So can only say, if you like in the =
reasoning and explanation of Narasimha ji, better try yourself and see how =
you feel. Anyway, AoL also teaches Agnihotra, and also homam in their Veda =
school. During Navaratri in Bangalore ashram there are all the homam done. =
So =C2=A0Homam is not contradiction to AOL. 
Hope this helps.

Mi=
