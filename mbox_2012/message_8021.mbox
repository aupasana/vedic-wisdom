=C2=A0  
 
Namaste - Initi=
ally I took it more as educational request, but I see that you mention "kin=
dly suggest" ! That sounds more like you want to try this !

Although it wa=
s for Sh Narasimha, I will give my cents as this was posted to the group.

=
Manish ji said once, you should see mother at home first before trying to s=
ee her in SmashAn. 

The schools of thought I follow does not let women do =
the last rites.

Lastly, I am not sure what your intent is; but let me take=
 it to one extreme and caution based on my experience in other school I am =
part of. The individuals who stuck to basics, not trying vipareeta (extreme=
) rituals made better progress than the enthusiastic ones whose goal was to=
 experience gopi bhAva, etc sooner. I remember your mails where you mention=
ed worshipping Ugra devata did not work for you at one point of time, so th=
is mail surprised me ! 
I am taking liberty in adding more than normally I =
do. Hope you take it rightly.

regards
rAma
