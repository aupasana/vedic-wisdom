namaste,

Yes, homam with the savitur gayatri mantra is quite common.

It is often done as a general-purpose prAyashcitta karma, to atone for any
sins. Many yajur vedis traditionally perform a homa with 1000 ahutis the
day after the yearly shrAvaNa upAkarma.

The sage bodhAyana has prescribed a gRha-shAnti homa which primarily
consists of 1000 ahutis with the gayatri mantra for "general prosperity of
the house". He has said that it can be done monthly, yearly, on in any good
muhurta. (i.e. a regular homa)

sasneham,

   ajit
