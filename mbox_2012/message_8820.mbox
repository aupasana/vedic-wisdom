People say remember God all the time. Remember His Name all the time. But t=
he mind never obeys (at least mine doesn't). It remembers only sporadically=
 unfortunately...it's such a meandering wandering thing!

"Life is short, T=
ime is fleeting" says Sivananda. Something has to be done to curtail this w=
andering mind. Enough time is already lost, and not an extra minute will be=
 given to us!

I wanted PRACTICAL TIPS on how to remember God all the time,=
 and googled it to see if anyone had any bright ideas. 

This article came =
up. It's very interesting.

kers/meditation/how-to-remember-god-at-all-times

The author, Sadhak Gaurav=
, says:

"While doing duties, one is supposed to remember God. There can be=
 three ways to achieve such remembrance:
 
1) While remembering God, do the=
 work. (Here remembrance is foremost and work is secondary.)

2) While doin=
g work, remember God. (Here work is foremost and remembrance is secondary.)=


3) Only do God's work. (Here exclusive feelings towards God are primary.)=


Most of the people try to follow #1 and #2. Some people do minimal amount=
 of duties and make remembrance their prime focus.    
Some other people tr=
y to do their duties and take care of their family and friends and try to r=
emember God while doing their duties. Most of these people struggle to reme=
mber God and tend to forget him. One obvious reason is the lack of alertnes=
s. But they also make very grave mistake. They accept their body, family, w=
ork and business as their own and have feeling on mine-ness towards it. 

"=
Therefore, God is forgotten again and again and it is difficult to remember=
 Him."

"If one does only God's work, then God will always be remembered. T=
here is sense of mine-ness towards God and His work and therefore, remembra=
nce happens all the time. Therefore, one should have a firm resolve to do o=
nly God's work so that one can always remember Him."


"What is God's work?=
 In order to do God's work, one must accept and understand the truth. The t=
ruth is that everything  belongs to God. All living entities are part of Go=
d as God is in everyone. All activities done are God's work as God is every=
one."

I thought he explained the technique brilliantly. God bless him! It'=
s easy to say "remember God", but it's much more helpful when someone gives=
 PRACTICAL advice on how to! 

How does one remember God all day? While bru=
shing one's teeth? While driving? While at work? When someone's yelling at =
one? When someone's being nice to one?  

Sivananda said, No need to run aw=
ay to the forest if you're a busy man/woman of the world. You can attain Go=
d in and through the world. Every hour, spend 2 minutes contemplating God. =

"Every hour, on the hour" (like the BBC world news slogan!), contemplate G=
od and say the Name...Over time, this builds up a huge spiritual force that=
 will transform you...

Here's Sivananda's article on God rememberance for =
working people/householders...
