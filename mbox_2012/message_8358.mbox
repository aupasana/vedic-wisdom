Hi Aparna, 

Great you going for Dalai lama, i followed his talks and tibet=
ian buddhism for quite a while. 

i think talks for western audience dilute=
s the essence. I think you are more emotional types so go and soak up his p=
resence and majestic. he is a living buddha. visit him in dharamshala and u=
ll get bang on empowerment.

even gopis didnt knew what they were at heart.=
 there is no becomming, there is only being. :)

and i thought aghoris coul=
d only wake up shamshan not a peaceful vedic forum.

enjoy
