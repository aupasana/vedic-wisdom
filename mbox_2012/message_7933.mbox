Dear Friends,
( Sri Narshma, Ananda Kishora and others)=A0
I have recently =
shifted in Calcutta. I live at Alipore which is quiet close to famous Kali =
temple. I have a humble plan which I want to share with you. If some of you=
 are staying in/ around Calcutta, then we can think of assembling at some c=
onvenient place and start hawan in group(with separate hawan kund). we can =
do it periodiacily say on weekends.=A0It is nice that we interact with each=
 other online and share spritual knowledge and clear our doubts, but it wou=
ld be much better if we can assemble at one place to do a hawan. the energy=
 of the collective action should be manyfold and it=A0should benefit all.=
=A0further we can learn from each other. 
If you notice Muslims and Ghristi=
ans, they pray to God at a common time and place in a group. While, we Hind=
us seperately visit our temples. May be, thats why their numbers are increa=
sing while proportanately ours numbers are decereasing. I just wanted to em=
phasize the importance organising for spritual upliftment. I have no ill fe=
elings against anyone. 
It might have happened in some age that one raam ha=
d defeated one ravana. But in this age ravana(kaam, krodh,loabh,..) are ver=
y powerful and therefore we need to act collectively. 
I have known that th=
ere=A0some group doing=A0hawan collectively at Bombay.=A0Similarly, we can =
start at calcutta, the place of sri Ramkrishna.=A0=A0
=A0
Further, I have a=
 doubt regarding procedure of hawan. I have noticed in the downloaded vedio=
 of Ganapati Hawan that the offering(ghee/coconut peices) are put in the fi=
re while saying swaha( sometimes it appers in the vedio that the offering i=
s put in fire after the mantra is complere and before swaha). I want to kno=
w if the offering should go in the fire after the mantra is complete(before=
 swaha), or while saying swaha, or after the mantra and swaha is complete.w=
hen should it leave our fingers?=A0I had earlier put up this question and w=
hat I understood from Sri Ananda Kishora's reply is that the offering is=A0=
to be made to=A0the fire after the mantra chanting with swaha is complete. =
But this vedio has created a doubt. Kindly Clarify.
=A0
Now a days=A0 few y=
ogacharyas advocate that while doing pranayama the air has to be filled in =
lungs and not stomach(i.e. the stomach should not bulge). But another group=
 says that air should fill both lungs and stomach(both stomach and lungs sh=
ould come out). What according to you is the correct procedure of pranayam?=

=A0
Waiting for your reply.

Thanking you
