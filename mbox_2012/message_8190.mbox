Namaskaram PVR garu and members,




I am interested in having my 11 yr old=
 kid do homams independently, but the basic question arises how can I help =
her in regulating the fire. 
    I know I am not supposed to put anything i=
nside the kunda. Since she has no experience she will need help so I was wo=
ndering can I take a metallic spoon or something to help the fire from goin=
g out? Any tips how can I help?


Another question that arises in my mind i=
s, is it too early for me to teach homam.  Homam requires one to be brahmac=
hari. Due to hormonal issues teens start experiencing sexual thoughts and v=
aried emotions. Having a kid control her emotions at such an early age is i=
t really right on my part? Will I be putting pressure on them .....shouldn'=
t they experience the life in fullest form before endeavouring the path of =
spirituality.  


Experienced parents kindly advice me? 


Advance thanks f=
or every help,


Regards,

Priya
