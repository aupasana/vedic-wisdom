Namaste Aparna ji, 

Good read on Tantra is kind of rare. Those who know do=
nt write and those who write dont know. (by the way it took a some time to =
realise that there exists full range from easy/nice/happy tantra to downrig=
ht black arts shamshan tantra) even the cute looking buddhist monks might f=
ollow the extreme. 
http://aghorpir.blogspot.in/2012/05/baby-magic.html

an=
d also it took me a while to understand that aghori beneath all the seeming=
ly freaky stuff carry "Bleeding for longing Heart" and "Life is a dream - I=
nterpretation". 

anyhow i found this blog to be a good read on tantra, its=
 written by a Aghori
http://aghorpir.blogspot.in/

His recommended book lis=
t
http://aghorpir.blogspot.ca/2012/05/resources-for-traditional-hindu-tantr=
a.html

but guess what he has put an end to it with following words
"Some w=
ords of advice:  Don't allow yourself to be imprisoned by life and circumst=
ances by living a zombie-like monotonous 9 to 5 life like a slave!  The sys=
tem is designed to keep you subservient and perpetuate itself.  Life is way=
 too short to waste it.  Seek for a way out!  Sorcery and Tantra is about F=
reedom, especially freedom from mental shackles.  It will give you the edge=
 you need to get ahead in life.  Seek for freedom from the Matrix and its a=
rchons.  Emancipate yourself even if it is only mentally!  You are a spark =
of the Divine and are meant for greater things than this!"

There are coupl=
e of FB forum but they mostly dish around sadhanas for solving issues and p=
rovide less theory on tantra. one guy post his tantra sadhana journey, all =
i can say is that on that path fanatics only reach such high levels.


and =
if you want to read about bhairavies 
(good interpretation must otherwise u=
ll get lost in words)
Diaries of a Bhairavi
http://www.newrealities.com/ind=
ex.php/component/content/category/170-diaries-of-bhairavi?start=3D50

there=
 are enough clues to find her out. she is a dancer in jakarta i guess. she =
teaches some basic classes also and quite accessible.

in case you find any=
 good links do share.

regards
