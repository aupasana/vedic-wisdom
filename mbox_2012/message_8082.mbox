Namaste Priya Ji,

I thank you for your suggestion. I am going to try with =
oven soon.

By the way I am a Muslim in a social standpoint, since I was bo=
rn in a Muslim family and continue to be a normal Muslim in the view of soc=
iety. But inside my heart and belief I am fully devoted to Sanatana Dharma.=
 It's sometimes a little difficult to keep such rituals [mantra japam, homa=
m etc.] private from my friends and associates!

Yours,
Tanvir
