Dear Manish,

The way Chhatrapati Shivaji stood unafazed against the devast=
ating Army of Afzal Khan and finally finished the tyranny, I wish that you =
would keep doing Havan habitually by overcoming *all* the challanges.

Best=
 Regards,

Utpal

 I am planning to do my first Mahaganapathi homam on the upcoming Vaishakha=
 Purnima on May 5th. I just wanted to find out where can one get the homam =
kunda and homam samagri from? I stay in Navi Mumbai, and if there are any s=
adhakas living in Mumbai/Navi Mumbai who can guide me regarding this, I wil=
l be very grateful to them.
