 I have decided to start a homam. In the beginning, I intend to do it every=
 Saturday. I will start with the MahaGanapathy homam, and then let MahaGana=
pathy guide me along the path, as you have said many times. Shrimaan, I was=
 thinking of starting from the beginning of the New Year in Chaitra Masa, w=
hich happens on March 23rd this year. The very auspicious Vasant/Chaitra Na=
varatri also starts the same day. I was thinking of starting from either Ch=
aitra Pratipada - March 23rd, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvitiya -March 24th, Sh=
anivara. Do you reckon this to be a good time to start the homam? and which=
 is a better day - Chaitra Pratipada, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvitiya, Shaniv=
ara?
