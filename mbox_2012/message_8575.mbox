aken-krishna-in-your-consciousness


Janmashtami celebrates the birth of Kr=
ishna. He is not a *vyakti* or
person but *shakti* or energy. Krishna was *=
poornakalaavataran, *a complete
incarnation. The purpose of celebration is =
to realise that Krishna is in
me. In the *Bhagwad Gita*, Krishna says, =E2=
=80=9COne who sees everyone in Me and
sees Me in everyone, for such a perso=
n, I shall never remain hidden and he
shall never be far from me.=E2=80=9D
=

Krishna=E2=80=99s life has all the nine *rasas* or flavours. For instance,=
 he was
naughty like a child, a warrior, joy personified and a source of
kn=
owledge. He was a perfect friend and guru. His birth on ashtami signifies
h=
is mastery of both spiritual and material worlds. He is a great teacher
and=
 spiritual inspiration as well as the consummate politician. On the one
han=
d, he is Yogeshwara, the Lord of Yogas while on the other, he is a
mischiev=
ous thief. His behaviour is a perfect balance of extremes =E2=80=94 perhaps=

this is why his personality is so difficult to fathom. The avdhoot is
obli=
vious to the world outside and a materialistic person, a politician or
a ki=
ng is oblivious to the spiritual world. But Krishna is both
Dwarkadheesh an=
d Yogeshwar.

 To understand Krishna, simply become Radha, Arjuna or Uddhav=
a. Three kinds
of people seek refuge in God -- the lover, the miserable and=
 the wise.
Uddhava was wise, Arjuna was miserable and Radha was love person=
ified.
Krishna=E2=80=99s teachings are most relevant to our times as they n=
either let you
get lost in material pursuits nor make you completely withdr=
awn. They
rekindle your life, from being a burnt-out and stressed personali=
ty to a
more centred and dynamic one. Krishna teaches us devotion with skil=
l. To
celebrate Gokulashtami is to imbibe extremely opposite yet compatible=

qualities and manifest them in your own life.

 Krishna tells Arjuna, "You=
 are very dear to me" and says he must
surrender. Surrender begins with an =
assumption. You assume you are the most
beloved of the Divine, and then sur=
render happens. Surrender is not an
action; it is an assumption. Non-surren=
der is ignorance, an illusion.
Surrender has to begin as an assumption and =
then it reveals itself as a
reality. Finally, it reveals itself as an illus=
ion. An illusion, because
there are no two aspects, no duality. There is no=
 independent existence of
anyone. An individual has no independent existenc=
e.

 So, in the Gita, Krishna says, "He is dear to Me who neither goes on
t=
hanking people nor hates anyone.=E2=80=9D Thanking and feeling obliged indi=
cates
that you believe in someone else's existence rather than in the Divin=
e who
is ruling everything. When you feel obliged, then you are not honouri=
ng the
principles of karma or the divine plan. Appreciate people for what t=
hey
are; do not thank them for what they do. Otherwise your thankfulness is=

centered around the ego. You are grateful, but not for an act. You are
gra=
teful for what is.

Hence the most authentic way of celebrating Janamashtam=
i is to know that
you have to play a dual role =E2=80=94 of being a respons=
ible human being and at
the same time to realise that you are above all eve=
nts, the untouched
Brahmn. Imbibing a bit of avadhoot and a bit of activism=
 in your life is
the real significance of celebrating Janmashtami. Awaken t=
he Krishna in
your consciousness =E2=80=93 =E2=80=9CKrishna is not far from=
 me, not separate from me, he
is within me=E2=80=99-- this feeling will fil=
l your life with Krishna.
