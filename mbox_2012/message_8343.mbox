greetings nobody

Well an Aghori saying "Jai Shri Radheya" and quoting Nusr=
at and nelly in same mail certainly puts you in whos-who of oddest list.

A=
fter your last post on loving goddess, many people will think twice before =
even loving and surrendering to even teddy bear let alone Gods. Thanks for =
making "surrender/loving" point extremely clear.

I have heard lot of thing=
s from some very senior guys in "ayi panth" nath sampradaya. Some are accom=
plished in 52-53veer/64yogini. They focus on devotion+method. They do have =
ishta as shiva but then they do sadhana for all gods with all kinds of mant=
ra from sabar/muslim/hindu. They sometimes give particular sadhana/process =
for certain end results (wordly-money/health/solving problems). Some are ea=
sy to activate, some are not-so. Siddhi is of course a different ball-game,=
 Far difficult to digest as compared to getting one. Even they dont carry t=
he extreme view on surrender and there is always a method.

You got to writ=
e things that makes sense to lesser mortals. And hell not after your single=
 malts. 

Are you up for some questions so that we can learn a bit. Because=
 for some grand reason 99.99% people do get it wrong. and for the few who d=
o get it right "nothing else matters"

To entice you further Will throw in =
choice for you, you can choose to ignore 1 out of 10 questions.

Regards,
p=
riyank
