Hi, 
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 So how a=
re you doing? no body answered your letter although many are married, I sup=
pose. I am not but I thought I will write several things after some time. B=
ut things are changing in my life and so as I was getting to write it witho=
ut delay,=C2=A0I saw a tv programme about pregnant women in India. And then=
 I received a indication that I should not get involved in=C2=A0such things=
. Certain things should=C2=A0remain hidden. So I will write a very short tr=
ue story only.
=C2=A0
I had read that drinking coconut milk during pregnanc=
y results in baby having a white skin.
=C2=A0
My late Uncle was famous astr=
ologer in his time and he was also my spiritual Guru. Somehow he had very f=
air white complexion and so his children=C2=A0. In late 50's or early 60's =
he was travelling by first class in train. After some time he noticed a wom=
an was kept staring at him.
This made him uneasy but then that woman starte=
d to speak to him. Do you have daughters? she asked. My uncle said yes. Do =
they have same white skin as yourself. Again my uncle said yes. Are they of=
 marriage age. The answer was yes again. Would you give them in marriage to=
 my son because their union will give my grandchildren as white skin as you=
 have.
=C2=A0
Now my Uncle asked that woman her caste. As soon she told
=C2=
=A0her caste which was very different,=C2=A0my uncle politely refused her o=
ffer.
=C2=A0
So if you are of different caste it is better to stick to coco=
nut milk.lol
=C2=A0
And good luck for your Purashcharan of whichever Mantra=
 you do. Remember to give sweets to your supporters after you finish it. I =
like white rasgulla and white dosa as well.
=C2=A0
Thanks

[vedic-wisdom] Garbhadhan Sanskar

dear narasimha ji and my spiritual sibli=
ngs,

i am
 planning to come up with a book on planning babies.
of course t=
he market is flooded with books on this topic
but this one will be more fro=
m the point of view of Vedas
and local/regional folk knowledge.
so i'd be r=
eally grateful if you could all pitch in
with your own knowledge base.
ever=
y bit is welcome- links, articles,your own knowledge
anything that you must=
 have heard from the last generation or anyone, interesting facts, secrets =
etc. 

i am especially interested to know the following:

1. Vedas and othe=
r ancient sacred texts- Garbhdhan sanskar, garbhadhan havan/pooja, planning=
 to have a baby girl/boy etc.
2. mythological tales proving the efficacy of=
 the above
3. local/regional
 knowledge- which food are good for pregnant l=
adies,
taboo foods and acts; vrata/pooja etc.; good food and lifestyle spec=
icfic to post partum days etc.
4. recipes that have specific effects viz. i=
n Mithila region of Bihar preg ladies take "banslochan" to make the bones o=
f the baby strong.
then they eat jeera ka halwa after the baby is born whic=
h heals the mother and enhances the milk formation in her breasts
5. the sp=
eciifc types of massages, asanas etc. for ladies
6. taking care of the youn=
g ones as prevalent in your own home areas
7. annprasahan and other poojas =
done in your areas for the baies
8. jyotish aspect- as in which nakshatras =
are favourable and which ones will produce babies with which qualities
9. w=
hich months will have babies with which qualities etc.
10.any other aspects=
 that you feel must be included in the book.

it'll be a coffee table book =
with lots of snippets.
so every bit of your knowledge is welcome.
and of co=
urse you'll get credits for your contribution :)

please help me with this.=

dolly.
