Namaste Ajit ji,

>>>In general, saying that "xyz" is not found in the veda=
s is not
>>>something to be taken lightly.

Yes! I had a second hand inform=
ation and i would remember not to quote Vedas for what i do not know myself=
 for sure.

***
after a good amount of thought on the subject, i have come =
to a conclusion that if I do something, I would get the reaction of it soon=
er or later. Good/bad/mixed feeling out of those results depends upon my me=
ntal conditioning, My mental state. hence If i need to have certain kind of=
 results, i have to involve in certain kind of actions and avoid certain ki=
nd of actions. It is now up to me as to what I desire. even if i know i sti=
ll get engaged to undesirable actions due to my vasanas and i would get res=
ults which i do not prefer. BUT i am now prepared and accept everything wit=
hout much drama. as I know deep within that It is all results of my Karma a=
lone. wonderful! gives me a great clarity, level of accptance and i may say=
, good detachment.

This is an over-simplified conclusions but clutter-free=
 as far as i go and it has given me clearer mindset. Better than heaviness =
generated by thinking of what is Papa (and associated guilts) and Punya (an=
d association of dangerous pride). It is also line of thinking IMHO which i=
s capable of giving true detatchment at fast pace.

bhavdiya!

Utpal
