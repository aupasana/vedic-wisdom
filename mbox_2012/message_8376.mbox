Hello,

Today fortunately watched glimpses of old "Chupke-chupke" movie on =
TV and now It "Munnabhai MBBS" is going on. Laughing like a hell. "To Tu ho=
ta hai, DO Du hota hai to GO Gu kyun nahi Hota..." "Ye baal ki dukan ko toc=
han dun kya bhai..." 
Hehehe ROFL.

Thik kaha XYZ bhaiya- No hard feelings,=
 preach karane se acchha hai Khush rahena...Hasate rahena...usme sar pe wis=
e hone ka koi vazan nahi raheta!

Warm Regards,

Utpal
