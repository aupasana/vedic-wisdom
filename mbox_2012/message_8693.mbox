nesha-remover-of-obstacles

Ganesha offers lessons in how to be successful =
for devotees familiar with
his incarnations as it=E2=80=99s faith in the el=
ephant-headed god that propels
them. The neighbourhood temple to Ganesha is=
 where they light a lamp, break
a coconut and hope fervently that the deity=
 also known as =E2=80=98Remover of
Obstacles=E2=80=99 will pitch in to help=
. This belief comes with ancient stories of
his prowess, even of his mount,=
 the rat, which can reach any corner of the
world and burrow through a moun=
tain, even.

 Ganesha took many forms as visualised in the Mudgala Purana t=
o show the
path to success. Of them, eight are particularly significant. Fi=
rst, in his
incarnation as Vakratunda or the one with a curved trunk when h=
e vanquished
the demon Matsarasura. Matsara means jealousy and the anger bo=
rn thereof.
His very birth is ascribed to a remiss by Indra and true to his=
 nature the
demon desired to rule all the three worlds. His boon of fearles=
sness from
Shiva helped him and soon he was tormenting everyone, heady with=
 power.
Vakratunda cut him down to size. He comes riding a lion. He says, h=
owever
well endowed you are, wisdom lies in  knowing and understanding your=
 limits.

 Second, his avatar as Ekdanta or the one-tusked one was taken in=
 order to
subdue Madasura or the demon of vanity. In this avatar Ganesha st=
resses the
need to not let illusions enter your head and intoxicate you wit=
h pride.
This is possible only when you understand that you are but a part =
of the
divine and that the divine energy is acting through you. So give up =
pride
in the self.



Third, Ganesha as Mohadara teaches us to get rid of m=
oha or attachment by
killing the demon Moha. Fourth, as Gajanana he kills t=
he demon Lobha or
greed. Fifth, as Lambodara he overcomes krodha or the dem=
on of anger. Lust
is another demon of undoing and so sixth is Ganesha=E2=80=
=99s incarnation as a
deformed Vikata who destroys the demon Kama. Seventh,=
 as Vignaraja, he
destroys the ogre of self-indulgence.



In his eigth inc=
arnation as Dhumravarna he cuts at the root of it all,
ahankara or arroganc=
e. Brahma felt the sun, the sustainer of life, deserved
the post of the min=
ister of life actions and so appointed him as such. With
this, the sun beca=
me  so arrogant, that when he suddenly sneezed, the
personification of arro=
gance, Ahantasura, was born. The terror he was
wreaking and the misery he w=
as bringing by his sheer arrogance was
unimaginable. Eventually the gods pr=
ayed to Ganesha, asking him to end
their suffering at the hands of Ahantasu=
ra.



Ganesha appeared as a smoke-coloured deity riding a rat. Ahantasura =
was
overcome. Arrogance is the root of self-destruction, says Dhumravarna. =
Even
though the sun is so powerful, his arrogance created havoc in the worl=
d.



Ganesha is elephant-faced, pot bellied and with short legs because he=
 has
no ego. And that is why the attributes which would otherwise be seen a=
s
disproportionate and strange now become endearing. We all have eight
nega=
tive energies in some measure in us and we need to overcome them in
order t=
o control the ego. The ills that derive from these negative emotions
manife=
st in a similar manner. It is divine power that makes you powerful,
beautif=
ul, desired=E2=80=A6 so do not ascribe it all to yourself, says Ganesha and=

that remains the most valuable lesson to success. Let the excitement of
ac=
hievement be the celebration of your Muse.
