Dear Ranga and others,

> I also notice that at times the drops of ghee falling on a small fire
actually put it off!


Most people ride a bicycle at a comfortable speed. Riding it too fast can
be dangerous. Riding it very slow is very difficult. When children first
try to ride a bicycle, they struggle because they are going too slow. When
they speed up a little, things become easier.

Maintaining a very small fire is difficult. If you cannot have a bigger
fire, don't worry about it, and do the best that you can. But, if you can
have a slightly bigger fire, such that a single wayward drop doesn't
extinguish it, you might consider doing that.


> But it bothers me that my attention is on maintaining the fire when I
should be concentrating on the mantras


Give it time. Slowly, you will become an expert, and your attention will go
where it needs to go.

sasneham,

   ajit
