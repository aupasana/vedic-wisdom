Shri Narasimhaji,

Namaste!

Thank you for your encouragement. We will sure=
ly perform the Satya Narayana vratam ritual every Pournima night.

With Par=
aAtman's Grace, I have decided to start a homam. In the beginning, I intend=
 to do it every Saturday. I will start with the MahaGanapathy homam, and th=
en let MahaGanapathy guide me along the path, as you have said many times. =
Shrimaan, I was thinking of starting from the beginning of the New Year in =
Chaitra Masa, which happens on March 23rd this year. The very auspicious Va=
sant/Chaitra Navaratri also starts the same day. I was thinking of starting=
 from either Chaitra Pratipada - March 23rd, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvitiya =
- March 24th, Shanivara. Do you reckon this to be a good time to start the =
homam? and which is a better day - Chaitra Pratipada, Shukravara or Chaitra=
 Dvitiya, Shanivara? 

I look forward to your guidance.

Thanks and best re=
gards,
Manish
