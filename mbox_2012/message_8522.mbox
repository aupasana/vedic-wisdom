Namaste Sri Ranga,

I say forget all that and try to be consistent and then=
 have a quality time doing homam! The main point is doing the sadhana (homa=
m), and as they all say, leave the results to GOD!

Good Luck & Keep doing =
with the same innocence that you tried the first time and enjoyed it. Have =
Fun :).
