Namaste friends,
=C2=A0
Regarding speed:
=C2=A0
To one pr=
acticing to walk on a tight rope, focus and steadiness are more important t=
han speed. If one walks too fast, one will fall. Similarly, to one seeking =
to walk on the tight rope of enlightened/detached action, focus and steadin=
ess are far more important than speed. If one walks too fast, one will fall=
 (develop attachment to actions or fruits).
=C2=A0
Spiritual progress by de=
finition is the process of slowing down unneeded mental activity and focus =
on one's dharma with as little attachment as possible. The notion of making=
 "fast" spiritual progress introduces unneeded mental activity and spoils f=
ocus.
=C2=A0
A somewhat related point:
=C2=A0
Don't make the sadhana you do=
 into a rat race or even a mindless ritual. Try to make it enjoyable. Try t=
o put your mind
 into it. If necessary, cut down on aspects that are stoppi=
ng you from being mindful and enjoying it.
=C2=A0
Regarding experiences:
=
=C2=A0
> In a nutshell, a genuine "experience" is good and authentic only t=
o the extent

rsonality.
=C2=A0
Absolutely. I will quote from http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=
up/vedic-wisdom/message/7948:
=C2=A0
<QUOTE BEGIN>
Suppose I go into the op=
en, but see Sun through green eyeglasses. I will see that Sun is green. I a=
m experiencing the real Sun, but I will get the wrong knowledge that "Sun i=
s green".
=C2=A0
Similarly, even a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seein=
g Sun!) CAN generate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one's conditio=
ning is conducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).
=C2=A0
The key is not just to e=
xperience, but the ability to
 interpet, *digest* and absorb the experience=
 into one's system well. One's conditioning influences how one digests vari=
ous life experiences, including spiritual experiences and mystical experien=
ces, like the green eye glasses in the above example!

Yes,=
 seekers will do well to remember these words. One may not realize the impo=
rtance of this today, but a day will come for every seeker when this will m=
ake all the difference in the world.
=C2=A0
If one has a good guru, (s)he w=
ill arrest the destruction. The main purpose of a guru is to detect inflati=
ons in ego and cut them off. However, many people
 are kind of on their own=
 in this age. That is why I keep emphasizing this point on hanging on tight=

yakosha of a human being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the ov=
erlapping influence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anaha=
ta. Everything=C2=A0 is possible here. Every higher deity has a correspondi=
ng lesser manifestation in this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly th=

te an expereince for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can eve=
n fake an experience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hol=

 lower extreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementin=

In a nutshell, a genuine "experience" is good and authentic only to th=
e extent that it helps to modify and transform your waking surface personal=
ity. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of experiences that com=
e from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this r=
ealm, are just sound and fury without substance. 

In the writings of Sri A=
urobindo, he calls it the intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerabl=

 realm. One =
sure-shot way to cross this realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this=
 some day, is to hang on tightly to the fundamentals.

A sage "sms" indeed! Yes direction must be always, a=

day to day example of driving Car. One can not miss/ignore the sight of cor=
