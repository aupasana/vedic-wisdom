The Brahm Yagna : During the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the =
swami being concerned about his country's future decided to organize a Brah=
m Yagna. This vedic ritual according to the swami had not been performed fo=
r past 5000 years in that part of the world. But this was no easy task, alr=
eady bounded by the time constraint, it required a hundred Brahmins who rec=
ite the Durga Saptashati daily, do not take money for performing any ritual=
s and are ordained in the Shakta Marga, i.e. Shaktism. On the top of this i=
t might take great physical labours, since most rituals would continue inde=
finitely, day and night, until some divine intervention occurs. Also a caus=
e of worry was the fact the such ritual may give unexpected and harmful res=
ults if done without care. Moved by the daily news of the failing Indian de=
fences, the swami decided to go ahead with the programme. Accordingly sermo=
ns were issued, to all parts of India where such willing Brahmins could be =
found, a large number of them came from Varanasi, as expected. But only 84 =
such Brahmins could be assembled in such a short duration of time, the yagn=
a began nonetheless. The temple complex was cordoned off for one and all, n=
o monetary help was taken from outside, neither was the programme publicize=
d. The Brahmins started the rituals which among others included the recitat=
ion of all the four vedas, use of the spiritually collected power against t=
he enemy of the country and it all supposedly happened under the powers of =
goddess Bagalamukhi and Dhumavati. Goddess Bagalamukhi was worship in the d=
ays to stop the enemy from further advances (the process called Sttambhan) =
while goddess Dhumavati was worshiped during the nights to force the enemy =
back (the process called Uchhatan). The durations of the yagna, thirty thre=
e days, was marked with supernatural experiences by every one involved in t=
he rituals, the swami would listen to them and based on his interpretation =
of the signs, would decide the next ritual. Even as the Yagna was at its pe=
ak, the much expected news of the ceasefire arrived. A personal account by =
a man, called Gopaldas Mishr, who was involved in the yagna is as follows

=
The eighty four Brahmins would recite the Durga Saptashati in the day's lig=
ht with a Samputt (that included the name of the then Premiere of China Zho=
u Enlai), while in the night eleven Brahmins would meditate, with japa on g=
oddess Dhumavati, from 9 P.M. to 4 A. M. . I was instructed by Swami Ji Mah=
araj to observe the picture of goddess Dhumavati and report immediately to =
him as soon as any sign was seen. For ten days the recitations went on unhi=
ndered, on the eleventh day, during the midnight a horribly strong animal l=
ike sound was heard in the traditional gymnasium situated in the Peeth, all=
 of us were fearful. But interestingly the swami was happy and said "the be=
ginning is auspicious, go now and carry on with your work ". Perhaps it was=
 the fourteenth day that I was ordered, by the goddess' picture "I am hungr=
y", I reported to the swami, to that Shree Swami Ji replied "She is always =
hungry, it very difficult to feed her, yet take some rice, ghee, gur, curd =
etc.. and feed Her". Accordingly the second next day we went to the pond ne=
arby where a Tantric Animal ate it. Next day the goddess hinted that she re=
mains hungry still, the swami ordered to increase the sacrificial offering.=
 The same Tantric Animal came next day to eat the offerings . The next day =
the goddess complained that the Japa is lesser by five japamalas, the swami=
 ordered to increase as per the goddess' desire. Finally it was on the twen=
ty first day, that I was almost half asleep that the Mother Goddess appeare=
d and caught my hand saying "sit with Me in the motor and come to China" to=
 which I requested "I am doing the ritual, how can I leave it incomplete ? =
please You go alone." The Mother sat in the car, just as I heard a sound of=
 starting of the motor, the mother disappeared before my eyes. When I repor=
ted this to the swami he lamented that "you did a mistake, you should have =
gone with the Mother, well now, I will have to go ". Shree Swami Ji and oth=
ers who were doing the Japa saw that the Mother wielding a whip and punishi=
ng the Chinese while standing on the bonnet of the car. The very next day i=
t was published in the newspapers that Chinese are retreating and indeed it=
 did so.

The worsened relatio=
n of the China and the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1960's was according to so=
me participants, the result of the yagna. Some of his lifelong devotees are=
 of the opinion that this was his single most important event in his life. =
A good account of this event was published in the Illustrated Weekly of Ind=
ia dated 6 October 1963 0n page number 19 under the title Chiaroscuro, alth=
ough the writer and the correspondent did not reveal their own identity.

Raghavendra Swami 
Onc=
e while he was touring Kumbakonam along with his wife, Sri Venkatanatha and=
 his family was invited to attend a function. Unfortunately, the hosts did =
not treat him well and wanted him to earn his food by running a chore. So t=
hey asked him to make some sandalwood paste for all the invitees. Sri Venka=
tanatha per his habit, was chanting stotras and mantras while preparing san=
dalwood for Tilaka. When the guests applied this paste, it induced a burnin=
g sensation all over their bodies. Surprised by this, the hosts sought a cl=
arification from Venkatanatha. He replied that the burning sensation was du=
e to the Agni Suktam (hymn for the worship as defined in the Esoteric Vedas=
) that he was chanting while preparing sandalwood and thus eternal power of=
 Vedic Mantras revealed itself. This happens only when chanted with absolut=
e dedication and devotion. The power is enhanced since it was chanted by so=
meone as virtuous and devoted to Bhagavan Hari as himself. Upon realizing h=
is devotion and power, the host apologized profusely to Sri Venkatanatha an=
d sought his forgiveness.

Sri Venkatanatha then prepared the paste again b=
ut chanted the Vedic Mantra to Varuna (Vedic rain gods) this time. It has b=
een recorded that when the guests applied this paste, they were awash with =
a sense of being drenched in rainwater, reaffirming Sri Venkatanatha's powe=
r of devotion
