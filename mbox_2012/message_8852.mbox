Dear P.V.R Ji,

In JHora, Yukteshwar Ayanamsa is given as one of the Ayanam=
sa option... but you never discuss about it... whether the name "Yukteshwar=
" come from Yukteshwar Giri, who was the GURU of Paramhamsa Yogananda?

Ano=
ther thing... if we count the percentage of aspects of planets on a house..=
. isn't it wise to count the area (spread in degree) of effects of a planet=
 where posited... is it possible to calculate as percentage of strength on =
a house like the aspects?

Regards,
Biswajit

JAI MAA
