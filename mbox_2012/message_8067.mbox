Namaste Narasimha Ji and others,

I have everything ready for my homam, and=
 got coconut copra and sliced them into pieces. However the white part is j=
uicy and when I experimented with it, it does not burn even after staying i=
n the fire for quite a long time! Today is the third day that I kept the co=
conut slices open to dry, but they still are not dry enough to burn. I gues=
s they might take even 8-10 or even 15 days.

But I don't want to wait that=
 long to start my homam.

Narasimha Ji, you have mentioned that fire can be=
 done with wood instead of coconut. So if I do the fire with twig or wood, =
the only time I would need coconut is for Purnahuti. Since dry coconut is n=
ot available now, can I do purnahuti with a big stream of spoonful ghee? Lo=
gically it might be acceptable, since I am offering only ghee as ahuti, so =
why not a big amount of ghee as purna (full) ahuti? Also I read in the arch=
ieve that in deepa-homam, purnahuti can be done with ghee.

Kindly confirm.=


Thanks
Tanvir
