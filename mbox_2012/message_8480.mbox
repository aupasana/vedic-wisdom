Dear Dolly,

I'm glad you found the articles useful. I wish you every suc=
cess with your purascharana. Obstacles are bound to come but at those times=
 it helps to remind oneself of the important reasons for which one started =
it. I'm sure you will be able to overcome all obstacles (just ask Lord Gane=
sh!). :)

 Perhaps we can be 'purascharana buddies' and motivate each other=
 to finish- you know like some people have 'gym buddies' to encourage them =
to workout on those inevitable lazy days that occur sometimes. I don't know=
 anyone in my circle of family and friends who is doing a purascharana so i=
t would be nice to finally know of someone who is doing one. It would be in=
teresting to hear of your purascharana plans so keep us updated. (Why wait =
till Navaratri, start now!) :p  Good luck! :)

Warm regards,

Aparna
