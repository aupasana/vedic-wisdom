Sir

It does not matter if the transplantation was done for an cataract cas=
e or total eye transplantation.Bottom line is atleast 1000 people got an ne=
w life.If you take all the organizations doing this work in India maybe 10,=
000-12,000 people are getting a new life annually.

If all those transplant=
s were rejected by their bodies they would be running to the hopsitals by n=
ow.You are still using a very tiny proportion to claim no transplantation s=
hould be done anywhere.You are throwing out 30 yrs of successfull medical s=
urgeries all over the world. 

Sankara Eye foundation run by the Kanchi pee=
tham does eye transplantaion and I am sure they know better about dharma.

=
Also Science and Spirituality are not mutually exclusive to each other.Many=
 a seer has built a hospital for the benefit of people.What you call as an =
certain planetary position is nothing but a gene sequence in the DNA or neu=
ron connection in the brain. Science does not understand it fully right now=
 .Some day with the help of intuition and modern day vedic seers it might.
=


It is inhuman to say " This person is destined to suffer this way .It mig=
ht be true that their karma is causing it.But a fellow human being having t=
he ability or chance to help the person does not do so on the basis on just=
ification of karma will incur a greater karma because he/she has forsaken h=
is humanity ".

Swami Vivekananda often said

"If in this hell of a world o=
ne can bring a little joy and peace even for a day into the heart of a sing=
le person, that much alone is true; this I have learnt after suffering all =
my life; all else is mere moonshine."

"The unselfish man says,' I will be =
last, I do not care to go to heaven, I will even go to hell if by doing so =
I can help my brothers.' This unselfishness is the test of religion. He who=
 has more of this unselfishness is more spiritual and nearer to Shiva."


A=
ll this over an mere organ of an dead body....we are not even talking about=
 donating an organ while we are alive. If it is classified as a sin so be i=
t !!!! This is my last post on the topic.

Vemparla RamKishore
