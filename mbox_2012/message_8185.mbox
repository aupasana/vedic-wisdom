Namaste Narasimhaji,

Thanks for clearing all my doubts. I will start with =
the MahaGanapathi homam as advised by you. I am really happy to know that m=
y wife can also participate, if and when, she wishes to. She is very fond o=
f Ganapathiji. 

I did write this mail and send it first to your private ma=
il. However, I wasn't sure whether it reached you, since it did not show in=
 my Sent/Outbox folder. Therefore, I decided to mail it here. 

Narasimhaji=
, please keep sharing, as you always do, all that you realize in your saadh=
anaa to help make ours a better society. 

Humble regards,
Vipin
