Namaste Priyank.

Incidentally I also started keeping Akhand deep since n=
ew moon day (22nd Jan 2012). I have a large one purchased from India. The l=
amp can burn on 24X7 basis, with its oil capacity. 

I use Seasome oil and =
it does not give smell. My wick comes as a roll and has been purchased from=
 Khadhi Bandar from Chennai. I cut a long length (say about 10"size) cotton=
 thread from the wick roll and fold it, so that the thread has become thick=
er and has two heads in once place for brighter and better lamp burning. 

=
For maintaining akhand jyoti, I have been increasing the wick length once i=
n 8 hours, after removing the burnt ball from wick, which is falling with i=
n the lamp. This is the only practical way I have experienced so far. 

I a=
llow the lamp to be completely over once in a week. I clean the lamp thorou=
ghly for removing the burnt black balls that fell in oil/ lamp. 

Previousl=
y I used to burn flat lamp, where again the wick has to be protruded to inc=
rease the length. 

Regards
