Namaste friends,

=A0
Dharma shastras have=
 clear guidelines. The well-known Manu Smriti is the authority for dharma m=
atters in Satya yuga. Goutama smriti is the authority in Treta yuga. For Ka=
li yuga, Parasara is the authority in dharma matters.
=A0
And "Parasara Mad=
haveeyam" clearly sets out the following:
=A0
"Compared to a ritual such as=
 homam performed in one's name by a PRIEST, a ritual performed in one's nam=
e by one's own disciple is 100 times more powerful; compared to that, a rit=
ual performed in one's name by one's own progeny is 100 times more powerful=
; compared to that, a ritual performed by oneself is 100 times more powerfu=
l."
=A0
In other words, a ritual such as homam performed by oneself is 1,00=
0,000 times more powerful than a ritual performed in one's name by a priest=
! THIS is the guideline given for Kali yuga.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The bottomline is that one is on one's own as K=
ali deepens and priests will be limited in their ability to give a material=
 and spiritual uplift to others.
=A0
All I am doing is to enable anybody in=
terested in doing key rituals by themselves. If one has other avenues which=
 one thinks are better, one is free to pursue them!
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
I do get a lot of emails from people who s=
ay that they never did any rituals before or even lit a lamp in their lives=
, but somehow felt like trying homam, did it for 6 months, their life chang=
ed so much and they are very thankful. There are such emails from around th=
e world and not just India or US or UK.
=A0
I even heard from a few people =
who were serious alcoholics and were able to leave the habit after starting=
 homam and are so much happier.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 *
=A0
Fire is one thing common between various religions. Hindus, Zo=
roastrians, native Americans, Incans, ancient Greco-Romans and even ancient=
 Judeo-Christian masters such as Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses are =
known to have worshipped "God" in fire and made offerings in fire.
=A0
Even=
 if one does not know any rituals or rules, just lighting a fire, imagining=
 God in fire and meditating in front of fire can be very very effective.

Already there may be very few brahmins on earth, if one goes by =
the definition given by Lord Krishna to Uddhava (see Srimad Bhagavatam 11.1=
7 http://vedabase.net/sb/11/17).

Sir, apart from this thread, I have seen all your threads o=
n me on JyotishGroup in the last 8 days. It looks like you keep thinking ab=
out me, type one email, then another email after an hour, then another afte=
r another hour, and so on. Why think so much about ME, Sir? If one thinks o=
f god with the same fervor with which you seem to think of me, one may even=
 get moksha!
=A0
Moreover, it may not be a good idea to project one's conte=
mpt for me for a specific thing I did, however well-justified, into all of =
my work.
=A0
Relax and take care Sir.
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha
