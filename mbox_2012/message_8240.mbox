Dear learned members

While I am doing the homam, is it alright for people =
attending the homam to help me keep the lamp burning? One member kept pouri=
ng ghee into the side of the fire so that the fire burns well. She then add=
ed the firewood whenever necessary so that the fire burns brightly. I reall=
y liked this. When I am doing the ceremony without assistance some of my at=
tention is on keeping the fire going. This distracts me from the reciting t=
he mantras.

Towards the end when I do the 3 pradakshinam, should the atten=
ding members of the public also do the same?

Please guide me.
Ranga
