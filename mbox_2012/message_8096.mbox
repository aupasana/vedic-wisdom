Namaste,

Don't worry about harm at all. To understand how mudras work you =
must first understand the basic principle of Tantra which is possibly the w=
orld's greatest psychological framework designed to recreate a new personal=
ity. A mudra works when coupled with visualization and endless practice. Ev=
entually, one day the sync becomes perfect and merely doing the mudra is su=
fficient to invoke some mental responses and create some tangible effects o=
n the outside. So if you just do the mudra without visualization, it may no=
t have any great effect initially. Also it needs LOTS of practice. Harm, no=
. There is very little chance of harm as long as you can maintain a basic a=
ttitude of surrender to the Deity. Everybody will make mistakes in sadhana =
in this age, but a Deity ignores and pardons them easily if you start with =
the basic premise - in your own mind - that you don't know much and you are=
 merely trying to worship.


Yoni Mudra has many variations too. The middle=
 finger cross is central to it. But changes in the other fingers supposedly=
 can produce a basic yoni mudra, sarva-yoni mudra, tri-yoni mudra, a yoni m=
udra for the nava Durga etc. Finally though, it is the visualization accomp=
anying it and focus which are of vital importance. Otherwise it is merely a=
 hand gesture without any effect.

One of the most useful mudras, for any d=
eity, is the Dhenu mudra. It is very auspicious. It can also be used for pu=
rification of the materials. Yoni Mudra, IMHO, is most useful when worshipi=
ng any form of the Goddess. If done properly with requisite focus, showing =
this mudra once can cause an invocation of the Goddess into the fire, even =
before all/any pranpratistha mantras are uttered!

For those interested, th=
ey may try to look up and use some of the following mudra specially while w=
orshipping Her - Dhenu Mudra, Yoni Mudra, Matsa Mudra, Khadga Mudra, Mrigi =
Mudra, Ankusha Mudra, Galini Mudra, Sankha Mudra, etc.

These days knowledg=
e is easy (easily available through books), but application and wisdom of c=
ourse is rare.=C2=A0

Impressive - you have a very keen observation!
=C2=A0
1. Corre=
ct. Crossed little fingers are restrained by the other hand's thumbs. Cross=
ed ring fingers are restrained by the other hand's index fingers. In the mi=
ddle, middle fingers make a reverse V and their side edges touch each other=
 at the top.
=C2=A0
2. This is called Yoni mudra. Yoni literally means the =
female reproductive organ or the source/origin. When you join the two hands=
 in this mudra and create some tension (as though you are keeping something=
 open), it makes it easier to visualize that some energy inside you is comi=
ng out and taking a new birth in a new body (fire, idol, kalasha etc).
=C2=
=A0
3. This can be done whenever visualizing any deity inside your heart en=
tering any object - idol, kalasha, fire etc.
=C2=A0
4. Yes, the palm is sim=
ply turned upside down without any other change from aavaahani mudra.
=C2=
=A0
Now that you mastered the procedure, the next step is to focus on the e=
motion and feeling. Try to develop full faith that god is in the fire in fr=
ont of you and surrender. The depth of that faith can make all the differen=
ce in the world!

Narasimha

Namaste Narasimha Ji 

As I am doing super-short homam I have learned the =
steps well. I now am studying to do the standard homam as described in the =
original manual. Surprising that after studying for 2-3 days the whole proc=
edure seems very easy. I never know it would seem this clear and easy. I gu=
ess once someone learns the basic steps (Anugya, Achamanam, Pranayamam and =
so on) in short then there is divine bliss and soon he can learn them in de=
tails also, without much problem. 

I have learned anganyasa, karanyasa and=
 some other mudras from your Ganapati Homam video and by reading them on th=
e net I have a clear understanding. However I still have some confusions th=
at I couldn't clear up from other sources, hence these questions: 

1) Whil=
e you are saying "Om shri Maha Ganapati Prana-Shaktyai Namah" you are perfo=
rming a mudra. If I understand it correctly, then it is - 

Middle fingers =
join each other. 
Small fingers join thumbs. 
Ring fingers join index finge=
rs. 

Am I right here to understand it? 

2) What is the name of this mudra=
? 

3) Should I perform this same mudra while performing invocation of the =
main deity for other homam also? Such as Sani homam, Lakshmi homam etc. and=
 all others? Or is this mudra for Maha Ganapati homam only? 

4) I understa=
nd all other mudras but when you turn the palm downwards to perform samstha=
pani mudra, are you STILL touching your ring finger's base with thumb's tip=
, like the Avahani mudra? Or are you simply touching your palm with the thu=
mb-tip? Because your thumb is not visible from above. 

Thanks 
Tanvir
