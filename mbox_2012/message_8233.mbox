You had allowed me in the past to place Balis in Havan Kunda when i asked=
 you about that. Thank you for this information that Parshads do not want t=
o accept Bali through fire.

However, there is a technical point here. If h=
avan Kunda is large enough to place Balis on the Base of kunda at prescribe=
d places, it would be probably ok because One does not intend to offer bali=
 in fire.

anyways, I liked the "Pradakshina" idea while placing the Balis =
outside and that seems Ideal if the setup allows to do that. My setup does =
not allow to do me Pradakshina at all.

Regards,

Utpal
