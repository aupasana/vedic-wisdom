Dear Ranga,

We can take some liberties with sattwic sadhanas which are don=
e
without any explicit material desires. They can be done quickly in a
few =
minutes if needed.

A simple but effective Ganapathi homam can be performed=
 in 15 minutes
(starting from achamana). If need be, it can certainly be re=
duced even
more. If it is taking longer, then it just needs some more pract=
ice
until the procedure / mantras become natural.

of 20 seconds to finish the main agnihotra.
> Much more time it would take =
to set up, shower before etc.


IMO, anyone doing meaningful sadhana should=
 be spending more time
doing the sadhana than in the setup portion. Otherwi=
se, something
should probably change.

If someone simply sits down, offers =
three ahutis, and then moves on
... this sadhana probably has no impact wha=
tsoever. If someone can
spend 20 seconds in homam, they can certainly do a =
10 minute homam as
well ... can anyone honestly say otherwise? And a 10-15 =
minute homam
will be 100 or 1000 times more effective than a 20 second homa=
m.

IMO, a 10-15 minute homam is the bare minimum. Why not do a longer 50
m=
inute Ganapati homam on weekends, and a shorter 10-15 minute Ganapati
homam=
 on weekdays?

sasneham,

   ajit
