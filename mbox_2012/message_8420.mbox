Good point .... I'm stuck in hospital working 13 hour shifts at the moment.=
..and with staffing shortages ( as usual), a busy department  and no days o=
ff to compensate next week, it's easy to feel a bit fed up. Trying to remin=
d myself that Nara seva is Narayana seva to keep positive. No homa today (m=
anaged to do one before work yesterday) but Japa is happening at least. 

H=
ope everyone else is having a more relaxed weekend!

Best wishes,

Aparna
