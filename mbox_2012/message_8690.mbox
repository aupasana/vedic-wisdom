If the reality of the world is only an illusion, then why should you
actual=
ly see solid objects in front of you?
"Here is a little illustration. There=
 is a big boulder, a stone. You see
the stone; it is very hard and heavy, a=
nd you can touch it as a solid
object. Bring a sufficiently powerful micros=
cope and look at this stone.
You will find that the stone is a heap of very=
 minute, fly-like,
insect-like entities called molecules. It is a heap of c=
ertain things,
and not one solid object. Bring another, more powerful micro=
scope, more
powerful than the earlier one. Even the molecules will not be s=
een
there. There will be still finer elements looking like almost
non-cogni=
sable particles which are called atoms. Bring a still more
powerful microsc=
ope. You will find that even these little particles melt
into a continuum o=
f energy, or force, which impinges on the energy
centres which are other at=
oms. It looks as if there is one sea of force
everywhere, an indistinguisha=
ble continuum. What has happened to the
stone? Can you say that this sea of=
 force, these atoms, one day thought:
"Let us become a stone"? If the atoms=
 have really become the stone, they
will not be there for you to see throug=
h the microscope. You will
conclude that they have never become the stone.
=
It is only your vision that presents the perception of a solid object.
Thes=
e so-called 'things' =96 molecules, atoms, energy centres, etc.
=96 never b=
ecame the stone. They were never transformed into the
stone. They did not c=
reate the stone. They exist and have always existed
in the same condition a=
s they were when you perceived them through a
powerful perception. The only=
 difference is that in one case our
perception is gross, and in another cas=
e it is subtle and correct. The
stone has not been created, though it is so=
lidly perceivable.
In the same way, the world has not been created, though =
it is visible to
the eyes."
Swami Krishnananda
