Namaste to all,

Let me add a close experience of This Maha-Mantra. One per=
son whom i know quite well since childhood, has affinity to this Mahamantra=
 since his childhood, has learnt it from his Grandfather. Once He came from=
 office late in the night and his Mother told him that certain lady staying=
 in same apartment has been diagnosed with some cancer (don't remember exac=
t nature). He and his mother felt deep sense of pain as well as compassion =
for the lady. they were of low means and family of 3 small children. The pe=
rson felt strong inspiration to ask help from Lord Shiva by reciting Maha-M=
rityunjaya Mantra. He took bath and sat for reciting the same for some time=
. The sense of compassion and appeal with feeling of helplessness was quite=
 deep while he recited the Mantra. As per him, more than concentration on w=
ords of the Mantra, his focus was more on asking for help from Lord Shiva.
=

Call it a good luck or Shiva's Grace or Power of this Mantra or power of P=
rayers from her family or all of that together, the Lady survived and they =
are leading a happy family Life. Do not know exactly what the reasons are b=
ut This Mantra coupled with deep sense of concern at the time of recital ma=
y work wonders! The person thanked Shiva in his heart of hearts.

Salutatio=
n to Lord Shiva! The Auspiciousness personified!
