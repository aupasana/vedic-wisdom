Hi LaxmiNarayanji,

I recently asked a senior monk at the Sivananda Ashra=
m in Rishikesh as to whether it is possible to have Darshan of Narayana i.e=
. see Him in the form described in all our scriptures with 4 arms, holding =
the conch, discus, mace and lotus. I said to him, there are countless stori=
es of devotees having Darshan of their God, is it actually possible today, =
in this day and age?

He said, yes most certainly! But he said Darshan of G=
od means feeling the Divine Presence in yourself, and all things, living an=
d non-living, in every atom, everywhere. This, he said, is Darshan.

I am c=
ontinuing with japa in the hope of one day getting to this stage of feeling=
 the presence of God everywhere at all times. 

However, having said that, =
I have not given up the idea of 'seeing' God (may be with the 'inner eye') =
in the form of Vishnu and Krishna- yes, with mace, discus, flute and all!!
=

The Bhagavatam says that Dhruva, Prahlad, even the elephant king Gajendra =
saw Vishnu....then why not me?!! Of course I'll have to do a lot of japa, a=
 lot of sadhana, remove all negative emotions, become a paragon of virtue (=
Oh god!) but I believe that if I do, it's bound to happen. May take a few l=
ifetimes though (but I'm going to try and do it this time, you've got to tr=
y at least!).

If ulta Rama nama could transform rogue Ratnakar into saint =
Valmiki, and grant him Darshan of Sri Rama, then why cannot Om Namo Narayan=
a convert rogue Aparna into saint Aparna one day and give her Darshan of Vi=
shnu/Krishna....I believe that the mantra can do anything. Anything. We'll =
all be saints one day....ain't got no choice, He'll see to it. :)

Thanks f=
or the message. :)

Aparna

 After all we cannot go to a shop and just buy them. If we are doing sadhan=
