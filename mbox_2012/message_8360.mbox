Hi Aparna, 


>> Love the Tibetan teachings- the Tibetan book of living and=
 dying >> is one of my favourite spiritual books.

Tibetian book of dead is=
 a therma (Greatest tibetian tantrik master Varjraguru Padmasambhava, (on s=
tarting of his career he was HOD at nalanda university, before invasion he =
fled to tibet with his senior students) He had lot of advance teaching that=
 he hid in nature and said that advance students will be able to access it =
when time comes, still some are hidden)

Its a extremely advance stuff for =
bardo states (fine levels of consciousness) one encounters after death. Its=
 supposed to be exercised in meditations by advance students. Its was never=
 meant to be a casual spiritual book, but guess it has become one. That is =
like the last course in Phd.

Buddha taught only one text over 300 times in=
 his life and that was his focus. but sadly its seen as too general and eas=
y. go find this one. :)  (Durgas sense of humor)

There are such texts in I=
ndia also but didnt manage to get a catchy title like "hindu book of dead".=
 In some FB forums there are senior sadhaks who access these bardo sort of =
states like walk in park. I am glad they share their experience, initially =
it felt exciting but then i realized its good only to provide more enthusia=
sm to your main practice.

"stand up and be the change" - wow!!! thats like=
 asking buddha to give a talk to politics. jolly well if buddha agrees to d=
eliver who am i to questions. He is incarnation of Avalokiteshwara "buddha =
of compassion" 

his mantras is - Om mani padme hum 
simple interpretation =
- jewel in lotus (but as with mantras have huge layers of meanings)

(chant=
 in his presense, in case the talk is general/boring)

nice talking to you
=

regards
