"Man IS a soul, and HAS a body. When he properly places his sense of identi=
ty, he leaves behind all compulsive patterns. So long as he remains confuse=
d in his ordinary state of spiritual amnesia, he will know the subtle fette=
rs of environmental law.

"God is harmony; the devotee who attunes himself =
will never perform any action amiss. His activities will be correctly and n=
aturally timed to accord with astrological law. After deep prayer and medit=
ation he is in touch with his divine consciousness; there is no greater pow=
er than that inward protection."

"Then, dear Master, why do you want me to=
 wear an astrological bangle?" I ventured this question after a long silenc=
e, during which I had tried to assimilate Sri Yukteswar's noble exposition.=


"It is only when a traveler has reached his goal that he is justified in =
discarding his maps. During the journey, he takes advantage of any convenie=
nt short cut. The ancient rishis discovered many ways to curtail the period=
 of man's exile in delusion. There are certain mechanical features in the l=
aw of karma which can be skillfully adjusted by the fingers of wisdom.

"Al=
l human ills arise from some transgression of universal law. The scriptures=
 point out that man must satisfy the laws of nature, while not discrediting=
 the divine omnipotence. He should say: 'Lord, I trust in Thee, and know Th=
ou canst help me, but I too will do my best to undo any wrong I have done.'=
 By a number of means;by prayer, by will power, by yoga meditation, by cons=
ultation with saints, by use of astrological bangles;the adverse effects of=
 past wrongs can be minimized or nullified.

"Just as a house can be fitted=
 with a copper rod to absorb the shock of lightning, so the bodily temple c=
an be benefited by various protective measures. Ages ago our yogis discover=
ed that pure metals emit an astral light which is powerfully counteractive =
to negative pulls of the planets. Subtle electrical and magnetic radiations=
 are constantly circulating in the universe; when a man's body is being aid=
ed, he does not know it; when it is being disintegrated, he is still in ign=
orance. Can he do anything about it?

"This problem received attention from=
 our rishis; they found helpful not only a combination of metals, but also =
of plants and;most effective of all;faultless jewels of not less than two c=
arats. The preventive uses of astrology have seldom been seriously studied =
outside of India. One little;known fact is that the proper jewels, metals, =
or plant preparations are valueless unless the required weight is secured, =
and unless these remedial agents are worn next to the skin."
