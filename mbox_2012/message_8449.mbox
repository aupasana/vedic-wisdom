Congratulations!Today is your day.You're off to Great Places!You're off
and=
 away!
You have brains in your head.You have feet in your shoes.You can ste=
er
yourself any direction you choose.You're on your own. And you know what
=
you know.And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.
You'll look up and =
down streets. Look 'em over with care.About some you
will say, "I don't cho=
ose to go there."With your head full of brains and
your shoes full of feet,=
 you're too smart to go down any not-so-good
street.
And you may not find a=
nyyou'll want to go down.In that case, of
course,you'll head straight out o=
f town.
It's opener therein the wide open air.
Out there things can happena=
nd frequently doto people as brainyand
footsy as you.
And then things start=
 to happen,don't worry. Don't stew.Just go right
along.You'll start happeni=
ng too.
OH!THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!
You'll be on y our way up!You'll be seeing=
 great sights!You'll join the
high flierswho soar to high heights.
You won'=
t lag behind, because you'll have the speed.You'll pass the
whole gang and =
you'll soon take the lead.Wherever you fly, you'll be
best of the best.Wher=
ever you go, you will top all the rest.
Except when you don't.Because, some=
times, you won't.
I'm sorry to say sobut, sadly, it's truethat Bang-upsand =
Hang-upscan
happen to you.
You can get all hung upin a prickle-ly perch.And=
 your gang will fly
on.You'll be left in a Lurch.
You'll come down from the=
 Lurchwith an unpleasant bump.And the chances
are, then,that you'll be in a=
 Slump.
And when you're in a Slump,you're not in for much fun.Un-slumping
y=
ourselfis not easily done.
You will come to a place where the streets are n=
ot marked.Some windows
are lighted. But mostly they're darked.A place you c=
ould sprain both
your elbow and chin!Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare t=
o go in?How
much can you lose? How much can you win?
And IF you go in, shou=
ld you turn left or right...or
right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not qui=
te?Or go around back and
sneak in from behind?Simple it's not, I'm afraid y=
ou will find,for a
mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.
You can get so con=
fusedthat you'll start in to racedown long wiggled
roads at a break-necking=
 paceand grind on for miles cross weirdish wild
space,headed, I fear, towar=
d a most useless place.The Waiting Place...
...for people just waiting.Wait=
ing for a train to goor a bus to come, or
a plane to goor the mail to come,=
 or the rain to goor the phone to ring,
or the snow to snowor the waiting a=
round for a Yes or Noor waiting for
their hair to grow.Everyone is just wai=
ting.
Waiting for the fish to biteor waiting for the wind to fly a kiteor
w=
aiting around for Friday nightor waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle
Jakeor a=
 pot to boil, or a Better Breakor a string of pearls, or a pair
of pantsor =
a wig with curls, or Another Chance.Everyone is just waiting.
NO!That's not=
 for you!
Somehow you'll escapeall that waiting and stayingYou'll find the =
bright
placeswhere Boom Bands are playing.
With banner flip-flapping,once m=
ore you'll ride high!Ready for anything
under the sky.Ready because you're =
that kind of a guy!
Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!There=
 are points to be
scored. There are games to be won.And the magical things =
you can do with
that ballwill make you the winning-est winner of all.Fame! =
You'll be as
famous as famous can be,with the whole wide world watching you=
 win on
TV.
Except when they don'tBecause, sometimes they won't.
I'm afraid=
 that some timesyou'll play lonely games too.Games you can't
win'cause you'=
ll play against you.
All Alone!Whether you like it or not,Alone will be som=
ethingyou'll be
quite a lot.
And when you're alone, there's a very good cha=
nceyou'll meet things that
scare you right out of your pants.There are some=
, down the road between
hither and yon,that can scare you so much you won't=
 want to go on.
But on you will gothough the weather be foul.On you will go=
though your
enemies prowl.On you will gothough the Hakken-Kraks howl.Onward=
 up manya
frightening creek,though your arms may get soreand your sneakers =
may
leak.
On and on you will hike,And I know you'll hike farand face up to =
your
problemswhatever they are.
You'll get mixed up, of course,as you alrea=
dy know.You'll get mixed up
with many strange birds as you go.So be sure wh=
en you step.Step with
care and great tactand remember that Life's a Great B=
alancing Act.Just
never foget to be dexterous and deft.And never mix up you=
r right foot
with your left.
And will you succeed?Yes! You will, indeed!(98=
 and 3/4 percent
guaranteed.)
