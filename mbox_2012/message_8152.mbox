Respected PVR, 

Strange are the ways of divine. I logged in after quite so=
me months and saw your reply to my last year questions.

Somewhere down the=
 line i lost momentum of my practice and was searching for outward solution=
s. 

Your answers have given me the clarity to move on my path in a confide=
nt way. 

many thanks to divine mother.

Regards
