hi SSR,

regarding Pariharas,=C2=A0

In Kumbakonam there is a very old famo=
us Temple, Ayyavadi Pratyangira Temple, Devi temple which is very old as th=
ey 2000 years Old,=C2=A0

recently=C2=A0M. Karunanidhi the ex CM of Tamilna=
du and Jayalaitha both did the pariharams during the election period, and J=
aylaitha became the CM, what happened to Karunanidhi, he also did the same =
pariharas as jayalalitha did,=C2=A0

thats why i said leave the result to t=
he Almighty God, if God has to bless he will bless any where the person is,=
=C2=A0

Just pray to God, believe in God, it is not that only in that templ=
e the pariharas will be solved, God will take care as the whole universe be=
longs to him. it is all his Play.

Whether Ramana Maharshi has seen GOD or =
not is important, take his good=C2=A0philosophy and just try to see God.=C2=
=A0

even Ramana maharshi has seen God or not there is no evidence. we take=
 Ramana Maharshi as Guru as he has shown some path to the society, he has n=
ot=C2=A0mislead-ed=C2=A0the devotees. =C2=A0=C2=A0

sathya

=C2=A0 
Then why even trus=
t such priest/ astrologer. I think the question here is NOT about procedure=
, rather credibility of the astrologers. Would you do pariharam as he presc=
ribed!

One of the important things I heard recently from pravachan's was
 =
     DO NOT emulate great souls. Probably 99% of us are not capable of
    =
  seeing GOD every where. There were souls that could live seeing
      GOD=
 in everything. For example, we can not emulate Bhagavan
      Ramana. Howe=
ver this statement "GOD is every where" is a good
      target for us to re=
ach, it takes a one in a million soul to live
      that way.

I do not mea=
n to offend/ undermine anyone's maturity here, however
      it is dangerou=
s to emulate great souls.
