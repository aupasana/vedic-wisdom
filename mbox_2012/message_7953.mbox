Namaste Sir and everyone,

We are trying to prepare a chart to explain to t=
eenagers and children in our place, the hierarchy of God and beings as taug=
ht by hinduism. 

For this, we have parabrahman or the formless God at the =
beginning. Parabrahman takes the 6 forms of higher deities like athi parash=
akti, narayana, shiva, ganapathi, etc as taught by Shankara. Below these we=
 have the trinity representing the trigunas, Brahma-Vishnu-Rudra, who take =
care of the triple task of creation, sustenance and destruction. Below them=
 we have the Gods beginning with Indra and the remaining 33 main devas refe=
renced in the vedas. 

Please advise and correct us if our understanding re=
garding this is proper.

Our further questions which we need some light fro=
m everyone else is:
1) Where do other beings and demigods like Gandharva, Y=
aksha, Kinnaras, Apsaras, feature in the scheme of things in this hierarchy=
. Other than those 4 I mentioned are there other types of beings?

2) Where=
 do Rishis and Manushya feature in the scheme of things in the same hierarc=
hy?

3) How about Pishaachas, and other beings? 

Please offer any informat=
ion you can on this for us.

Pranams,
Anoop.
