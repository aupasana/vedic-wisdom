Ram Ram,
( Play this while reading -----   
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=
=3DIn3XdRxI-kA  )

A couple of points ----->

    * Ghee and the Dry offeri=
ng  ------- Have you ever had a sookhi roti?
That is a prantha without ghee=
? It can satiate your hunger, but you
always know, that something was missi=
ng. A sookha fulka is a little less
joyous to eat than one with ghee. Don't=
 use the word 'dosha' it will
drive people away. It is not a dosha. Mr Agni=
 likes the offering with
ghee, he prefers it that way, but accepts it other=
wise too. Not offering
with ghee does not result in a 'dosha' in the tradit=
ional sense of the
word. See, the person who said that it results in 'dosha=
' might have a
very different definition of this word, to the one that many=
 will
comprehend. For him/her, it might be regular usage for a simple 'faul=
t',
for somebody reading it might be " OMFG, What the hell have I done? I
d=
id a Dosha for so long!!" Oh well, calm down. Even if you committed a
dosha=
, what the hell have you been doing when you are reading that
"anagyatam, y=
adagyatam, yagasya kriyte mithu...." section. You are
apologizing specifica=
lly to Mr Agni, aren't you? Thus you have already
said sorry for this, so n=
ext time onwards, just put a little ghee to
whatever you offer. it helps Mr=
 Agni, to carry it forward or to accept
it depending on the situation, and =
as you are hosting him it is your
paramount duty to take care of him when h=
e comes. He comes and actually
does a favor to you. Revere him, he tolerate=
s our foolishness and
ignorance and does not burn our house/us down in ange=
r  ( very capable
of doing so ), thus help him out and treat him with honor=
. He is a
living being. being hot is his nature, I am not talking about Par=
is
hilton waala "hot" here. An offering with ghee, helps him out when
compa=
red to a dry one, but he still accepts the latter, but prefers the
former.
=

    * Regarding the ratios and everything else ----
A purusha-acharana is =
too complex and requires an extreme amount of
discipline to complete. Conce=
pts detailing to mantra siddhi and all
that, but walk on to these paths whe=
n the basics are there. The best
part is , when the basics are complete, go=
d will automatically graduate
you tot his level, it might take 10 days, or =
10 years, or 10 months, who
the hell knows apart from Mr god a.k.a the form=
 of your god you are
worshiping? Anyone doing a simple homam, like many are=
, need not worry
about the ratios AS OF NOW. If a stage comes later, that y=
ou become
"big" enough to apply some rules to your penance, or maybe you ar=
e
headed down some specific route, and you need to do it as per
instruction=
s from your teacher( god )/ or aadesh from inside, do it. If
you are gettin=
g confused with 10 times then one, or 100 times then one
or what om and wha=
t tarpyami or what swaha..... chuck it. Just offer the
mantra in the fire, =
with utter sincerity and forget that you ever
offered too. If you are to be=
 taken on a path that requires the ratios,
you will be taken, no issues. Ti=
ll then, keep offering the single
repetition just like, you are now. Unless=
 and until, significant penance
is done, theory about ratios and how it all=
 works, will go over our
heads, and confuse even further. It is useless to =
discuss it, will only
give rise to more debates and confusion galore. Spend=
 time chanting
instead.

    * One more pointer, since I think I read somew=
here as to how we can
improve our homams. Offer any thing to the fire with =
love, I sometimes
notice, people throwing stuff in, or maybe due to the fea=
r of getting
burnt, pulling the hand away extremely quickly. Remember you a=
re feeding
someone, and that someone is an extremely ALIVE being, the one w=
ho sits
in front of you and makes you sweat. You ever notice how a mother f=
eeds
her child bites of food, even though the fingers are always at risk of=

getting bitten and coming back with a coat of gooey saliva? Thore se
pyaar=
 se, feed Mr Agni, he will appreciate it. He always does. Maybe you
can mod=
ify your hand movement and integrate some grace in the way an
offering is m=
ade, doesn't matter even if it is made from a distance. It
can take some ti=
me getting used to, practice makes perfect!
    * A sub pointer in improvin=
g your homam is the appreciation of the
fact of the suffering of the offeri=
ng! Bow down to your golas , the tils
, the mithai,  the ghee, "spiritual p=
rogress tumhaari, jalegi humari"
seems to be the chant from whatever you ar=
e offering!! LOL . Mind you,
somebody is jumping straight in to Mr agni's m=
outh on your behest, the
gola nariyaal you so gladly cut inside out, ouch t=
he pain!! Because
those too are manifestations of the same divine and their=
 sacrifice is
supreme, thus bow down and sincerely thank god for manifestin=
g and
providing you the material to do this wonderful ritual.
