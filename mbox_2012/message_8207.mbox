If you do not understand the mantras you are reciting, your efforts are was=
te, and even wrong pronunciation is very dangerous. Homa is not like reciti=
ng another mantra, it has to be according to the rules. Our elders were not=
 fools to believe in rules that were meaningless, so these rules have a mea=
ning, one should respect these rules.... In the airforce, you need to have =
great experience flying a sports/small aircraft, understand it properly, be=
fore you can even put your hands on a fighter.. I hope the meaning goes del=
ivered.....
