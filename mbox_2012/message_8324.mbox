Dear Priyank,

These three attitudes that you have named are for any sadhan=
a, not just Tantra. Even so called Vedic Sadhanas are often done for materi=
al gains. Recall how most of the Sanskrit stotras of various deities contai=
n a phalastuti (the expected results), is that not material gain? Doing a M=
ahamrityunjaya Mantra for health benefits, isn't that a material gain? It i=
s not the path, but the attitude of the sadhaka which determines for what h=
e/she is performing a certain sadhana.


Yogis and/or those who do sadhana =
using 'Vedic' tools also acquire siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can =
come as a byproduct of the path. The problem is not with siddhis per se, it=
 is with misusing them or commercializing them or hanging on to them. Any s=
adhaka who can gain a siddhi, can also let go of that siddhi whenever he/sh=
e wants. 


Speaking of Karma, everything has a karma of it's own. Tantra, =
as it stands today, is roughly divided into two major geographic and philos=
ophical demarcations. The style practiced in South India - mostly Dakshina =
Margi - and that practiced in Bengal and adjacent areas - mostly Vama Margi=
. In my personal opinion, the adherents of the path in both cases, generall=
y speaking, have been trapped in two delusions born out of collateral bypro=
ducts of their respective paths. The first step of Shakti sadhana is genera=
ting shakti. Second step is holding the shakti. Third step is channeling th=
e shakti. In view of this, one school of Tantra that is prevalent today has=
 tied itself up in too much of technicalities, such that on an average they=
 forget to capture shakti (here shakti means energy, not Shakti the supreme=
 Goddess). WHile the other school is able to generate and hold shakti much =
better, only to commercialize the same and/or misuse it (generally speaking=
,
 expcetions are there too). End result, both eventually do not end up pro=
ducing enough genuine Tantrik saints.

<<

A fair excha=
nge is never a robbery, as Vimalananda says. Theoretically, when the *right=
 person* performs many of the things mentioned in that blog, (and some of t=
he stuff there is not exactly accurately portrayed), he/she will know how t=

Hello all, 

I have been following some tantra groups and in tantra there=
 seems to be 3 attitudes. 

1. IShta sadhana - complete surrender
2. Siddhi=
 sadhana - for gaining specific siddhi (part bhog part moksha)

3. Material=
 sadhana - related to bhog part of life. you do this specifically for the r=
esult you want. here there are sadhanas right from kuber sadhanas to apsara=
/urvashi to making pact with lot of entities (from ghosts to whatnot).

i a=
m wondering "if at all" and "what kind" of karmic liabilities one might be =
getting into ?
