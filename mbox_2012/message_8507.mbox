Hello LaxmiNarayanji,

I'm sorry to hear you are having health problems and=
 suffering pain. They say God gives troubles like illnesses as a blessing t=
o those He loves a lot so they remember Him, and attain Him quickly. But I =
know from my own experience of terrible head-splitting migraines that it is=
 not easy to appreciate this type of His 'help' without grumbling a little =
(or a lot as in my case!). 

While saying the Mahamrityunjaya mantra, I wis=
h you a speedy recovery and restoration of your good health.   

Best wishe=
s,

Aparna
