JAI MAA,

A dressed up child in her mother's clothes.

I sometimes ask mys=
elf, `Why do I write; what's the point? Is it simply a self-indulgent past =
time that I should put aside for more important things?' Why am I doing thi=
s when no one is ready to listen to my CRY and longing for my MAHADEV. All =
they want is their family, their children, knee pain, stomach pain, marriag=
e, children, money =85the list is endless. Is the ego flaring up its ugly h=
ead =96 causing me to face my inner demons and doubts, to face my fears and=
 stories. I can see it - my alter ego, the other me that likes colors, laug=
hter and light just like a dressed up child in her mother's clothes.

So th=
is is my check up time with my mother - I am asking her all these questions=
 - why exactly is she making me spend time on certain things ( clearly the =
ego does too) =96 be it writing, reading, eating, running, watching tv, com=
plaining, working etc=85 Or should I even be asking HER this question. A pa=
rt of me says if I don't ask my mother then who can I ask. Who will hold me=
 in her lap and make sure I walk in all three or four stages, thinking of h=
er only , waking sleeping and meditating.

Why do I write? I write to allow=
 my inner thoughts to unfold, release, and be free, the bottleneck that app=
ears because of my love for HER once I purge, SHE appears. I purge my self =
and share my connection with HER with all of you.  HERE I am hiding in a co=
rner but I can reveal my deep thoughts to you Unlimited by the doubt that t=
akes over when I try to express my thoughts through the limits of sound, th=
roat, time and voice=85. My insecurities are unfettered by the written word=
, less restricted than my throat and uncertain, meek voice. I write to upli=
ft, I write to uplift, I write to sing her beauty, and I write to allow for=
 space and freedom. 

Then I know that this is where I need to spend my tim=
e =96 it is not self-absorbed, it is self-giving and in turn self-receiving=
=85 The more I give the more I get from HER, that is what keeps me going fo=
r more. This is my gift of love to all; that which inspires and creates spa=
ce for my true self. I write to open up my heart and when my heart needs to=
 shut down the sadness, the uncertainty; I write. I write to clear space in=
 my mind for the bank of inspired ideas that seem to have no end =96 space =
created in order for my mind not to shut down in protest, exhaustion =96 to=
 prevent it from saying there is no more room at the inn, no more deposits =
to be made, I am full up. Purging the ideas and thoughts from my heart and =
soul=85 creating room for breathe, for clarity =96 allowing more inspired e=
nergy to flow through me =96 I am simply the vessel, these ideas are not un=
ique to me, I am merely the channel through which they flow. These words ha=
ve been written over and over again.  

I write because then I am able to S=
HARE HER with you, at times I do not wish to share I am good at it and terr=
ible, all in one, broken sentence. Because at times I have so much to say t=
hat it overwhelms me.  I write my own emotions scare me =96 I feel the need=
 to share this minor and major insights/truths/revelation that I have appea=
red in front of me. I write because then SHE splendor becomes clear to me. =
I see HER appear in front of me through these words.

THEN SHE SAYS TO ME -=
 keep going, walk you must and walk alone. She says - keep going =96 yin an=
d yang balance in your life, forcing the self-assuredness that at times wav=
ers. SHIV SHIV SHIV. Let go of fear and take a hold of your life =96 you ar=
e the one responsible, no one else.  My SHIV has created a space with me wh=
ere no one resides but HIM. MY SHIV Allow me to go home, guide me to my hom=
e.

Om
