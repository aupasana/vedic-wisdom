Dear learned members

I have been doing Ganapathi homam once a week. I find=
 it difficult to  spare time (nearly 50 minutes) to do itmore often.

Of la=
te I have been reading up about Agnihotra. Once source says to do Agnihotra=
 at sunrise and sunset with the mantras uttered ONLY once each:

1. Sury=E1=
ya Sw=E1h=E1
Sury=E1ya Idam Na Mama (offer ghee and uncooked rice in the fi=
re).

2. Praj=E1pataye Sw=E1h=E1 
Praj=E1pataye Idam Na Mama (offer ghee an=
d uncooked rice in the fire).

This should take all of 20 seconds to finish=
 the main agnihotra. Much more time it would take to set up, shower before =
etc.

My intention is to do Ganapathi homam on the weekends and Agnihotra a=
s above weekdays.

Am I getting this right? Learned members, please help me=
 get it right so that I can do it right.

Thanks for your advice
Ranga
