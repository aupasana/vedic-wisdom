Nope. Arjuna was not a Jivan muktha or even vidEha muktha that life. One =
tradition states that Arjuna re-incarnated as Kannappa (Bhakta Kannappa) wh=
o becomes a devotee of Shiva (remember that in Mahabharat itself the seed f=
or this was sown in an episode that Arjuna and Shiva fight for a wild boar =
they hunted). It is in that Kannappa life that he attains to mukti at srI k=
ALahasti. In Kurukshetra war, Arjuna arrives at a certain state of uncondit=
ioned awareness or consciousness due to the dilemma and circumstances of th=
e war and Krishna utilized that receptivity(arising out of utter helplessne=
ss and hence willingness to surrender) to give him glimpses of the Virat sw=
arupam. You can liken the viswaroopam event to Ramakrishna making Narendra =
experience divinity by placing his feet on the chest. 

I think Narasimha g=
Aru's second post on jIvan mukta was relatively straight and clear on the c=
oncept. The other points I'll add is that action done by tri-karanas do res=
ult in consequence(s) to the doer (as long as the action was done while doe=
r holds conditioned identity). All this accumulates in the sanchita (wareho=
use) of the doer and a portion of it gets allotted as prarabdha for a given=
 life. This prarabdha one has to experience whether they are liberated or n=
ot. Removal of conditioning does drop the entire Sanchita (breaks the threa=
d that is holding the Sanchita to the being) but prarabdha itself holds as =
this was already allotted and in itself is the primary cause for the embodi=
ed life of that being. If you drop prarabdha you drop the body and hence li=
fe too. Because that karmic structure is what glues the jIva and the sarIra=
. A jIvan mukta had dropped all conditioning and hence his bondages to all =
sanchita is gone. No new bondage is established for newer actions (agAmi) b=
ecause the actions now are not conditioned by any kind of ignorance(mAya). =
These actions themselves can have consequences but they are not tied to him=
 and hence not attached/directed at him. They 'can' even attack their prAra=
bdha to alter it if neeeded, but as they had already become pure witnesses =
than agenda driven conditioned individuals, they generally don't get into t=
hat and experience all of their prarabdha to let it burn naturally. They al=
so have capabilities to create and accumulate 'conscious and measured quant=
ity and quality of sanchita' to be available as prarabdha for a future life=
, if they intend to re-incarnate. However, whether the 'veil of mAya' was p=
ut consciously by oneself or was eternally present as we forgot that we put=
 it ourselves, as long as the veil is on us there will be an amount of cond=
itioning and ignorance. The main difference is that just as a man who puts =
a veil on his face sees blurred but is fully aware that he can anytime lift=
 the veil at his own will to see through clearly, a re-incarnated avatAra a=
lso knows that the veil of mAya was put on for a purpose and can be dropped=
 once the purpose is served. The case of rest of us is that of a man who pu=
t the veil a long time ago but totally forgot about that i.e. a) that the v=
eil exists and is interfering with his vision and b) that the veil was put =
by himself and it is within his own control to remove it. Hence we do all s=
adhana to recognize that distinction between the veil and ourselves and thu=
s drop the veil.
