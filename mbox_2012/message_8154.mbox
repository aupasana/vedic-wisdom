=C2=A0 
Namaste Narasimhaji,

I =
feel blessed to have chanced upon this yahoo group! For the last couple of =
years, I have witnessed a gradual yet strong inclination towards spirituali=
ty, religion, rituals, yoga, ayurveda and jyotish. I have been reading a lo=
t about them, mostly via the internet, some readings more helpful than othe=
rs, but each drawing me closer towards learning more and understanding bett=
er. A lot of what I read here, in this yahoo-group, is one of the most luci=
d explanation of spirituality, and the final goal of every saadhana, and th=
e link between spirituality and rituals, yoga, ayurveda, and leading a simp=
le and humble life.

I have downloaded the book compiled from your writings=
 on spiritual matters and I am in the process of reading that as well, and =
derive great happiness in reading it. I also visited your website and saw a=
 wealth of material for spiritually inclined people there. The manuals on d=
o-it-yourself homams are one of your outstanding contributions to society, =
and shine brightly among the other gems of your contributions. I feel an in=
clination towards performing homams on a daily/weekly basis. Before I start=
 this, I want to seek your guidance on the following:

1. Do I need to prep=
are myself in any way before I start the homam?- I will explain to you what=
 I mean here - since you have suggested that one start with MahaGanapathi h=
omam, I shall start with it too. However, as I have been worshipping DeviMa=
 every morning and Hanumanji every evening, do I need to start worshipping =
MahaGanapathi now for a few days during mornings and evenings and then afte=
r a few days, start with the homam?

2. Related to the first question, as I=
 have been worshipping DeviMa for quite sometime now, I see/visualize Her m=
any times during the day (at work/home), so now when I start with the MahaG=
anapathi homam with complete faith, devotion, and surrender to MahaGanapath=
i, wouldn't there be a conflict in my mind, since I may still be visualizin=
g DeviMa everywhere around me (due to mind's conditioning), while I am wors=
hipping MahaGanapathi as the One who is the source, cradle and end of every=
thing, and hence shoule be visualizing Him instead? This may be a hypotheti=
cal situation, as I am talking about the future, however, may still be rele=
vant, and so I seek your advice here.

3. As I am householder, and we are e=
xpecting our first child in the next few months, is it ok to perform a homa=
m at home? It may sound jouvenile but I don't know any better, and would ra=
ther listen to wiser men. The reason I ask this is that while doing the hom=
am, we chant various mantras/stotras, and they produce effects in the immed=
iate environment, specially in the presence of Agni, the Pavaka. Although, =
the goal of my saadhana is to decondition my mimd to move towards greater p=
urity, humility and peace, and I have faith that a regular homam will enabl=
e me to achieve that. However, for the sake of my wife and our child (insid=
e her womb), I am prompted to ask this question. Please don't take it in an=
y other way except as a genuine concern for my family (however silly it is)=


4. Related to the above question, if it is fine for me to do the homam at=
 home, then can my pregnant wife also participate in it, if she wants to?

=
5. Should I wait for an auspicious day like an amavasya or an eclipse to st=
art the homam, or is any day fine? Similarly, should I do the homam at a pa=
rticular time every day or is any time fine? I do understand that doing the=
 homam/any saadhana at the same time everyday, whatever time one does it, i=
s more beneficial than doing it at different times.

6. Is it better to do =
the homam at home or can it be done elsewhere as well? The reason I ask thi=
s is we are living in a rented accomodation and the smoke from the homam ma=
y blacken the walls and the ceiling. However, in our residential/apartment =
complex, there is a common area, which is open on two sides, where some com=
munity festivals are celebrated together, and if I get the permission, then=
 maybe I can do the homam there? Is there a strong reason/added benefit to =
doing the homam at home?

Narasimhaji, I will be very grateful to you for y=
our answers to the above questions.

You are rendering a great service to t=
oday's society and we pray to DeviMa to keep showing you the way.

Thank yo=
u for sharing so much!

Humble regards,
Vipin
