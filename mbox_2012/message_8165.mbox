Hi all,

I have a question. I consulted an astrologer. He told me to do par=
iharimam in navaghara temple @ kumbakonam. He added, that when i do going t=
o a temple to do pariharimam, then i must visit only that temple and come b=
ack to home.

I asked that i need to see few other temple in kumbakonam. Th=
e astrologer said i may visit the non-pariharimam temple first and finally =
go to the pariharimam temple and should not go to any other temple after th=
at....

My question is - I want to go to other temple in kumbakonam, after =
the pariharimam temple - where pariharimam is done. But the local astrologe=
rs say that no other temple should be visited after pariharimam temple.

It=
s god every where, why is the difference=A0

regards,

Ganesh
