 It is a decision that has tremendous health, political, environmental and =
spiritual implications. Vegetarianism is a choice to live your life to the =
utmost ethical degree. In this amazing video, one of the world's most quali=
fied and authentic Dharma teachers explains the benefits of vegetarianism w=
ith more clarity and depth than has ever been witnessed before. Sri Dharma =
Pravartaka Acharya reveals the deepest truths about vegetarianism in his fa=
mously celebrated style of no-nonsense logic, loving frankness, and strikin=
g honesty. If you are interested in exploring vegetarianism, or even if you=
 have been vegetarian for years, be prepared to learn more about this ancie=
nt practice than you have ever known possible.
