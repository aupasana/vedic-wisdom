Precisely. Carry your own food or eat only at vegetarian restaurants. To be=
 safe, alway ask for vegan food; in fact, I prefer to go to Indian restaura=
nts when I visit US and ask for Jain food as that is the easiest way you ca=
n get no onion, no garlic vegetarian food. 
As for the mistake, it is done =
and whether it is a sin or not, none of us will be able to judge. All one c=
an do is move on.


regards
Prasad
