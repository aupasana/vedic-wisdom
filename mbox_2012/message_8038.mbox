Dear Narasimha ji, 

Namaste.

Thanks for your guidance.

I went to the old=
 part of the town where such items are available and collected clay pots, c=
lay lamp, ghee, sesame oil, camphor, etc. The kunda is not available here, =
I live in Bangladesh and the tradition of homam is lost, so to say. I will =
perhaps get the kunda made through an order and start performing homam soon=
. I am very much interested to make homam a part of my life as I have made =
mantras.

I find your teachings very true regarding the frequency of homam/=
mantras. I have been doing mantras for 7-8 years now and see that without d=
oing it regularly, it is not possible to maintain the energy created. Also =
what you taught about the power of homam is very true, that it is a lot mor=
e stronger than mantra. I can say this because I had the opportunity to tak=
e part in a homam while staying in Maharashtra with a Brahmin family.

I ha=
ve just a few more questions though -

1) You have mentioned about kumkum/v=
ermillion. I am not sure what it means. I searched quite a lot here and the=
y sale kumkum as a dense liquid used for women's make up, applied with a sm=
all brush. No kumkum is available in powder form anywhere. I looked up in l=
ocal dictionary and it says 'vermillion' means 'sindoor'... which married H=
indu ladies apply above forehead, in the middle, just inside their hair bor=
der. So I just bought the 'sindoor' powder. Is it the right thing?

2) By t=
urmeric powder, did you mean the same turmeric powder that is used in cooki=
ng? Can I simply use that?

3) Is it compulsory to draw the two parallel re=
d lines with kumkum to connect homam kunda with my seat? I ask this silly q=
uestion because I am planning to arrange a mat on the floor and do homam ov=
er it.

4) An important question I forgot to ask. How do I count the no. of=
 repetition of mantras in 'Pradhana Homam', esp if I repeat 108 times? Can =
I keep counting with my left fingers while offering ahutis with right hand?=
 I mean, each finger is divided into three parts so counting the two border=
s and the base and the top of the finger, each finger can be used to count =
4 (four). Can I count this way, or there are some other 'pure' ways in trad=
ition to count the repetition?

Thanks
Tanvir
