Dear Rajarshi,

You really need to not make your stand clear on Shankara:

=
[[[[To make my stand clearer, let me say hypothetically that IF by some str=
ange miracle of God, Sri Adi Shankara were to come and stand infornt of me,=
 I would have no qualms about falling at his feet and bowing down to him an=
d asking for his blessings, for his spiritual stature is unquestionable. Ye=
t I will still not be agreeable to the philosophy he propagated during the =
time he lived.]
]]]

At least I knew that from the previous messages in thi=
s chain. Even I have similar view point when I may not be able to appreciat=
e somebody's philosophy and yet have love, respect for him/her.
***
Please =
forgive me as I have aversion to write elaborately now a days and it has be=
en my experience and understanding lately that even a good Sadhaka and a pe=
rson of sharp intelligence tend to misunderstand what is written and derive=
 quite a different meaning and impressions.
""Yes! Many things cannot be su=
fficiently expressed in words without causing some distortion"" and this "s=
ome" distortion is capable of creating large misunderstandings.
Things can =
be relatively better when two individual, interested in such subjects, disc=
usses such things in person with open-mindedness and ready to appreciate ea=
ch other's view point.
***
[[Yet I will still not be agreeable to the philo=
sophy he propagated during the time he lived........
However, to understand=
, appreciate, criticize, debate, analyses, comparatively-evaluate any philo=
sophy of any individual is not that difficult and is a valid rational proce=
ss
]]
With the same philosophy, Sanatan Dharma was saved in those times and=
 all philosophers, without exceptions, were defeated in debates. here again=
, please do not think that because of his intellectual exploits, his victor=
y in debates, his philosophy stands automatically correct. However, that is=
 also very reason that his philosophy of Adwaita (call it a Mayavaad) must =
have some absolute Truth which proved undefeatable in debates by all high a=
nd mighty of those times.

***
[[[Philosophy is pure rational thought. Spir=
ituality on the other hand is experiential. One can sit in an armchair and =
contemplate on philosophy, but the same is not possible in case of spiritua=
lity. These two are different. Philosophy gives a logical framework of unde=
rstanding something. There could be philosophy of science, a philosophy of =
ethics, a philosophy of spirituality, a philosophy of epistemology (the inv=
estigations into the process of acquiring knowledge) etc.]]]

Yes! I tend t=
o agree what you said here but i would draw your attention to the thing you=
 correctly mentioned "a philosophy of spirituality". and in case of Shankar=
a, what we are pointing towards is the very philosophy of spirituality. Phi=
losophy of Shankara was meant for foundation, of which, targeted goal was e=
volvement of Spirituality in one and precisely, that is the reason why we a=
ll normally have much more love and respects for the Philosophers of Spirit=
uality such as Adi Shankara, Swami Vivekananda, Aurobindo, Vallabhacharya, =
Vimalananda, Lord Shri Krishna, Maharshi Vasishtha, Maharshi Ramana and so =
on.

***
[[[> While future is always uncertain, but chances look remote for=
 me that I would find Mayavada more attractive. It was Sri Adi Shankara's M=
ayavada..........

I have a personal view about judging philosophy. For eve=
rything that one giant has said, there is always another one who has said e=
xactly the opposite. And a third and forth one who came up with a different=
 view-point, differing with all the previous ones. And each of these giants=
 have spoken with the utmost conviction of their own realizations of truths=
. ]]]

I have read his vivekachudamani some 4 years back. Core Message of S=
hankara's vivekachudamani and Maharshi Vasishtha's teachings to Lord Rama i=
s identical IMVHO. "The phenomenon called world never existed. it never cam=
e in to existence".

To be true to myself, I am personally not attracted to=
 such thing because for most of us it is highly unpalatable from our standp=
oint and hence not attractive or inspiring. What inspires me is a Ramakrish=
na where all philosophies merge without facing unjustified Rejection and in=
 whose teachings, all the philosophies get their rightful and deserving app=
reciation.
when people start repeating like a parrot, THAT half verse of Sh=
ankara and say "Brahman Satya Jaganmithya" , The pseudo Vedanta develops wi=
th utterly foolish ideas. however, when a person like Swami Vivekananda cor=
rectly understands what was meant by Adi Shankara and such few real greats =
of Vedanta, can rightly explain its usefulness to the world and what become=
s very palatable to us as practical vedanta. This is not to start discussin=
g pros and cons of various philosophies, but to make it a point that philos=
ophies of a Shankara or a Madhavacharya or a Vallabhacharya or anybody else=
 can be rejected purely on the ground of unattrectiveness, un-inspiring, un=
palatable, going over the top and such reasons but the attitude to reject t=
hem as a false or mistaken must be avoided and I DO NOT SAY THAT YOU CARRY =
SUCH ATTITUDE. I AM SURE YOU DO NOT.
Especially i would single out philospo=
hy of Adi Shankara because as i said earlier, that in intellectual debates,=
 the same philosophy proved to be victorious and that is on records. It was=
 not a pure spirituality, It was Philosophy which was debated then. This is=
 probably the only recorded example in History where in a Spiritual philoso=
phy was debated in a vast region and accepted by all peers.
I am not trying=
 to hard sale Adi Shankara here. who am I? just to put some thoughts as the=
y are coming to me.    

***
I wrote a big message by my standards :) and s=
till feel that there are so many thoughts i could not write and even the on=
e which I wrote, it could have written much better.

Best Regards,

Utpal

 In the Mahabharata, there is an incident which comes later on, after the g=

it, but not necessary that everyone else will also benefit. There are so ma=

 Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstood the depth of his teachings=
. Both their love and their hatred is a function of their own egos, like it=
 was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any genuine understanding or apprec=

 you can disagree with someone without losing respect or love for the perso=
n, in an objective manner, you reap very little karmic effects. That is why=
 Lord Krishna too advices us to become more detached in life.

 complicated.

ur theory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times when certain p=

 is uttering is=C3=82=C2=A0complete truth, when in fact it is=C3=82=C2=A0fa=
r from truth. Once=C3=82=C2=A0I saw in a article that Aurobindo said that D=
