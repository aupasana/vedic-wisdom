Namaste BhaiO aur BahenO,

Wish to point towards important Astrological fac=
tor.

Very noteworthy coincidence is happening. Tomorrow is Magha Pournima =
and Narasimha Garu has produced Satyanarayan Pujan Manual. He has chosen a =
very very significant time period.
SHANI DEVATA is extremely powerful ongoi=
ng few days. HE is especially strong tomorrow due to absolutely Stationary =
in exaltation Sign  (akin to Meditating & about to start retrograde motion)=
 while despositor Shukra has also entered its own exalted Sign.

Please use=
 tomorrow for starting any Serious Sadhana. It will go a long way for spiri=
tual development of Sadhaka. Appeal is out of my personal intuition. Do not=
 miss this one.

Sincerely,

Utpal
