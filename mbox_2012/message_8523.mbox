 Many people say that they don't believe in any religion. However, on
takin=
g a closer look, we can see that there is no one in this world who
does not=
 believe in religion.

To those who say that they don't believe in any reli=
gion, I would like to
ask, don't they believe in the body's religion of eat=
ing, drinking,
sleeping and evacuating? Don't they believe in the religion =
of the mind?
They may say that they don't believe in the religion of the so=
ul.

How can they believe in it? They don't even know what it is. However, =
don't
they want to live forever? Do they want to remain fools? Don't they w=
ant
knowledge? Don't they want happiness?

This is called sat, cit and anan=
da in the language of the scriptures. To
desire sat-cit-ananda and to serve=
 Him is the religion of the soul. Living
beings, parts of the marginal pote=
ncy of the all-powerful Supreme Lord, are
also atomic sat-cit-ananda while =
the Supreme Lord is infinite
sat-cit-ananda.

So, whether directly or indir=
ectly, everyone desires the sat-cit-ananda
Supreme Lord. Those who call the=
mselves atheists do not know that they also
desire to attain sat-cit-ananda=
. However, it will be impossible to attain
sat, cit and complete ananda on =
the path that they are following.
