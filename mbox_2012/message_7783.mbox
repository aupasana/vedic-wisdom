Hello Shankar, 

Please search for Older posts on Fasting, Some good tips a=
nd insights were mentioned. 

Summing my experience, Start with Fruits, mil=
k, Fasting food (non-grain simple dishes, sabudana kichdi, Aloo sabzi with =
puri of "Singada/Kutu Flour" ). These are all simple foods that are digeste=
d by body easily. 

Plan your meals for fasting day in advance, so that you=
 know your options beforehand.

Know your auyvedic body type, Like vata bod=
y type gets disturbed a lot. I am vata and simply could not tolerate comple=
te fast (even fruit only diet). I stick to simple food now and increased de=
votion/prayer on these special days.

Main thing on Ekadashi, Pradosha, Poo=
rnima is what you put in your mind and heart not just in your body. 

For "=
reduce weight" Increase your metabolism Walking daily. read some ayurvedic =
tips on webs. 

One of my relatives went from being a fat 40yr old to looki=
ng absolute stud of 25yr. He eats smaller portion every 3/4hrs. Initially E=
ats 3/4 stomach only (absolutely no overstuffing). Last meal he takes at 7-=
8pm. 

hope it helps

regards
priyank
