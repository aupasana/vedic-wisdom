=C2=A0 
Mr Gaurav,

To answer your question of "why chandi is feared and wh=
y should we fear our own mother?"

Lets say, I come into your house, and br=
eak everything down in front of you. All the things you loved, all the thin=
gs you claimed to be yours, I take them and tear everything apart. I burn y=
our IIIT degree in front of you, and leave no trace of your very claim to b=
e from IIIT.

I take your real estate papers and feed it to the dogs.

And =
then lets say I take your arm in my hand , and cut it off. And then I take =
the other and I cut it off. Then I take the blood that is pouring out and D=
rink it, while you are still alive. And then I grab the back of your head a=
nd slash it off. 

And this all happens on one fine Sunday morning without =
warning.

Mr. Tripathi, I abolish all that is "Gaurav Tripathi" in your lif=
e, and make you realize who you truly are and merge your tiny blob of light=
 into the infinite light that is me, and I'll do it in the manner described=
 above, are you willing to love me??
Are you willing to call me in your hom=
e??
Are you willing to wash my feet and drink the water??

Your eyes percei=
ve that I have slashed your arms off, but in reality I have taken your karm=
as off, isn't that the best thing?

Your eyes perceive that I have destroye=
d everything that you ever had, but what did you bring in the world when yo=
u were born?? Thus, by apparently destroying what you claim to be yours, ha=
ven't I broken an illusion of yours??

Your eyes perceive your death, but i=
n reality i am just taking my baby back whom i love.

The more attached you=
 are to the false notion of "you", the more fierce she appears. But if afte=
r doing strenuous penance, you realize that "oh my gawd, all my life I have=
 been identifying with this and that, and that and this.", then she will ap=
pear to be the most loveliest being out there. Easy to type and easy to rea=
d, difficult to be at this stage.

Who says you are to fear your own mother=
? If you truly surrender to your mother then she can do anything with your =
existence, right? After all she is your mother. 

This is why they say be c=
areful while saying I surrender and do anything god but I only want you. Be=
 prepared then to do "anything".

Anyways keep on doing penance, its the on=
ly purpose of this birth.

Jai girnari!!!

Warm Regards,
Nobody

      <div>Mr Gaurav,<br>
<br>
To an=
swer your question of "why chandi is feared and why should we fear our own =
mother?"<br>
<br>
Lets say, I come into your house, and break everything do=
wn in front of you. All the things you loved, all the things you claimed to=
 be yours, I take them and tear everything apart. I burn your IIIT degree i=
n front of you, and leave no trace of your very claim to be from IIIT.<br>
=
<br>
I take your real estate papers and feed it to the dogs.<br>
<br>
And t=
hen lets say I take your arm in my hand , and cut it off. And then I take t=
he other and I cut it off. Then I take the blood that is pouring out and Dr=
ink it, while you are still alive. And then I grab the back of your head an=
d slash it off. <br>
<br>
And this all happens on one fine Sunday morning w=
ithout warning.<br>
<br>
Mr. Tripathi, I abolish all that is "Gaurav Tripat=
hi" in your life, and make you realize who you truly are and merge your tin=
y blob of light into the infinite light that is me, and I'll do it in the m=
anner described above, are you willing to love me??<br>
Are you willing to =
call me in your home??<br>
Are you willing to wash my feet and drink the wa=
ter??<br>
<br>
Your eyes perceive that I have slashed your arms off, but in=
 reality I have taken your karmas off, isn't that the best thing?<br>
<br>
=
Your eyes perceive that I have destroyed everything that you ever had, but =
what did you bring in the world when you were born?? Thus, by apparently de=
stroying what you claim to be yours, haven't I broken an illusion of yours?=
?<br>
<br>
Your eyes perceive your death, but in reality i am just taking m=
y baby back whom i love.<br>
<br>
The more attached you are to the false no=
tion of "you", the more fierce she appears. But if after doing strenuous pe=
nance, you realize that "oh my gawd, all my life I have been identifying wi=
th this and that, and that and this.", then she will appear to be the most =
loveliest being out there. Easy to type and easy to read, difficult to be a=
t this stage.<br>
<br>
Who says you are to fear your own mother? If you tru=
ly surrender to your mother then she can do anything with your existence, r=
ight? After all she is your mother. <br>
<br>
This is why they say be caref=
ul while saying I surrender and do anything god but I only want you. Be pre=
pared then to do "anything".<br>
<br>
Anyways keep on doing penance, its th=
e only purpose of this birth.<br>
<br>
Jai girnari!!!<br>

Warm Regards=

If you have a dharmik material result in mind (e.g. marriage, childbirth, g=

gt; Chandi is a highly fierce deity. Her slaying of Mahisha, Nishumbha, Shu=
mbha etc symbolize slaying one's pride (over one's achievements), one's mam=

ta or I-am-ness (the very notion that one exists as a being separate from B=
rahman) etc. As anyone trying to overcome those will know, it is not an eas=
