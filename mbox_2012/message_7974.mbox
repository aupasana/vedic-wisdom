Dear all and Greetings of the day!!

I am posting a question for discussion=
 in this group regarding MOKSHA.
Is the mere presence of Ketu and Jupiter i=
n 12 house leads to attainment of Moksha? 
If ketu signifies Moksha ,then a=
 person with 1 st house ketu is restarting his cycle of births and rebirths=
 on this mother earth after completing one cycle ? Is it, he/she was in a d=
ifferent yoni in his previous birth and now in this birth he is homo sapien=
s or is he an incarnation of that families ancestors whose soul is still wa=
ndering ?

OM SHANTHI!SHANTHI!SHANTHI!OM
