Dear Utpal,

I am a beginner in shastras, but happen to have access to a go=
od
collection of books. An online searcheable version of the rig veda &
kri=
shna yajur veda is available from http://sanskritweb.net. If you
search the=
 taittiriya brahmana, you will find references to puNya and
pApa.

In gener=
al, saying that "xyz" is not found in the vedas is not
something to be take=
n lightly. Just a small fraction of the various
branches of veda are availa=
ble to us today. So, the best that we can
say is that some subject doesn't =
appear (in a literal sense) in the
fraction of vedic texts that we have not=
 yet lost. And we can only say
that after an exhaustive search.


> it is b=
etter to look the whole thing as law of Karma


I agree.

However, when we =
are caught in the pains of suffering, this is very
difficult to internalize=
. Instead of spending too much time wondering
about who set the building on=
 fire, it is better to get out of the
burning building. Later, there will b=
e plenty of time to point the
finger at everyone else, and then, reluctantl=
y, point the finger back
to choices that we freely undertook at a different=
 time.

When the mind is calm, we can try to contemplate on the nature of
k=
arma. Then, we can use our new wisdom to try and keep the mind calm
when it=
 faces agitating situations. But, when the mind is already
agitated, trying=
 to contemplate on the nature of karma may not be the
best way to calm the =
mind.

sasneham,

     ajit
