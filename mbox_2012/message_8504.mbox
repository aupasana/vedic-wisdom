Bhaskar ji

There are two more temples with small invisible windows. One is=
 the Temple dedicated to Lord Surya in Arasavilli and the second one is Sur=
yanarayana Koil ( One of the Navagraha temples of tamilnadu) . 

The specia=
lity of the Arasavilli Surya temple is that on Ratha Saptami day the rays o=
f the sun fall directly on the sanctum sanctorum. The speciality of the Sur=
yaNarayana Koil one is that on the Tamil new year day the rays of the sun d=
irectly fall on the idol.

Similarly there are a few more temples. The anci=
ent Rishis possessed the wisdom to construct such temples . Even though the=
 stars are moving and the earth slightly changing its axis tilt, till to th=
is day these temples demonstrate this practical sight.

The presence of suc=
h temples only demonstrates the level of skill of the ancients ...it does n=
ot prove that the stars are not rotating or lack of need of a ayanamsha or =
beeja samskara in SSS.

Regards
Vemparla Ram Kishore
