Dear NarasimhaBhai,
How are you? When I saw this mail I thought it looks ve=
ry difficult but as I was reading it I noticed that words
like Love or Grac=
e were not mentioned even once. In my experience without=A0Love, Grace, Joy=
, Magic, Light, Bliss and similar things spiritual path becomes very dry.Se=
veral months ago I was thinking ---this Narasimha guy is like rishi, he is =
helping so many people on spiritual path. I fully support him yet many of m=
y spiritual experiences are very different and when I write them he feels s=
ubtle pain. perhaps I should no longer write here.These thoughts were in my=
 mind.
Then Divine Mother Smiled. Same Divine Mother you meditate upon when=
 you do gayatrijap.
Same Divine Mother who has 18 hands.
Same Divine Mother=
 Whose Grace has protected me for so long.
I felt deep peace.
Several days =
ago I saw this mail . I could not believe it

-------Again, the key is not =
to see a god or a goddess, but to be=A0
de-conditioned enough to really ben=
efit from it!=A0-------


We worship Divine Beings. We go to their Temple. =
We do the jap of their mantra. We fast. We meditate. We do several other th=
ings to please them and get their Grace. And when the Light from Their Aura=
 fills our physical eyes, we have to deny them. Right. This is the most =A0=
absurd thing I have seen for a long time.

What is beyond Divine Mother? Al=
l types of samadhi and moksha and known and unknown things are due to her d=
irect or indirect Grace. Why cannot we simply enjoy Her Presence and feel t=
he Bliss.
What is wrong in asking her for magical spiritual experiences or =
Her Darshan. After all do we not ask Her for material things all the time
=
=A0If someone is puffed up and during meditation is not grounded and wants =
to become master of universe, so what. It does not mean that those do medit=
ation in a proper way and feel bliss are in delusion. Car is a good mode of=
 transport yet so many people are hurt every year. Should we stop using it?=


.I very much hope that those who do haven or other spiritual things with =
love and devotion and secretly desire for beautiful spiritual experiences o=
r darshan of their Eshtdav would keep dreaming their dream. Only thing to r=
emember is that it works through Grace and not by their doing.
Ego and Know=
ledge.
What is ego? If we have knowledge of something which is right then s=
hould we not protect ourselves.
I was in a dentist chair and 2 senior denti=
st were checking my mouth. They wanted to pull out one tooth but I refused =
because there was nothing wrong with it.Then with instruments in my mouth o=
ne thug said it is his ego. I did not say anything after treatment and left=
. I did not go there again. They called me again but I never went there. Th=
at tooth remained in my mouth for 20 more years. What should I have done? m=
ake myself humble and lower my ego so they can hurt me.
My take is that I a=
m always kind and sincere to all beings. Open doors for them and let them g=
et ahead of me and help others as much as possible. If despite of all this =
tamcik energy comes, do I not keep my ego strong to protect my self and my =
SanatanDharma. Why should I make myself artificially humble.

NarasimhaBhai=
, you will have to excuse me as I do not agree with several things you wrot=
e. Just my luck.
Happy Holi and green burfi but not too much as it tends to=
 make anybody master of galaxy even without meditation.

] Spiritual Progress, Ego & Experiences

Om Harih Om
Namaste friends,

A lo=
t of people asked in the past how to know if they are making 
spiritual pro=
gress with their sadhana or not. This is a loaded question, 
but I will sha=
re a few random thoughts on
 this and several related 
topics. More than ho=
w to recognize spiritual progress, I will be writing 
on how NOT to try to =
recognize it!

If you don't like my 2 cents, kindly feel free to ignore me =
and follow 
your gurus and others whom you may prefer.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

MATERIAL RESULTS

One obvious thing is that some people =
get material benefits, like 
marriage, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That=
 reinforces or increases 
faith in the initial stages and makes one continu=
e sadhana.

However, that may not happen to everyone. Moreover, such materi=
al 
results do not necessarily show spiritual progress. So, how do we 
iden=
tify spiritual progress?

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

GOAL OF SADH=
ANA

Spiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized in 
=
scriptures. Though different scriptures may use
 different words, it all 
b=
oils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, 
attachments =
and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the 
mind. How free we =
are is indicated by how much we are able to resist and 
overcome this innat=
e conditioning.

MaharshiVasishtha taught Lord Rama in "Yoga Vaasishtham" t=
hat 
Self-realization means overcoming conditioning. Patanjali defined Yoga=
 
(Communion with Self) in "Yoga Sutras" as "yogaHchittavRttinirodhaH" 
(Co=
mmunion is resisting the working of conditioning).

This conditioning infla=
tes ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, 
we can deflate the ego com=
pletely and then identify with the entire 
universe, instead of a single en=
tity with a single agenda.

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

IDENTIFYIN=
G CONDITIONING

Innate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what de=
termines our 
likes,
 dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (o=
r dislike) 
some people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some =
things 
though our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) t=
hose 
things. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated =

over many lives.

When someone praises us, we may know that it is irreleva=
nt (our inner 
voice tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. When someone =
puts us 
down, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice tells us =
so) 
and yet we may feel offended and feel like doing something about it. A=
ll 
this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated over many 
liv=
es.

Idnetifying the conditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, 
=
calculations and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key 
i=
s to learn to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the 
inner =
voice of conscience is telling us one
 thing and we are impelled 
from insi=
de to do otherwise, we can conclude that that is the work of 
conditioning.=
 We often suppress the inner voice of conscience and obey 
the inner voice =
of our conditioning.

If we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - =
physical or mental 
- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it mea=
ns our 
conditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful measu=
re of 
spiritual progress. This may in general be difficult for others to 
=
judge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.

The tricky thing is that o=
ur self-analysis and self-judgment is also 
controlled by our conditioning!=
! Suppose I engaged in an action against 
my inner voice. Suppose I want to=
 analyze what just happened and whether 
I violated my inner voice of consc=
ience. That whole process is governed 
by the conditioning too. Depending o=
n how deeply I am conditioned to 
think that I am a good
 person doing the =
right thing and not making a 
mistake, my mind will be impelled to label th=
e inner voice of conscience 
as a voice of confusion and not accord it any =
importance. Instead, it 
will focus on the inner voice of conditioning (whi=
ch shouts out from 
inside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclu=
de that I did the 
right thing.

The grip of conditioning is too tight to o=
vercome in a day or two! But, 
the inner voice of conscience does tell ever=
yone when one is doing 
something wrong under the influence of conditioning=
. If one keeps 
trying, it can oneday help one identify and overcome condit=
ioning.

SPECIAL EXPERIENCES

Sometime=
s, as one makes spiritual progress, one may have super-normal or 
mystical =
or out-of-body experiences, visions and dreams.

For example, one person I =
know started to feel very light in the head 
with a vision of bright light =
of a particular color, when he meditated 
with a specific mantra. Another p=
erson felt like there was a big fire at 
the base of his spine and the enti=
re lower back was on fire (he actually 
felt unbearably hot), when he medit=
ated with a specific mantra. Another 
person saw a deity appear in front of=
 him and the deity talked to him. 
Interestingly, the same deity was seen b=
y another person who was also 
sitting there at the same time and that pers=
on had a totally different 
(and more mundane) mental conversation with the=
 same deity at the same 
time. Another person felt like he became very ligh=
t and was floating in 
air and there was an inexpressible happiness. In ano=
ther case, one 
sadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense that his =
job was done 
on earth and he could now leave. He thought, "let me leave an=
d let me 
take some more with me". He felt like he was a point moving up
 w=
ith a 
tremendous speed. At the same time, another person who was meditatin=
g a 
few feet away in front of a homam fire felt like somebody was pulling =

that person forcibly through a cave and felt really overwhelmed.

There ar=
e so many possible experiences. But the key point is that 
experiences are =
secondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT for 
spiritual progres=
s. I had my share of experiences, progress and setbacks 
and I am 100% sure=
 of the above. You'll do well to remember this 
sentence and not be swayed =
by stories of experiences or desire them 
consciously or sub-consciously. I=
 will elabate a little later on the 
grave dangers of desiring experiences.=


*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

EXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION=


We say that god can be known only by experience and not by reading 
books=
. That is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply desirous
 of an 
exper=
ience, one may experience an aspect of god's Delusory Power instead 
of god=
 and that may increase false pride (a true experience of god will 
instead =
produce infinite humility). Not all experiences are equal.

There is a famo=
us quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton of 
theory. Though th=
at is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of 
experience is usele=
ss if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of 
theory may actually be =
better if it actually reduces one's ego to a 
pound or an ounce!

The issue=
 is not whether one needs practical experience or theoretical 
understandin=
g. That is secondary. The primary thing is what is happening 
to one's ego.=
 Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT is undoubtedly 
the main issue. I=
f reading books, satsanga, rituals, theoretical 
understanding etc reduce e=
go from a ton to a quintal, from a quintal to 
a pound and from a pound to =
an
 ounce, even without a direct experience, 
that's awesome. That is bette=
r than getting a ton of experience and ego 
being inflated from a pound to =
a quintal.

Though it is true that ego does not become complete zero withou=
t an 
"experience" of god in the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that 
=
"experience" when one's ego is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce it 
t=
o as small a quantity as you can. Experience of god will then come by 
itse=
lf.

In the famous Indian movie "3 Idiots", there is a nice line: "Don't 
c=
hase success, but chase capability. Success will follow automatically." 
Si=
milarly, don't chase experiences, but chase detachment and deflation 
of eg=
o. Experience will automatically follow. Chasing experience without 
trying=
 to reduce ego is like putting the cart before the horse. To use 
the analo=
gy from the movie "3 Idiots", one then runs the risk of 
becoming the spiri=
tual equivalent of ChaturRamalingam (alias Silencer) 
of that movie, who ch=
ased success, ended up with huge ego from limited 
success and failed in th=
e end!

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

EXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING

A=
s said above, it is a bad idea to seek an "experience" when one's ego 
is s=
till a ton or a quintal. In other words, when one's conditioning is 
dense =
enough, a pre-occupation with experiences can be 
counter-productive. The r=
eason is that any experience will be 
interpreted (and absorbed into one's =
system!!!) through the color of 
one's conditioning.

If I go into the open=
 and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see 
that Sun is orange. But, =
suppose I see Sun from green colored glass 
windows of a house. Or suppose =
I go into the open, but see Sun through 
green eyeglasses. In either case, =
I will see that Sun is green. I am 
experiencing the real Sun, but I will g=
et
 the wrong knowledge that "Sun 
is green".

Similarly, even a genuine sp=
iritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN 
generate false knowledge (e.g. S=
un is green!) if one's conditioning is 
conducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).=


The key is not just to experience, but the ability to interpet, *digest* =

and absorb the experience into one's system well. One's conditioning 
infl=
uences how one digests various life experiences, including spiritual 
exper=
iences and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the 
above e=
xample!

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

DIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES

In =
ayurvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic 
buildup =
in the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various 
tissues a=
nd create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look and 
feel health=
y despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one 
develops serio=
us diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts 
of the body. Th=
e ama may even interfere with the digestion of good food 
being taken in an=
d the working of even medicines one may take in. When 
too much ama has acc=
umulated and destabilizes the system, one may need 
to go through a painful=
 de-toxification process.

Similarly, spiritual experiences one cannot dige=
st well become spiritual 
ama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can=
 slowly build up, get 
absorbed into various aspects of one's being and cre=
ate various diseases 
in the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look =
and feel 
spiritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiri=
tual 
ama accumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can =

eventually affect one's entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for 
de-=
toxification) may be far more difficult than the physical 
pancha-karma.

*=
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

EXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS

To illustrate=
 what I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a 
*hypothetical* =
example.

Suppose someone sits still for a few hours everyday and meditates=
. 
Suppose one starts to get some special inner experiences and some 
seemi=
ngly supernatural things start happening externally around one. 
Suppose th=
ese experiences give one the impression that one is special 
and one is mak=
ing excellent spiritual progress. Suppose one reads some 
spiritual books a=
nd fantasizes "becoming like Shiva" mentioned in those 
books. Then one may=
 start to think "may be, I have become like Shiva" 
and slowly convince one=
self that one HAS become like Shiva. Suppose one 
reads a spiritual book th=
at claims "If one becomes like Shiva, the whole 
universe connives against =
one who causes an offense to him".

Of
 course, there is a context behind e=
very statement and no statement is 
absolute. If one misses the nuances, on=
e may digest and absorb it into 
one's system incorrectly. After all, one c=
ould have also said, "if one 
becomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully =
co-operates with one and 
there is no way anyone can really cause offense t=
o that person".

Anyway, one in the process of convincing oneself that one =
has indeed 
become like Shiva may then look for examples of someone causing=
 offense
and suffering bad things. Of course, just as one can find any shap=
es in 
clouds, one can find any correlations in things happening around one=
. 
One will find a few examples. That may reinforce the delusion that one 
=
has become like Shiva. When good and bad happen to people around one, 
one =
may start correlating them to good and bad done by those people to 
one and=
/or to things one has done. Over time, the delusion may become so 
deep tha=
t it just feels so natural and obvious. This is like a serious 
disease dev=
eloping from a toxic buildup of undigested or badly digested 
food. Inabili=
ty to fully understand the spiritual experiences one had, 
the fantasy of b=
ecoming like Shiva, the pre-exising pride (like 
pre-existing ama) and the =
not-so-well-digested notion that offense to 
Shiva causes harm, have togeth=
er created spiritual ama buildup that now 
resulted in a serious disease.

=
Though original experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming 
late=
r on MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from the 
ill-dig=
ested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is 
conducive to =
creating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of 
the system can s=
pread to others.

As said before, the key issue is: Is the ego getting infl=
ated or 
deflated. If ego is getting inflated, then one is on the wrong tra=
ck. 
One is either deluding oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences du=
e 
to pre-existing conditioning and delusions (spiritual ama). In either 
c=
ase, whatever one is experiencing is not being digested well and is 
weaken=
ing the system instead of strengthening it. If, on the other hand, 
ego is =
getting deflated, then one is on the right track. Whatever one is 
experien=
cing is being digested well and strengthening the system.

SHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIRACLES

This emphasis on ego def=
lation may make some people wonder about the 
prominence given in some book=
s to accumulation of shakti, siddhis and 
miracles. For example, some books=
 describe what a being like Shiva or 
someone less but still with high enou=
gh shakti, can do.

Yes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings close to en=
lightenment MAY 
have a lot of spiritual shakti and be able to do some spec=
ial things. 
But, no book said that you get those abilities by being proud =
or 
pursuing something that can make one proud.

In fact, if one looks at t=
hose abilities described in books and adores 
them from one's *current* lev=
els of dense conditioning, it is quite akin 
to looking at a "green Sun" fr=
om green eyeglasses and admiring the 
greenness of that Sun!!! In other wor=
ds, one has missed the whole point. 
One with dense conditioning can't even=
 understand what that shakti or 
ability really means or comes from. In ord=
er to understand what shakti
is, to accumulate enough shakti or to reach su=
ch a state, one MUST 
deflate one's ego.

Bottomline is this: Most scriptur=
es of most religions are unanimous in 
teaching the importance of humility,=
 compassion and ego deflation. No 
scripture talks about the glory of pride=
 and ego inflation. It's as 
simple as that.

GODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS

We encounter some peop=
le who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses 
and also conversations =
with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime 
coming from the divine be=
ings in their encounters. Whatever the divine 
beings supposedly said is we=
ll within what one consciously or 
sub-consciously already knew or believed=
 or wanted to believe.

This may remind one of the encounters of Mahatma Ga=
ndhi by the character 
played by SanjayDutt in hit bollywood movie "LageRah=
eMunnabhai". In 
that movie, the visions are due to "chemical imbalance" in=
 Munnabhai's
mind and the Gandhi he sees and can talk to, cannot answer que=
stions 
that Munnabhai himself does not know (but real Gandhi should know).=
 So 
the conclusion is that the person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a 
char=
acter in his own mind constructed based on what Munnabhai
understands of Ga=
ndhi.

In the case of divine encounters, it may be a little different from =
this 
movie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied meeting based on al=
l 
that one consciously and sub-consciously knew already, OR it may be a 
r=
eal being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her actions are 
inte=
rpreted strictly based on one's conditioning, like the "green Sun" 
in our =
previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, what divine 
beings say fit=
s well within the realm of knowledge one consciously or 
sub-consciously al=
ready knew or believed or wanted to believe.

In the rare case of a sadhaka=
 with very little conditioning having a 
real divine encounter, it is like =
an innocent child meeting mother or 
father, and there is a real flow of di=
vine and sublime understanding and 
wisdom.

Again, the key is not to see a=
 god or a goddess, but to be 
de-conditioned enough to really benefit from =
it!

*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

KUNDALINI AWAKENING & RISE

One m=
ore thing people often talk about is Kundalini awakening and rise. 
Kundali=
nishakti is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this 
is "I"). Ku=
ndalini being asleep in Mooladharachakra means one does not 
even question =
who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties 
self down to th=
e physical body and physical senses. However, 
self-awareness rising above =
this does not necessarily mean spiritual 
progress or enlightenment. Kundal=
ini awakening is only the beginning of 
a long process. If one's conditioni=
ng is deeply holding down to subtle 
ideas of who one is (e.g. I am a great=
 spiritual soul who saved the 
world many times in the past and came back t=
o save it), an awakened 
Kundalini may take one's notion of self beyond the=
 physical body, but 
will get stuck somewhere else. In
 fact, one's subtle =
notions of self may 
become aggrandized when Kundalini reaches conducive re=
gions and one may 
experience things that aggravate and strengthen those no=
tions. One may 
get badly stuck.

As mentioned above, any spiritual experie=
nce can create spiritual ama
when not digested properly. Any pre-existing c=
onditioning may make it 
difficult to digest anything complex. Instead of e=
ating a heavy-duty 
protein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxic bu=
ildup in the 
system, one is better off eating simple food that one's own s=
ystem can 
process and digest well.

To be clear, whether one'sKundalini is=
 awakened or not, and where one's
Kundalini is currently, is NOT a measure =
of one's spiritual progress. As 
Kundalini does not rise through a single p=
ath, as the rise is not linear 
and as the obstructions are not uniform in =
all people, one cannot 
compare two people based on Kundalini experiences.
=

One can cling to the body and overcome all conditioning slowly and 
oneday=
Kundalini may awaken and rise all the way to Sahasrara. Another 
person may=
 awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck somewhere where it is 
extremely dif=
ficult to overcome the corresponding conditioning.

The bottomline is that =
how much conditioning is overcome and how reduced 
one's ego is is the corr=
ect measure of spiritual progress and not 
whether Kundalini is awakened an=
d where Kundalini is.

CORRELATIONS GA=
LORE

Do not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or ma=
y 
not mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, "wow, I was 
=
just thinking about you". Or suppose you say something and someone says, 
"=
wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as though you read 
my m=
ind." Suppose you were unhappy with the
 happenings in some region of 
the =
world, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad happened 
there. Or =
suppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did some 
sadhana and th=
e desire was fulfilled.

In several such cases, correlating a result with s=
omething you did can 
often increase pride and your sense of self-worth. An=
d, doing that will 
not enable you to do your dharma any better.

Keep thin=
king your thoughts and desires, keep doing your actions and 
keep doing you=
r sadhana. That's it. Don't correlate actions and results 
and think that y=
ou made X or Y result happen. We engage in actions and 
god gives results. =
The sense of "I made X happen" is conducive to pride 
and ego inflation. Mo=
reover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether 
action A or B caused resul=
t X or Y, because the action-result pipeline 
has variable delay!! So, why =
even bother to correlate and run the risk 
of ego
 inflation?

*=A0 =A0 =A0=
 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *

BOTTOMLINE

Don't run after special experiences an=
d special abilities or anything 
that makes you special (as you imagine cur=
rently, based on your dense 
conditioning). Spiritual progress is not about=
 becoming "special", but 
about becoming humble. Special experiences and ab=
ilities do not matter 
at all. In fact, they can distract one and give fals=
e pride. God makes 
one special AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost =
completely.

Also, stop correlating things happening to or around you, with=
 your 
actions, and think that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in action=
s is 
your sacred duty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time =
is 
god's prerogative. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe=
 
in one's thinking.

Remember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful=
 measure of 
spiritual progress is
 how deflated your ego is and how humble=
 you become 
(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have rea=
lly become 
internally). It is how well you are able to resist the temptati=
ons of 
following the voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and h=
ow 
well you can follow the voice of conscience.

When inflations in ego oc=
cur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice 
it, bring it to the attentio=
n and perhaps even be ruthless in belling 
the cat [of ego]. But most gurus=
 now-a-days may not do that well. So, 
you have to do your best to avoid an=
y serious ego inflations.

Unfortunately, the path of spiritual progress an=
d self-realization IS 
very very very likely for most of us to include many=
 many many 
opportunities for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep=
 a strict 
watch on your ego.

ING<br><br>Innate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determi=
nes our <br>likes,
 dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or =
dislike) <br>some people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some=
 things <br>though our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to d=
o) those <br>things. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accum=
ulated <br>over many lives.<br><br>When someone praises us, we may know tha=
t it is irrelevant (our inner <br>voice tells us so) and yet we may feel el=
ated. When someone puts us <br>down, we may know that it is irrelevant (our=
 inner voice tells us so) <br>and yet we may feel offended and feel like do=
ing something about it. All <br>this comes from conditioning, which has bee=
n accumulated over many <br>lives.<br><br><span id=3D"misspell-46" class=3D=
"mark">Idnetifying</span> the conditioning as it works on our instincts, th=
oughts, <br>calculations and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible=
. The key <br>is to learn to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whene=
ver the
 <br>inner voice of conscience is telling us one
 thing and we are =
impelled <br>from inside to do otherwise, we can conclude that that is the =
work of <br>conditioning. We often suppress the inner voice of conscience a=
nd obey <br>the inner voice of our conditioning.<br><br>If we are engaging =
in fewer and/or smaller actions - physical or mental <br>- that go against =
the inner voice of conscience, it means our <br>conditioning is becoming li=
ghter. THAT is the only meaningful measure of <br>spiritual progress. This =
may in general be difficult for others to <br>judge, but one can certainly =
judge for oneself.<br><br>The tricky thing is that our self-analysis and se=
lf-<span id=3D"misspell-47" class=3D"mark">judgment</span> is also <br>cont=
rolled by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action against <br>my =
inner voice. Suppose I want to <span id=3D"misspell-48" class=3D"mark">anal=
yze</span> what just happened and whether <br>I violated my inner voice of =
conscience. That whole process is governed <br>by the
 conditioning too. De=
pending on how deeply I am conditioned to <br>think that I am a good
 perso=
n doing the right thing and not making a <br>mistake, my mind will be impel=
led to label the inner voice of conscience <br>as a voice of confusion and =
not accord it any importance. Instead, it <br>will focus on the inner voice=
 of conditioning (which shouts out from <br>inside the reasons that justify=
 the action!) and conclude that I did the <br>right thing.<br><br>The grip =
of conditioning is too tight to overcome in a day or two! But, <br>the inne=
r voice of conscience does tell everyone when one is doing <br>something wr=

 That is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply desirous
