=C2=A0
As soon as he picked the vessel, i was watching him, a=
s somewhere my intution said he will be using same water. now, i am feeling=
 very bad, i should have protested loudly instead of silently.
=C2=A0
Heyyy=

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to sometimes feed the=

I have a small doubt on priest's act i=
 came across on shivrathri night in shiva temple in Dallas. They had planne=

archana. There were total 7 brahmins involved out of which two were recitin=

, and after mahanysam is complete, he used the same water from the vessel t=
hat he drank, for pooja and perform all shodacha upachara samaskrams such a=
s "suddhodaka snanam", arghyam, achamanam, etc to the maha linga. 
=C2=A0

My question is, once the water has been drunk by priest, would it be wise t=
o use same vessel water for pooja. i tried to convey him the message but he=
 was not looking at me, and i could not go near him=C2=A0 and tell as there=
