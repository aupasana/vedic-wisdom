Namaste,

A minor point here.

<<who take care of the trip=

The interpretation tha=
t we have of deities, that one creates, one destroys, one sustains, or one =
is angry, (Kali) or such is based on *our* perspective, not theirs. For a d=
eity, there is only one motivation and that is doing the right thing at the=
 right time with literally zero attachment. Because each deity is a living =
example of the perfection in detached execution of their own dharmas, Natur=
e accords them vast roles in its grand design. That is why each of them are=
 actually capable of doing everything. A Deity does, what it must do at tha=
t specific point in time. That's all.

Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Hierarchy in Hinduism
 

=C2=A0 
Namaste Sir and ev=
eryone,

We are trying to prepare a chart to explain to teenagers and child=
ren in our place, the hierarchy of God and beings as taught by hinduism. 

=
For this, we have parabrahman or the formless God at the beginning. Parabra=
hman takes the 6 forms of higher deities like athi parashakti, narayana, sh=
iva, ganapathi, etc as taught by Shankara. Below these we have the trinity =
representing the trigunas, Brahma-Vishnu-Rudra, who take care of the triple=
 task of creation, sustenance and destruction. Below them we have the Gods =
beginning with Indra and the remaining 33 main devas referenced in the veda=
s. 

Please advise and correct us if our understanding regarding this is pr=
oper.

Our further questions which we need some light from everyone else is=
:
1) Where do other beings and demigods like Gandharva, Yaksha, Kinnaras, A=
psaras, feature in the scheme of things in this hierarchy. Other than those=
 4 I mentioned are there other types of beings?

2) Where do Rishis and Man=
ushya feature in the scheme of things in the same hierarchy?

3) How about =
Pishaachas, and other beings? 

Please offer any information you can on thi=
s for us.

Pranams,
Anoop.
