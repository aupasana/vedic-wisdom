bject: [vedic-wisdom] Spiritual Progress, Ego & Experiences
 

=C2=A0 
Om H=
arih Om
Namaste friends,

A lot of people asked in the past how to know if =
they are making 
spiritual progress with their sadhana or not. This is a lo=
aded question, 
but I will share a few random thoughts on this and several =
related 
topics. More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I will be w=
riting 
on how NOT to try to recognize it!

If you don't like my 2 cents, k=
indly feel free to ignore me and follow 
your gurus and others whom you may=
 prefer.

*        *        *

MATERIAL RESULTS

One obvious thing is that =
some people get material benefits, like 
marriage, job, promotion, childbir=
th etc. That reinforces or increases 
faith in the initial stages and makes=
 one continue sadhana.

However, that may not happen to everyone. Moreover,=
 such material 
results do not necessarily show spiritual progress. So, how=
 do we 
identify spiritual progress?

*        *        *

GOAL OF SADHANA
=

Spiritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized in 
scri=
ptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, it all 
boils =
down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, 
attachments and a=
gendas, which come from innate conditioning of the 
mind. How free we are i=
s indicated by how much we are able to resist and 
overcome this innate con=
ditioning.

Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama in "Yoga Vaasishtham" that =

Self-realization means overcoming conditioning. Patanjali defined Yoga 
(C=
ommunion with Self) in "Yoga Sutras" as "yogaH chitta vRtti nirodhaH" 
(Com=
munion is resisting the working of conditioning).

This conditioning inflat=
es ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, 
we can deflate the ego comp=
letely and then identify with the entire 
universe, instead of a single ent=
ity with a single agenda.

*        *        *

IDENTIFYING CONDITIONING

I=
nnate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determines our 
lik=
es, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or dislike) 
some p=
eople for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some things 
though our=
 inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) those 
things. All =
this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated 
over many lives.
=

When someone praises us, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner 
voi=
ce tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. When someone puts us 
down, we =
may know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice tells us so) 
and yet we ma=
y feel offended and feel like doing something about it. All 
this comes fro=
m conditioning, which has been accumulated over many 
lives.

Idnetifying t=
he conditioning as it works on our instincts, thoughts, 
calculations and a=
ctions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. The key 
is to learn to list=
en to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever the 
inner voice of conscienc=
e is telling us one thing and we are impelled 
from inside to do otherwise,=
 we can conclude that that is the work of 
conditioning. We often suppress =
the inner voice of conscience and obey 
the inner voice of our conditioning=
.

If we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - physical or mental =

- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it means our 
conditionin=
g is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful measure of 
spiritual pr=
ogress. This may in general be difficult for others to 
judge, but one can =
certainly judge for oneself.

The tricky thing is that our self-analysis an=
d self-judgment is also 
controlled by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged=
 in an action against 
my inner voice. Suppose I want to analyze what just =
happened and whether 
I violated my inner voice of conscience. That whole p=
rocess is governed 
by the conditioning too. Depending on how deeply I am c=
onditioned to 
think that I am a good person doing the right thing and not =
making a 
mistake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voice of con=
science 
as a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance. Instead,=
 it 
will focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts out from 
=
inside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that I did the 
r=
ight thing.

The grip of conditioning is too tight to overcome in a day or =
two! But, 
the inner voice of conscience does tell everyone when one is doi=
ng 
something wrong under the influence of conditioning. If one keeps 
tryi=
ng, it can oneday help one identify and overcome conditioning.

*        * =
       *

SPECIAL EXPERIENCES

Sometimes, as one makes spiritual progress, =
one may have super-normal or 
mystical or out-of-body experiences, visions =
and dreams.

For example, one person I know started to feel very light in t=
he head 
with a vision of bright light of a particular color, when he medit=
ated 
with a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a big fire=
 at 
the base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire (he actual=
ly 
felt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific mantra. Another=
 
person saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity talked to him. 
I=
nterestingly, the same deity was seen by another person who was also 
sitti=
ng there at the same time and that person had a totally different 
(and mor=
e mundane) mental conversation with the same deity at the same 
time. Anoth=
er person felt like he became very light and was floating in 
air and there=
 was an inexpressible happiness. In another case, one 
sadhaka when meditat=
ing was filled with the sense that his job was done 
on earth and he could =
now leave. He thought, "let me leave and let me 
take some more with me". H=
e felt like he was a point moving up with a 
tremendous speed. At the same =
time, another person who was meditating a 
few feet away in front of a homa=
m fire felt like somebody was pulling 
that person forcibly through a cave =
and felt really overwhelmed.

There are so many possible experiences. But t=
he key point is that 
experiences are secondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY=
 NOR SUFFICIENT for 
spiritual progress. I had my share of experiences, pro=
gress and setbacks 
and I am 100% sure of the above. You'll do well to reme=
mber this 
sentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences or desire t=
hem 
consciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little later on the 
=
grave dangers of desiring experiences.

*        *        *

EXPERIENCE VS =
THEORY: WRONG QUESTION

We say that god can be known only by experience and=
 not by reading 
books. That is not incorrect. However, when one is deeply =
desirous of an 
experience, one may experience an aspect of god's Delusory =
Power instead 
of god and that may increase false pride (a true experience =
of god will 
instead produce infinite humility). Not all experiences are eq=
ual.

There is a famous quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton =
of 
theory. Though that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of=
 
experience is useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of 
th=
eory may actually be better if it actually reduces one's ego to a 
pound or=
 an ounce!

The issue is not whether one needs practical experience or theo=
retical 
understanding. That is secondary. The primary thing is what is hap=
pening 
to one's ego. Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT is undoubted=
ly 
the main issue. If reading books, satsanga, rituals, theoretical 
under=
standing etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal, from a quintal to 
a pound=
 and from a pound to an ounce, even without a direct experience, 
that's aw=
esome. That is better than getting a ton of experience and ego 
being infla=
ted from a pound to a quintal.

Though it is true that ego does not become =
complete zero without an 
"experience" of god in the end, it is still a bad=
 idea to seek that 
"experience" when one's ego is still a ton or a quintal=
. First reduce it 
to as small a quantity as you can. Experience of god wil=
l then come by 
itself.

In the famous Indian movie "3 Idiots", there is a =
nice line: "Don't 
chase success, but chase capability. Success will follow=
 automatically." 
Similarly, don't chase experiences, but chase detachment =
and deflation 
of ego. Experience will automatically follow. Chasing experi=
ence without 
trying to reduce ego is like putting the cart before the hors=
e. To use 
the analogy from the movie "3 Idiots", one then runs the risk of=
 
becoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Ramalingam (alias Silencer) 
=
of that movie, who chased success, ended up with huge ego from limited 
suc=
cess and failed in the end!

*        *        *

EXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONI=
NG

As said above, it is a bad idea to seek an "experience" when one's ego =

is still a ton or a quintal. In other words, when one's conditioning is 
d=
ense enough, a pre-occupation with experiences can be 
counter-productive. =
The reason is that any experience will be 
interpreted (and absorbed into o=
ne's system!!!) through the color of 
one's conditioning.

If I go into the=
 open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see 
that Sun is orange. =
But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass 
windows of a house. Or sup=
pose I go into the open, but see Sun through 
green eyeglasses. In either c=
ase, I will see that Sun is green. I am 
experiencing the real Sun, but I w=
ill get the wrong knowledge that "Sun 
is green".

Similarly, even a genuin=
e spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN 
generate false knowledge (e.=
g. Sun is green!) if one's conditioning is 
conducive (e.g. green eyeglasse=
s!).

The key is not just to experience, but the ability to interpet, *dige=
st* 
and absorb the experience into one's system well. One's conditioning 
=
influences how one digests various life experiences, including spiritual 
e=
xperiences and mystical experiences, like the green eye glasses in the 
abo=
ve example!

*        *        *

DIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES

In ayurvedic te=
rms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic 
buildup in the syste=
m. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various 
tissues and create va=
rious diseases. In the beginning, one may look and 
feel healthy despite so=
me ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one 
develops serious diseases.=
 The disease starts to spread to various parts 
of the body. The ama may ev=
en interfere with the digestion of good food 
being taken in and the workin=
g of even medicines one may take in. When 
too much ama has accumulated and=
 destabilizes the system, one may need 
to go through a painful de-toxifica=
tion process.

Similarly, spiritual experiences one cannot digest well beco=
me spiritual 
ama, a toxic buildup in the subtle system. It can slowly buil=
d up, get 
absorbed into various aspects of one's being and create various =
diseases 
in the subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and feel 
sp=
iritually healthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritual 
ama ac=
cumulates, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can 
eventually =
affect one's entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for 
de-toxification=
) may be far more difficult than the physical 
pancha-karma.

*        *   =
     *

EXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS

To illustrate what I mean by spiritual am=
a and delusions, let me give a 
*hypothetical* example.

Suppose someone si=
ts still for a few hours everyday and meditates. 
Suppose one starts to get=
 some special inner experiences and some 
seemingly supernatural things sta=
rt happening externally around one. 
Suppose these experiences give one the=
 impression that one is special 
and one is making excellent spiritual prog=
ress. Suppose one reads some 
spiritual books and fantasizes "becoming like=
 Shiva" mentioned in those 
books. Then one may start to think "may be, I h=
ave become like Shiva" 
and slowly convince oneself that one HAS become lik=
e Shiva. Suppose one 
reads a spiritual book that claims "If one becomes li=
ke Shiva, the whole 
universe connives against one who causes an offense to=
 him".

Of course, there is a context behind every statement and no stateme=
nt is 
absolute. If one misses the nuances, one may digest and absorb it in=
to 
one's system incorrectly. After all, one could have also said, "if one =

becomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully co-operates with one and 
the=
re is no way anyone can really cause offense to that person".

Anyway, one =
in the process of convincing oneself that one has indeed 
become like Shiva=
 may then look for examples of someone causing offense 
and suffering bad t=
hings. Of course, just as one can find any shapes in 
clouds, one can find =
any correlations in things happening around one. 
One will find a few examp=
les. That may reinforce the delusion that one 
has become like Shiva. When =
good and bad happen to people around one, 
one may start correlating them t=
o good and bad done by those people to 
one and/or to things one has done. =
Over time, the delusion may become so 
deep that it just feels so natural a=
nd obvious. This is like a serious 
disease developing from a toxic buildup=
 of undigested or badly digested 
food. Inability to fully understand the s=
piritual experiences one had, 
the fantasy of becoming like Shiva, the pre-=
exising pride (like 
pre-existing ama) and the not-so-well-digested notion =
that offense to 
Shiva causes harm, have together created spiritual ama bui=
ldup that now 
resulted in a serious disease.

Though original experiences =
may have been genuine, experiences coming 
later on MAY be the result of ac=
cumulated delusions (disease) from the 
ill-digested experiences and notion=
s (ama). Please note that ama is 
conducive to creating more ama. When unch=
ecked, disease in one part of 
the system can spread to others.

As said be=
fore, the key issue is: Is the ego getting inflated or 
deflated. If ego is=
 getting inflated, then one is on the wrong track. 
One is either deluding =
oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences due 
to pre-existing condition=
ing and delusions (spiritual ama). In either 
case, whatever one is experie=
ncing is not being digested well and is 
weakening the system instead of st=
rengthening it. If, on the other hand, 
ego is getting deflated, then one i=
s on the right track. Whatever one is 
experiencing is being digested well =
and strengthening the system.

*        *        *

SHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIR=
ACLES

This emphasis on ego deflation may make some people wonder about the=
 
prominence given in some books to accumulation of shakti, siddhis and 
mi=
racles. For example, some books describe what a being like Shiva or 
someon=
e less but still with high enough shakti, can do.

Yes, SOME enlightened be=
ings or some beings close to enlightenment MAY 
have a lot of spiritual sha=
kti and be able to do some special things. 
But, no book said that you get =
those abilities by being proud or 
pursuing something that can make one pro=
ud.

In fact, if one looks at those abilities described in books and adores=
 
them from one's *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is quite akin =

to looking at a "green Sun" from green eyeglasses and admiring the 
greenn=
ess of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole point. 
One wit=
h dense conditioning can't even understand what that shakti or 
ability rea=
lly means or comes from. In order to understand what shakti 
is, to accumul=
ate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUST 
deflate one's ego.

B=
ottomline is this: Most scriptures of most religions are unanimous in 
teac=
hing the importance of humility, compassion and ego deflation. No 
scriptur=
e talks about the glory of pride and ego inflation. It's as 
simple as that=
.

*        *        *

GODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS

We encoun=
ter some people who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses 
and also c=
onversations with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime 
coming from =
the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine 
beings supposed=
ly said is well within what one consciously or 
sub-consciously already kne=
w or believed or wanted to believe.

This may remind one of the encounters =
of Mahatma Gandhi by the character 
played by Sanjay Dutt in hit bollywood =
movie "Lage Rahe Munnabhai". In 
that movie, the visions are due to "chemic=
al imbalance" in Munnabhai's 
mind and the Gandhi he sees and can talk to, =
cannot answer questions 
that Munnabhai himself does not know (but real Gan=
dhi should know). So 
the conclusion is that the person Munnabhai imagines =
seeing is a 
character in his own mind constructed based on what Munnabhai =

understands of Gandhi.

In the case of divine encounters, it may be a litt=
le different from this 
movie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied m=
eeting based on all 
that one consciously and sub-consciously knew already,=
 OR it may be a 
real being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her=
 actions are 
interpreted strictly based on one's conditioning, like the "g=
reen Sun" 
in our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, what divi=
ne 
beings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one consciously or 
=
sub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.

In the rare=
 case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning having a 
real divine enco=
unter, it is like an innocent child meeting mother or 
father, and there is=
 a real flow of divine and sublime understanding and 
wisdom.

Again, the k=
ey is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be 
de-conditioned enough to re=
ally benefit from it!

*        *        *

KUNDALINI AWAKENING & RISE

One=
 more thing people often talk about is Kundalini awakening and rise. 
Kunda=
lini shakti is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this 
is "I").=
 Kundalini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra means one does not 
even quest=
ion who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties 
self down t=
o the physical body and physical senses. However, 
self-awareness rising ab=
ove this does not necessarily mean spiritual 
progress or enlightenment. Ku=
ndalini awakening is only the beginning of 
a long process. If one's condit=
ioning is deeply holding down to subtle 
ideas of who one is (e.g. I am a g=
reat spiritual soul who saved the 
world many times in the past and came ba=
ck to save it), an awakened 
Kundalini may take one's notion of self beyond=
 the physical body, but 
will get stuck somewhere else. In fact, one's subt=
le notions of self may 
become aggrandized when Kundalini reaches conducive=
 regions and one may 
experience things that aggravate and strengthen those=
 notions. One may 
get badly stuck.

As mentioned above, any spiritual expe=
rience can create spiritual ama 
when not digested properly. Any pre-existi=
ng conditioning may make it 
difficult to digest anything complex. Instead =
of eating a heavy-duty 
protein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxi=
c buildup in the 
system, one is better off eating simple food that one's o=
wn system can 
process and digest well.

To be clear, whether one's Kundali=
ni is awakened or not, and where one's 
Kundalini is currently, is NOT a me=
asure of one's spiritual progress. As 
Kundalini does not rise through a si=
ngle path, as the rise is not linear 
and as the obstructions are not unifo=
rm in all people, one cannot 
compare two people based on Kundalini experie=
nces.

One can cling to the body and overcome all conditioning slowly and 
=
oneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the way to Sahasrara. Another 
per=
son may awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck somewhere where it is 
extrem=
ely difficult to overcome the corresponding conditioning.

The bottomline i=
s that how much conditioning is overcome and how reduced 
one's ego is is t=
he correct measure of spiritual progress and not 
whether Kundalini is awak=
ened and where Kundalini is.

*        *        *

CORRELATIONS GALORE

Do =
not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or may 
not me=
an much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, "wow, I was 
just thin=
king about you". Or suppose you say something and someone says, 
"wow, I wa=
s just thinking about it. You answered me as though you read 
my mind." Sup=
pose you were unhappy with the happenings in some region of 
the world, did=
 a special sadhana and suppose something bad happened 
there. Or suppose yo=
u had a desire at the back of your mind, did some 
sadhana and the desire w=
as fulfilled.

In several such cases, correlating a result with something y=
ou did can 
often increase pride and your sense of self-worth. And, doing t=
hat will 
not enable you to do your dharma any better.

Keep thinking your =
thoughts and desires, keep doing your actions and 
keep doing your sadhana.=
 That's it. Don't correlate actions and results 
and think that you made X =
or Y result happen. We engage in actions and 
god gives results. The sense =
of "I made X happen" is conducive to pride 
and ego inflation. Moreover, yo=
u can *never* know *for sure* whether 
action A or B caused result X or Y, =
because the action-result pipeline 
has variable delay!! So, why even bothe=
r to correlate and run the risk 
of ego inflation?

*        *        *

BO=
TTOMLINE

Don't run after special experiences and special abilities or anyt=
hing 
that makes you special (as you imagine currently, based on your dense=
 
conditioning). Spiritual progress is not about becoming "special", but 
a=
bout becoming humble. Special experiences and abilities do not matter 
at a=
ll. In fact, they can distract one and give false pride. God makes 
one spe=
cial AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost completely.

Also, stop cor=
relating things happening to or around you, with your 
actions, and think t=
hat you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actions is 
your sacred duty and =
giving whatever results are fit at a given time is 
god's prerogative. That=
 is the simplest and safest model one can imbibe 
in one's thinking.

Remem=
ber the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful measure of 
spiritual prog=
ress is how deflated your ego is and how humble you become 
(not how humble=
 you act or behave, but how humble you have really become 
internally). It =
is how well you are able to resist the temptations of 
following the voice =
of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and how 
well you can follow the =
voice of conscience.

When inflations in ego occur, it is the job of a guru=
/mentor to notice 
it, bring it to the attention and perhaps even be ruthle=
ss in belling 
the cat [of ego]. But most gurus now-a-days may not do that =
well. So, 
you have to do your best to avoid any serious ego inflations.

U=
nfortunately, the path of spiritual progress and self-realization IS 
very =
very very likely for most of us to include many many many 
opportunities fo=
r very very very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict 
watch on your ego=
.

Namaste friends,<br>
<br>
A =
lot of people asked in the past how to know if they are making <br>
spiritu=
al progress with their sadhana or not. This is a loaded question, <br>
but =
I will share a few random thoughts on this and several related <br>
topics.=
 More than how to recognize spiritual progress, I will be writing <br>
on h=
ow NOT to try to recognize it!<br>
<br>
If you don't like my 2 cents, kindl=
y feel free to ignore me and follow <br>
your gurus and others whom you may=
 prefer.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
MATERIAL RESULTS<br>
<br>
On=
e obvious thing is that some people get material benefits, like <br>
marria=
ge, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That reinforces or increases <br>
faith=
 in the initial stages and makes one continue sadhana.<br>
<br>
However, th=
at may not happen to everyone. Moreover, such material <br>
results do not =
necessarily show spiritual progress. So, how do we <br>
identify spiritual =
progress?<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
GOAL OF SADHANA<br>
<br>
Sp=
iritual progress is an internal thing. It is well characterized in <br>
scr=
iptures. Though different scriptures may use different words, it all <br>
b=
oils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, dislikes, <br>
attachme=
nts and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of the <br>
mind. How =
free we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist and <br>
overcom=
e this innate conditioning.<br>
<br>
Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama in=
 "Yoga Vaasishtham" that <br>
Self-realization means overcoming conditionin=
g. Patanjali defined Yoga <br>
(Communion with Self) in "Yoga Sutras" as "y=
ogaH chitta vRtti nirodhaH" <br>
(Communion is resisting the working of con=
ditioning).<br>
<br>
This conditioning inflates ego and by overcoming all t=
he conditioning, <br>
we can deflate the ego completely and then identify w=
ith the entire <br>
universe, instead of a single entity with a single agen=
da.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
IDENTIFYING CONDITIONING<br>
<br>=

Innate conditioning of the mind, as said before, is what determines our <b=
r>
likes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend to like (or dislike) <=
br>
some people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or avoid) some things <=
br>
though our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (or to do) those=
 <br>
things. All this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated =
<br>
over many lives.<br>
<br>
When someone praises us, we may know that it=
 is irrelevant (our inner <br>
voice tells us so) and yet we may feel elate=
d. When someone puts us <br>
down, we may know that it is irrelevant (our i=
nner voice tells us so) <br>
and yet we may feel offended and feel like doi=
ng something about it. All <br>
this comes from conditioning, which has bee=
n accumulated over many <br>
lives.<br>
<br>
Idnetifying the conditioning a=
s it works on our instincts, thoughts, <br>
calculations and actions, is no=
t easy. But it is not impossible. The key <br>
is to learn to listen to the=
 inner voice of conscience. Whenever the <br>
inner voice of conscience is =
telling us one thing and we are impelled <br>
from inside to do otherwise, =
we can conclude that that is the work of <br>
conditioning. We often suppre=
ss the inner voice of conscience and obey <br>
the inner voice of our condi=
tioning.<br>
<br>
If we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller actions - phys=
ical or mental <br>
- that go against the inner voice of conscience, it mea=
ns our <br>
conditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaningful m=
easure of <br>
spiritual progress. This may in general be difficult for oth=
ers to <br>
judge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.<br>
<br>
The tr=
icky thing is that our self-analysis and self-judgment is also <br>
control=
led by our conditioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action against <br>
my in=
ner voice. Suppose I want to analyze what just happened and whether <br>
I =
violated my inner voice of conscience. That whole process is governed <br>
=
by the conditioning too. Depending on how deeply I am conditioned to <br>
t=
hink that I am a good person doing the right thing and not making a <br>
mi=
stake, my mind will be impelled to label the inner voice of conscience <br>=

as a voice of confusion and not accord it any importance. Instead, it <br>=

will focus on the inner voice of conditioning (which shouts out from <br>
=
inside the reasons that justify the action!) and conclude that I did the <b=
r>
right thing.<br>
<br>
The grip of conditioning is too tight to overcome =
in a day or two! But, <br>
the inner voice of conscience does tell everyone=
 when one is doing <br>
something wrong under the influence of conditioning=
. If one keeps <br>
trying, it can oneday help one identify and overcome co=
nditioning.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
SPECIAL EXPERIENCES<br>
<=
br>
Sometimes, as one makes spiritual progress, one may have super-normal o=
r <br>
mystical or out-of-body experiences, visions and dreams.<br>
<br>
Fo=
r example, one person I know started to feel very light in the head <br>
wi=
th a vision of bright light of a particular color, when he meditated <br>
w=
ith a specific mantra. Another person felt like there was a big fire at <br=
>
the base of his spine and the entire lower back was on fire (he actually =
<br>
felt unbearably hot), when he meditated with a specific mantra. Anothe=
r <br>
person saw a deity appear in front of him and the deity talked to hi=
m. <br>
Interestingly, the same deity was seen by another person who was al=
so <br>
sitting there at the same time and that person had a totally differ=
ent <br>
(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same deity at the =
same <br>
time. Another person felt like he became very light and was float=
ing in <br>
air and there was an inexpressible happiness. In another case, =
one <br>
sadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense that his job was=
 done <br>
on earth and he could now leave. He thought, "let me leave and l=
et me <br>
take some more with me". He felt like he was a point moving up w=
ith a <br>
tremendous speed. At the same time, another person who was medit=
ating a <br>
few feet away in front of a homam fire felt like somebody was =
pulling <br>
that person forcibly through a cave and felt really overwhelme=
d.<br>
<br>
There are so many possible experiences. But the key point is th=
at <br>
experiences are secondary. They are NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIEN=
T for <br>
spiritual progress. I had my share of experiences, progress and =
setbacks <br>
and I am 100% sure of the above. You'll do well to remember t=
his <br>
sentence and not be swayed by stories of experiences or desire the=
m <br>
consciously or sub-consciously. I will elabate a little later on the=
 <br>
grave dangers of desiring experiences.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<b=
r>
<br>
EXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION<br>
<br>
We say that god can b=
e known only by experience and not by reading <br>
books. That is not incor=
rect. However, when one is deeply desirous of an <br>
experience, one may e=
xperience an aspect of god's Delusory Power instead <br>
of god and that ma=
y increase false pride (a true experience of god will <br>
instead produce =
infinite humility). Not all experiences are equal.<br>
<br>
There is a famo=
us quote: An ounce of experience is better than a ton of <br>
theory. Thoug=
h that is true in a way, it is not complete. Even a ton of <br>
experience =
is useless if produces a quintal of ego. Instead, a ton of <br>
theory may =
actually be better if it actually reduces one's ego to a <br>
pound or an o=
unce!<br>
<br>
The issue is not whether one needs practical experience or t=
heoretical <br>
understanding. That is secondary. The primary thing is what=
 is happening <br>
to one's ego. Is it getting inflated or deflated? THAT i=
s undoubtedly <br>
the main issue. If reading books, satsanga, rituals, the=
oretical <br>
understanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal, from a =
quintal to <br>
a pound and from a pound to an ounce, even without a direct=
 experience, <br>
that's awesome. That is better than getting a ton of expe=
rience and ego <br>
being inflated from a pound to a quintal.<br>
<br>
Thou=
gh it is true that ego does not become complete zero without an <br>
"exper=
ience" of god in the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that <br>
"experie=
nce" when one's ego is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce it <br>
to as=
 small a quantity as you can. Experience of god will then come by <br>
itse=
lf.<br>
<br>
In the famous Indian movie "3 Idiots", there is a nice line: "=
Don't <br>
chase success, but chase capability. Success will follow automat=
ically." <br>
Similarly, don't chase experiences, but chase detachment and =
deflation <br>
of ego. Experience will automatically follow. Chasing experi=
ence without <br>
trying to reduce ego is like putting the cart before the =
horse. To use <br>
the analogy from the movie "3 Idiots", one then runs the=
 risk of <br>
becoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur Ramalingam (alias=
 Silencer) <br>
of that movie, who chased success, ended up with huge ego f=
rom limited <br>
success and failed in the end!<br>
<br>
*        *        =
*<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING<br>
<br>
As said above, it is a bad =
idea to seek an "experience" when one's ego <br>
is still a ton or a quinta=
l. In other words, when one's conditioning is <br>
dense enough, a pre-occu=
pation with experiences can be <br>
counter-productive. The reason is that =
any experience will be <br>
interpreted (and absorbed into one's system!!!)=
 through the color of <br>
one's conditioning.<br>
<br>
If I go into the op=
en and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I will see <br>
that Sun is orange.=
 But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass <br>
windows of a house. O=
r suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through <br>
green eyeglasses. In=
 either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am <br>
experiencing the real=
 Sun, but I will get the wrong knowledge that "Sun <br>
is green".<br>
<br>=

Similarly, even a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN <br>=

generate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one's conditioning is <br=
>
conducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).<br>
<br>
The key is not just to exper=
ience, but the ability to interpet, *digest* <br>
and absorb the experience=
 into one's system well. One's conditioning <br>
influences how one digests=
 various life experiences, including spiritual <br>
experiences and mystica=
l experiences, like the green eye glasses in the <br>
above example!<br>
<b=
r>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
DIGESTION OF EXPERIENCES<br>
<br>
In ayurve=
dic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a toxic <br>
buildup in=
 the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into various <br>
tissues=
 and create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look and <br>
feel =
healthy despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one <br>
deve=
lops serious diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts <br>
o=
f the body. The ama may even interfere with the digestion of good food <br>=

being taken in and the working of even medicines one may take in. When <br=
>
too much ama has accumulated and destabilizes the system, one may need <b=
r>
to go through a painful de-toxification process.<br>
<br>
Similarly, spi=
ritual experiences one cannot digest well become spiritual <br>
ama, a toxi=
c buildup in the subtle system. It can slowly build up, get <br>
absorbed i=
nto various aspects of one's being and create various diseases <br>
in the =
subtle system. In the beginning, one may look and feel <br>
spiritually hea=
lthy despite such issues, but, when too much spiritual <br>
ama accumulates=
, one develops serious spirituality disorders. It can <br>
eventually affec=
t one's entire being. The spiritual pancha-karma (for <br>
de-toxification)=
 may be far more difficult than the physical <br>
pancha-karma.<br>
<br>
* =
       *        *<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS<br>
<br>
To illustrate =
what I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a <br>
*hypothetica=
l* example.<br>
<br>
Suppose someone sits still for a few hours everyday an=
d meditates. <br>
Suppose one starts to get some special inner experiences =
and some <br>
seemingly supernatural things start happening externally arou=
nd one. <br>
Suppose these experiences give one the impression that one is =
special <br>
and one is making excellent spiritual progress. Suppose one re=
ads some <br>
spiritual books and fantasizes "becoming like Shiva" mentione=
d in those <br>
books. Then one may start to think "may be, I have become l=
ike Shiva" <br>
and slowly convince oneself that one HAS become like Shiva.=
 Suppose one <br>
reads a spiritual book that claims "If one becomes like S=
hiva, the whole <br>
universe connives against one who causes an offense to=
 him".<br>
<br>
Of course, there is a context behind every statement and no=
 statement is <br>
absolute. If one misses the nuances, one may digest and =
absorb it into <br>
one's system incorrectly. After all, one could have als=
o said, "if one <br>
becomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully co-operat=
es with one and <br>
there is no way anyone can really cause offense to tha=
t person".<br>
<br>
Anyway, one in the process of convincing oneself that o=
ne has indeed <br>
become like Shiva may then look for examples of someone =
causing offense <br>
and suffering bad things. Of course, just as one can f=
ind any shapes in <br>
clouds, one can find any correlations in things happ=
ening around one. <br>
One will find a few examples. That may reinforce the=
 delusion that one <br>
has become like Shiva. When good and bad happen to =
people around one, <br>
one may start correlating them to good and bad done=
 by those people to <br>
one and/or to things one has done. Over time, the =
delusion may become so <br>
deep that it just feels so natural and obvious.=
 This is like a serious <br>
disease developing from a toxic buildup of und=
igested or badly digested <br>
food. Inability to fully understand the spir=
itual experiences one had, <br>
the fantasy of becoming like Shiva, the pre=
-exising pride (like <br>
pre-existing ama) and the not-so-well-digested no=
tion that offense to <br>
Shiva causes harm, have together created spiritua=
l ama buildup that now <br>
resulted in a serious disease.<br>
<br>
Though =
original experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming <br>
later o=
n MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from the <br>
ill-di=
gested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is <br>
conduciv=
e to creating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of <br>
the sys=
tem can spread to others.<br>
<br>
As said before, the key issue is: Is the=
 ego getting inflated or <br>
deflated. If ego is getting inflated, then on=
e is on the wrong track. <br>
One is either deluding oneself or ill-digesti=
ng genuine experiences due <br>
to pre-existing conditioning and delusions =
(spiritual ama). In either <br>
case, whatever one is experiencing is not b=
eing digested well and is <br>
weakening the system instead of strengthenin=
g it. If, on the other hand, <br>
ego is getting deflated, then one is on t=
he right track. Whatever one is <br>
experiencing is being digested well an=
d strengthening the system.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
SHAKTI, S=
IDDHIS AND MIRACLES<br>
<br>
This emphasis on ego deflation may make some p=
eople wonder about the <br>
prominence given in some books to accumulation =
of shakti, siddhis and <br>
miracles. For example, some books describe what=
 a being like Shiva or <br>
someone less but still with high enough shakti,=
 can do.<br>
<br>
Yes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings close to enli=
ghtenment MAY <br>
have a lot of spiritual shakti and be able to do some sp=
ecial things. <br>
But, no book said that you get those abilities by being =
proud or <br>
pursuing something that can make one proud.<br>
<br>
In fact,=
 if one looks at those abilities described in books and adores <br>
them fr=
om one's *current* levels of dense conditioning, it is quite akin <br>
to l=
ooking at a "green Sun" from green eyeglasses and admiring the <br>
greenne=
ss of that Sun!!! In other words, one has missed the whole point. <br>
One =
with dense conditioning can't even understand what that shakti or <br>
abil=
ity really means or comes from. In order to understand what shakti <br>
is,=
 to accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one MUST <br>
deflat=
e one's ego.<br>
<br>
Bottomline is this: Most scriptures of most religions=
 are unanimous in <br>
teaching the importance of humility, compassion and =
ego deflation. No <br>
scripture talks about the glory of pride and ego inf=
lation. It's as <br>
simple as that.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
=
GODS, GODDESSES, VISIONS & CONVERSATIONS<br>
<br>
We encounter some peo=
ple who claim to have visions of gods and goddesses <br>
and also conversat=
ions with them. When probed, there is nothing sublime <br>
coming from the =
divine beings in their encounters. Whatever the divine <br>
beings supposed=
ly said is well within what one consciously or <br>
sub-consciously already=
 knew or believed or wanted to believe.<br>
<br>
This may remind one of the=
 encounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character <br>
played by Sanjay Dutt i=
n hit bollywood movie "Lage Rahe Munnabhai". In <br>
that movie, the vision=
s are due to "chemical imbalance" in Munnabhai's <br>
mind and the Gandhi h=
e sees and can talk to, cannot answer questions <br>
that Munnabhai himself=
 does not know (but real Gandhi should know). So <br>
the conclusion is tha=
t the person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a <br>
character in his own mind =
constructed based on what Munnabhai <br>
understands of Gandhi.<br>
<br>
In=
 the case of divine encounters, it may be a little different from this <br>=

movie. It MAY be a divine being one truly fancied meeting based on all <br=
>
that one consciously and sub-consciously knew already, OR it may be a <br=
>
real being. Even in the latter case, the being and his/her actions are <b=
r>
interpreted strictly based on one's conditioning, like the "green Sun" <=
br>
in our previous example. So, no wonder, in most cases, what divine <br>=

beings say fits well within the realm of knowledge one consciously or <br>=

sub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.<br>
<br>
In=
 the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditioning having a <br>
rea=
l divine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mother or <br>
fat=
her, and there is a real flow of divine and sublime understanding and <br>
=
wisdom.<br>
<br>
Again, the key is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be=
 <br>
de-conditioned enough to really benefit from it!<br>
<br>
*        * =
       *<br>
<br>
KUNDALINI AWAKENING & RISE<br>
<br>
One more thing pe=
ople often talk about is Kundalini awakening and rise. <br>
Kundalini shakt=
i is that through which we are aware of self (i.e. this <br>
is "I"). Kunda=
lini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra means one does not <br>
even questio=
n who one is and assumes the normal self-awareness that ties <br>
self down=
 to the physical body and physical senses. However, <br>
self-awareness ris=
ing above this does not necessarily mean spiritual <br>
progress or enlight=
enment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of <br>
a long process. I=
f one's conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle <br>
ideas of who one=
 is (e.g. I am a great spiritual soul who saved the <br>
world many times i=
n the past and came back to save it), an awakened <br>
Kundalini may take o=
ne's notion of self beyond the physical body, but <br>
will get stuck somew=
here else. In fact, one's subtle notions of self may <br>
become aggrandize=
d when Kundalini reaches conducive regions and one may <br>
experience thin=
gs that aggravate and strengthen those notions. One may <br>
get badly stuc=
k.<br>
<br>
As mentioned above, any spiritual experience can create spiritu=
al ama <br>
when not digested properly. Any pre-existing conditioning may m=
ake it <br>
difficult to digest anything complex. Instead of eating a heavy=
-duty <br>
protein bar that one cannot digest and getting toxic buildup in =
the <br>
system, one is better off eating simple food that one's own system=
 can <br>
process and digest well.<br>
<br>
To be clear, whether one's Kund=
alini is awakened or not, and where one's <br>
Kundalini is currently, is N=
OT a measure of one's spiritual progress. As <br>
Kundalini does not rise t=
hrough a single path, as the rise is not linear <br>
and as the obstruction=
s are not uniform in all people, one cannot <br>
compare two people based o=
n Kundalini experiences.<br>
<br>
One can cling to the body and overcome al=
l conditioning slowly and <br>
oneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the=
 way to Sahasrara. Another <br>
person may awaken Kundalini and it may get =
stuck somewhere where it is <br>
extremely difficult to overcome the corres=
ponding conditioning.<br>
<br>
The bottomline is that how much conditioning=
 is overcome and how reduced <br>
one's ego is is the correct measure of sp=
iritual progress and not <br>
whether Kundalini is awakened and where Kunda=
lini is.<br>
<br>
*        *        *<br>
<br>
CORRELATIONS GALORE<br>
<br>=

Do not get distracted by trying to find *correlations* that may or may <br=
>
not mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell you, "wow, I was <b=
r>
just thinking about you". Or suppose you say something and someone says,=
 <br>
"wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as though you rea=
d <br>
my mind." Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings in some regio=
n of <br>
the world, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad happen=
ed <br>
there. Or suppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did so=
me <br>
sadhana and the desire was fulfilled.<br>
<br>
In several such case=
s, correlating a result with something you did can <br>
often increase prid=
e and your sense of self-worth. And, doing that will <br>
not enable you to=
 do your dharma any better.<br>
<br>
Keep thinking your thoughts and desire=
s, keep doing your actions and <br>
keep doing your sadhana. That's it. Don=
't correlate actions and results <br>
and think that you made X or Y result=
 happen. We engage in actions and <br>
god gives results. The sense of "I m=
ade X happen" is conducive to pride <br>
and ego inflation. Moreover, you c=
an *never* know *for sure* whether <br>
action A or B caused result X or Y,=
 because the action-result pipeline <br>
has variable delay!! So, why even =
bother to correlate and run the risk <br>
of ego inflation?<br>

Don't run after special experien=
ces and special abilities or anything <br>
that makes you special (as you i=
magine currently, based on your dense <br>
conditioning). Spiritual progres=
s is not about becoming "special", but <br>
about becoming humble. Special =
experiences and abilities do not matter <br>
at all. In fact, they can dist=
ract one and give false pride. God makes <br>
one special AFTER one sheds p=
ride completely or almost completely.<br>
<br>
Also, stop correlating thing=
s happening to or around you, with your <br>
actions, and think that you ca=
used events X or Y. Engaging in actions is <br>
your sacred duty and giving=
 whatever results are fit at a given time is <br>
god's prerogative. That i=
s the simplest and safest model one can imbibe <br>
in one's thinking.<br>

<br>
Remember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningful measure of <br>
=
spiritual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble you become <b=
r>
(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have really become=
 <br>
internally). It is how well you are able to resist the temptations of=
 <br>
following the voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and how=
 <br>
well you can follow the voice of conscience.<br>
<br>
When inflations=
 in ego occur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice <br>
it, bring it t=
o the attention and perhaps even be ruthless in belling <br>
the cat [of eg=
o]. But most gurus now-a-days may not do that well. So, <br>
you have to do=
 your best to avoid any serious ego inflations.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the=
 path of spiritual progress and self-realization IS <br>
very very very lik=
ely for most of us to include many many many <br>
opportunities for very ve=
ry very serious ego inflation! So keep a strict <br>
watch on your ego.<br>=
