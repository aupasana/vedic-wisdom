Hi to All,

    This is my understanding.

     Living life naturally is the ultimate meditation. Living at the 
present moment. Living truthful to the self is greatest meditation 
purifies oneself internally. Gradually one will realize everything is ok 
- i am also ok.
Then life is a music, which you live moment to moment and enjoy with it.
No Sadhna is Required. At the end one has to drop everything to Attain 
the liberation.

As the vedic rishis said the the goal of human lifes is to attain 
liberation, life after life they will be lead towards liberation. 
Remember the River always flows towards sea to unite with that.
and understand that "The Fish is Already in the Sea."

Regards,
Suresha H

              I would like to add my few thoughts here. Sincerity &
              intensity of Intentions are 2 of the most valuable of
              attributes. If one is ready for certain level of Sadhana,
              one will get all the resources by supreme power. if one is
              ready for so called "Mahavidya Sadhana", one will be
              provided suitable resources for that. even real teacher
              will come at ones door-step to teach. To give an
              instcance, I know a friend who is doing Homa, Chandi paath
              and such Sadhana for few years. though he has devotion to
              form of Mother Goddess, he has no desire for Mahavidya
              sadhana and does not even do casual search for any
              informnations on the internet. he knows that Mother will
              provde the intense desire and resources at the right time
              if at all that Sadhana is needed.<br>
              really, for almost everybody, specifically for people got
              in to family business, the only bhavana needs to be
              developed is to become a child of Supreme Mother
              (Jagadamba or Rama or Krishna or Shiva or Budhha or Guru
              or Rishi or jesus or Allah or...) in present world. <br>
              I have highest admiration for Thakur Ramakrishna or
              Vimalananda because they both gave the Identical message
              which is the most important message of our time
              atleast-IMO. "Be a child in the lap of devine Mother" and
              then Mahavidya or even post-Mahavidya will be provided, if
              needed.<br>
