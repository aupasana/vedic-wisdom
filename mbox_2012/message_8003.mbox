A cataract is a clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye o=
r in its envelope (lens capsule), varying in degree from slight to complete=
 opacity and obstructing the passage of light.This is common nowadays. Its =
treatment is also done by lot of Government and many more Service Organizat=
ions like Rotary, Lions, etc., There is no transplantation required here. R=
emoval of outer layer. In extreme cases of old age people, it may be requir=
ed. This is not the main cause of blindness as depicted by statistics.=C2=
=A0

Blindness by birth is mostly caused by damage to retina and optic nerv=
e, which cannot be treated now.


In Modern Science there is no proof for t=
he claim that eye donation gives Punya. But Dharmic texts are the deciders =
of Paapa & Punya. According to that Anga or Angamsha Daana is not at all ac=
cepted. 


Please remove the name donation =3D daana. It is just a business=
 (Kraya-Vikraya). Its a lobby is most parts of the world. If one tries to t=
ransplant any organ to any other by surgeries, the body of acceptor never a=
ccept that and it will be in the process of rejecting the same!! 


Does an=
y part of modern science has any strong explanation for the cause of blindn=
ess by birth? Why a particular person 'X' has to loose his/her eye sight? W=
hy only the person 'Y' got Kidney failure? What's the reason behind it? 


=
Only Karma Siddantha can answer all these questions. Vaidhika Bauthashastra=
 is infinite fold advanced than that of the modern science which is not eve=
n a baby in front of that!!

=C2=A0 
Sir

You are =
taking an miniscule proportion of the donation rejection cases and claiming=
 that donation does not work. These are the statistics below for eye donati=
ons done successfully yearly in India.

I am quoting directly from Indian e=
xpress.

http://www.indianexpress.com/news/a-lot-needs-to-be-done-to-create=
-awareness-on-eye-donation/551681/0

1. 1/3rd of the world's blind populati=
on is in India and most of them go blind due to preventable cataract format=
ion and other issues.

2.Sankara Netrayala as mentioned in the article is a=
n acclaimed organization which on a average conducts on a average 1000 eye =
transplantation surgeries.

1000!!!! lives impacted with one organization..=
.is that an small number. Still millions wait for an surgery to gain eyesig=
ht. 

By the way ..Sankara Netrayala is associated with the Kanchi peetham =
and was inspired by the clarion call of Sri Jayendra Saraswathi in the 1970=
's. Also the Kanchi peetham has an annex centre associated with Sankara Net=
ralaya. 

Kanchi peetham also works with the Sankara eye foundation

http:/=
/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankara_Nethralaya

http://www.sankaranethralaya.org=
/patient-care-jkcn.html

Nobody is advocating not following the samskaras a=
fter death.What is preventing the following of the samskara for rest of the=
 corpse.

Which is an greater punya , using an part of the body after the s=
oul has left to bring alive the life of another person or blindly sticking =
to dogma.

Vemparla RamKishore
