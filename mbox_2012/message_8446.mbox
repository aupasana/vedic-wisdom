=C2=A0 
Hi,
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0It was nice to see =C2=A0your le=
tter and read about your experience. There is no need to feel embarrassment=
 as a great deal of people feel unhappy talking about ghost/spirit although=
 they might say otherwise. And what you experienced was very frightening at=
 such a young age but it will prove positive for you in future. One day soo=
n or later you will become a teacher yourself and give Diksha to others and=
 if somebody asks your help in such a situation you will draw on your exper=
ience and not on some bookish knowledge.

=C2=A0I have to say that I have e=
xperienced a great deal of such similar disturbing incident . Each and ever=
y time I have been saved by Grace of Divine mother. I will woke up shouting=
 and reciting Divine names. Sometimes I would know what might be the cause =
of such a attack. I never dismiss such incidents as just my imagination=C2=
=A0and try to take proper action by going over the things I have done previ=
ous day. I am also able to see very easily spirits/beings etc and some year=
s back I used to give deep healing to certain persons whom I had never met =
so they might go to higher dimensions and become free from cycle. And I alw=
ays ask Divine Mother's permission for it. Last year in Oct. ancestors of v=
ery famous family in England suddenly appeared in my front room where I was=
 doing my everyday japa and indicated they need similar sort of healing. Th=
ey were a couple who were very famous when they were alive. I became very n=
ervous and got up and avoided touching them
 and went to my Puja Room to as=
k for guidance. Divine Mother immediately refused any healing for them thro=
ugh me. They have sort of disappeared since then.

I am puzzled by somethin=
g you said.You will pester -Her- for help. Help for What?? They are Sister =
And Brother and in fact They are One and Same. This world is creation of Di=
vine Mother. She is in it and also far away from it.And when She is meshed =
up with Her devotees She feels joy and pain as well. And if you will pray a=
nd worship Her for this reason She might not say anything but some heart st=
ring will not play right. And Her Big Brother will also look at Her. I woul=
d hold Her Feet for Her sake and do the likewise for Divine Lord.

When I w=
as living in Brijbhoomi, it was the ashram of disciples of Swami Shivanand =
=C2=A0where I have rented a room. When I came back to London I kept receivi=
ng pamphlets from the Sivanand Yoga centre for several years. I never atten=
ded any workshop there but I used to cut out the pictures and names of Divi=
ne Mother and keep them in my books.

Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Hello LaxmiNaray=
anji,

Thanks for the encouraging message. The thought of Vishnu turning on=
 his watery resting place and glancing in this direction is rather sweet. Y=
ou've motivated me to do the mantra with even more enthusiasm now. Thank yo=
u. :) I will pester Her for help with this......Ramakrishna says you have t=
o keep tugging at Her sari till she gives you something vaguely worthwhile =
like devotion.

Very interesting to hear of your experience in Delhi. I agr=
ee that the Name provides protection against dodgy situations. I don't like=
 to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I'm embarrassed to say that have alw=
ays been scared of the dark since childhood, slowly getting over it now. 

=
Once at university, around 7 years ago, I was preparing for some exams. It =
was after term-time and I had stayed back to revise.=C2=A0 I was moved to a=
 room that was different to the one I had been staying in, as my usual room=

 was being used for some conference guests. I used to hang out with the Ha=
re Krishnas then, and was really into chanting the Hare Rama mahamantra the=
n (still love this mantra, but chant Om Namo Narayanaya more now)- used to =
do 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. 

I was lying on my back in this=
 new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in some sort of light sleep=
 state. At that point I had a very nasty sensation that can only be describ=
ed as something or someone trying really hard to strangle me! I felt very f=
rightened, and couldn't move, speak or wake myself up.

In this state, my m=
ind started repeating "Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, Hari" very very fast in terro=
r. I think I chose this name because it was short and I could say it very f=
ast with concentration! The frightening experience then passed and I felt t=
he Name saved me.

I woke up and turned on the light feeling absolutely pet=
rified and unable to go back to sleep. I then did something I wouldn't norm=
ally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in London at that time of night (=
I knew they don't sleep till about midnight as I've stayed there) and had t=
he nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who initiated me into my =
chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she very kindly came to the =
phone and reassured me saying it could have been some real negative force o=
r just something from my imagination. Either way, she reassured me saying I=
 had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating the Name was the right a=
pproach. She suggested chanting before bedtime to avoid similar experiences=
. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra before going to bed and slep=
t fine (had to sleep with the light though on because I'm a coward ;).

Sin=
ce then, I keep up the practice of repeating the Name before bedtime. I fee=
l it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings positive Divine energy to my=
 mind ensuring better sleep. :)

Best wishes,

Aparna

=3D"yiv695049507mark">LaxmiNarayanji</span>,<br><br>Thanks for the encourag=
ing message. The thought of Vishnu turning on his watery resting place and =
glancing in this direction is rather sweet. You've motivated me to do the m=
antra with even more enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for he=
lp with this......Ramakrishna says you have to keep tugging at Her sari til=
l she gives you something vaguely worthwhile like devotion.<br><br>Very int=
eresting to hear of your experience in Delhi. I agree that the Name provide=
s protection against dodgy situations. I don't like to think about ghosts/s=
pirits etc.... I'm embarrassed to say that have always been scared of the d=
ark since childhood, slowly getting over it now. <br><br>Once at university=
,
 around 7 years ago, I was preparing for some exams. It was after term-ti=
me and I had stayed back to revise.  I was moved to a room that was di=
fferent to the one I had been staying in, as my usual room
 was being used =
for some conference guests. I used to hang out with the Hare <span id=3D"yi=
v695049507misspell-14" class=3D"yiv695049507mark">Krishnas</span> then, and=
 was really into chanting the Hare Rama <span id=3D"yiv695049507misspell-15=
" class=3D"yiv695049507mark">mahamantra</span> then (still love this mantra=
, but chant Om <span id=3D"yiv695049507misspell-16" class=3D"yiv695049507ma=
rk">Namo</span> <span id=3D"yiv695049507misspell-17" class=3D"yiv695049507m=
ark">Narayanaya</span> more now)- used to do 2 hours a day and it made me f=
eel good. <br><br>I was lying on my back in this new room trying to sleep a=
round 11 pm, and was in some sort of light sleep state. At that point I had=
 a very nasty sensation that can only be described as something or someone =
trying really hard to strangle me! I felt very frightened, and couldn't mov=
e, speak or wake myself up.<br><br>In this state, my mind started repeating=
 "<span id=3D"yiv695049507misspell-18"

was short and I could say it very fast with concentration! The frightening =
experience then passed and I felt the Name saved me.<br><br>I woke up and t=
urned on the light feeling absolutely petrified and unable to go back to sl=
eep. I then did something I wouldn't normally do. I rang the <span id=3D"yi=
v695049507misspell-23" class=3D"yiv695049507mark">Sivananda</span> Yoga cen=
tre in London at that time of night (I knew they don't sleep till about mid=
night as I've stayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior=
 lady Swami who initiated me into my chosen mantra.
 Despite the late hour =
of 11 pm, she very kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it coul=
d have been some real negative force or just something from my imagination.=
 Either way, she reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, =
and repeating
 the Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting befo=
re bedtime to avoid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the =
<span id=3D"yiv695049507misspell-24" class=3D"yiv695049507mark">Mahamantra<=
/span> before going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light thou=
gh on because I'm a coward ;).<br><br>Since then, I keep up the <span id=3D=
"yiv695049507misspell-25" class=3D"yiv695049507mark">practice</span> of rep=
eating the Name before bedtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! An=

of God). <br>> <br>> At any point in time, there are several human be=
