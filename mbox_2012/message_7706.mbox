=C2=A0Dear Srikanth,
=C2=A0
Jai Ma Durga!
=C2=A0
<<I would no=
t want to argue ..>>
=C2=A0
Never stop yourself from arguing if you think y=
our point of view has logic! I do it always, irrespective of consequences. =
So your mail and view point is thoroughly welcome as far as I'm concerned.
=
=C2=A0
I will try to explain a few points from your reply, as I see it.
=C2=
=A0
<<It is not their identity that you see, it is the identity which we ha=
ve been exposed to since ages. Just an analogy, Tendulkar may actually be a=
 great father at home but we only saw the perceivable cricketer aspect of h=
im as it is known to your outside world which dwells on popularity or a pro=
nounced thing. Kali is dreadful Goddess to many who see her physical aspect=
 but I did see many homes in Kolkata praying her as family Goddess. All exp=
eriences are PERSONAL in nature between us and the deity and can be abstrac=
t from a different view point.>>
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
You see my basic point is th=
at Tendulkar is a cricketing genius to 120 Crore Indians, while his identit=
y as a father is limited to 2 children. If you approach Tendulkar and call =
him father, he may feel weird about it.=C2=A0 Now deities of course are far=
 more subtle and complex. One of names of Kaali in her sahashranama is also=
=C2=A0Lalita. If you worship Kaali and expect Her to come to you in the for=
m of Lalita, because the Sahasrahanama of=C2=A0Kaali has the name Lalita,=
=C2=A0=C2=A0chances are that=C2=A0it may result in=C2=A0a hodgepodge. In th=
e worst case it may result in fright. To give a very crude example, this is=
 like buying the DVD for the movie "The Exorcist" while consciously and sub=
-consciously expecting to see "Kaho Na Pyar Hai"!
=C2=A0
Yes Kaali is the m=
ost worshipped deity in Bengal for various historical reasons, chief of whi=
ch being that fantastic amount of Kali worshippers have lived in Bengal/Ass=
am/Tripura/Odisha. This has caused=C2=A0the notion of Kali to get ingrained=
 in the very culture. Even sufis in Bengal worship Kaali. But the key is to=
 accept Her and love Her, AS SHE IS! Which means, say if you find the garla=
nd of skulls on her neck and the skull in her hand disturbing, or if you fi=
nd the blood-dripping from the freshly cut head in Her hand difficult to re=
late to, you cannot cannot replace=C2=A0those from her iconography and expe=
ct to get clear results from your worship. Love Her the way She is, in her =
ferocity and wildness and beauty. When you do that, you're game.=C2=A0Yes S=
he=C2=A0can be dreadful, but that is how She is loved by her devotees, with=
out trying to modify Her innate nature and characteristics. Relate to Her a=
s Ma, but don't ask Her to remove the skulls. 
=C2=A0
The=C2=A0traditional=
=C2=A0idea, which I believe to be correct,=C2=A0is to worship the form in t=
he way it is and love and relate to it in all its attributes. I know a cert=
ain person who used to=C2=A0worship a very fierce form of Devi but mentally=
 was=C2=A0unable to relate to that form. She was adviced by her guru to do =
so, who used to worship that fierce form himself. When I asked her what doe=
s she feel about the deity, she said I mentally think of Her of Gouri but p=
erform the ritual for the fierce form=C2=A0as my Guru asked me to. I of cou=
rse had no business interfering in the relationship between a Guru and his =
disciple and so kept my mouth shut, but personally I was extremely skeptica=
l of this approach. When you can't even love=C2=A0the form you are worshipp=
ing, then what kind of worship is that? Later she met another individual wh=
o acted as a mentor and gave her a mantra of a much milder form of God. Tod=
ay=C2=A0the lady spends nearly=C2=A08 hours every day immersed in the worsh=
ip of
 that milder=C2=A0form. Her spiritual life leap-frogged once she star=
ted worshipping the milder form of God. Thats why the Tantras stress so hea=
vily on the importance of=C2=A0correct form for each individual. 
=C2=A0
=
=C2=A0
It is not my contention that worshipping an urga deity is difficult =
or simple compared to worshipping a milder form. Both are difficult and to =
succeed in any worship=C2=A0a combination of various factors must fall in p=
lace. It's like trying to judge, which among Rugby and Table-tennis, is a m=
ore difficult game. Some like one, some like the other, but you cannot pass=
 a judgement about which is more dificult.

=C2=A0 
Jai Maa Durge.

Rajarshiji,

Again, M=
y two cents with my own humble understanding:

It is not their identity tha=
t you see, it is the identity which we have been exposed to since ages. Jus=
t an analogy, Tendulkar may actually be a great father at home but we only =
saw the perceivable cricketer aspect of him as it is known to your outside =
world which dwells on popularity or a pronounced thing. Kali is dreadful Go=
ddess to many who see her physical aspect but I did see many homes in Kolka=
ta praying her as family Goddess. All experiences are PERSONAL in nature be=
tween us and the deity and can be abstract from a different view point.

Ou=
r Subjective experience is based on density of=C2=A0 Karmas and the associa=
ted Vasanas accumulated over several births coupled with your present life =
(Intensity of it depends on several variables in/out of our control) Sadhan=
a. Mother will reveal the respective band of her spectrum as you progress
 =
further using your free will carefully is my view exactly as your physical =
mother knows when you feel hungry and not in right frame of mind etc etc.(T=
hough over simplified a bit)

In general we all wish to pursue sadhana with=
 a thought that she is not very far away and we indeed have a chance to rea=
ch her or abide by her.

I'm an ant at the foot hills of a mountain and can=
not talk about a glorious mountain like "Sri Lalitha Devi". I worship the D=
urga energies of her when I go on the karmic field and worship her play as =
Lalitha when I enjoy the bhoga(healthy body,Mind,Intellect and Materials) s=
he gave me unasked.

I would not want to argue but you will find many such =
ugra names in "Gayathri Sahasranaam" too.
=C2=A0
This synergistic concept o=
f the Divine Mother was pursued in the sacred literature on Mother worship
=
across many centuries. In the Devi Mahatmya we find the Divine Mother as th=
e most beautiful, benevolent,and

 Saraswati, the redeeming spirit of Durga, the wealth, splendour,and cornuc=
opia of Lakshmi or Sri, and the terribleface of Kali or Gouri.

<div> Dear Srikanth,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jai Ma Durga!</div>

<div><<I would not want to argue ..>></div>
<=

<div>Never stop yourself from arguing if you think your po=
int of view has logic! I do it always, irrespective of consequences. So you=
r mail and view point is thoroughly welcome as far as I'm concerned.</div>
=
<div> </div>
<div>I will try to explain a few points from your reply, =
as I see it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><<It is not their identity =
that you see, it is the identity which we have been exposed to since ages. =
Just an analogy, Tendulkar may actually be a great father at home but we on=
ly saw the perceivable cricketer aspect of him as it is known to your outsi=
de world which dwells on popularity or a pronounced thing. Kali is dreadful=
 Goddess to many who see her physical aspect but I did see many homes in Ko=
lkata praying her as family Goddess. All experiences are PERSONAL in nature=
 between us and the deity and can be abstract from a different view point.&=
gt;></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You see my basic poi=
nt is that Tendulkar is a cricketing genius to 120 Crore Indians, while his=
 identity as a father is limited to 2 children. If you approach Tendulkar a=
nd call him father, he may feel weird about it.  <var id=3D"yiv2288732=
6yui-ie-cursor"></var>Now deities of course are far more subtle and complex=
. One of names of Kaali in her sahashranama is also Lalita. If you wor=
ship Kaali and expect Her to come to you in the form of Lalita, because the=
 Sahasrahanama of Kaali has the name Lalita,  chances are th=
at it may result in a hodgepodge. In the worst case it may result=
 in fright. To give a very crude example, this is like buying the DVD for t=
he movie "The Exorcist" while consciously and sub-consciously expecting to =
see "Kaho Na Pyar Hai"!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yes Kaali is the most =
worshipped deity in Bengal for various historical reasons, chief of which b=
eing that fantastic amount of Kali worshippers have lived in Bengal/Assam/T=
ripura/Odisha. This has caused the notion of Kali to get ingrained in =
the very culture. Even sufis in Bengal worship Kaali. But the key is to acc=
ept Her and love Her, AS SHE IS! Which means, say if you find the garland o=
f skulls on her neck and the skull in her hand disturbing, or if you find t=
he blood-dripping from the freshly cut head in Her hand difficult to relate=
 to, you cannot cannot replace those from her iconography and expect t=
o get clear results from your worship. Love Her the way She is, in her fero=
city and wildness and beauty. When you do that, you're game. Yes She&n=
bsp;can be dreadful, but that is how She is loved by her devotees, without =
trying to modify Her innate nature and characteristics. Relate to Her as Ma=
, but don't ask Her
 to remove the skulls. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Th=
e traditional idea, which I believe to be correct, is to wor=
ship the form in the way it is and love and relate to it in all its attribu=
tes. I know a certain person who used to worship a very fierce form of=
 Devi but mentally was unable to relate to that form. She was adviced =
by her guru to do so, who used to worship that fierce form himself. When I =
asked her what does she feel about the deity, she said I mentally think of =
Her of Gouri but perform the ritual for the fierce form as my Guru ask=
ed me to. I of course had no business interfering in the relationship betwe=
en a Guru and his disciple and so kept my mouth shut, but personally I was =
extremely skeptical of this approach. When you can't even love the for=
m you are worshipping, then what kind of worship is that? Later she met ano=
ther individual who acted as a mentor and gave her a mantra of a much milde=
r form of God. Today the lady spends
 nearly 8 hours every day im=
mersed in the worship of that milder form. Her spiritual life leap-fro=
gged once she started worshipping the milder form of God. Thats why the Tan=
tras stress so heavily on the importance of correct form for each indi=
vidual. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>It is not my =
contention that worshipping an urga deity is difficult or simple compared t=
o worshipping a milder form. Both are difficult and to succeed in any worsh=
ip a combination of various factors must fall in place. It's like tryi=
ng to judge, which among Rugby and Table-tennis, is a more difficult game. =
Some like one, some like the other, but you cannot pass a judgement about w=
hich is more dificult. </div>

<div><span>Dear Srikanth,</span></div>
<div><span></span> </=

<div class=3D"yiv22887326im">
<div><span></span> </div>
=
<div><span><<" Pancha Pretasanasina, Panch Brahmaswarupini" The one w=
ho sits on 4 corpses etc<br><br>and "Aparna Chandika Chanda Mundasura Nishu=

<div><span></span> </div></div>
<div><span>=
Traditionally, so I am told, this verse is ment to understand that She sits=
 on a throne held by five corpses. These five corpses are of Brahma, V=
ishnu, Rudra, Mahadeva and Sadashiva. Simply put, She is representative ene=
rgy of everything. Personally, I don't like this explanation. To me the fiv=
e pretas are the five koshas surrounding the human organism. She controls a=
ll of them.</span></div>
<div><span></span> </div>
<div><span>Now if w=
e take this line literally, She sits on an asana of five pretas - spir=
its of a kind. You must have read the biographies of many siddhas who worsh=
ipped Lalita Tripursundari. How many have you found who has had a vision of=
 Her in this form, sitting on corpses? The Lalita Sahashranama is a complet=
e text of ALL possible attirbutes of Lalita Tripursundari. Of these, what p=
ercentage of names do you find which can be described as ugra?</span></div>=

<div><span></span> </div>
<div><span>Consider this example. If you as=
k 100 people who is Sachin Tendulkar, all will reply that he is a great cri=
cketer. But isn't Tendulkar also a father, brother, son, husband, a respons=
ible citizen of India, a consumer at the local grocery store, and for all y=
ou know maybe even a reasonable bathroom singer? These are all his identiti=
es too. But why don't we refer to them when we speak of Tendulkar? Because =
his central defining identity for us is his cricket.</span></div>
<div><spa=
n></span> </div>
<div><span>Same way, each deity eventually is everyth=
ing. But each has its own "defining identity" which has its own set of attr=
ibutes. Of all the people worshipping Lalita Tripursundari at this very mom=
ent, probably a 2 percent or less will realize Her in this lifetime. O=
f these, 99.9999999999999999999 percent will realize Her ONLY in Her c=
hief identity as Lalita. How many will, or have till date, actually realize=
d that form of Lalita Tripursundari sitting on a pretasana? And why is this=
 form so remote and so uncommon for most standard worshippers of Lalit=
a Tripursundari? These are questions to ponder!</span></div>
<div><span></s=
pan> </div>
<div><span></span> </div>
<div><span>I've very little=
 knowledge of worship of Sri Lalita Tripursundari, either theoritical or fr=
om the point of practical worship, but if there is beauty in this worl=
d, it is Her. Like a five course gourmet meal, like a sublime poe=
try, like an efforlessly brilliant music, like a dazzling play of ligh=
ts, like a classic Tendulkar shot,.... all these combined together and much=
 much more ...you feel and wish that it never comes to an end. It is d=
ifficult to describe the feeling that She evokes, but it's like a flood of =
pure, distilled essence of beauty and you feel like there is nothing m=
ore to be done, no goal to reach, no path to walk, no battles to fight -&nb=
sp;simply bask in the depth of the moment because therein lies fullfilment =
and a whole new world! She banishes the very roots of the sense of strife a=
nd ugliness from your system... the knowledge that She exists is enough to =
incapacitate you from asking anything
 more. She is THE greatest poetr=
y of all possible Universes of all possible cycles of creation.</span></div=
