Namaste friends,
=A0
A few quick points:
=A0
(1) It is possible to disagree=
 with a spiritual giant's views expressed in a work by him, without ridicul=
e or even disrespect.
=A0
(2) Work of some giants starts even before they b=
ecome enlightened. There will be some works that do not represent their fin=
al/full understanding.
=A0
(3) The Truth is sufficiently captured by Veda a=
nd Upanishad. That way, there is no need for any additional works. Though p=
eople cannot comprehend them and need someone to comment on them, nobody ca=
n capture the Truth more perfectly than Veda and Upanishad. So, what ends u=
p happening is that one focuses on a small part of the Truth captured by th=
em and explains it in the desa-kala-patra of one's times.
=A0
Shankaraka wr=
ote commentaries on the ageless Truths of Upanishad, as per his desa-kala-p=
atra. Now, people can't understand even his commentary as it was meant. So =
there are further commentaries on his commentaries, based on OUR desa-kala-=
patra!
=A0
(4) The goal of a master is often not to write something perfect=
 (if so, Veda and Upanishad are already there), but to write something more=
 direct and useful to one's audience. Every master may come with a mission =
and focus on that mission. Adi Shankara's primary mission was to stop the a=
dvance of Buddhism and show how tenets of Buddhism are contained in Vedanta=
.
=A0
(5) If one thinks (like a learned friend of mine does) that every wor=
d of Adi Shankara is gospel and perfect truth, I invite them to read his co=
mmentary on "Ishavasyopanishad" (aka "Ishopanishad"). One can certainly vie=
w it as the great Shankara tying himself in knots! THAT upanishad really ch=
allenges the simplified main message Shankara chose to drive home in THAT i=
ncarnation!
=A0
Contrast it with how Sri Aurobindo does justice to that key=
 Upanishad!
=A0
Best regards,
Narasimha

Dear Utpal,

<<

Philosophy is pure rationa=
l thought. Spirituality on the other hand is experiential. One can sit in a=
n armchair and contemplate on philosophy, but the same is not possible in c=
ase of spirituality. These two are different. Philosophy gives a logical fr=
amework of understanding something. There could be philosophy of science, a=
 philosophy of ethics, a philosophy of spirituality, a philosophy of episte=
mology (the investigations into the process of acquiring knowledge) etc. 

=
That Sri Adi Shankara was a fantastic spiritual giant, I have no doubt (whi=
ch I have already stated in my previous email. Vibhuti of God). I am also s=
ure that the very presence of such a man of such spiritual stature would ha=
ve naturally drawn masses towards him.=A0 It happens with all great persona=
lities. They have a magnetism which extends=A0 way beyond after their death=
. 

However, to understand, appreciate, criticize, debate, analyses, compar=
atively-evaluate any philosophy of any individual is not that difficult and=
 is a valid rational process. 

While future is always uncertain, but chanc=
es look remote for me that I would find Mayavada more attractive. It was Sr=
i Adi Shankara's Mayavada - as is understood and propagated by his follower=
s - which I had studied when I was first trying to get a grasp of Hindu phi=
losophy. It a nice, compact and easily understandable philosophy. Possibly =
one the chief reasons why most=A0 intellectuals like his Adwaitha apart fro=
m being attracted by his personality. It is easier to debate from Sri Shank=
ara's stand-point. At that time I liked it. Later as I got acquainted mysel=
f with more varieties of Hindu philosophy, I found others more comprehensiv=
e and covering more essential points and using a very, if I may use this ph=
rase, a bottom-up=A0 approach to understanding reality, while Sri Shankara'=
s philosophy is a very top-down approach, with a greater thrust on the top =
and an indeterminate leftover in the bottom. Shankara's Adwaitha, Ramanujac=
harya's Visistha-adwaitha,
 Vallavacharya's Suddha Adwaitha - so many varie=
ties of philosophy. 

I have a personal view about judging philosophy. For =
everything that one giant has said, there is always another one who has sai=
d exactly the opposite. And a third and forth one who came up with a differ=
ent view-point, differing with all the previous ones. And each of these gia=
nts have spoken with the utmost conviction of their own realizations of tru=
ths. So personality and stature of the philosopher should play no role in a=
n objective analysis of the philosophy. Just like the personality and statu=
re of a mathematician is of no use in=A0 judging the correctness of a mathe=
matical theory.=A0 Spiritually, the reality is same (and it maybe a very=A0=
 complex reality). But philosophically each have differences which cannot t=
he ignored. In such an intellectual climate, in my personal opinion, it is =
fair enough to discard one philosophy for another, after a thorough and det=
ailed contemplation of the pros and cons. 

>From a spiritual view-point all=
 this is utterly meaningless. Which ever spiritual giant one chooses to han=
g on to, if sincere faith, reverence and effort is engaged, surely progress=
 will happen in time. But philosophy is a another matter. 

[To make my sta=
nd clearer, let me say hypothetically that IF by some strange miracle of Go=
d, Sri Adi Shankara were to come and stand infornt of me, I would have no q=
ualms about falling at his feet and bowing down to him and asking for his b=
lessings, for his spiritual stature is unquestionable. Yet I will still not=
 be agreeable to the philosophy he propagated during the time he lived.]

actually "rejecting" may not=

>=
 There are three basic layer of this Universe. The physical, the astral or =
subtle layer, and the causal (karana jagat) layer. In this subtle layer, wh=
ich lies superimposed on our own physical plane, there is a whole wide worl=
d of all possible forces, just like in our own world. It is a layer which i=
s created out of force of pranashakti. This force of pranashakti in humans =
beings is what causes all emotive movements on the consciousness - joy, hap=
piness, love, passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, disgust, lust, attachment=
s etc etc. These are also capable of influencing the thinking mind is us. N=
ow the core philosophy of sadhana and specially Tantrik sadhana, is to crea=
te a formation of the deity using ones own prana-shakti through the aid of =
repeated rituals and procedures and mantras etc. If you think carefully, yo=
u will realize that every idol, ever homa agni needs a pranapratisthapana r=
itual before starting. The sadhaka used the force of his/her=A0 own 
>=A0 p=
ranashakti to infuse life into a subtle formation of the deity. Once this p=
rocess is successfully done, this sublte formation of the deity which exist=
s in the subtle plane, has a life of its own. It can then guide the sadhaka=
 through the path and eventually, one day lead him/her to the real abode of=
 the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyond this astral plane). If a perso=
n is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakti, and make it identify/create s=
uch an astral formation of the deity, it becomes an even more powerful forc=
e. It is, from our limited human perspective, as much a powerful entity as =
we may imagine, yet it is often not the actual Deity yet. Exactly the same =
thing has been described by Sri Vimalananda in the Aghora books, if you rea=
d carefully.=C2=A0

> When a sadhaka has been able to associate with suc=
h an astral formation of the deity, it can guide the sadhaka along the path=
 provided the sadhaka also is trying to work hard and sincerely to reach th=

 formation of the deity and the real deity is that, the former is neither b=
ound nor capable by itself of causing a complete and total transformation o=
f the average human nature without a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas=
, if one reaches the plane of the Great Gods, which is where the real deity=
 exists, one cannot avoid being transformed in mind, emotions, body etc. An=

e at ALL time and unfailingly, a complete withdrawal of lower nature of man=
 - lust,=A0
 anger, 
>=A0 jealousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace,=
 calm, detachment, mental-illumination, genuine compassion, a widening of t=
he consciousness. Such an individual, even if he/she just sits down next to=
 another person, will exude a silent strong peace and unselfish love which =
will automatically calm the minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals =
ETC. THAT is the authentic, unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of t=
he great deities. This comes even if one deity is properly realized in the =
causal planes of existence. But the astral formation of the same deity, whi=
ch is created by the force of our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case =
maybe, is often not capable of affecting this kind of a total transformatio=
n in a sadhaka. That is why it is limited. It is not limited because it can=

to realization. One off experiences create a force no doubt, but in time it=

 of the sadhaka.

was able to=A0 understand 
>=A0 from his writings with much deeper clarity.=
=C2=A0 Many of my own experiences made more sense to me. Many sentences of =
Aghora books too made amply sense in a new light. I read 40 - 45 % of his w=

to him, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna was his Guru, the Di=

 is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo's perspective of spirituality. I have=
 benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone else will also benefit.=

 per their freewill. This world is a play of forces and a democracy of oppo=

chance to run its course and actualize
 itself in the Universe. THAT is Her=
 Divine Compassion! That is why She is THE GREATEST Mother. She is mother t=
o the Great Gods as much to the Danavas and Daityas, and Rakshasas and Bhut=
as and Pretas and other corrupt human being and what not. <br>> <br>>=
 Now coming to your question on the phrase "higher deities having less abil=
ity". I think I have not been able to explain clearly, since in the last ma=
il I was merely writing in the context of that discussion. Let me try here.=
 <br>> <br>> There are three basic layer of this Universe. The physic=
al, the astral or subtle layer, and the causal (karana jagat) layer. In thi=
s subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our own physical plane, there is=
 a whole wide world of all possible forces, just like in our own world. It =
is a layer which is created out of force of pranashakti. This force of pran=
ashakti in humans beings is what causes all emotive movements on the consci=
ousness - joy, happiness, love,
 passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, disgus=
t, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capable of influencing the thi=
nking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadhana and specially Tantrik =
sadhana, is to create a formation of the deity using ones own prana-shakti =
through the aid of repeated rituals and procedures and mantras etc. If you =
think carefully, you will realize that every idol, ever homa agni needs a p=
ranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sadhaka used the force of his=
/her  own <br>>  pranashakti to infuse life into a subtle form=
ation of the deity. Once this process is successfully done, this sublte for=
mation of the deity which exists in the subtle plane, has a life of its own=
. It can then guide the sadhaka through the path and eventually, one day le=
ad him/her to the real abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyond=
 this astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakti=
, and make it
 identify/create such an astral formation of the deity, it be=
comes an even more powerful force. It is, from our limited human perspectiv=
e, as much a powerful entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not the act=
ual Deity yet. Exactly the same thing has been described by Sri Vimalananda=
 in the Aghora books, if you read carefully.=C2  <br>> <br>> Whe=
n a sadhaka has been able to associate with such an astral formation of the=
 deity, it can guide the sadhaka along the path provided the sadhaka also i=
s trying to work hard and sincerely to reach the causal planes (the real sp=
iritual planes of existence where the real force of the Deity originates). =
The difference, if you ask, between this astral formation of the deity and =
the real deity is that, the former is neither bound nor capable by itself o=
f causing a complete and total transformation of the average human nature w=
ithout a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one reaches the plane o=
f the
 Great Gods, which is where the real deity exists, one cannot avoid b=
eing transformed in mind, emotions, body etc. And what kind of a transforma=
tion will it be? One that will reflect to the world as a greater and genuin=
e humility, sense of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL time and unfailing=
ly, a complete withdrawal of lower nature of man - lust,  anger, <br>&=
gt;  jealousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace, calm, detachmen=
t, mental-illumination, genuine compassion, a widening of the consciousness=
. Such an individual, even if he/she just sits down next to another person,=
 will exude a silent strong peace and unselfish love which will automatical=
ly calm the minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the=
 authentic, unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of the great deities=
. This comes even if one deity is properly realized in the causal planes of=
 existence. But the astral formation of the same deity, which is created
 b=
y the force of our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case maybe, is often=
 not capable of affecting this kind of a total transformation in a sadhaka.=
 That is why it is limited. It is not limited because it can't=C2  get=
 me a better job or a nice pay hike or cure some diseases or bring me fame =
or any such material benefit if I so ask of it - the astral formations of&n=
bsp; the deities <br>>  can very easily do all these things in the =
physical world - but it is limited because it cannot by itself give you the=
 must authentic and persistent spirituality of the higher planes, the one a=
im and destination of all genuine sadhana. <br>> <br>> Since this ast=
ral plane is the way it is, therefore it's extremely important to keep acti=
vely working on ourselves to increase detachment, objectivity, genuine inte=
rnal surrender (when that happens one accepts all life-situations without t=
he slightest grudge), humility, control of anger, lust, jealousy
 etc. (all=
 that is universally accepted as spiritual qualities). For unless these cha=
nges are affected at least to some degree in the mind and emotions of the s=
adhaka, one is simply not ready to reach the higher planes of God and benef=
it from them spiritually. Moreover, at every stage of spiritual evolution t=
here is a gap between experience and realization. Only repeated experiences=
 *may* lead to realization. One off experiences create a force no doubt, bu=
t in time it fritters away, or worst, gets distorted by the impurities and =

ughts pour into my mind that my understanding of spirituality is imperfect =
and has serious flaws. I tried, using my own meditations to find out what w=
as wrong or rather imperfectly understood, what needed rethinking. First qu=
estion I asked myself was, what is the aim of spirituality? My mind could g=
rasp some outlines of certain answers and processes and truths. But it was =
still not exceptionally clear. <br>> <br>> I had first read Sri Aurob=
indo when I was in college. I could not go beyond the
 first two pages. The=
y were bouncers going one mile over my head. Three years ago someone gave m=
e a book of Sri Aurobindo. I could understand say 10 percent, and rest I re=
jected, partly due to ignorance and partly due to egoistic arrogance. Never=
 opened any of his writing since then. This year, as my sadhana was going o=
n and as I was instinctively trying to correct the flaws in my understandin=
g, one day while meditating I had an inner thought in the form of an image,=
 which told me that I should start reading Sri Aurobindo but in a very spec=
ific manner. The image was very clear in my inner-eye, and thoroughly press=
ing on my consciousness. I opened his book again, and read it in the prescr=
ibed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense to me. What I was struggli=
ng to understand all this year, whose outline I could grasp yet not get a p=
roper hang of, I was able to  understand <br>>  from his writi=
ngs with much deeper clarity.=C2  Many of
 my own experiences made mor=
e sense to me. Many sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a new=
 light. I read 40 - 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me to s=
top at a certain point of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 % =
I will have to first make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational m=
ind will distort the information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected firm=
ly 3 years ago, now came back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing sun=
. <br>> <br>> The line that you mention, is from one of the earlier w=
ritings of Sri Aurobindo on the historical problem of the Mahabharta. In th=
e Mahabharata, there is an incident which comes later on, after the great w=
ar and when Yudhisthira was ruling the kingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sr=
i Krishna to repeat the words he had spoken at the beginning of the war (Th=
e Gita) once more since he has forgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, the ti=
me has passed away (it was a special
 time when the Gita was spoken), he ca=
nnot repeat the "exact words" once again. <br>> <br>> Sri Krishna was=
 the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even Swami Vivekananda was one of his Gurus, f=
or during the time when Sri Aurobindo was in jail, for 15 days Swami Viveka=
nanda would appear before him daily and instruct him on the various layers =
of the mind, which he was not aware of till then. Swami Vivekananda had alr=
eady left his physical body by then. It was in the writings of Sri Aurobind=
o that he mentioned about the left and right hemisphere of the brain and th=
eir difference in functionality, and their connection to spirituality, abou=
t 30 years before medical science confirmed the same. <br>> <br>> Rig=
ht from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondicherry, to pushing his own=
 spiritual experiences further into states of Sahaja (which he describes in=
 different terminology), etc etc, he was guided continuously by the Adesha =
of Sri Krishna. He would
 literally hear the voice of Krishna speaking to h=
im, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna was his Guru, the Divine=
 Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destination. Anyway, my point is =
not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo's perspective of spirituality. I have ben=
efited from it, but not necessary that everyone else will also benefit. The=

pectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must individually try and find wh=

 progress on the path. <br>> <br>> Though I now have a very deep resp=
ect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both his critics and=
 his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstood the de=
pth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a function of the=
ir own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any genuine und=
erstanding or
 appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can be understood =
accurately or even slightly without sincere sadhana. <br>> <br>> <br>=

passions exist) separate from my thinking mind. <br>> It is very much po=
ssible, through practice, for a man to disassociate <br>> his rational-m=
ind from
 the emotional-mind. So have no fears that your <br>> disagreem=
ent is going to make me like you any less or any more. <br>> <br>> Th=
e problem with the emotional part of our being is that it jumps up at appea=
rances, running ahead to grasp the truth rather than waiting patiently for =
the truth to arrive in all its aspects and dimensions, and in the process i=
t distorts the truth and then reacts to that distorted image. For example, =
recently in some social forums I posted a comment that I found the Tantrik =
Adwaitha far more appealing than Sri Adi Shankara's Adwaitha, though the Ad=
waitha of Adi Shankara has many hard-selling supporters. Immediately some f=
riends of mine on Twitter and otherwise, jumped to the false conclusion tha=
t I have disrespected Adi Shankara, and tried best to make me "see the trut=
h" by such grandiose statements that=C2  Shankara is the 'final word' =
on Adwaitha and everything else must be necessarily lesser. Or that I was
 =
making an egoistic denouncement. Both of which are million light-years away=
 from the truth. That Sri Adi Shankara was a special Vibhuti <br>> =
 (manifestation) of God, that much I am certain. His compositions are so br=
illiant that it can't be sufficiently appreciated in words. Yet, I have equ=
ally no qualms in rejecting his philosophy. And because I am not bound to a=
ccept his philosophy, does not mean I respect or love him any less than any=
 other great saint.=C2  <br>> <br>> If you disrespect a man, and=
 specially a saint, and then start disliking him too with a passion, you ar=
e creating strong negative karmas. But if you can disagree with someone wit=
hout losing respect or love for the person, in an objective manner, you rea=
p very little karmic effects. That is why Lord Krishna too advices us to be=
come more detached in life. <br>> <br>> In conclusion, Narasimha is t=
otally correct. Many things cannot be sufficiently expressed in
 words with=
out causing some distortion. <br>> <br>> -Regards <br>> =C2 Rajars=

 =C2  <br>> Dear Rajarshi Bhai, <br>> How are you doing? About 2=
00 hundred years ago, a man made a theory of creation in France. When Napol=
ean asked where is God in it, the guy said, do not talk about God. It makes=
 things complicated. <br>> So is there a place for Divine Mother and Her=
 Love or Grace or Protection in your theory. Is=C2 this
 intermediate zone =
as you say is created by Her and part of Her creation=C2 or by=C2 somebody =
else.=C2  Does=C2 She needs some visa to go there if she is=C2 not the=
 Creater.=C2 As you say all higher deity are there but less in ability. Doe=
s the deities have even less =C2 ability on earth plane. <br>> =C2 =
 <br>> I am sure this is not your theory. You have taken it from yogi Au=
robindo. Many times when certain person reach a stage in their spiritual pa=
th, others think whatever this guy is uttering is=C2 complete truth, when i=
n fact it is=C2 far from truth. Once=C2 I saw in a article that Aurobindo s=
aid that Divine Lord who spoke Gita completely forgot it after few minutes =
or so. I could not believe what I was reading. Then my respect for this yog=
i went down the drain. <br>> =C2  <br>> Divine Mother, Her Love,=
 Her Grace Her Protection and other Eternal Divine Beings are outside of ou=
r human perception. They only allow us to know about
 Themselves what They =
wish to. For me there is a=C2 difference between a yogi and devotee.=C2&nbs=
p; A devotee rises due to Grace of Divine Mother or their Ishtdav. where as=
 a yogi rises after a lot of huff and fuff, and they get stuck everywhere. =
I am sure there are only=C2 devotee in this group. They may be doing haven =

 things properly, but some =
pattern is observable.=C2  Not all experiences are what they seem to b=
e. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle of experiences, not being=
 able to adequately determine which is genuine and which is non-genuine. Th=
is is the world of astral <br>>  plane, driven by the overlapping s=
healths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a human being. In T=
antrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (overlappi=
ng and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything=C2  is pos=
sible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation in =
this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless beings of v=
aries character and hue who can very easily create an expereince for a sadh=
aka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experience/aura o=
f a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker and use him/h=

 wide world, the lower extreme of w=

 lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc and at the othe=
