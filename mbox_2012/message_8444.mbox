Hi,
=A0 =A0 =A0It was nice to see =A0your letter and read about your experi=
ence. There is no need to feel embarrassment as a great deal of people feel=
 unhappy talking about ghost/spirit although they might say otherwise. And =
what you experienced was very frightening at such a young age but it will p=
rove positive for you in future. One day soon or later you will become a te=
acher yourself and give Diksha to others and if somebody asks your help in =
such a situation you will draw on your experience and not on some bookish k=
nowledge.

=A0I have to say that I have experienced a great deal of such si=
milar disturbing incident . Each and every time I have been saved by Grace =
of Divine mother. I will woke up shouting and reciting Divine names. Someti=
mes I would know what might be the cause of such a attack. I never dismiss =
such incidents as just my imagination=A0and try to take proper action by go=
ing over the things I have done previous day. I am also able to see very ea=
sily spirits/beings etc and some years back I used to give deep healing to =
certain persons whom I had never met so they might go to higher dimensions =
and become free from cycle. And I always ask Divine Mother's permission for=
 it. Last year in Oct. ancestors of very famous family in England suddenly =
appeared in my front room where I was doing my everyday japa and indicated =
they need similar sort of healing. They were a couple who were very famous =
when they were alive. I became very nervous and got up and avoided touching=
 them
 and went to my Puja Room to ask for guidance. Divine Mother immediat=
ely refused any healing for them through me. They have sort of disappeared =
since then.

I am puzzled by something you said.You will pester -Her- for h=
elp. Help for What?? They are Sister And Brother and in fact They are One a=
nd Same. This world is creation of Divine Mother. She is in it and also far=
 away from it.And when She is meshed up with Her devotees She feels joy and=
 pain as well. And if you will pray and worship Her for this reason She mig=
ht not say anything but some heart string will not play right. And Her Big =
Brother will also look at Her. I would hold Her Feet for Her sake and do th=
e likewise for Divine Lord.

When I was living in Brijbhoomi, it was the as=
hram of disciples of Swami Shivanand =A0where I have rented a room. When I =
came back to London I kept receiving pamphlets from the Sivanand Yoga centr=
e for several years. I never attended any workshop there but I used to cut =
out the pictures and names of Divine Mother and keep them in my books.

Tha=
nks

Hello LaxmiNarayanji,

Thanks for the encouraging message=
. The thought of Vishnu turning on his watery resting place and glancing in=
 this direction is rather sweet. You've motivated me to do the mantra with =
even more enthusiasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for help with thi=
s......Ramakrishna says you have to keep tugging at Her sari till she gives=
 you something vaguely worthwhile like devotion.

Very interesting to hear =
of your experience in Delhi. I agree that the Name provides protection agai=
nst dodgy situations. I don't like to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I'=
m embarrassed to say that have always been scared of the dark since childho=
od, slowly getting over it now. 

Once at university, around 7 years ago, I=
 was preparing for some exams. It was after term-time and I had stayed back=
 to revise.=A0 I was moved to a room that was different to the one I had be=
en staying in, as my usual room was being used for some conference guests. =
I used to hang out with the Hare Krishnas then, and was really into chantin=
g the Hare Rama mahamantra then (still love this mantra, but chant Om NamoN=
arayanaya more now)- used to do 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. 

I=
 was lying on my back in this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and wa=
s in some sort of light sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty sensa=
tion that can only be described as something or someone trying really hard =
to strangle me! I felt very frightened, and couldn't move, speak or wake my=
self up.

In this state, my mind started repeating "Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, =
Hari" very very fast in terror. I think I chose this name because it was sh=
ort and I could say it very fast with concentration! The frightening experi=
ence then passed and I felt the Name saved me.

I woke up and turned on the=
 light feeling absolutely petrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then =
did something I wouldn't normally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in L=
ondon at that time of night (I knew they don't sleep till about midnight as=
 I've stayed there) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Sw=
ami who initiated me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm,=
 she very kindly came to the phone and reassured me saying it could have be=
en some real negative force or just something from my imagination. Either w=
ay, she reassured me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repea=
ting the Name was the right approach. She suggested chanting before bedtime=
 to avoid similar experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra=
 before going to bed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light though on =
because I'm a coward ;).

Since then, I keep up the practice of repeating t=
he Name before bedtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings=
 positive Divine energy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)

Best wishes,
=

Aparna

a slight trance.Suddenly I noticed some spirits/entities were trying to com=

g of white light there. I knew immediately it is the effect of that haven i=
n the house. Now in the link article same thing is mentioned as
 a psychic =
shield. Probably this shield  was all round the .building bu=

strange how a dead body looks just like an empty house...exactly like someo=

 think that there must be something mo=
re to us than this fleshy cage. This cage that becomes unattractive in old =
age, filled with appalling miseries in serious illness, and hideous in deat=
h. <br>> <br>> It is interesting to think about what one can do to he=
lp the sick and dying, when they reach a stage beyond all human aid. It is =
not pleasant to watch someone die while feeling utterly helpless to relieve=
 suffering. <br>> <br>> <span id=3D"misspell-38" class=3D"mark">Sivan=

misspell-49" class=3D"mark">Mahamrityunjaya</span>) for their patients, eac=
h other and the whole world. I believe it is the same with the
 little Ashr=
am hospital in <span id=3D"misspell-50" class=3D"mark">Rishikesh</span>. Wh=
at a wonderful way to start the day.....repeating mantras with your colleag=
ues. <br>> <br>> I wanted to mention the power of this mantra for any=
one who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or indeed, if you yourself=
 are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the blessing of God to e=
ase suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Basically saying "Thy Will=
 be done" because You know what is best. Of course it is NOT asking for a m=
iracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will of God). <br>> <br>> =
At any point in time, there are several human beings, animals and various c=
reatures who are dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly during the proc=
ess of dying. I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra a few times da=
ily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it works, and I believe them. <br=

 in learning mor=
e about this great mantra. The article is written by a disciple of Swami <s=
