I could give one explanation, from my understanding of Vedic philosophy.

A=
s per the basic interpretation in Vedas, there is one God but several
forms=
, like various mirror reflection of one entity.
That one supreme God is kno=
wn as Vishnu as per Vaishnavas, Adi-Shakti as
per Shaktas, Ganapathi as per=
 GaaNapatyas and Shiva as per Shaivas. Even we
can call Para-brahma or para=
m-aatman to refer that divine entity. He/She/It
is beyond gender. However f=
or easy reference, we take masculine reference
attributing to the Great pro=
tector nature.

To prevent much confusion, it is easy and consistent to use=
 the word Vishnu
(Vishnu etymologically means, one who pervades everything =
and protects
everything, the supreme, omniscient, omnipresent and omnipoten=
t divine
entity).  His one reflection is Lakshmi, another reflection is Shi=
va, yet
another reflection is Sapta-rishis (Just remember the Viswa-roopa f=
orm seen
by Arjuna in the battle-field of Kurukshetra).

Now, let's come to=
 your actual question:
Is Lakshmi, wife of Ganapathi?

Answer is Yes and No=
.

Yes, because Ganapathi is the Vishwambara form of Vishnu, the one who is=

lord of Ganas and protects the Vishwa. The mystical saints had the vision
=
of something looking like elephant in their meditative super conscious
stat=
e.

No, because, usual lexical meaning of Ganapathi, means the son of Shiva=
,
who is grandson of Padmanabha (Shrimad Bhagavatam 3.12.4-20). In that
sen=
se, Ganapathi is great-grand son of Lakshmi.
