Oh No Saranyan Ji,

Lalit Bhai saa'b is sending such hate mails since 2 yea=
rs now. most on the list may not be knowing this fact.

At the moment he do=
es not want to "understand". does not want to "See" the big picture and for=
cefully convinces himself that Narasimha is a very big cheat and all the ot=
her who value him are fools who are destined to be doomed.

I pray for him =
that he becomes free from feeling of hatred as soon as possible. Burden of =
hatred is one the most unbearable of all.

baki time pe hi sab kuch hoke ra=
hega.

Best Regards,

Utpal
