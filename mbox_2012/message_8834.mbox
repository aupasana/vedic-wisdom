hapter: Outwitting the Stars ***

"Astrology is the study of man's response=
 to planetary stimuli. The stars have no conscious benevolence or animosity=
; they merely send forth positive and negative radiations. Of themselves, t=
hese do not help or harm humanity, but offer a lawful channel for the outwa=
rd operation of cause-effect equilibriums which each man has set into motio=
n in the past.

"A child is born on that day and at that hour when the cele=
stial rays are in mathematical harmony with his individual karma. His horos=
cope is a challenging portrait, revealing his unalterable past and its prob=
able future results. But the natal chart can be rightly interpreted only by=
 men of intuitive wisdom: these are few.

"The message boldly blazoned acro=
ss the heavens at the moment of birth is not meant to emphasize fate=97the =
result of past good and evil=97but to arouse man's will to escape from his =
universal thralldom. What he has done, he can undo. None other than himself=
 was the instigator of the causes of whatever effects are now prevalent in =
his life. He can overcome any limitation, because he created it by his own =
actions in the first place, and because he has spiritual resources which ar=
e not subject to planetary pressure.

"Superstitious awe of astrology makes=
 one an automaton, slavishly dependent on mechanical guidance. The wise man=
 defeats his planets=97which is to say, his past=97by transferring his alle=
giance from the creation to the Creator. The more he realizes his unity wit=
h Spirit, the less he can be dominated by matter. The soul is ever-free; it=
 is deathless because birthless. It cannot be regimented by stars.
