Namaste all, 

3 days back i started keeping Akhand deep, (copper deep with=
 central wick hole, Mustard oil). After 2-3 hrs of burning the tip of the b=
urning wick gets burned and forms small charcoal ball and the flame becomes=
 small. In night it got extinguished coz of same issue. 

for maintaining a=
khand jyot it seems one has to increase the wick length for burning and rem=
ove burnt ball on top of wick every 5-6 hrs. this doesnt seem practical. i =
think i might be doing something wrong.

Please guide. 

regards
priyank
