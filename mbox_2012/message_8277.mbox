Namaste friends,

The "Astrology & Spirituality Resources" website 
(http://www.VedicAstrologer.org) has been revamped to make it easy to 
navigate. As a part of the exercise, we fixed some errors in the Tarpana 
manuals.

Previously released Satya Narayana vratam manuals (short and 
super-short) have also been placed prominently on the website (earlier 
there was no proper link to them and one could get them only if one knew 
the location from my email here).

In the coming months, Satya Narayana vratam regular manuals and all 
language versions will be uploaded. We also plan to revamp the homam 
manuals and add some more deities. I have Narasimha homam, Rama homam, 
homam to other 7 grahas, ayushya sookta homam, vaastu sookta homam and 
purusha sookta homam on the to-do list. If anybody is interested in some 
specific homam, please send a private email to pvr@.... If 
possible, I will consider.

Thanks,
Narasimha
