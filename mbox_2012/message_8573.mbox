This is really helpful. Thanks. I hadn't thought about it in terms of the p=
ranas before. I had previously read that there is no restriction on doing j=
apa if the purpose is Realisation. 

As Japa itself is purifying it is mean=
ingless to say it cannot be done due to 'impurity' of person/place. 

Howev=
er I guess the same cannot be said of homam. Is that case isn't Japa 'super=
ior' to Homam? :P Only joking. I think they are both excellent practices th=
at complement each other wonderfully.
