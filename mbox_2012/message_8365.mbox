Mr. Utpal 

What bakwaas ? Next you will find another link up story where a=
 man made mockery of god durga and he got moksha. Jitna time waste kisi ko =
gaali dene ke liye sikaya hai utna hi waqt jaap karte toh behtar hota. 
So =
we are fools wasting time loving god. My friend will be very happy to hear =
that he will get god's darshan soon , as he routinely kicks god pictures in=
 frustration.  
Absolute stupidity,please don't preach any further leave it=
 for the wise they know better.
