Hello Anup...

As far as I understand the dried coconut meat is the part of=
 coconut which is used for homam. Also, I am unaware of there being any ban=
 on the outer shell of coconut, as all parts of coconut are available at th=
e local supermarkets, and the dried coconuts being available at the local I=
ndian markets. As far as other alternatives to coconuts are concerned, the =
wood from the oak trees burns hot and clean producing a minimum of smoke. T=
here are many ways to deal with the problem of smoke if you are living in a=
 apartment or flat. And it depends on how much you want to spend on fans an=
d ducts to draw the smoke outside of the apartment, so as to reduce the lik=
elihood of smoke damage to the walls and painted surfaces. Hope this helps =
you get started again.

Warm Regards

Ajaya

 I'd a very fundamental query.=

 I was planning to restart doing homam and came to know that these days th=
e outer shell of coconut is banned in US. Just wanted to know how others ar=
e conducting the homam?
 Also - I remember Narasimhaji had shared how we ca=
n setup the homam in US appartment, but couldnt find that email. If anyone =
can share that email to me, that would be great.
