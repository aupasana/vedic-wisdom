namaste,

There are two puranas which glorify ganesha -- the ganesha purana=
 and
mudgala purana. The second one is less popular, but is quite
interesti=
ng. It retells many popular stories from the ramayana,
mahabharata etc and =
adds or magnifies ganesha's role. For example, the
story of the slaying of =
madhu and kaitabha from the devi mahatmyam is
retold, but here, ganesha is =
the hero. Upon being awakened, vishnu has
to pray to ganesha, and with his =
blessing gets the necessary strength
to slay the demons.

Hindi tranlsation=
s of both puranas are probably available through
chaukamba publications.

s=
asneham,
