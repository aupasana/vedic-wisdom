Dear LaxmiNarayanji,

I am a complete beginner on the spiritual path. =
My human mind cannot grasp God, so concepts like 'with form' and 'formless'=
 are just intellectual. Ultimately experience is what counts. So I will not=
 argue with you about what God is, as I have nor experienced this yet (have=
 only read about it).

The saints all declare the Name is God. So I will si=
mply stick to repeating the mantra and see what happens. God has to give Da=
rshan to all of us one day, I cannot be left behind forever. :) Till then, =
I enjoy reminding myself that the saints say that Name is even superior to =
form. Krishna's Name on a tulsi leaf weighed more than He Himself. I may no=
t have seen the form of Hari but I have access to His Name. Will make the m=
ost of this blessing.

I agree honey and water Is soothing for the throat- =
I wish you every success with your chanting. :)

Warm regards, 

Aparna

worshipped for Her sake as well, not just for attaining Him. But in my mind=

llah, Buddha and Jehovah too when I repeat this mantra). I feel all these e=
xist in Narayana. While I love the forms of Hari and Durga especially, and =
find them the easiest to talk to, I also find the forms of Radha and Shiva =
enchantingly beautiful. The Hare Krishnas say that Krishna can only be atta=

 mother is always easily accessible, always close to her children, keeping =
an eye on them and they can speak with her freely.....the father tends to b=
