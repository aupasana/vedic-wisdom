Please refer to "Acharya Sankara's" Jeevanmuktananda lahari on how a true
j=
ivan mukta behaves/is in this world. An enlightened master cannot be
measur=
ed with definitions of mind and intellect bound by time and space. I
person=
ally liked the message from Sri.Narasimhaji on the fact that we
cannot defi=
ne these things with Vaikhari.

A gyani(Jeevan Mukta) is beyond karmic bond=
age and uses gunas as tools in
the interest of the world and does not accum=
ulate new vasanas however he
will indeed have prarabdha karma. Arrows that =
have left the bow cannot but
strike the target though master can change vel=
ocity and trajectory.

In once instance, i heard of a story when Bhagwan Ra=
mana or Paramacharya
asked a devotee to stay back in his ashram as an astro=
loger predicted a
life threat to the devotee. Let us note that Bhagwan has =
changed the
destiny by cut and paste into future lives of the devotee or ta=
ken over his
karma. Very few masters out of kindness do it.

In the case Ar=
juna, let us note that he never went to heaven during his
last days and in =
fact fell off on his way to heaven. Only Dharmaraja who is
his eldest broth=
er went to heaven finally as he also accumulated certain
karmas from his ac=
tions. Obviously Arjuna  is not jeevanmukta though he did
have a purpose wh=
y he came down with Narayana himself.

Irrespective of Arjuna's prowess, af=
ter Lord Krishna left his mortal body,
Arjuna became like a ineffective war=
rior for sometime and had to pray to
Lord to regain his prowess which means=
 that without the touch of divine, we
will screw up even normal nitya, naim=
ittika karmas. Maya is powerful even
with best faculties,

"Mahatma who liv=
e in awareness and abiding in  "Self" is a "mukta" is
relieved of effects o=
f Karma" Karma is like a tool and the disease they
handle in relation to th=
eir body is affect of minor residue of past karmas
.It is said that when Bh=
isma was lying on his bed of arrows, he revealed
before Lord Krisha that he=
 has reviewed his previous 99 lives (an instance
of self pastlife regressio=
n) but could not find relevant sanchit karma for
this bed of the arrows. Th=
en Vasudev, advised him to review his 100
previous life. When Bheesm the Pi=
tamah remembered his 100 life it became
apparent to him that he was a king =
in that life and while traveling on a
horse, he found a snake in his route,=
 he picked up an arrow and threw the
snake on nailed bushes. The snake was =
reborn as Arjuna in this life. Even
Jivan Mukta is bound by laws of karma b=
ut being a gyani is untouched by it
and is in alignment with nature and nev=
er breaks laws of karma.

Please refer to "Acharya Sankara's" Jeevanmuktananda lahari o=
n how a true jivan mukta behaves/is in this world. An enlightened master ca=
nnot be measured with definitions of mind and intellect bound by time and s=
pace. I personally liked the message from Sri.Narasimhaji on the fact that =
we=A0 cannot define these things with Vaikhari.<br>


<br>A gyani(Jeevan Mu=
kta) is beyond karmic bondage and uses gunas as tools in the interest of th=
e world and does not accumulate new vasanas however he will indeed have pra=
rabdha karma. Arrows that have left the bow cannot but strike the target th=
ough master can change velocity and trajectory.<br>


<br>In once instance,=
 i heard of a story when Bhagwan Ramana or Paramacharya asked a devotee to =
stay back in his ashram as an astrologer predicted a life threat to the dev=
otee. Let us note that Bhagwan has changed the destiny by cut and paste int=
o future lives of the devotee or taken over his karma. Very few masters out=
 of kindness do it.<br>


<br>In the case Arjuna, let us note that he never=
 went to heaven during his last days and in fact fell off on his way to hea=
ven. Only Dharmaraja who is his eldest brother went to heaven finally as he=
 also accumulated certain karmas from his actions. Obviously Arjuna=A0 is n=
ot jeevanmukta though he did have a purpose why he came down with Narayana =
himself.<br>


<br>Irrespective of Arjuna's prowess, after Lord Krishna=
 left his mortal body, Arjuna became like a ineffective warrior for sometim=
e and had to pray to Lord to regain his prowess which means that without th=
e touch of divine, we will screw up even normal nitya, naimittika karmas. M=
aya is powerful even with best faculties,<br>
<br>"Mahatma who live in=
 awareness and abiding in=A0 "Self" is a "mukta" is rel=
ieved of effects of Karma" Karma is like a tool and the disease they h=
andle in relation to their body is affect of minor residue of past karmas .=
It  is  said  that  when Bhisma was  lying  on his  bed  of  arrows,  he
 r=
evealed before Lord Krisha that he has reviewed his previous 99 lives
 (an =
instance of  self  pastlife  regression)  but  could  not  find  
relevant =
 sanchit karma for  this  bed of the arrows. Then Vasudev, 
advised him to =
review his 100 previous life. When Bheesm the Pitamah 
remembered  his 100 =
life  it became apparent  to him that  he was a  
king in that life and whi=
le traveling on  a horse, he found  a  snake  
in his route, he picked up a=
n arrow and threw the snake on nailed 
bushes. The snake was reborn as Arju=
na in this life. Even Jivan Mukta is bound by laws of karma but being a gya=
ni is untouched by it and is in alignment with nature and never breaks laws=
 of karma.<br><br>"Gahana karmano gatih<br>

Nope. Arjun=
a was not a Jivan muktha or even vidEha muktha that life. One tradition sta=
tes that Arjuna re-incarnated as Kannappa (Bhakta Kannappa) who becomes a d=
evotee of Shiva (remember that in Mahabharat itself the seed for this was s=
own in an episode that Arjuna and Shiva fight for a wild boar they hunted).=
 It is in that Kannappa life that he attains to mukti at srI kALahasti. In =
Kurukshetra war, Arjuna arrives at a certain state of unconditioned awarene=
ss or consciousness due to the dilemma and circumstances of the war and Kri=
shna utilized that receptivity(arising out of utter helplessness and hence =
willingness to surrender) to give him glimpses of the Virat swarupam. You c=
an liken the viswaroopam event to Ramakrishna making Narendra experience di=
vinity by placing his feet on the chest. <br>



<br>
I think Narasimha gAr=
u's second post on jIvan mukta was relatively straight and clear on the=
 concept. The other points I'll add is that action done by tri-karanas =
do result in consequence(s) to the doer (as long as the action was done whi=
le doer holds conditioned identity). All this accumulates in the sanchita (=
warehouse) of the doer and a portion of it gets allotted as prarabdha for a=
 given life. This prarabdha one has to experience whether they are liberate=
d or not. Removal of conditioning does drop the entire Sanchita (breaks the=
 thread that is holding the Sanchita to the being) but prarabdha itself hol=
ds as this was already allotted and in itself is the primary cause for the =
embodied life of that being. If you drop prarabdha you drop the body and he=
nce life too. Because that karmic structure is what glues the jIva and the =
sarIra. A jIvan mukta had dropped all conditioning and hence his bondages t=
o all sanchita is gone. No new bondage is established for newer actions (ag=
Ami) because the actions now are not conditioned by any kind of ignorance(m=
Aya). These actions themselves can have consequences but they are not tied =
to him and hence not attached/directed at him. They 'can' even atta=
ck their prArabdha to alter it if neeeded, but as they had already become p=
ure witnesses than agenda driven conditioned individuals, they generally do=
n't get into that and experience all of their prarabdha to let it burn =
naturally. They also have capabilities to create and accumulate 'consci=
ous and measured quantity and quality of sanchita' to be available as p=
rarabdha for a future life, if they intend to re-incarnate. However, whethe=
r the 'veil of mAya' was put consciously by oneself or was eternall=
y present as we forgot that we put it ourselves, as long as the veil is on =
us there will be an amount of conditioning and ignorance. The main differen=
ce is that just as a man who puts a veil on his face sees blurred but is fu=
lly aware that he can anytime lift the veil at his own will to see through =
clearly, a re-incarnated avatAra also knows that the veil of mAya was put o=
n for a purpose and can be dropped once the purpose is served. The case of =
rest of us is that of a man who put the veil a long time ago but totally fo=
rgot about that i.e. a) that the veil exists and is interfering with his vi=
sion and b) that the veil was put by himself and it is within his own contr=
ol to remove it. Hence we do all sadhana to recognize that distinction betw=
een the veil and ourselves and thus drop the veil. <br>
