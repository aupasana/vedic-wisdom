Namaste PVR Ji / All

I would like to bring to attention one rare stuti for=
 Narayan from Skanda puran. The document also lists the benefits of praying=
 to narayan on ekadashi.

Stuti - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SriRangaSri=
/message/17478 (see attachment in the post)
Meaning - http://stotraratna.sa=
thyasaibababrotherhood.org/v110.htm

Since strotras/Stuti to Narayan are ra=
re it might be beneficial to add this in puja manual (may be set as optiona=
l). The creator of the document K.Murlidharan was kind enough to send me th=
e Word file with fonts. Let me know if anyone needs it.

due thanks to Sri =
P.R.Ramachander for providing meaning of the strotra.

regards
priyank
