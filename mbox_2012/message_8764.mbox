Namaste Ashutosh,

Very interesting information mainly because it came via =
Ashtamangal Prashna.

Til to be mixed atleast with some Ghee and not to be =
offered Dry and for that matter any material - This is a kind of Indication=
 to me as well. during my today's ashtami Full fledged Chandi Havan, I did =
stopped for a momoent to think mixing of White Til with ghee. I did not do =
it eventually though but your post is a kind of confirmation signal for me =
atleast. Narasimha Garu normally indicates that whatever one offer in Ahuti=
 should not be completely dry. once he suggested me that if i offer Cowdung=
 cakes as Ahuti, then i dhould dip that in ghee and offer. so this thing is=
 very clear.

2ndly, I wish to understand about "Chandi Path verses" which =
are recited while offering Ahuti iN Chandi Homas. How one ought to apply th=
e rule of 10:1 or 100:1 in such cases? any Idea you have or you can get?

T=
hank you again for the post and Happy Durgaashtami to all!

Best Regards,

=
Utpal

shNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is f=
