Hi,

A senior monk at the Sivananda Ashram in Rishikesh told me a very inte=
resting story as I was leaving after a brief stay last week. I thought I wo=
uld share it with you as I thought it very inspiring.

The story is of a mo=
nk called Brother Lawrence who lived in the 1600s in France. He lived a ver=
y ordinary life, doing menial work such as cleaning pots and pans in the mo=
nastery kitchen and repairing sandals. People ordered him about, and nobody=
 thought much of him. He died in relative obscurity after a long life.

Dur=
ing the latter part of his life, people had noticed he seemed to radiate an=
 extraordinary peace. 

He was asked about his spiritual practice. He said =
words to the effect of..."It's nothing much, I am a simple man and don't ha=
ve any special prayers or rituals as these just confuse me."

But

"I pract=
ice the Presence of God"

"What do you mean?" he was asked..

He said words=
 to the effect of....

"I talk to God all the time. I converse with Him. To=
gether, God and I scrub the pots and pans, and do everything together. I fe=
el His living Presence with me all the time. It was hard work fixing my min=
d on Him for the first 10 years, but slowly, through His Grace, I have mana=
ged it after 40 years of practice. I feel so much peace and joy from this P=
ractice that I recommend it to everybody! I am as close to God in the noise=
 and clatter of the kitchen, as when I am on my knees receiving the blessed=
 sacrament in Church!!"

His letters describing his extraordinarily simple =
but beautiful practice are really worth a read. This is a link to a book ab=
out his practice....containing the conversations of a monk with him, and hi=
s own letters to friends who asked him for guidance.
