Namaste Utpal ji,

Like you I am also curious how the ratio works out for C=
handi Homam, although I don't do Chandi Homam myself. However in temples I =
have seen that whenever there is a Chandi Homam, 10 people sit down to reci=
te the entire Durga Saptashati (Chandi Path). Then one person offers the ah=
uti. This technically fulfils the 10:1 requirement. However one thing to re=
member is that such activities in temples are not generally done for one's =
individual spiritual progress. Rather it is sponsored by a person for his l=
owkika "desired" fruits. Also when done from the temple itself, it is gener=
ally done for the betterment of the community, society etc. 

My 2 cents.

=
Regards,
Ashutosh
