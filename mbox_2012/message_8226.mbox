A brief synopsis of Milarepa's life - one of the greatest Yogis of Tibet.

=

Milarepa was born into a prosperous family, but his father died when he wa=
s seven, and the house and property went to a greedy aunt and uncle, who tr=
eated the family like slaves; they lived in a hovel, ate swill, and toiled =
in the fields all day.  When he was 15, Milarepa's mother demanded that he =
visit a certain sorcerer and learn black magic to extract revenge.  If he d=
idn't do her bidding, she threatened to kill herself in front of him.

To u=
nderstand Milarepa's story at all, we have to imagine a culture where famil=
y honor was more important than life itself.  Where a human incarnation was=
 held to be infinitely precious, and your mother was revered as the chief g=
iver of this gift.  Where allowing harm to come to your mother if you had t=
he power to prevent it was an unimaginable sin.

Milarepa chose to obey his=
 mother.  He went to the sorcerer and learned a complex practice that allow=
ed him to invoke spirts who pulled down the stone house where his uncle's f=
amily was celebrating a wedding.  Thirty-five people were in the house.  Ir=
onically, only the aunt and uncle survived.

All hell broke loose.  The rel=
atives of the dead were furious and gave chase.  Milarepa barely escaped pu=
rsuit, but he couldn't escape his own conscience or the negative karma for =
33 murders that was sure to land him in Buddhist hells for quite a few inca=
rnations.  His sorcerer contact advised him to seek out a famous guru named=
 Marpa.  When he heard the name, a thrill went through Milarepa, as if a gl=
impse of his destiny had just opened up.  The night before he arrived, the =
guru dreamed of someone very special coming into his life.  Though he insta=
ntly recognized Milarepa's potential, he also saw the dark karma and knew t=
he boy would have to work it out before anything else could take place.

Mi=
larepa asked for initiation into spiritual practice, but Marpa refused, say=
ing such treasures were not for someone as "worthless" as he.  Instead, he =
told Milarepa to move a stone tower to another location three miles away.  =
It took Milarepa three years to carry the rocks on his back.  Marpa looked =
at his work, scratched his chin, and said, "You know what?  I think I liked=
 it better at the first location.  Move it back."

At that point, most of u=
s would probably run away, but Milarepa did what he was told.  In those day=
s, spiritual seekers sometimes endured great hardships and life-threatening=
 journeys for spiritual instruction.  It was all right; for a Guru like Mar=
pa would never wind up on the news with charges of fraud or scandal. Marpa =
himself was the disciple of Naropa, another legendary Indian Buddhist yogi,=
 mystic and monk.

Milarepa toiled for twelve years before receiving spirit=
ual initiation.  After that, he undertook an eleven month retreat in a seal=
ed cave with only a butter lamp for light, and a little slot where someone =
passed him one meal a day.  Later he moved to another remote cave where he =
lived on nothing but nettles and local vegetation.  He looked like a living=
 skeleton, but there he attained final awakening.  

Milarepa's tale assert=
s that no one is beyond redemption once they sincerely turn in that directi=
on.

*   *    *

Naturally many miracles are associated with Milarepa. Once=
 Milarepa had placed his open hand against the cave's wall (where he medita=
ted) at about shoulder level . . . and then continued to push his hand fart=
her into the rock in front of him, as if the wall did not exist! When he di=
d so, the stone beneath his palms became soft and malleable, leaving the de=
ep impression of his hand for all to see=85

Milarepa believed that he and =
the rock are not separate. His meditation taught him that he was a part of =
the rock, and everything else too, and therefore his hand could pass into/t=
hrough the rock!

After becoming a Jeevanmukta, Milarepa would =
roam around the villages composing spontaneous poems. A few lines from one =
of his poetry follows:

"May I be far removed from contending creeds and do=
gmas.
Ever since my Lord's grace entered my mind,
My mind has never strayed=
 to seek such distractions.
Accustomed long to contemplating love and compa=
ssion,
I have forgotten all difference between myself and others.
Accustome=
d long to meditating on my Guru as enhaloed over my head,
I have forgotten =
all those who rule by power and prestige.
Accustomed long to meditating on =
my guardian deities as inseparable from myself,
I have forgotten the lowly =
fleshly form.
Accustomed long to meditating on the secret whispered truths,=

I have forgotten all that is said in written or printed books.
Accustomed,=
 as I have been, to the study of the eternal Truth,
I've lost all knowledge=
 of ignorance.
Accustomed, as I've been, to contemplating both nirvana and =
samsara as inherent in myself,
I have forgotten to think of hope and fear.
=
Accustomed, as I've been, to meditating on this life and the next as one,
I=
 have forgotten the dread of birth and death.
Accustomed long to studying, =
by myself, my own experiences,
I have forgotten the need to seek the opinio=
ns of friends and brethren.
Accustomed long to applying each new experience=
 to my own spiritual growth,
I have forgotten all creeds and dogmas.
Accust=
omed long to meditating on the Unborn, the Indestructible, the Unchanging,
=
I have forgotten all definitions of this or that particular goal.
Accustome=
d long to meditating on all visible phenomena as the Dharmakaya,
I have for=
gotten all meditations on what is produced by the mind.
Accustomed long to =
keeping my mind in the uncreated state of freedom,
I have forgotten all con=
ventions and artificialities.
Accustomed long to humbleness, of body and mi=
nd,
I have forgotten the pride and haughty manner of the mighty.
Accustomed=
 long to regarding my fleshly body as my hermitage,
I have forgotten the ea=
se and comfort of retreats and monasteries.
Accustomed long to knowing the =
meaning of the Wordless,
I have forgotten the way to trace the roots of ver=
bs, and the
sources of words and phrases.
You, 0 learned one, may trace out=
 these things in your books
[if you wish].

"My religion is not Buddhism. M=
y religion is to live and die without regret." =96 Jetsun (meaning revered)=
 Milarepa.
