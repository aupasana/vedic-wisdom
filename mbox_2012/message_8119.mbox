Dear Dolly,

> best to do equal numbers of mahamrityunjay and gayatri mantra for a
balanced approach.

My perspective is that a mantra is best done for it's own sake, and not to
purposefully or forcefully control the movement of prana. Prana may or may
not move ... it can decide that on it's own. All of this is best left to
the devata and the rishi of the mantra.

Traditionally, sadhakas are encouraged to do 2000 / 3000 repetitions of the
gayatri mantra daily ... they are not required to do anything "for balance".

sasneham,

   ajit
