ॐ नमो भगवते स&#=
2340;्यदेवाय।

I am providi=
ng with practical informations which may help others as well to remove conf=
usions as to when one perform Lord Satyanarayan Pujan.

I follow simple log=
ical steps-

1) check when "exactly Pournima starts & Ends" locally(using J=
hora). do not go by Pouplar civilian calender which do not clearly inform a=
bout starting & ending tithi of pournima.

2) "Note the period of evening t=
o early morning" within that entire Pournima tithi.

3) Select around Eveni=
ng time (sunset time) to start performance of Bahagavan SatyaNarayan Pujan.=
 if that is not possible, choose any time of the night (the main criteria i=
s that full moon is shining bright in the sky), if that is also not possibl=
e then any time of the pournima tithi.

When Pournima covers partial durati=
ons of 2 dates (which is very frequent occurrence), this simple logic helps=
 me to remove any clutters.

4) For any reasons if it is not possible to pe=
rform Pujan (say due to genuine issues such as Travelling, outstation stay,=
 Problem of periods of ladies at home etc...), then i perform the pujan dur=
ing next possible day or weekend.

***
Performance of any Ritual with faith=
 is "the single most important" requirement than all the above factors and =
members of this esteemed list already know that.

Best of Luck to anybody w=
ho peforms this Great Ritual. The real *Selfish* people should start perfor=
ming this Pujan once a month. This Pujan is celebrated as a bestower of pro=
sperity & Truthfulness and Real *Selfish spiritualist* needs that in curren=
t times so that they can concentrate better on their Sadhanas.

ॐ =

;यदेवाय।
