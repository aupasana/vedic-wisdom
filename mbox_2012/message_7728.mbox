=C2=A0 
Aghora Vimalanada answers the classic question on Why some people =
makes lots 
progress in short periods of time while other take longer time =
with the 
following story.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
**
One Aghora who is doing smashan=
a sadana found himself in difficult situation for 
doing sadana in city env=
ironment, where people might mistake him for black magic 
if does it city g=
rave yards with corpses. Finally he decides to go Forest after 
purchasing =
corpse. He goes to forest =C2=A0near a tree starts repeating a mantra by 
s=
itting on corpse.
=C2=A0
A wood cutter passes nearby, becomes curious of wh=
at is happening there with 
that Aghora. The woodcutter climbs up a tree an=
d watches the Aghora and hears 
the mantra that Aghora is repeating.
=C2=A0=

After some time, one tiger comes and eats the Aghora who is repeating the =
mantra 
on corpse.
=C2=A0
Then this wood cutter climbs down from tree and s=
tarts repeating the same mantra 
that Aghora is repeating by sitting on cor=
pse. After few hours Goddess appears 
to him and tells him that she is plea=
sed with the sadana and asks him to get a 
boon from her.
=C2=A0
Then wood =
cutter becomes puzzled on how =C2=A0Goddess becomes pleased so easily with =

him, whereas Agohora who has been repeating this mantra for days hasn=E2=
=80=99t 
succeeded. He poses that question to the goddess, for goddess repl=
ies that the 
wood cutter has been repeating the same mantra for several of=
 his previous life 
times. In this life time, he only have finish the final=
 few rounds of that 
mantra, also goddess tells him that Aghora who is eate=
n by tiger would need two 
more life times to become successful at that man=
tra. She(Goddess) is the one who 
become a tiger and eaten the Aghora, so t=
hat right circumstances are created for 
wood cutter to repeat this mantra.=
 

=C2=A0
Seeing the unconvinced wood cutter that goddess further explains,=
 if you haven=E2=80=99t 
done this sadana in his previous lives how can you=
 remember this mantra and gets 
courage to sit on corpse, after seeing the =
tiger eating the previous Aghora.
**
=C2=A0
One=E2=80=99s hard work towards=
 spiritual uplift never goes in vain, nature creates the 
right circumstanc=
es for all of us to proceed further from the place where we are 
left off. =
