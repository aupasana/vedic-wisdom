*[SSR] I think I was pointing to the same thing, it takes a lot to get 
there. A person who could do this is unlikely to get in to parihara 
business.*

*[SSR] I think this is what I was saying too, take his philosophy and 
try to get there. If everyone could see god everywhere, we do not need 
so many different kinds of sadhanas.*

*[SSR] An interesting argument, is it not.  There are quite a few 
incidents in Bhagavan Ramana's life to support the fact. Whether 
Bhagavan Ramana has seen GOD matters to my logic since the point was not 
to emulate great souls.  We all believe in existence of electrons 
without ever caring to see them.*

    <b>[SSR] An interesting argument, is it not.  There are quite a few
      incidents in Bhagavan Ramana's life to support the fact. Whether
      Bhagavan Ramana has seen GOD matters to my logic since the point
      was not to emulate great souls.  We all believe in existence of
      electrons without ever caring to see them.</b><br>

                            astrologer. I think the question here is NOT
                            about procedure, rather credibility of the
                            astrologers. Would you do pariharam as he
                            prescribed!<br>
                            <br>
                            One of the important things I heard recently
                            from pravachan's was DO NOT emulate great
                            souls. Probably 99% of us are not capable of
                            seeing GOD every where. There were souls
                            that could live seeing GOD in everything.
                            For example, we can not emulate Bhagavan
                            Ramana. However this statement "GOD is every
                            where" is a good target for us to reach, it
                            takes a one in a million soul to live that
                            way.<br>
                            <br>
                            I do not mean to offend/ undermine anyone's
                            maturity here, however it is dangerous to
                            emulate great souls. <br>
