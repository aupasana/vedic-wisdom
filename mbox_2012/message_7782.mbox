Dear Narasimhaji and other respected elders,
I would like to extend a previ=
ous topic, please.

My father had demised on the 20th of December. It happe=
ned in a Western country with nobody knowledgeable in Bharatavarsha traditi=
ons nearby. We did everything as per laws and injunctions of that particula=
r country. On my behalf besides praying to Almighty I had put into his grav=
e vibhuti and poured Ganga water which I had since my pilgrimage to Badrina=
th for Shraaddha ceremony during Pitru Paksha this year. Also I burn a cand=
le before my father's photo every day praying for his happy afterlife (he w=
as a virtuous person). Nevertheless I feel an urge to know more and do more=
 as per our Hindu tradition. 

I would be extremely grateful for any clarif=
ication on the subject. Also if you are knowledgeable of any useful website=
s containing first-hand in-depth information (not superficials or superstit=
ions) they are welcomed also. I'm sorry if the subject was already covered =
in previous topics. In this case, please, let me know the message number if=
 possible.

With Love to all,
Maneesha
