Three stages of sadhana, as I see it. Purely my own observations. Not point=
s of debate. Everyone is free to disagree.

1st stage of Sadhana: Try out s=
coops of everything, hanging on to solicited or unsolicited advice from any=
where and everwhere, and eventually moving in confused circles, feeling pro=
ud and happy about the fact that, yes I am doing something called sadhana w=
hile many others are not. The mind lies in the communal stage (communal =3D=
 anyone one who mentally identifies to a community not necessarily in a rel=
igious sense), trying to find a community of similar minded individuals and=
 hang on to the same in a subconscious attempt to define itself.

2nd stage=
 of Sadhana: Get bits and pieces of "experiences" in an external format whi=
ch the mind correlates to the process of sadhana and either feels happy, or=
 dejected. Soon it gets boring, for none of these so called external "exper=
iences" are consistent or even replicable at will. Doubts start creeping, b=
oredom sets in, confusions galore, and some fall back to stage 1 described =
above.

3rd stage: One realizes the absolute futility of the external exper=
iences compared to what is happening inside, if at all anything is happenin=
g. Until a transformation process triggers inside the mind, all of it is me=
aningless. The external world may crack open and 33 millions deities may da=
nce infornt, yet it eventually counts for nothing if it is not able to stil=
l the "monkey-mind" and make the sadhaka enjoy a concentrated feeling of in=
ternal joy. This joy will overflow into other secular activities and though=
ts, it's so powerful and dynamic in nature. One who is firmly established i=
n this stage, will never bother too much about the external ritual, its sou=
rce, its accuracy etc. He/she does not shun external rituals, but he/she re=
alizes that the real barometer for judging the efficacy of a sadhana is ins=
ide the mind and heart. This is the beginning of the "alone" phase. Alone, =
but not lonely. In loneliness one craves for external validation, in being =
alone one needs no validation apart from his/her own joy.

As such, if this=
 person were to meet another sadhaka, the only worthy information he/she wi=
ll try to extract is what has the other person experienced internally, and =
be least bothered about what path he/she walks and which deity he/she is tr=
ying to worship. Fancy names and theoretical classifications do not impress=
 him/her anymore.

>From here starts the real journey. Before that, stage 1 =
and stage 2 is like a kindergarten attitude. So each sadhaka must ask himse=
lf/herself objective, where does he/she stand and where is he/she headed!
