Visitor: "Honored sage, should we take the way of monastic renunciation aft=
er our social and family responsibilities are completed?"

Ramakrishna: "Th=
e path of monastic discipline is not necessary for everyone who longs to aw=
aken. The passion for external renunciation is like a bolt of lightning. It=
 may strike at any time. It is not a reasoned choice. But why not renounce =
all sense of limitation, even the limitation of monastic forms? Why not enj=
oy all possible dimensions of human experience as already merged in God? Ca=
n one get completely inebriated on just a few pennies' worth of wine? Fill =
up the whole pitcher!"

This radical response surprises the questioner, who=
 had already tacitly assumed a traditional, pious answer. He gazed, speechl=
ess, at the laughing sage, and then asks with astonishment: "A spiritual pr=
actitioner should lead a worldly life?"

Ramakrishna: "Why not? What is the=
re to fear or avoid when Divine Reality is know to be all-embracing=85 Rela=
tively few persons have the destiny to drop social and personal connections=
 entirely in order to enter the external state of sannyasa - wandering aiml=
essly in the ecstasy of knowledge and love, taking no direct responsibility=
 for educating or serving society in pragmatic ways."

Visitor: "Master, wh=
at does it mean to say that a person has reached the end of worldly enjoyme=
nts?"

Ramakrishna: "=85To come to the end of worldly enjoyments is to EXPE=
RIENCE Divine Bliss flowing through EVERY ACTION, EVERY PERCEPTION."

Visit=
or: "How can I get rid of sexual passion?"

Ramakrishna: "Why get rid of it=
? Turn its powerful energy in another direction. Lust is blind, but the Gre=
at Delight conferred by the Goddess is ever-pure and resplendent."

The new=
 questioner is also disconcerted by such a radical response delivered with =
such wonderful laughter. This seeker has been conditioned by the teaching t=
hat cultivates liberation by categorically rejecting what ever appears as i=
gnorance, limitation, or bondage. Intrigued by the relaxed, all-embracing t=
antric attitude of the Goddess-worshiping sage, drawn deep into inquiry by =
this magnet of Divine Mother's Knowledge and Love, this visible form of the=
 dancing Kali-the seeker cries in consternation: "Please, most revered Mast=
er, why would a benign Deity project the power of ignorance and limitation?=
"

Ramakrishna melts into laughter, his eyes swimming in ecstasy, his body,=
 like burnished gold, glowing with heavenly light. This response emanates d=
irectly from Mother Mahamaya, beyond reason, religion, philosophy. Now our =
Master is weeping tears of pure love: "It is ALL Her Play, Her delirious Pl=
ay. OM KALI, OM KALI, OM KALI!"

Visitor: "Beloved Paramahamsa, who is real=
ly to blame for sexual obsession and its bondage? Men or women?"

Ramakrish=
na: "You are male, so I will speak to you about women. To women, I give the=
 same teachings about the spiritual danger and the spiritual potential of m=
en. A women who has awakened in her body and mind the energy of transcenden=
t wisdom, which is the brilliant healing and enlightening presence of the G=
oddess, can be a tremendous blessing for a male practitioner - as a tantric=
 consort, as consecrated wife, or simply as the inspiring friend of his sou=
l. But a woman who has developed exclusively her biological and social driv=
es is filled with a subtle energy that can be detrimental to the progress o=
f a male aspirant. Eventually - without either person recognizing any dange=
r-she can stifle his aspiration by drowning him in the forces of the limite=
d ego world. Precisely the same facts must be explained to women concerning=
 men...The brilliant feminine energy of wisdom, which incarnates through th=
e bodies and minds of both men and women, cultivates the refined taste for =
sweet spiritual companionship, for knowledge of oneness, for tears of pure =
love, for ecstatic union with various revealed forms of Divinity, and for r=
efreshing renunciation of all deceptive, habitual expectations. By contrast=
, the energy of limitation consists of the random, compulsive play of the m=
ind and senses with their objects - an instinctual drive for experience tha=
t lacks both subtlety and harmony and causes the heart to forget the deligh=
t of Divine Reality, the communion that is natural to the human soul. But, =
both currents - the energy of wisdom and the energy of limitation - are sim=
ply Mother's Energy. When only God exists, who is there to praise and whom =
to blame?" (7)
