Dear Pavan and others,


> it doesn't matter if you perform homam for 3hrs =
or 3 mins and with many materials or little materials


If you have perfect=
 bhakti, then you are absolutely correct. For
imperfect beings,=A0the amoun=
t of time that we *regularly* spend in
front of the sacred fire matters. Th=
e size of the fire and=A0the
materials we offer do matter. By spending incr=
easing amounts of time
in front of a bigger fire, concentration and belief =
will increase. As
a result, shorter times will be more effective in the fut=
ure. The
heart of a bhaktiless person will melt, and wisdom will dawn on a
=
fool. Slowly, but surely.

Spend as much time as you can afford, offering m=
aterials within your
financial constraints, to the biggest fire that you ca=
n safely manage
in your living space. For most of us,=A0a short 15 minute d=
aily or
weekly=A0homam offering small pieces of copra to a small fire is go=
od. A
few people might *regularly* spend 3 hours in front of the sacred
fir=
e. That must be terrific !

sasneham,

=A0 =A0ajit
