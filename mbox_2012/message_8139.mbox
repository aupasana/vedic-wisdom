Hello,
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Several years ago, I was suffering fr=
om similar sort of things and may be much more, but as I kept doing prayers=
 and jap, these were somehow kept at bay. Those days I also used to go to h=
ealers like reiki and also 
learned different types of healing methods for =
personal growth. So again it was a great help in reducing stress and mental=
 pain and wandering.
=A0
What I will suggest that you should check out EFT =
on internet. It is a extremely potent method of self healing and growth and=
 protection. There are several groups which are offering solutions to diffe=
rent problems using EFT.
on you tube etc. Although it is always a very good=
 thing if there is a caring family member or friend to give support but man=
y times we have to=A0make certain effort ourselves. In learning EFT on inte=
rnet you do not have to pay a single penny.
=A0
If it is possible depending=
 on your physical health do body detox every 2/3 months to clean out inner =
system.
I can write certain other methods but it might make you more confus=
ed and I certainly do not want it.
=A0
What ever you decide , Do not leave =
your everyday prayers and jap etc. 
=A0
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

Re=
spected NARASIMHA ji and other learned scholar,

I am posting my condition =
with a hope of getting some relief and solution. Kindly do not judge me bas=
ed on my condition, rather give me some positive solution and perspective t=
o what I am going through.

I am a very strong beloved of god and a very st=
rong devotee. I love to worship him as much as I can.however, all my passio=
n, interest seems to get drained and discouraged due to my mindset and the =
hell I go through because of it. I always , always get negative & abusive t=
houghts and tie those to the god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see a =
negative thing, bad or foul my mind relates or ties it to god. My mind star=
t abusing god with the same foul language.
When I do Japam, =A0my mind woul=
d not get concentration, but goes into this evil mode with racing thoughts.=

I can't see directly into the eyes of god with the fear of my mind abusing=
 him I can't focus my drishti on god statues. My thoughts are extremely fou=
l...most specially foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my wor=
ship, which means I don't give up praying him. I requested him several time=
s to relive me from such pain so that I can increase my devotion and prayer=
s. I love him. I want to pray him.=A0
Currently, my mind and it's racing ev=
il & foul thoughts have become a road block in my devotion and trying to ke=
ep me away from him as much as possible. At one point of time, they dominat=
ed me and I had to stay away from praying him for a while.

Now my question=
s are
Am I a Maha papi or ghora papi that this is happening to me?
Why does=
 it happen to me?
Is it some kind of disorder
Am in incurring wrath of god=
=A0
I am scared to death that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough for=
 some 100 births
What can I do to get out of this perversion and be able to=
 concentrate on him
I want to worship god like every one does
I am highly s=
tressed because of this constant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always =
in pain because of this stress.

Please help me , but do no hate me. Please=
 do not disregard or discard my email. This is a situation I can't disclose=
 to anyone in person with the fear of hatred and resentment. I am hoping to=
 get some relief from learned scholars like yourself.
