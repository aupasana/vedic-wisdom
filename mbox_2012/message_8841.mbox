Dear All,
I would be thankful to know if there are any members in this grou=
p who are based in Bangalore and are doing daily Homa as per the procedure =
given by Shri PVR Narasimha Rao.  I am earnestly interested in doing the Da=
ily Homa and would like to know about others already doing Daily Homa in Ba=
ngalore.  The purpose is for 1) Satsanga and 2) to know about practical iss=
ues concerning where and how to procure the Havan Kund/ Havan materials and=
 to know any best practices (DOs and DONTs).
Thanks in advance.
Best Regard=
s
Krishna
