Namaste all,

"They way of a pilgrim" is very interesting book that I have =
just started to read. It's about a man who succeeds in constant rememberanc=
e of God.

In a nutshell, it's an (annonymous) autobiography of an average =
man from 19th century Russia who began to repeat a Christian 'mantra' calle=
d the Jesus prayer..."Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me a sinner"...day in=
 and day out (after his wife died and he was drawn to the spiritual path). =
And slowly he explains how the mantra began to repeat itself constantly in =
his mind without him having to do anything. He solves the problems of mind-=
wandering and attains
one-pointedness, and various spiritual truths are slo=
wly revealed to him.

By the way, is there anyone on the forum who has actu=
ally experienced this state? If yes, please can you advise how you got ther=
e? How did you overcome obstacles such as laziness, boredom, forgetfullness=
, mind-wandering etc? It would be inspiring to hear your experiences. Readi=
ng stories of highly exalted God realised beings is fine, but it's difficul=
t to relate to them (they seem so far advanced). It sometimes helps to hear=
 from someone who was just like you, and how they worked on themselves.

Co=
ming back to the book, in the first chapter, he is a 'spiritual baby' just =
starting out on the path and completely ignorant (was an ordinary household=
er, but then wife died and his house burnt down and he became poor) He read=
s in the Bible "pray unceasingly" and becomes fascinated with this idea.

H=
e meets a Guru (an elderly monk) and said "I want to pray unceasingly but I=
 don't know how". Guru taught him the Jesus prayer and said do 3000 repetio=
ns a day of the prayer for one week, 6000 a day the week after, and 12000 a=
 day the week after that! After 12000 repetitions a day, he says his tongue=
 felt a bit numb, and his wrist/thumb were hurting a little from counting t=
he beads on his
rosary! But he followed his Guru's instructions fully.

Lat=
er the Guru said, well done...now it's time to repeat this prayer all the t=
ime, keeping other thoughts away as much as possible! How is this possible =
asks the student (as many of us may also ask). The Guru said just try. He t=
ries, and succeeds. Quite inspiring.

For anyone who's interesting in glanc=
ing through a few chapters, a preview is available on google books.
