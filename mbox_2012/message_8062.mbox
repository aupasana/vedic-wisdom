Namaste,

We seem to be caught up in the person called "Arjuna" than the Pe=
rsona. All
of us are indeed in the state of Arjuna's mind when in battle fi=
eld of
life. Arjuna is indeed a personification of Human Spirit to evolve a=
nd win
in life.  I could have been utterly wrong on judging Arjuna not to b=
e a
Jivan Mukta but please refer to Adi Sankara's Jivan Muktananda lahari o=
n
how  a saint moves about. Read about Janaka Maharaj the father of Sita
ma=
taji.......he was a yogi and a saint living in palace.

I'm sorry if i hurt=
 or demeaned the human spirit called "Arjuna" in all of
us. I have only sai=
d that without the touch of Divine, even Arjuna cannot
function on his own.=
 Please follow the sequence of the Geeta, first few
chapters go about with =
the the great warrior with all faculties(He can
shoot arrows in darkness in=
 all directions) is in a sad state as he is
enamored my MAYA and slowly ope=
ns up to the greater states of consciousness
and then goes the nimitta matr=
am bavasavyasachi and then on to Lord's
Viswaroop where Lord tells him that=
 Lord alone does everything and he was
never the doer and hence do the karm=
a without expectation on result with
the "gloves" of "actor" untouched by t=
he wetness of the action. Action
itself on time axis is affected by many va=
riables and the result of course
is not linear but dependent on several var=
iables etc. Action alone does not
bind you, but the expectation of the resu=
lt is already created a dent in
the result.

before we go further, let us u=
nderstand "mukti" from "what" not surely
from "karma" or "Life"? If it is f=
rom Life then it means that Jivan Mukti
is to live in life from being liber=
ated from ego being like LOTUS in the
pond.

I may have over simplified it =
as I'm a tiny tot in the spiritual path and
very sure that i have chance in=
 many future lives to be enlightened as Lord
wants it from not just me but =
all of us.

Maa Bless you all.

Tam durgam durgamam dev=EFm dura-chara vigh=
atin=EFm, Namami bhava-bh=EFt=F4-ham
samsar-arna-vatarin=EFm.

 Goddess Dur=
ga who is inaccessible, who completely removes our misfortunes,
 I bow to Y=
ou who carries us across the flood of this worldly existence and
removes al=
l fear and illusion

Jai Durge

I agree completely. =
Arjuna is held in great respect at other places as well. The whole Kshetra =

<br>
