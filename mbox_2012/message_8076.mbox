Dear learned members of the group
=A0
I read every post pertaining to perfo=
rming homam just to see if my experience matches that of others. And I alwa=
ys find something that validates my experience. Therefore, thanks to Mr Kin=
g_Tanvir who has found a way to perform the homam in a predominantly muslim=
 country. Congratulations.
=A0
My dilemma. I struggle to keep the fire burn=
ing by adding dried coconut pieces, drops of ghee, other such material whil=
e I recite the various mantras prescribed in the manual. But it bothers me =
that my attention is on maintaining the fire when I should be concentrating=
 on the mantras (I try to guess the real meaning behind the words in the ma=
ntra, I understand some intuitively, some not at all, I take the whole by f=
aith). At times when the fire goes out I feel very bad.
=A0
Espeically towa=
rds the end, when i start to meditate, if I have to worry about the fire dy=
ing out, I feel miserable because this is the most important part of the ho=
mam, according to the manual (well, Mr Narasimha).
=A0
My questions: if I h=
ave a guest witnessing the ceremony, is it proper to let the guest keep the=
 fire burning? But what if he also wants to meditate? And my guests are not=
 of Indian origin, they are not comfortable taking an active part in the ho=
mam. They are interested in observing the proceeding, not so much in partic=
ipation.
=A0
I also notice that at times the drops of ghee falling on a sma=
ll fire actually put it off! So I have started to add the drops to the side=
 of the burning flame, may be on a piece of coconut. I make the ghee at hom=
e, so I do not suspect the quality of the ghee:-))
=A0
What am I doing wron=
g?
=A0
Thanks for any advice from the learned members.
=A0
Regards
Ranga
