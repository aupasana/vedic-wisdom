Namaste

I came to know previously of Swami S=
athsivom's work by Narasimha ji's writings.Below is one of the original mes=
sages from Narasimha ji about how the Divine mother gave the vision of star=
ting Mahaganapati homam when Narasimha ji and Manish ji were at the Kalikam=
bal temple in Chennai.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/=

Swami Sathsivom recently consecrated a Shiva temple in San Jose califo=
rnia along with the deities of Pratyangira Devi and I had the good fortune =
of visiting it yesterday.

http://srimahakalmandir.org/

http://vimeo.com/4=
5322018

It is with tears of gratitude that I write this...have no other wa=
y to put it in words ...for the first time in in life was blown away throug=
h a physical experience of the divine in the Sri Pratyangira shrine. I cons=
ider the experience too sacred to put it in words but it is something that =
cannot be explained by wordly reasoning.

All the discussions and books tha=
t I have read so far now seem so chidlish compared to the one true experien=
ce I had ....my million salutations to the feet  of Swami Sathsivom who has=
 given an opportunity to even normal people to experience the divine not in=
 abstract terms  but as a jolt of 20,000 volts of pure physical electricity=
 !!!!!.A million salutations to Narasimha ji and Manish ji for guiding so m=
any Sadhakas on the path.

I did not deserve the experience ...did not have=
 any qualifications.Just wanted to share the experience so that if anybody =
is close to San jose or visiting they could take the opportunity to visit t=
he shrine and experience it.

Regards
