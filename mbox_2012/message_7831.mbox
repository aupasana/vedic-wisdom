Namaste Narasimhaji,

Thanks for answering my query. 

Does word 'yajati' m=
eans to put in yagnya as havan ?

Did Atharva Rishi write the phalashruti a=
s well ? 
I wonder why did Rishis write or make promises in phalashruti suc=
h as if one does havan with 1000 'Modak' one's any wish would be full fille=
d ?

The thought that getting the fruits of sadhana is dependent on one's k=
arma and aptitude is logical and I completely believe in it. I can't unders=
tand why would our learned Rishis make such promises. 

Regards
Aparna
