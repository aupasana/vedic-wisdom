ss, Ego & Experiences


Om Harih Om
Namaste friends,

A lot of people asked=
 in the past how to know if they are making 
spiritual progress with their =
sadhana or not. This is a loaded question, 
but I will share a few random t=
houghts on this and several related 
topics. More than how to recognize spi=
ritual progress, I will be writing 
on how NOT to try to recognize it!

If =
you don't like my 2 cents, kindly feel free to ignore me and follow 
your g=
urus and others whom you may prefer.

*        *        *

MATERIAL RESULTS=


One obvious thing is that some people get material benefits, like 
marria=
ge, job, promotion, childbirth etc. That reinforces or increases 
faith in =
the initial stages and makes one continue sadhana.

However, that may not h=
appen to everyone. Moreover, such material 
results do not necessarily show=
 spiritual progress. So, how do we 
identify spiritual progress?

*        =
*        *

GOAL OF SADHANA

Spiritual progress is an internal thing. It is=
 well characterized in 
scriptures. Though different scriptures may use dif=
ferent words, it all 
boils down to one thing. What binds us is our likes, =
dislikes, 
attachments and agendas, which come from innate conditioning of =
the 
mind. How free we are is indicated by how much we are able to resist a=
nd 
overcome this innate conditioning.

Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama=
 in "Yoga Vaasishtham" that 
Self-realization means overcoming conditioning=
. Patanjali defined Yoga 
(Communion with Self) in "Yoga Sutras" as "yogaH =
chitta vRtti nirodhaH" 
(Communion is resisting the working of conditioning=
).

This conditioning inflates ego and by overcoming all the conditioning, =

we can deflate the ego completely and then identify with the entire 
unive=
rse, instead of a single entity with a single agenda.

*        *        *
=

IDENTIFYING CONDITIONING

Innate conditioning of the mind, as said before,=
 is what determines our 
likes, dislikes, attachments and agendas. We tend =
to like (or dislike) 
some people for no clear reason, we tend to do (or av=
oid) some things 
though our inner voice (conscience) tells us not to do (o=
r to do) those 
things. All this comes from conditioning, which has been ac=
cumulated 
over many lives.

When someone praises us, we may know that it i=
s irrelevant (our inner 
voice tells us so) and yet we may feel elated. Whe=
n someone puts us 
down, we may know that it is irrelevant (our inner voice=
 tells us so) 
and yet we may feel offended and feel like doing something a=
bout it. All 
this comes from conditioning, which has been accumulated over=
 many 
lives.

Idnetifying the conditioning as it works on our instincts, t=
houghts, 
calculations and actions, is not easy. But it is not impossible. =
The key 
is to learn to listen to the inner voice of conscience. Whenever t=
he 
inner voice of conscience is telling us one thing and we are impelled 
=
from inside to do otherwise, we can conclude that that is the work of 
cond=
itioning. We often suppress the inner voice of conscience and obey 
the inn=
er voice of our conditioning.

If we are engaging in fewer and/or smaller a=
ctions - physical or mental 
- that go against the inner voice of conscienc=
e, it means our 
conditioning is becoming lighter. THAT is the only meaning=
ful measure of 
spiritual progress. This may in general be difficult for ot=
hers to 
judge, but one can certainly judge for oneself.

The tricky thing =
is that our self-analysis and self-judgment is also 
controlled by our cond=
itioning!! Suppose I engaged in an action against 
my inner voice. Suppose =
I want to analyze what just happened and whether 
I violated my inner voice=
 of conscience. That whole process is governed 
by the conditioning too. De=
pending on how deeply I am conditioned to 
think that I am a good person do=
ing the right thing and not making a 
mistake, my mind will be impelled to =
label the inner voice of conscience 
as a voice of confusion and not accord=
 it any importance. Instead, it 
will focus on the inner voice of condition=
ing (which shouts out from 
inside the reasons that justify the action!) an=
d conclude that I did the 
right thing.

The grip of conditioning is too ti=
ght to overcome in a day or two! But, 
the inner voice of conscience does t=
ell everyone when one is doing 
something wrong under the influence of cond=
itioning. If one keeps 
trying, it can oneday help one identify and overcom=
e conditioning.

*        *        *

SPECIAL EXPERIENCES

Sometimes, as on=
e makes spiritual progress, one may have super-normal or 
mystical or out-o=
f-body experiences, visions and dreams.

For example, one person I know sta=
rted to feel very light in the head 
with a vision of bright light of a par=
ticular color, when he meditated 
with a specific mantra. Another person fe=
lt like there was a big fire at 
the base of his spine and the entire lower=
 back was on fire (he actually 
felt unbearably hot), when he meditated wit=
h a specific mantra. Another 
person saw a deity appear in front of him and=
 the deity talked to him. 
Interestingly, the same deity was seen by anothe=
r person who was also 
sitting there at the same time and that person had a=
 totally different 
(and more mundane) mental conversation with the same de=
ity at the same 
time. Another person felt like he became very light and wa=
s floating in 
air and there was an inexpressible happiness. In another cas=
e, one 
sadhaka when meditating was filled with the sense that his job was =
done 
on earth and he could now leave. He thought, "let me leave and let me=
 
take some more with me". He felt like he was a point moving up with a 
tr=
emendous speed. At the same time, another person who was meditating a 
few =
feet away in front of a homam fire felt like somebody was pulling 
that per=
son forcibly through a cave and felt really overwhelmed.

There are so many=
 possible experiences. But the key point is that 
experiences are secondary=
. They are NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT for 
spiritual progress. I had =
my share of experiences, progress and setbacks 
and I am 100% sure of the a=
bove. You'll do well to remember this 
sentence and not be swayed by storie=
s of experiences or desire them 
consciously or sub-consciously. I will ela=
bate a little later on the 
grave dangers of desiring experiences.

*      =
  *        *

EXPERIENCE VS THEORY: WRONG QUESTION

We say that god can be =
known only by experience and not by reading 
books. That is not incorrect. =
However, when one is deeply desirous of an 
experience, one may experience =
an aspect of god's Delusory Power instead 
of god and that may increase fal=
se pride (a true experience of god will 
instead produce infinite humility)=
. Not all experiences are equal.

There is a famous quote: An ounce of expe=
rience is better than a ton of 
theory. Though that is true in a way, it is=
 not complete. Even a ton of 
experience is useless if produces a quintal o=
f ego. Instead, a ton of 
theory may actually be better if it actually redu=
ces one's ego to a 
pound or an ounce!

The issue is not whether one needs =
practical experience or theoretical 
understanding. That is secondary. The =
primary thing is what is happening 
to one's ego. Is it getting inflated or=
 deflated? THAT is undoubtedly 
the main issue. If reading books, satsanga,=
 rituals, theoretical 
understanding etc reduce ego from a ton to a quintal=
, from a quintal to 
a pound and from a pound to an ounce, even without a d=
irect experience, 
that's awesome. That is better than getting a ton of exp=
erience and ego 
being inflated from a pound to a quintal.

Though it is tr=
ue that ego does not become complete zero without an 
"experience" of god i=
n the end, it is still a bad idea to seek that 
"experience" when one's ego=
 is still a ton or a quintal. First reduce it 
to as small a quantity as yo=
u can. Experience of god will then come by 
itself.

In the famous Indian m=
ovie "3 Idiots", there is a nice line: "Don't 
chase success, but chase cap=
ability. Success will follow automatically." 
Similarly, don't chase experi=
ences, but chase detachment and deflation 
of ego. Experience will automati=
cally follow. Chasing experience without 
trying to reduce ego is like putt=
ing the cart before the horse. To use 
the analogy from the movie "3 Idiots=
", one then runs the risk of 
becoming the spiritual equivalent of Chatur R=
amalingam (alias Silencer) 
of that movie, who chased success, ended up wit=
h huge ego from limited 
success and failed in the end!

*        *        =
*

EXPERIENCE AND CONDITIONING

As said above, it is a bad idea to seek an =
"experience" when one's ego 
is still a ton or a quintal. In other words, w=
hen one's conditioning is 
dense enough, a pre-occupation with experiences =
can be 
counter-productive. The reason is that any experience will be 
inte=
rpreted (and absorbed into one's system!!!) through the color of 
one's con=
ditioning.

If I go into the open and view Sun without any eyeglasses, I wi=
ll see 
that Sun is orange. But, suppose I see Sun from green colored glass=
 
windows of a house. Or suppose I go into the open, but see Sun through 
g=
reen eyeglasses. In either case, I will see that Sun is green. I am 
experi=
encing the real Sun, but I will get the wrong knowledge that "Sun 
is green=
".

Similarly, even a genuine spiritual experience (e.g. seeing Sun!) CAN 
=
generate false knowledge (e.g. Sun is green!) if one's conditioning is 
con=
ducive (e.g. green eyeglasses!).

The key is not just to experience, but th=
e ability to interpet, *digest* 
and absorb the experience into one's syste=
m well. One's conditioning 
influences how one digests various life experie=
nces, including spiritual 
experiences and mystical experiences, like the g=
reen eye glasses in the 
above example!

*        *        *

DIGESTION OF =
EXPERIENCES

In ayurvedic terms, food one cannot digest well becomes ama, a=
 toxic 
buildup in the system. It can slowly build up, get absorbed into va=
rious 
tissues and create various diseases. In the beginning, one may look =
and 
feel healthy despite some ama, but, when too much ama accumulates, one=
 
develops serious diseases. The disease starts to spread to various parts =

of the body. The ama may even interfere with the digestion of good food 
b=
eing taken in and the working of even medicines one may take in. When 
too =
much ama has accumulated and destabilizes the system, one may need 
to go t=
hrough a painful de-toxification process.

Similarly, spiritual experiences=
 one cannot digest well become spiritual 
ama, a toxic buildup in the subtl=
e system. It can slowly build up, get 
absorbed into various aspects of one=
's being and create various diseases 
in the subtle system. In the beginnin=
g, one may look and feel 
spiritually healthy despite such issues, but, whe=
n too much spiritual 
ama accumulates, one develops serious spirituality di=
sorders. It can 
eventually affect one's entire being. The spiritual pancha=
-karma (for 
de-toxification) may be far more difficult than the physical 
=
pancha-karma.

*        *        *

EXPERIENCES OR DELUSIONS

To illustrate=
 what I mean by spiritual ama and delusions, let me give a 
*hypothetical* =
example.

Suppose someone sits still for a few hours everyday and meditates=
. 
Suppose one starts to get some special inner experiences and some 
seemi=
ngly supernatural things start happening externally around one. 
Suppose th=
ese experiences give one the impression that one is special 
and one is mak=
ing excellent spiritual progress. Suppose one reads some 
spiritual books a=
nd fantasizes "becoming like Shiva" mentioned in those 
books. Then one may=
 start to think "may be, I have become like Shiva" 
and slowly convince one=
self that one HAS become like Shiva. Suppose one 
reads a spiritual book th=
at claims "If one becomes like Shiva, the whole 
universe connives against =
one who causes an offense to him".

Of course, there is a context behind ev=
ery statement and no statement is 
absolute. If one misses the nuances, one=
 may digest and absorb it into 
one's system incorrectly. After all, one co=
uld have also said, "if one 
becomes like Shiva, the whole universe fully c=
o-operates with one and 
there is no way anyone can really cause offense to=
 that person".

Anyway, one in the process of convincing oneself that one h=
as indeed 
become like Shiva may then look for examples of someone causing =
offense 
and suffering bad things. Of course, just as one can find any shap=
es in 
clouds, one can find any correlations in things happening around one=
. 
One will find a few examples. That may reinforce the delusion that one 
=
has become like Shiva. When good and bad happen to people around one, 
one =
may start correlating them to good and bad done by those people to 
one and=
/or to things one has done. Over time, the delusion may become so 
deep tha=
t it just feels so natural and obvious. This is like a serious 
disease dev=
eloping from a toxic buildup of undigested or badly digested 
food. Inabili=
ty to fully understand the spiritual experiences one had, 
the fantasy of b=
ecoming like Shiva, the pre-exising pride (like 
pre-existing ama) and the =
not-so-well-digested notion that offense to 
Shiva causes harm, have togeth=
er created spiritual ama buildup that now 
resulted in a serious disease.

=
Though original experiences may have been genuine, experiences coming 
late=
r on MAY be the result of accumulated delusions (disease) from the 
ill-dig=
ested experiences and notions (ama). Please note that ama is 
conducive to =
creating more ama. When unchecked, disease in one part of 
the system can s=
pread to others.

As said before, the key issue is: Is the ego getting infl=
ated or 
deflated. If ego is getting inflated, then one is on the wrong tra=
ck. 
One is either deluding oneself or ill-digesting genuine experiences du=
e 
to pre-existing conditioning and delusions (spiritual ama). In either 
c=
ase, whatever one is experiencing is not being digested well and is 
weaken=
ing the system instead of strengthening it. If, on the other hand, 
ego is =
getting deflated, then one is on the right track. Whatever one is 
experien=
cing is being digested well and strengthening the system.

*        *      =
  *

SHAKTI, SIDDHIS AND MIRACLES

This emphasis on ego deflation may make =
some people wonder about the 
prominence given in some books to accumulatio=
n of shakti, siddhis and 
miracles. For example, some books describe what a=
 being like Shiva or 
someone less but still with high enough shakti, can d=
o.

Yes, SOME enlightened beings or some beings close to enlightenment MAY =

have a lot of spiritual shakti and be able to do some special things. 
But=
, no book said that you get those abilities by being proud or 
pursuing som=
ething that can make one proud.

In fact, if one looks at those abilities d=
escribed in books and adores 
them from one's *current* levels of dense con=
ditioning, it is quite akin 
to looking at a "green Sun" from green eyeglas=
ses and admiring the 
greenness of that Sun!!! In other words, one has miss=
ed the whole point. 
One with dense conditioning can't even understand what=
 that shakti or 
ability really means or comes from. In order to understand=
 what shakti 
is, to accumulate enough shakti or to reach such a state, one=
 MUST 
deflate one's ego.

Bottomline is this: Most scriptures of most reli=
gions are unanimous in 
teaching the importance of humility, compassion and=
 ego deflation. No 
scripture talks about the glory of pride and ego inflat=
ion. It's as 
simple as that.

*        *        *

GODS, GODDESSES, VISION=
S & CONVERSATIONS

We encounter some people who claim to have visions of go=
ds and goddesses 
and also conversations with them. When probed, there is n=
othing sublime 
coming from the divine beings in their encounters. Whatever=
 the divine 
beings supposedly said is well within what one consciously or =

sub-consciously already knew or believed or wanted to believe.

This may r=
emind one of the encounters of Mahatma Gandhi by the character 
played by S=
anjay Dutt in hit bollywood movie "Lage Rahe Munnabhai". In 
that movie, th=
e visions are due to "chemical imbalance" in Munnabhai's 
mind and the Gand=
hi he sees and can talk to, cannot answer questions 
that Munnabhai himself=
 does not know (but real Gandhi should know). So 
the conclusion is that th=
e person Munnabhai imagines seeing is a 
character in his own mind construc=
ted based on what Munnabhai 
understands of Gandhi.

In the case of divine =
encounters, it may be a little different from this 
movie. It MAY be a divi=
ne being one truly fancied meeting based on all 
that one consciously and s=
ub-consciously knew already, OR it may be a 
real being. Even in the latter=
 case, the being and his/her actions are 
interpreted strictly based on one=
's conditioning, like the "green Sun" 
in our previous example. So, no wond=
er, in most cases, what divine 
beings say fits well within the realm of kn=
owledge one consciously or 
sub-consciously already knew or believed or wan=
ted to believe.

In the rare case of a sadhaka with very little conditionin=
g having a 
real divine encounter, it is like an innocent child meeting mot=
her or 
father, and there is a real flow of divine and sublime understandin=
g and 
wisdom.

Again, the key is not to see a god or a goddess, but to be =

de-conditioned enough to really benefit from it!

*        *        *

KUN=
DALINI AWAKENING & RISE

One more thing people often talk about is Kundalin=
i awakening and rise. 
Kundalini shakti is that through which we are aware =
of self (i.e. this 
is "I"). Kundalini being asleep in Mooladhara chakra me=
ans one does not 
even question who one is and assumes the normal self-awar=
eness that ties 
self down to the physical body and physical senses. Howeve=
r, 
self-awareness rising above this does not necessarily mean spiritual 
p=
rogress or enlightenment. Kundalini awakening is only the beginning of 
a l=
ong process. If one's conditioning is deeply holding down to subtle 
ideas =
of who one is (e.g. I am a great spiritual soul who saved the 
world many t=
imes in the past and came back to save it), an awakened 
Kundalini may take=
 one's notion of self beyond the physical body, but 
will get stuck somewhe=
re else. In fact, one's subtle notions of self may 
become aggrandized when=
 Kundalini reaches conducive regions and one may 
experience things that ag=
gravate and strengthen those notions. One may 
get badly stuck.

As mention=
ed above, any spiritual experience can create spiritual ama 
when not diges=
ted properly. Any pre-existing conditioning may make it 
difficult to diges=
t anything complex. Instead of eating a heavy-duty 
protein bar that one ca=
nnot digest and getting toxic buildup in the 
system, one is better off eat=
ing simple food that one's own system can 
process and digest well.

To be =
clear, whether one's Kundalini is awakened or not, and where one's 
Kundali=
ni is currently, is NOT a measure of one's spiritual progress. As 
Kundalin=
i does not rise through a single path, as the rise is not linear 
and as th=
e obstructions are not uniform in all people, one cannot 
compare two peopl=
e based on Kundalini experiences.

One can cling to the body and overcome a=
ll conditioning slowly and 
oneday Kundalini may awaken and rise all the wa=
y to Sahasrara. Another 
person may awaken Kundalini and it may get stuck s=
omewhere where it is 
extremely difficult to overcome the corresponding con=
ditioning.

The bottomline is that how much conditioning is overcome and ho=
w reduced 
one's ego is is the correct measure of spiritual progress and no=
t 
whether Kundalini is awakened and where Kundalini is.

*        *       =
 *

CORRELATIONS GALORE

Do not get distracted by trying to find *correlati=
ons* that may or may 
not mean much. Suppose you call someone and they tell=
 you, "wow, I was 
just thinking about you". Or suppose you say something a=
nd someone says, 
"wow, I was just thinking about it. You answered me as th=
ough you read 
my mind." Suppose you were unhappy with the happenings in so=
me region of 
the world, did a special sadhana and suppose something bad ha=
ppened 
there. Or suppose you had a desire at the back of your mind, did so=
me 
sadhana and the desire was fulfilled.

In several such cases, correlati=
ng a result with something you did can 
often increase pride and your sense=
 of self-worth. And, doing that will 
not enable you to do your dharma any =
better.

Keep thinking your thoughts and desires, keep doing your actions a=
nd 
keep doing your sadhana. That's it. Don't correlate actions and results=
 
and think that you made X or Y result happen. We engage in actions and 
g=
od gives results. The sense of "I made X happen" is conducive to pride 
and=
 ego inflation. Moreover, you can *never* know *for sure* whether 
action A=
 or B caused result X or Y, because the action-result pipeline 
has variabl=
e delay!! So, why even bother to correlate and run the risk 
of ego inflati=
on?

*        *        *

BOTTOMLINE

Don't run after special experiences a=
nd special abilities or anything 
that makes you special (as you imagine cu=
rrently, based on your dense 
conditioning). Spiritual progress is not abou=
t becoming "special", but 
about becoming humble. Special experiences and a=
bilities do not matter 
at all. In fact, they can distract one and give fal=
se pride. God makes 
one special AFTER one sheds pride completely or almost=
 completely.

Also, stop correlating things happening to or around you, wit=
h your 
actions, and think that you caused events X or Y. Engaging in actio=
ns is 
your sacred duty and giving whatever results are fit at a given time=
 is 
god's prerogative. That is the simplest and safest model one can imbib=
e 
in one's thinking.

Remember the absolute bottomline: The only meaningfu=
l measure of 
spiritual progress is how deflated your ego is and how humble=
 you become 
(not how humble you act or behave, but how humble you have rea=
lly become 
internally). It is how well you are able to resist the temptati=
ons of 
following the voice of your conditioning (which inflates ego) and h=
ow 
well you can follow the voice of conscience.

When inflations in ego oc=
cur, it is the job of a guru/mentor to notice 
it, bring it to the attentio=
n and perhaps even be ruthless in belling 
the cat [of ego]. But most gurus=
 now-a-days may not do that well. So, 
you have to do your best to avoid an=
y serious ego inflations.

Unfortunately, the path of spiritual progress an=
d self-realization IS 
very very very likely for most of us to include many=
 many many 
opportunities for very very very serious ego inflation! So keep=
 a strict 
watch on your ego.
