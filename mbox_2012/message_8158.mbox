Respected Narasimhaji and Learned scholars,

I have a question on shani's =
worship.This is not an astrological question. Currently, all the four membe=
rs of my family are running bad period such as Sade sati, arthashtama sani =
and kantaka shani.

One of shani upasaka suggested to my husband to perform=
 shani Japa during night times at any place other than home. He starts at a=
bout 10:00 PM, draws something on the floor and performs Japa for 4-5 hrs a=
nd goes to temple next day morning before coming home. I am confused on thi=
s procedure.

my question is:

Why should we perform shani Japa at night ti=
mes only? I am suggesting him to do at day times in a shiva temple.
Is ther=
e a method for shani worship written in any scriptures?
Can we perform shan=
i homa?

Please provide me some insights, as I am not comfortable with him =
performing Pooja at night times.

Thanks all
Vasavi
