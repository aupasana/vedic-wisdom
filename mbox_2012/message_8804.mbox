Reaction, Revolution and Dharma Renaissance: 
The Case of Hin=
du Nationalism

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya


"Every major question in=
 history is a religious question. It has more effect in molding life than n=
ationalism or a common language."

- Hilaire Belloc (1870-1953)

The follow=
ing paper will examine the Indian social movement known variously as "Hindu=
" Nationalism, or "Hindutva"[1].

The overtly political aspects of the ongo=
ing Hindu renaissance that has been haphazardly developing for the last app=
roximately 135 years, along with its repeated failure to secure its self-st=
ated aim of instantiating Rama-rajya (Dharmic rule) on the political scene,=
 are crucial topics that very few Hindu intellectuals have addressed in an =
ideologically cogent and politically mature manner.  Some of the few intell=
ectual leaders who have, in fact, addressed this issue in a truly systemati=
c and well-formulated ideological way include Dr. David Frawley (Sri Vedach=
arya Vamadeva Shastri), Sitaram Goel, Ram Swarup and Dr. Koenraad Elst.  I =
have also written about this topic very extensively, but have only begun re=
leasing a limited number of my writings on this matter to the general publi=
c starting in early 2011, The Dharma Manifesto being the ideological d=E9no=
uement of these writings.  The following are a few thoughts on the current =
state of contemporary Dharma politics on the South Asian subcontinent, with=
 an emphasis on the specific case of what is often termed "Hindu" Nationali=
sm.

As we will see, the primary stumbling block that has relegated the gre=
ater Hindutva movement to near irrelevancy in the dual realms of both ideol=
ogical development and engaged political action has been:

1) Its preponder=
ance of reactionary thinking and action, rather than proactive cultivation =
of a more revolutionary outlook and practical strategy to both a.)gain poli=
tical power and to b.) consequently govern the Indian nation-state along pu=
rely Dharmic principles.

2) The lack of the divinely-bestowed spiritual em=
powerment that is necessary for any self-described religious-based movement=
 to secure meaningful success.

By the time the British and other European =
powers began the incremental process of colonial domination in India and th=
e rest of South Asia in 1757, much of the Hindu community in north India sp=
ecifically had already experienced hundreds of years of genocidal religious=
 cleansing at the hands of the Mughals and other Islamic invaders before th=
em. Without doubt, the establishment of European rule over India directly s=
aved Hinduism (and, arguably, much of Vedic spiritual culture that served a=
s the ancient basis of the later phenomenon of "Hinduism") from inexorable =
extinction at the hands of Islam.  If the British had not assumed the admin=
istration of India when they did, Hinduism would most likely not exist toda=
y, and all of present day India would be an Islamic state. All followers of=
 Dharma must be eternally grateful to the British for this inadvertent resc=
ue of the non-Islamic elements of Indian culture.

During the more liberal =
atmosphere of the British Raj period (1857-1947), history witnessed the beg=
inning stages of a budding, if often very confused, and ultimately self-abn=
egating, Hindu renaissance with the emergence of such neo-Hindu movements a=
s the Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission and Hindu Mahasabha, as well as such =
Hindu leaders as Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), Bhaktivinode Thakura (1838-=
1914), Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920), Arumuga Navalar (1822-1879), Gedong=
 Bagus Oka (1921-2002), Sister Nivedita (1867-1911)[2], Annie Besant (1847-=
1933)[3], and many others. As a result of the rediscovery of their Vedic he=
ritage on the part of many 19th century and early 20th century Hindu intell=
ectual leaders, a new sense of political activism in the name of a rediscov=
ered "Hinduism" cautiously developed with the nascent political theories of=
 such people as Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (1883-1966) and Keshav Baliram Hed=
gewar (1889-1940).

The culmination of this new movement, which was decided=
ly devoted to a Hindu identity politics, has resulted in the overwhelmingly=
 dominant role of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (founded in 1925) and its=
 greater Sangh Pariwar family of front organizations over the realm of Hind=
u politics in India for the last 85 years.  The overtly political manifesta=
tion of the Sangh Pariwar movement was eventually manifest in the later Jan=
a Sangh political party.  The party operated under this name from 1951-1980=
.  It was founded by Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee (1901-1953), who was subse=
quently murdered by the Congress Party regime in 1953. Since 1980, the part=
y has been known by the name Bharatiya Janata Party.[4]

There has been a c=
lear, multi-stage trajectory in which pro-Hindu political ideology and acti=
vism have progressed in the last 135 or so years.  Before I discuss the nat=
ure of that trajectory in any significant depth, first I need to lay out th=
e three general morphologies that most political formulations have historic=
ally taken.  There are three general forms of political activity observable=
 in the modern political realm: 1) Utopian, 2) Reactionary, 3) Revolutionar=
y.

Utopian designates a primarily futuristic-oriented politics that tends =
to be very unrealistic and fantasy-fueled.  In many cases utopian-based ide=
ologies tend to be eschatologically-driven and millennial in outlook, with =
the never-achieved (or achievable) promise of a perfect paradise on earth t=
hat can only be delivered by the particular political movement making the g=
iven promise. Such disastrously failed movements as Marxism, Leninism, Maoi=
sm, Anarchism and the political Left in general are Utopian in nature.

Rea=
ctionary, on the contrary, is primarily past-oriented[5] and looks toward a=
 "better, more ordered time", that is historically usually no more than sev=
eral generations previous to the present era, as the archetypal hallmark an=
d model for present-day cultural renewal.  As Nicol=E1s G=F3mez D=E1vila  e=
xplains the mindset of the reactionary: "The reactionary is, nevertheless, =
the fool who takes up the vanity of condemning history and the immorality o=
f resigning himself to it." American reactionaries, for example, tend to se=
e the 1950s as the apex of American civilization. As is clear from the term=
 itself, reactionaries are capable only of reacting to assaults on traditio=
n that they detect around them, and are usually incapable of proffering pro=
-active and positive ideas for how to foundationally transform society for =
the better in the face of modernity's degenerate encroachment upon traditio=
nal values and culture. Reactionaries are especially known for timidity, in=
tellectual incuriosity, lack of vision, as well as narrow parochialism and =
immaturely expressed xenophobia.  Republicans, Tories, and the conservative=
 Right in general fall under this general heading. Utopian and Reactionary =
represent the two furthest opposing extremes of the political spectrum.

Re=
volutionary, on the other hand, describes a political stance that is proact=
ive and constructive in nature, rather than merely utopian or reactionary. =
 Rather than supporting either unrealistic utopian goals, or merely reactin=
g in an ineffectively knee-jerk fashion to the incessant attacks of its opp=
onents,  the revolutionary perspective proffers positive systemic change de=
signed to transform the basic characteristics of a presently-given social r=
eality in a wholly original and fundamental way.  Revolutionaries seek to a=
lter society, not merely peripherally and incrementally, but foundationally=
 and swiftly.

In the very specifically Hindu/Vedic context, the revolution=
ary perspective looks at the ancient past (and not merely two or three gene=
rations back, but millennia back) as the source from which to derive eterna=
l principles that are designed to be used in the present day to create a ra=
dically better future. The Dharmic revolutionary subscribes to an archeofut=
urism, to use Guillaume Faye's instructive terminology.[6] Rather than mere=
ly dreaming about an unobtainable future based upon blind faith and wishful=
 thinking, or conversely, merely reacting in a frustrated manner to the neg=
ative occurrences happening around them, revolutionaries seek systemic (and=
 not merely cosmetic) change in the here and now.

The term "Revolutionary"=
 tends to carry with it the stereotyped, and wholly inaccurate, notion of p=
olitical violence, which is not at all the technical denotation of this wor=
d in political science terminology.  Rather, by "Revolutionary" is meant a =
concept, ideology or movement whose aim is to affect fundamental systemic c=
hanges (i.e., a change of the prevailing system itself), rather than merely=
 cosmetic or surface change alone (i.e., minutial changes and readjustments=
 within the confines of the system).  With this proper understanding of the=
 terminology, the term "Revolutionary" does not in any way denote violence.=


In brief, a Revolutionary movement must have the following features:

A) =
It is predicated upon a grand, but rationally achievable, vision.

B) It is=
 led by a professional vanguard of elite leaders dedicated to achieving the=
 vision, (b.i) who are capable of intellectually formulating that vision in=
to ideological form, (b.ii) who know how to organized the masses in both th=
e largest and most effective ways necessary to achieve the vision, and (b.i=
ii) who themselves wholly personify the vision of the movement in their own=
 personal character and lifestyle; i.e., the leader is the movement.

C) It=
 has a clearly and systematically formulated ideology that encompasses the =
totality of political concern, including a comprehensive and defensible int=
ernal ideological structure, the minutia of economics, a philosophy of gove=
rnance, social relations, geopolitical formulations, etc.

D) It has the ab=
ility to both formulate constructive alliances with like-motivated movement=
s/organizations, and has a keen understanding of all aspects of the opposin=
g forces.

E) Most importantly of all: a revolutionary has the resolute wil=
l to win.

As we look at the last 135 or so years of modern Hinduism, we se=
e that Hindu forms of political expression have progressed roughly and sequ=
entially, though certainly with significant overlaps, through the above thr=
ee stages of Utopian, Reactionary, and Revolutionary.

"We Are One" =96 Uto=
pian Stage (1875-1925)

Beginning in the Colonial era, and continuing down =
to today, such historical trends as the 19th century neo-Hindu movements an=
d Radical Universalism, as well as such historic figures as Swami Vivekanan=
da, Gandhi, and many of the earlier gurus who came to the West, clearly rep=
resented an early Utopian stage of Hindu political expression.  The concern=
s of such Hindu Utopians included such unrealistic liberal Western notions =
as radical egalitarianism, universalism, evolutionary and historico-progres=
sive world-views, temporal-centrism,[7] and such emotionally-driven eschato=
logical visions as the future establishment of a pan-ecumenical world polit=
ical order =96 what today would be more accurately termed the New World Ord=
er.  Such intellectually puerile sentiments, however, did not (and could no=
t) lead to the type of strong Vedic restoration movement necessary to reviv=
e Dharma globally.

Such a Vedic restoration is necessarily radically tradi=
tionalist in nature, and is thoroughly opposed to all the key corrosive ele=
ments that have rendered modernity non-viable. The German intellectual Edga=
r Julius Jung (1894-1934) presciently describes a similar vision of such a =
restoration in the following way.

"Restoration of all those elementary law=
s and values without which man loses his ties with nature and God and witho=
ut which he is incapable of building up a true order. In the place of equal=
ity there will be inherent standards, in the place of social consciousness =
a just integration into the hierarchical society, in the place of mechanica=
l election an organic elite, in the place of bureaucratic leveling the inne=
r responsibility of genuine self-government, in the place of mass prosperit=
y the rights of a proud people."[8]

For Sanatana Dharma to both survive an=
d thrive in the coming decades and centuries, a thorough Vedic Restoration =
along the lines of Jung's words above must be brought about =96 a reaffirma=
tion of Sanatana Dharma's most ancient and orthodox cultural and spiritual =
expression in direct contradistinction to the values of both Western materi=
alist modernity and shortsighted Indian nationalism (i.e., "Hindu" National=
ism).

Most of the formulators and present-day thinkers of the "Hindu Natio=
nalist" movement represent, to one degree or another, a rather sharp histor=
ical and conceptual disconnect from the traditional Sanatana Dharma that ha=
d been taught by the Vedic Acharyas and that had been practiced by the comm=
on Hindu people for thousands of years.  After 1000 years of genocidal batt=
ering on the part of Islamic invaders, modern Hinduism was definitely not a=
t the height of its intellectual, cultural, spiritual and political/militar=
y glory by the time the British arrived on the scene.  By the time the Brit=
ish had saved Vedic culture from extinction, a radically traditional Sanata=
na Dharma, in its unapologetic, pristine, and consciously Vedic-centric for=
m, needed desperately to be reconstructed by her intellectuals and spiritua=
l leaders. Unfortunately, a serious process of tradition-oriented reconstru=
ction was not seriously attempted at that time.

Instead of seeing the dire=
 problems with Hinduism that were present by the 18th and 19th centuries as=
 something that needed to be addressed and cured from within the confines o=
f Sanatana Dharma, the neo-Hindus instead turned to external, non-Vedic, so=
urces for their guiding inspiration. As a result, rather than attempting a =
true reconstruction of authentic Sanatana Dharma, which would have made San=
atana Dharma strong and pure once again, they instead attempted an unnecess=
ary "reform" of Sanatana Dharma along the lines of Christian norms and idea=
ls.

Thus we saw the Christian-inspired, neo-Hindu obsessions with eliminat=
ing "caste", eliminating sati, eliminating murti worship, Christian style m=
onotheism, "social reform" at the expense of intellectual/spiritual develop=
ment, Hegelian historicism, and Radical Universalism. Attendant upon these =
superfluous "reforms", we now witness the sad legacy of a Hindu world confu=
sed about what it believes, about what even constitutes a "Hindu", about it=
s future, as well as Hindu children who are not interested in Hinduism, and=
 a Hindu community of almost one billion people many of whom suffer from in=
feriority complexes and the psychological scars of a people disconnected fr=
om their true spiritual heritage.  What Sanatana Dharma really needed was n=
ever "reform" along these neo-Hindu lines, but rather a positive tradition-=
based reconstruction of its eternal ideals. "Hinduism" needed to re-embrace=
 its true essence as Sanatana Dharma =96 the Eternal Natural Way.

What San=
atana Dharma needed =96 and still needs! =96 were two interdependent develo=
pments.

A) A reclamation of Vedic-based, traditional Sanatana Dharma, with=
 a highly orthodox, Vedic-centric understanding of the unitive and integral=
 Vedic culture that had sustained Sanatana Dharma for 5000 years. It needed=
 a purely Vedic understanding of pramana (valid means of knowledge and deri=
vation of authority), of the nature of Dharma (in the strictest of philosop=
hical senses, not just the popular sense), of what constitutes Vaidika (Ved=
ic) vs. Avaidika (non-Vedic), etc.

B) Once the pure Tradition of Sanatana =
Dharma was reconstructed, the next organic development needed to be a stric=
tly Vedic-based strategy for both juxtaposing, but also actively interfacin=
g, traditional Sanatana Dharma with the modern world.

The latter project o=
f fostering dialogue between Sanatana Dharma and modernity needed to be don=
e, not by falsely denying the differences between the two (as almost all of=
 the 19th century proto-Hindutva figures attempted via Radical Universalism=
), but in the same manner that every other ancient culture had met the chal=
lenge of modernity: recognition of most modern religions/ideologies as purv=
a-pakshas =96 opposing ideological constructs; friendly and open debate wit=
h these purva-pakshas; unapologetic assurance in the exceptional status of =
Sanatana Dharma, and a concomitant refusal to concede to the forced imposit=
ion of an inferior status.

Unfortunately, because the unneeded distraction=
 of "Hindu reform" became the more easily accomplished dominant paradigm of=
 the hour, to this very day the real project of Vedic reconstruction outlin=
ed above has barely gotten off the ground.  It is now time to begin the pro=
cess.

Many of the "Hindu reformers" were well-motivated and sincere person=
s who truly felt that they were acting in the interests of Sanatana Dharma.=
 Many of Ramakrishna's words are very inspiring and wise. Swami Vivekananda=
 was a truly courageous and talented leader who the Hindu people can and sh=
ould take immense pride in. More, many of these personalities did accomplis=
h some good in providing at least some modicum of a vehicle for interfacing=
 Sanatana Dharma and modernity, however self-destructive this particular ve=
hicle has ending up being in the long-run.  In formulating a Christian-insp=
ired paradigm for Vedic survival with only short-term successes in mind, ho=
wever, they did not have the long-term implications of their syncretism in =
mind.

"We Are Different" =96 Reactionary Stage (1925-1945)

Beginning roug=
hly in the Interwar period (the 1920s and 1930s), we then see the formulati=
on of a strictly Reactionary form of Hindu politics with the emergence of S=
avarkar, Savitri Devi (the European Pagan writer Maximiani Portas, 1905-198=
2),[9] the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, etc. The uniformed paramilitary for=
mations, martial aesthetic, stress on character development, egalitarian et=
hos combined with a rigid hierarchical structure, and much of the generic p=
atriotic rhetoric of the RSS was directly appropriated from the newly immer=
ging, parallel nationalist movements that were sweeping the European contin=
ent during the 1920s.

Unlike their much more successful European counterpa=
rts, however, this new reactionary Hindu movement had very few innovative i=
deas, did not know how to successfully engage in politics either electorall=
y (not till the 1980s at the earliest) or in terms of mass mobilization (ot=
her than borrowing heavily from the paramilitary structure earlier develope=
d by their much more successful counterparts in the various nationalist org=
anizations of contemporary Europe), were wholly disconnected from the tradi=
tionalist and orthodox Vedic understanding and practice of the Yoga traditi=
on, had no clear understanding of Dharmic political theory, and most import=
antly, did not know how to construct an elite political vanguard capable of=
 leading the people by their own spiritual example.

The RSS and Sangh Pari=
war defined itself, both historically and to this very day, exclusively in =
negative juxtaposition to what they were not: they were not Muslims; they w=
ere not Christians; they were not Marxists; thus, if only by necessary defa=
ult, they were "Hindus".  However, to this very day, the RSS has found itse=
lf incapable of defining in positive identitarian terms what it actually me=
ans to be a Hindu in the spiritual sense of this term. Savarkar's blind imi=
tation of then-fashionable European racialist theory in the formulation of =
his interpretation of "Hindutva", or "Hinduness", as designating a specific=
ally racial group was doomed to failure from the outset. For Savarkar and a=
ll those who followed in his footsteps, being Hindu meant being Indian; bei=
ng Indian meant being Hindu. Thus, Hinduism for the Hindu Nationalists was =
merely another term for the Indian race![10] Being a politician, and not a =
Vedic philosopher, Savarkar did not understand that Sanatana Dharma does no=
t equate to the Indian race. Sanatana Dharma is a world-view and spiritual =
tradition. It is the sacred heritage, not merely of those people who happen=
 to possess an Indian passport, but of the entirety of the Indo-European pe=
oples.

To this day, rather than facilitating the radical, systemic change =
necessary to bring about a new Dharma civilization (which is clearly not at=
 all the aim of these Hindutva movements, and never has been), the Reaction=
ary tendency in pro-Hindu politics has shown itself to be an un-visionary, =
anti-intellectual, philosophically impotent and currently irrelevant politi=
cal force. It finds itself dedicated more to a rather light version of Indi=
an Nationalist conservatism than Vedic nation building.

The deepest extent=
 of their political program essentially consists of a return to an era more=
 within the comfort zone of the octogenarian men who lead this reactionary =
movement =96 possibly a return to India circa 1855 for Savarkar and Hedgewa=
r, or an India circa 1955 for an Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advan=
i. A Dharma Nation will never be achieved by the feckless Reactionaries, if=
 only because such a goal is not even within the scope of their actual aims=
 or intellectual understanding.

Sadly, the vast bulk of so-called "Hindu a=
ctivism" that takes place today still falls under the category of Reactiona=
ry, and is more a reflection of amorphous Indian Nationalism, and general p=
ride of place and ethnicity than any serious attempt to reorder society (ei=
ther Indian, American, or global) in such a manner as to reflect Dharmic pr=
inciples instantiated in concrete political form.

Many of the attempts at =
polemical and ideological writing that we have seen arising from "Hindu Nat=
ionalists" make it all too apparent that they are not yet politically matur=
e enough to either vie for power or to govern a working nation-state. When,=
 and only when, it comes to the point that self-described "Hindu Nationalis=
ts" develop the philosophical maturity to engage in the nuanced ideological=
 struggle necessary to win power, and only when they learn how to develop t=
emporary and practical alliances with others while also keeping the greater=
 goal of political power in mind, will they be ready to govern the current =
nation-state of India. Only then will "India" become Vedic Bharat once agai=
n! Contemporary "Hindu Nationalism" needs to move away from the fantasy-rhe=
toric level that they have wallowed in for so many decades, and begin the h=
ard work of engaging in real politics in the real world.

"We are Vedic!" =
=96 Transforming the RSS into a Revolutionary Movement

Without doubt, the =
current attempt at Vedic restoration is seen as almost being synonymous wit=
h the vision, leadership, organizational structures and ideological pronoun=
cements of the RSS movement.  With approximately six million dedicated acti=
vists, the RSS is officially the largest volunteer organization on the Eart=
h today. Unfortunately, the RSS has served as a sadly flawed and ideologica=
lly challenged vehicle for Vedic restoration.  The RSS will need to address=
 the following problems if it is going to transform itself from a Reactiona=
ry movement to a Revolutionary one:

A) Distinguishing between Indian Natio=
nalism versus Vedic Restorationism.  Many difficulties arise when these two=
 separate concerns become indistinguishable, as they very clearly have in t=
he minds of almost all "Hindu Nationalists".  Indian Nationalism is an ethn=
icity/national/racial movement.  Vedic Restoration, on the other hand, is a=
 religious/cultural/philosophical one.  The RSS has, in my opinion, been mo=
re of an Indian Nationalist movement than a Vedic Restorationist movement. =
More, this is the primary reason why the BJP so badly lost the Indian natio=
nal election of 2004 =96 because they tried to appeal to Muslims, Christian=
s, pseudo-secularists, and other non-Hindu Indians merely as patriotic Indi=
ans, rather than appealing exclusively to the majority community as followe=
r of Sanatana Dharma[11].  The RSS's main concern has become Indian Nationa=
lism rather than Sanatana Dharma=85and this has only set the movement back.=


B) Within the current day Vedic Restorationist movement, we must clarify =
the difference between Hindu Revival (a political/social/cultural phenomeno=
n), which the RSS is predominantly engaged in, versus Vedic Reconstruction,=
 (an intellectual/academic/philosophical/spiritual matrix of projects), whi=
ch is precisely what such individuals as David Frawley, Swami Dayananda Sar=
asvati, Shrikant Talageri, Subhash Kak and myself, as well as other, more t=
raditionalist, Vedic thinkers are engaged in. Both are projects of seemingl=
y rival significance, and the different natures, goals and methods of these=
 two separate projects need to be understood.

C) Within the parallel proje=
cts of Hindu Revival and Vedic Reconstruction, we need to distinguish betwe=
en a Neo-Hindu versus a Traditionalist world-view, which has been addressed=
 to a much greater extent in the book Radical Universalism: Are All Religio=
ns the Same?, by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya.

The RSS is currently a neo=
-Hindu, revivalist, Indian Nationalist movement. What it needs to become is=
 a Traditionalist Vedic Reconstructionist movement. Like some of the 19th c=
entury neo-Hindus of the past, the RSS has done much good for the Indian na=
tion-state historically. The RSS has been on the front-lines of defending H=
indu India from foreign aggression, both military and missionary.[12] The s=
acrifices of countless individual RSS members are too numerous to mention. =
 Today, however, both India and Sanatana Dharma need radically more. The RS=
S needs to change quite radically if it is going to maintain itself as an e=
ffective organization in the future.

The following is a ten point program =
that Hindu Nationalists should implement if they truly wish to transform th=
eir nation of India for the better.

1) Annihilate the immediate existentia=
l threat from the Communist terrorists, Islamic Jihadists and Christian mis=
sionaries who have enslaved your country.

2) Stop graduating countless eng=
ineers, "IT professionals" and medical personnel, and instead begin to once=
 again encourage your children to become philosophers, sadhus (sages), arti=
sts, thinkers, warriors and leaders.

3) Revive the Kshatriya warrior spiri=
t of your ancestors and no longer revel in weakness in the name of ahimsa.
=

4) Re-Aryanize, re-Vedicize and re-spiritualize the entirety of your prese=
nt-day culture.

5) Eliminate the Dalit problem once and for all by allowin=
g those many individuals who are eligible among this community to enter the=
 varna system in accordance with their inherent individual psycho-physical =
nature. If a Dalit behaves like a brahmana, then he is a brahmana. Period!
=

6) Learn to interact with modernity in a successful manner. That means, wi=
thout excuses, rededicating yourselves to excellence and perfection in ever=
ything you do and communicate.

7) Build your own economy instead of depend=
ing upon the West for economic success via immigration and outsourcing of j=
obs. To do this, you will need to completely exorcise your economy of even =
the slightest taint of socialism and collectivism. Once and for all =96 Soc=
ialism simply does not work!

8) Start to carry yourselves with courage and=
 pride in your Vedic heritage, rather than viewing this heritage as an emba=
rrassing burden from the past. If you do not reclaim your immense Vedic her=
itage, someone else will reclaim it from you.

9) Make spoken Sanskrit the =
sole recognized language of your nation.

10) To successfully achieve all o=
f the above, stop reaching for any and all excuses for why you have not yet=
 been able to achieve these goals. Victory belongs only to those who reject=
 excuses. Then, and only then, will Bharat regain the respect of the world.=


Dharma Nationalism: A New Revolutionary Approach

The new stage that Hind=
u activism needs to take is undoubtedly the Revolutionary approach. It is c=
lear that Indian Hindus now need to enter the Post-RSS phase of Hindu activ=
ism. As a starting point, 21st century Hindu activism needs to make a sharp=
 break from its more paranoid and pessimistic past, and begin to start thin=
king in much more realistic, concrete, strategic and winning terms.

The en=
emies of Dharma have had the gift of being able to think and strategize on =
a long-term basis. Their end goal has always been the end of Dharmic civili=
zation and the creation of their own dystopic vision of reality ranging cen=
turies into the future! Contemporary Hindu activism, on the other hand, has=
 only seemed able to operate reactively, only thinking about some immediate=
 injustices that have just occurred in the news today =96 and even then onl=
y rarely reacting effectively, if at all. The contemporary Indian Hindu act=
ivist movement needs to stop looking for excuses, and beat the enemy at the=
ir own game.

A truly Revolutionary Dharma activist movement has not existe=
d on the world scene until 2012.  The seeds of its birth have now come to f=
ruition in the form of the Dharma Nationalist movement.

Indeed, the Indian=
 nationalist fueled "Hindu" activism of the past will now quickly take a ba=
ck seat to the spiritually fueled Dharma Nationalist activism of the future=
. Unlike parochial "Hindu Nationalism", Dharma Nationalist activism is, ind=
eed, comprehensively total in its application. It is based primarily upon s=
piritual/philosophical concern, and only secondarily on ethnic/national con=
cern. It is motivated by the spiritual insight and compassion gifted to us =
by the eternal Truth of Sanatana Dharma, and not merely on an empty pride r=
esiding in the relative and temporal, ever-changing geographical boundaries=
 of the nation-state of India. It fosters a true selfless action akin with =
that of the rishis, and not merely a series of political calculations based=
 upon the personal need for power and aggrandizement.

More crucial than an=
y other juxtaposing comparison to the failed Hindu activist endeavors of th=
e past: Dharma Nationalism presents a clear, realistic, and achievable stra=
tegic diagram revealing exactly how society should be best structured in or=
der to ensure the maximal amount of happiness and prosperity, to the fulles=
t degree of qualitative and spiritual depth, for the greatest number of liv=
ing beings. This fact will be abundantly evident upon an attentive reading =
of The Dharma Manifesto.
