Dear Aparna,

<<Please could you reccommend some articles/books on tantra. =
>>

You can find books on the philosophy of Tantra, but finding authentic s=
tuff on the practices of Tantra are not easy. Some tend to sensationalize, =
some tend of derogate, some merely skim the surface. I like the writings of=
 Sir Arthur Avalon, specially his book "Shakti and ShaktA". It deals with t=
he broad philosophy of Tantra as a path. He was a British Judge of the Calc=
utta High Court during the English rule in India, when he got initiated int=
o Tantra. He learnt Sanskrit and translated many of the rare Tantrik Manusc=
ripts into English and spend the rest of his life lecturing on Tantra acros=
s various Universities. Most of the new age books on Tantra are but a rip-o=
ff from Arthur Avalon's work. You may also try reading "Aghora - at the lef=
t hand of God" by Dr Svboda. That books actually throws much light on some =
esoteric aspects of Tantra. But before all that, you have to first see if y=
ou like it. Not everyone really likes Tantra, which is ok. Infact of the
 p=
eople who are public figures, very few have the kind of insight and wisdom =
as Dr Svboda does when it comes to understanding Tantra. Rest of the good p=
eople keep themselves private.


I am not a fan of Osho, but I like one sta=
tement of his where he says, "In the Upanishads the Rishis asked "Why?", in=
 the Tantras the Rishis asked "How?". 


In Yoga the idea is to restrain th=
e inputs from the sense-organs and eventually discover the changeless state=
. In Tantra the idea is to divinize the inputs from the sense-organs and ev=
entually spiritualize yourself, transform the limited personality into a di=
vine one and live in this world. End results of both the paths are practica=
lly same, but the perspectives and paradigms are different.=C2=A0

It is ve=
ry difficult to meet a genuine Bhairavi, even in this age when society has =
become relatively 'free' 

with respect to women expressing themselves and =
sexuality in general. What the beat generation and hippie movement and wome=
n's-lib movements are doing today, the Tantras had done it ages ago but on =
a firm plank of practical spirituality. The term Bhairavi refers to a form =
of the Divine Feminine energy (Aadya Shakti), a Goddess in her own rights, =
whose energy, if it were to possess a woman, would make her so fearless and=
 rooted into herself that she would not mind transgressing and breaking soc=
ial mores and thus evoke either fear or awe or a sense of disowning from a =
society conditioned over centuries to believe in fixed ideas of spiritualit=
y and moral behavior. On a practical side, every genuine Bhairavi always, a=
lways looks a good decade or two younger than their physical age, and tend =
to have some very distinct and remarkable facial features. In Vaishnava Tan=
tras, which have become extinct now, Krishna was considered a MahaBhairava =
and Radha was His
 Bhairavi. 

Anyway, if you are meant to meet one, you wi=
ll I am sure. 

<<it's not a perfect homam technique wise, but I try and pu=
t a bit of 
heart in it. And if I can't find any heart, I blame Durga for n=
ot giving
 me any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I'm afraid, but as she m=
ade me,
 it's her own fault). >>

Homas with heart are a good thing. Eventu=
ally it strengthens the inner voice and helps one to progress. Fire is a po=
werful medium of worship.

________________________________________________=

BTW, the concept of Virodha Bhakti is more complex. One must intensel=
y and continuously hate God with a vengence if that has to have any effect.=
 Occasionally being angry or accusative is not the same, because that is ra=
rely equal to hatred. People often get angry on those they actually love. I=
n recorded history, apart from two or three people, no one has succeeded in=
 attaining God by actually hating him/her/it.

Namaste Rajarshi ji,

Thank you for the very =
interesting information about tantra, a subject I know very little about. 
=

It sounds fascinating. Making an idol of Durga from the mud collected from=
 the house of a widow and a prostitute! I interpret that ritual to demonstr=
ate that Durga abides in the heart of a prostitute as much as she does in t=
he heart of a saint, and so the soil from both their houses is equally sacr=
ed. 

I'm glad to hear you say that tantra has so many women of high spirit=
ual calibre...that's very inspiring. What a pity we don't hear much about t=
hem.

I recently read a wonderful book about the women saints of India, cal=
led "Daughters of the Goddess", written by an American devotee of the Godde=
ss (Linda Johnsen). She asked the same question "Where are the women saints=
 of India?". A Pandit ji replied, "just because they don't stand on public =
stages and give seminars, doesn't mean they don't exist!". Linda then went =
on a pilgrimage to India and met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anandi Ma and other l=
iving realised saints in the female form. I've met Amma, but would love to =
meet some of the yoginis and Bhairavis you mention.

I'm curious about tant=
ra and would like to learn more about it. I like Japa as my main spiritual =
practice,  but I'm open to learning about other paths (tantra probably incl=
udes Japa for all I know). And learning more about Goddess worship would be=
 great. I see Durga as my spiritual guide, keeping me on the path, doing th=
e Sadhana with me (because I'm too lazy to do it on my own), and Hari as th=
e goal (actually they're the same in my head and are both my goal as my div=
ine parents). The cowherd girls of yore, clever girls, knew that the Goddes=
s alone could give them Hari...as we all know, they famously worshipped Kat=
yayani asking for Krishna, and She gave Him to them! 

Please could you rec=
commend some articles/books on tantra. I would love to have a read and educ=
ate myself on this, and may be even, add something to my practice. My only =
worhip of Durga currently (aside from abusing and praising her alternately)=
 is repeating her mantra Om Dum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha=
) randomly. (My main mantra that I got intiated into from a Swami of the Si=
vananda tradition is Om Namo Narayanaya.) And I have recently added homams =
to my practice, albeit only once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Har=
i with it (it's not a perfect homam technique wise, but I try and put a bit=
 of heart in it. And if I can't find any heart, I blame Durga for not givin=
g me any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I'm afraid, but as she made me, i=
t's her own fault). 

Thanks again for the message, and here's to tantra, t=
he path that treats women as equals! 

Aparna

there was never any restriction to females with respect to sadhana. Not onl=

chieved as "uttara-sadhikas", "bhairavis" and "yoginis". While mainstream H=
induism was busy burning widows alive in the name of some dubious rules, Ta=
ntras boldly declared Sati-daha as an abomination, rejected the caste-syste=
m totally, and allowed women the status of spiritual preceptors when they c=
ould attain certain states. One of the Gurus of Sri Ramakrishna was a Bhair=
avi who taught him Tantra. The first person to worship

 the Vindya Hills was the wife of a disciple of Sri Ramana Maharishi, who w=
as initiated into this worship by a Bhairavi in Mithila. If a Bhairavi has =
the caliber to teach a Ramakrishna, would she not have the caliber to act a=
s gurus for average folks? Sure. But then, history does not even record her=
 real name. Why? Because, the system of Tantra as well as those who followe=
d the path - both men and women - were firmly rejected by mainstream brahmi=
nical Hinduism; thus they never gained any popularity, except for the wrong=
 reasons. 
>

dia is still a watered-down version from the Tantras. The concept of ChanDi=
 Homa was first mentioned in the Damara and Katyayani Tantras. In Bengal ev=

etc etc.]

of the Goddess was popular. Even the misguided thugees - infamous worshiper=

since Tantras strictly forbid harming the female of any specifies for a wor=

, objectively it would not fall on those whose chief worship was of Durga o=
r Kali or one of Her forms.

ute! I interpret that ritual to demonstrate that Durga abides in the heart =
of a prostitute as much as she does in the heart of a saint, and so the soi=
l from both their houses is equally sacred. <br>
<br>
I'm glad to hear you =
say that tantra has so many women of high spiritual calibre...that's very i=
nspiring. What a pity we don't hear much about them.<br>
<br>
I recently re=
ad a wonderful book about the women saints of India, called "Daughters of t=
he Goddess", written by an American devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen).=
 She asked the same question "Where are the women saints of India?". A Pand=
it ji replied, "just because they don't stand on public stages and give sem=
inars, doesn't mean they don't exist!". Linda then went on a pilgrimage to =
India and met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anandi Ma and other living realised sain=
ts in the female form. I've met Amma, but would love to meet some of the yo=
ginis and Bhairavis you mention.<br>
<br>
I'm curious about tantra and woul=
d like to learn more about it. I like Japa as my main spiritual practice,  =
but I'm open to learning about other paths (tantra probably includes Japa f=
or all I know). And learning more about Goddess worship would be great. I s=
ee Durga as my spiritual guide, keeping me on the path, doing the Sadhana w=
ith me (because I'm too lazy to do it on my own), and Hari as the goal (act=
ually they're the same in my head and are both my goal as my divine parents=
). The cowherd girls of yore, clever girls, knew that the Goddess alone cou=
ld give them Hari...as we all know, they famously worshipped Katyayani aski=
ng for Krishna, and She gave Him to them! <br>
<br>
Please could you reccom=
mend some articles/books on tantra. I would love to have a read and educate=
 myself on this, and may be even, add something to my practice. My only wor=
hip of Durga currently (aside from abusing and praising her alternately) is=
 repeating her mantra Om Dum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) r=
andomly. (My main mantra that I got intiated into from a Swami of the Sivan=
anda tradition is Om Namo Narayanaya.) And I have recently added homams to =
my practice, albeit only once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Hari w=
ith it (it's not a perfect homam technique wise, but I try and put a bit of=
 heart in it. And if I can't find any heart, I blame Durga for not giving m=
e any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I'm afraid, but as she made me, it's=
 her own fault). <br>
<br>
Thanks again for the message, and here's to tant=
ra, the path that treats women as equals! <br>
