Theoretically speaking apart from the soul, it is the mind-stream that live=
s beyond death and reincarnates in a suitable body based on vasanas and kar=
mas. It is here that the desires, karmas, etc are stored.

In another persp=
ective, the soul is a particular state of awareness I guess. When one is ab=
le to reach there, then and only then does one 'discover' the Atma. Constan=
t identification with that state is being in the Atmah.
