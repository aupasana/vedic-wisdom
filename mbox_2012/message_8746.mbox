=C2=A0
Of course, everything is created, sustained and eventually =
destroyed, by Her. And, yes, all are Her children. But, my friend, her Grac=
e flows to different people in different ways, depending on their readiness=
 and, more importantly, what they desire and how they are conditioned. Afte=
r all, a mother who gives laddus to a grown up kid does not give the same t=
o a baby - she gives milk instead. To another unruly kid beating other kids=
, she may deny food and give him a good beating. Similarly, how divine Moth=
er's grace flows to one depends on one's readiness, conditioning, attitude =
and actions.

Let us take more down to earth a=
nd repugnant example. Let us take a criminal such as a rapist or a mass mur=
derer. The rapist, his mind and mindset are also "created by Her". He too i=
s "Her child" and recipient of "Her Grace".
=C2=A0
If someone tells the rap=
ist or mass murderer that it is bad karma with bad consequences and one sho=
uld try to change, will we then also say "nobody should feel any sort of fe=
ar or pressure even for one second because there is no such hocus pocus bad=
 karma and consequences ... there is Grace of Divine Mother on all Her chil=
dren"?

=C2=A0
If a sadhaka experiencing a higher realm entertains not=
ions of being special or accomplishing something great, one can get stuck i=
n that delusion and look at everything around one from that delusional and =
egoistic point of view. There is nothing hocus pocus about it. This is very=
 real and happens to many excellent sadhakas.
=C2=A0
It is not that She doe=
s not love such a person. She loves even the rapist, so why not that sadhak=
a? But She gives results *compatible* with one's actions and one's conditio=
ning and of course opportunities to overcome one's conditioning and engage =
in better actions. If one uses those opportunities, Her Grace flows even mo=
re.
=C2=A0
What Sri Aurobindo said amounts to asking people to use those op=
porunities. This is not a matter of fear or pressure. This is a matter of b=
eing responsible for one's actions and attitude and developing perfect surr=
ender.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
It is easy to hide behind mis-conceive=
d understanding of high concepts such as "divine Grace" and "divine Mother'=
s Love". If misunderstood, it can simply descend into being another flavor =
of pseudo-Vedanta and fatalism.
=C2=A0
Yes, divine Mother loves all and Her=
 grace flows towards all, but our conditioning, attitude and actions do mat=
ter. She does not give one which is not good for one (and for the world), b=
ased on one's current attitude. She gives only when one is ready. Asking on=
e to be better prepared for Her grace does not tantamount to "fear or press=
ure".

=C2=A0
These notions are not easy to discuss =
in written words. Even if we are sitting in the same room and talking (i.e.=
 tone and emotion are visible!), it may be tough. In written words, so much=
 more is lost.
=C2=A0
Also, certain words, concepts and styles of expressio=
n trigger some baggage and conditoning and may make one love or hate someth=
ing.
=C2=A0
I have no solution, except for asking people to be more cautiou=
s and patient in trying to understand what the other person is saying.
=C2=
=A0
Regarding your story of Aurobindo saying that Krishna forgot, I am afra=
id you misunderstood him. In any case, Sri Aurobindo is definitely a really=
 elevated soul. Please spare yourself from the undesirable karma of thinkin=
g negatively about such souls.

How are you doing? About 200 hundred yea=

I am sure this is not your theory. You have taken i=

utes or so. I could not believe what I was reading. Then my respect for thi=
s yogi went down the drain. 
=C2=A0 
Divine Mother, Her Love, Her Grace Her=
 Protection and other Eternal Divine Beings are outside of our human percep=
tion. They only allow us to know about Themselves what They wish to. For me=
 there is a difference between a yogi and devotee.=C2=A0 A devotee rises du=

 lot of huff and fuff, and they get stuck everywhere. I am sure there are o=

So nobody should feel any sort of fear or pressure even for one =

Dear Utpal, 

Agreed -:) =


If we do not forget the parameters of judgement, then sadhana is fruitful=
, IMO. Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameters of judgement is =
to objectively see what changes are happening in our surface, day-to-day co=
nsciousness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc. 

The fiel=
d of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some of it ca=
n be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. Most =
spiritual people have never gone in depth trying to analyse and understand =
these things properly, but some pattern is observable.=C2=A0 Not all experi=
ences are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jun=
gle of experiences, not being able to adequately determine which is genuine=
 and which is non-genuine. This is the world of astral=C2=A0 plane, driven =
by the overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of=
 a human being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping =
influence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everyt=
hing=C2=A0 is possible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser =
manifestation in this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are en=
dless beings of varies character and hue who can very easily create an
 exp=
ereince for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an=
 experience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a se=
eker and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the l=
ower extreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a sur=
face ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious amb=
itions, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc et=
c and at the other extreme this layer can, if properly=C2=A0 channalized as=
 is done in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divine Anan=
da and manifest the "antaratmah" as an unfailing guide to the path. 

In a =
nutshell, a genuine "experience" is good and authentic only to the extent t=
hat it helps to modify and transform your waking surface personality. That =
is the only true test. Rest all the range of experiences that come from thi=
s realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are =
just sound and fury without substance. 

In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, =
he calls it the intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis wh=
o have got swept away by the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot w=
ay to cross this realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, =
is to hang on tightly to the fundamentals.
