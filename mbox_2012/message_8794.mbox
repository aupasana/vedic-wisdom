Namaste,

Very valid question which we all keep wondering about from time=
 to time. My take on it.

=C2=A0

<<But how does one identify the boundary =
at which you stop following a rule? Many a times, I find keeping count of m=
antras slightly distracting and feel that I 
should instead just sit and me=
ditate for some time. May be more time 
some day and less time on other day=
s.>>

The boundary has to be determined by the seeker himself/herself, or i=
f he/she has a Guru who has accomplished the full sadhana of that specific =
path, or an uttara-sadhaka (a more advanced sadhaka). All fixed rules are b=
ased on circumstances when the rules are set. From time to time the rules n=
eed to be modified, added, or subtracted or improvised based on current sit=
uations.

Let me give you an example. There are some people here who do Cha=
ndipath and Chandi homas. Now the historically, the Sri Sri Chandi is a Tan=
tric text which was the mainstay on Kali-Kula Tantric Paramparas for ages. =
Maximum worship, and siddhis of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana has happened from pa=
ramparas originating and centering around the Kamakhya Shakti Peetha. These=
 paramparas had fantastic Gurus, some of whom were really Mahasiddhas. If y=
ou follow the texts from these paramparas, which are very ancient, one shou=
ld not even touch the book of Sri Sri Chandi until one has been given a gen=
uine Shaktipath diksha by a competent Guru. First there is a Shakta Abhisek=
h, then=C2=A0 once a certain level is reached a PurnaAbhisekh, and in some =
rare cases a BhairavaAbhisekh. Moreover, the Tantras are clear that to achi=
eve the grace of Sri Sri Chandi a sadhaka must stay completely alone and do=
 the sadhana in a deserted shiva-temple, or inside a forest where humans do=
 not
 enter, on a hill-top where people do not live, near a river bank unde=
r certain specific trees where there is no habitation nearby , or a smashan=
 which is away from the city. These were the original instructions and whoe=
ver did not follow the same can, it was said, fall in serious trouble inclu=
ding but not limited to death. But over time, many other people have done s=
adhana of Sri Sri Chandi, often not following all the laid down rules or im=
provising on them, and yet achieved various degrees of high **realizations.=
 So rules need to understood first, and the reinterpreted based on circumst=
ances.

Similarly for everything there are many rules laid out at various p=
oints of time by great masters, which are at times even contradictory, and =
they have a deeper reason too. But if you can figure out the reason behind =
the rules, or someone helps you to figure out the reason, then you can very=
 well improvise based on your current situation. At any cost, it is good an=
d nice to have some joy in your sadhana by maintaining a right balance betw=
een being too strict on rules vs following what thoughts come naturally to =
aid your sadhana.


The word meditation in English really covers two differ=
ent concepts. a) Concentration. b) Contemplation.

For concentration you si=
t in an asana and fix your thoughts on something, be it a mantra or a deity=
 ETC. This need 
a still body and then a still mind. First the mind will be=
come calm. Then eventually the mind will become quite. In a normal human mi=
nd there is a constant running commentary going on. That needs to be stoppe=
d eventually. When that is done, without or without a mantra, various kinds=
 of interesting experiences come to the seeker. But the problem with this m=
ethod is that, its gains are often limited to only the time frame when you =
are stilling and concentrating. Once you go back to teh world, your gains a=
re either lost or frittered away. It takes a really long time to get such a=
 one-off experience in focused concentration which is powerful enough to ch=
ange your surface personality even during other times. For most seekers, su=
ch a thing never happens. 

Contemplation is when you keep your focus on a =
mantra or a deity even with engaging in all kinds of activities. This is a =
process of knowing by becoming. If you keep contemplating constantly for da=
ys on end on one specific things, you will often gain some knowlege/underst=
anding about it by way of association. This is a very useful sadhana. Unlik=
e concentration, this can be and is ment to be done even while doing all ot=
her things. 

When you do both, that is focused concentration while keeping=
 the body still, and contemplation of Divine at all points even when engage=
d in other activities, then a dual effect accrues in your system which has =
a greater chance of changing your surface daily personality. For all sadhan=
a eventually must do just that.


**realization, the English word, is super=
 vague. In spirituality, if one does an objective reckoning of scriptures, =
paths, sadhanas, and experiences of various legendary sadhakas one will see=
 that there are vast multidimensional number and nature of great spiritual =
realizations. And they are not similar at all. It is a complex and interest=
ing study in itself. The proverbial reality is One, but it is so complex th=
at few, even among greats, have ever had a complete realization of all aspe=
cts of the One. 

-Regards

=C2=A0=
 
Dear Rakeshji and other learned members of the group,

I had one clarific=
ation on the point of being flexible with the rules. As per my understandin=
g from other emails in this group, one should always start with a rule and =
then gradually move over to complete surrender wherein there are no rules. =
A kid who wants to run a marathon needs to follow rules/discipline for prac=
ticing daily. Once he has developed a practice routine, it is ok even if he=
 doesnt follow rules. Similarly for this long journey towards realization.
=

But how does one identify the boundary at which you stop following a rule?=
 Many a times, I find keeping count of mantras slightly distracting and fee=
l that I should instead just sit and meditate for some time. May be more ti=
me some day and less time on other days.

Any advice or practical pointers =
in this regard will be very helpful.

Kind regards,
Vishal

Mantra is done like this : <br>
<br>
once while inhaling a=
nd once while exhaling.<br>
through continuous efforts a stage automaticall=
y comes when it gets embeded in our breathing system and then it runs with =
our rhythem.<br>
It all depends upon HIS grace, keep on putting efforts.<br=

But do not count mantra, it is only for initial stages when u count,<br>
=
 even while counting ur focus is on numbers which is bad<br>
it is the only=
  ceaseles pray , japa which is best.through practice it is possible and po=
ssible when one has deep love for God.<br>
Even mantra stops at advance sta=
ges as then soul itself travels further.<br>
<br>
Mantra=3Done which keeps =
mind here in present<br>
<br>
one can Meet HIM when one does not have any d=
esire and I have seen ur many mails and even this desire should not be ther=
e that when we will relise HIM<br>
<br>
USKE LIYE ITNI TADAP HO ki WO MAZBO=
OR HO JAYE AANE KE LIYE.<br>
<br>
See Hanuman ji , his body was immersed in=
 Ram nam, he never desired anything.<br>
<br>
These is no rule, those who f=
ollow rule , they have time to see rules but those who r immersed in HIS LO=
VE , they feel their body is just tool through which HE is working.their   =
I     dies.<br>
see Gopis in Love of Krishna<br>
<br>
It is HIS will, accep=
t in all circumstances, Surrender is the key, Be kid, new born baby, who do=
es not know anything except his mother,<br>
<br>
Did Shabri from Ramayan fo=
llowd any rules, rules apply for Sakam Bhakti, means there r desires, avod =
all this, no desire of even realising HIM,it will also bloch.ceasless pray,=
 and keep dhayan of HIM <br>
<br>
one should remeber HIM in Mahkhane or Pak=
hana, where is HE not present, who except HIM is presnt.<br>
<br>
Realised =
person see HIM everywheer and nothing else.becuse theer is no Duality<br>

<br>
U R DOCTOR, SEE ur patients as LORD , u r also LORD , LORD in form of =
 doctor , serving LORD patients.<br>
where r u, HE IS alone.Transform ur th=
ought process like this wheer thoughts will reduce to one just GOD.<br>
Tea=
ch ur mind this ,when  Mind understands , it starts helping.Donot seek rule=
s,<br>
Rule following people can never Realise HIM.What so ever way u can c=
onnect to HIM , do that way, <br>
He will guide u  through u only LISTEN to=
 HIM , inside u  <br>
<br>
Hope it helps<br>
