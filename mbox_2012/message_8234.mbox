Subject: Reciting part stotrams

Dear All,

1. Is it possible to recite some chosen verses from a stotram rather than the complete stotram?.

For example, I would like to recite the Subramanya Bhujanga stotram which has 33 verses. Is it OK if I choose about 15 verses from the 33 and then recite them on a daily basis?

Similarly can we customize other stotrams into fewer verses?

2. What are the rules for reciting Kavachams?

3. Should Stotrams and Kavachams be recited at a particular intonation or speed? Eg: MS Subbalakshmi has a certain intonation when she recites the Vishnu sahasra. She recites in 29.5 minutes, while I finish the same in 20 minutes.


I would appreciate any guidance on this.


Regards
Ram
