Dear all,

Does a spider have any special significance in Vedic wisdom? Is =
it symbolic of anything at all? I have had multiple curious happenings invo=
lving spiders - I have no particular love or fear of them. But the number o=
f incidences is out of the ordinary.. And for the ones with a funny bone, n=
o I dont have a house full of cobwebs :-)

In the book "Dreams, Symbols and=
 Homeopathy: Archetypal Dimensions of Healing" by Jane Cicchetti, there is =
a sentence "The ancient vedic philosophy of India suggests that a spider wo=
ve the veil of illusion that conceals the supreme reality". But there is no=
 reference to any vedic text.. I wonder if it is just hearsay..

Regards,
