Namaste Sathya,

> God is every where, he is antheryami, he is everywhere,
=

If God is everywhere, why should one seek an astrologer's help and go to
t=
emples.
One's Antheryami lens view says all places, life events and actions=
 are
Antheryami and leave results to Antheryami. Game over.

Before calling=
 astrologer foolish and greedy, could it be possible that
Antheryami in ast=
rologer or those old people, knowingly or unknowingly,
suggested Ganesh to =
go to one temple in the hope that he will put complete
faith in Antheryami =
at Navagraha temple.

If Ganesh insisted on visiting multiple temples, they=
 might have hoped his
memory holds the last place best and hence suggested =
to visit navagraha
temple at the end of trip.

I don't know much about thes=
e temple around Kumbakonam. It seems like there
is some value in spending f=
ew minutes listening to those aged people in
Coimbatore and understand thei=
r beliefs before dispelling them with broad
theories. What do you think?

R=
egards,
-Kishore
