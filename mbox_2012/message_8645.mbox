Namaste Vinayak,

[you are the one of the 4
> prominent people who have inf=
luenced & inspired me on spiritual path]

I am sure the 2nd important perso=
n is me :)
Jokes apart, let me share a little bit of my personal background=
 on Sudrashan Kriya and Homa as i have done both practices.

I learnt SK in=
 2005 and then almost daily kept doing it till 2008 mid. I also learnt adva=
nce course as well as Padmasadhana (PS) from AOL in 2006. I also regularly =
kept doing PS ALMOST everyday. For about 3 years, I used to do SK and PS re=
gularly. 

Now I got started with Homa on daily basis since 2008 Sept and k=
eep doing it till date (with few breaks/irregularities at times) and since =
then I have stopped SK, however sometime do PS as i enjoy that systematic Y=
ogaasanas.

Just gave above background which may help to assess.
***
SK and=
 PS helped me cure some physical chronic issues which troubled me since chi=
ldhood and were helpful to strengthen my will power. It generated an inner =
attitude to sustain any problems or calamities life may throw by making my =
mind generally calmer then it used to be. I am able to say that because I a=
ctually faced deep crises in 2006 July to sept and I was still more or less=
 unperturbed and could handle the situation. i increasingly become philosop=
hical in my attitude.

Now I started Chandi paath and Havan combination in =
2008. if i now sit back and look at things then i can see some striking dif=
ferences. Havan and CP combination striked at my emotional aspect. In the p=
ast, i was hardly tested on Emotional/Relational issues in general with soc=
iety. i hardly faced any trouble in that area. However, when I started Hava=
n and CP, it looks that it badly attacked this aspect of my being and I was=
 severely tested. in Short, My public relations which used to be always exc=
ellent (naturally) started falling apart. It shook me up very badly as it n=
ever happened in the past and I did not have enough experience, knowledge t=
o handle such things. severe EQ testing then surfaced other weaknesses whic=
h i felt that i never had :-). it amazed me at one side while at the same t=
ime It threw a formidable challenge to my so called **ballooned spiritual e=
go**. All these happening were more inside and much less tangible outside. =
There are crises i went through in my job which also tested me a lot. I los=
t a good some of money in a cheating case within 6 months of starting Havan=
. however, fortunately I intuitionally realised that Mother is removing bad=
 karmas using Pavaka and I steadfastly kept doing Havan in the midst of all=
 these emotional, financial, career, family troubles and now it seems as if=
 the dust have been settled more or less. quite peaceful with myself after =
seeing Stars in the bright Sunny day ;-)

***
So if now i compare it, the p=
eace of mind and will power given by SK and PS was a surface one. They neve=
r created a situation where in i was ruthlessly tested on my weaknesses. So=
 i would say that they are spiritual practices which worked quite slowly an=
d quite easily without disturbing me. While CP and Homam actually turned me=
 on my head. It started giving me a real kind of Detachment, wisdom. Few vi=
tal things have become much clearer now.
***
Please note that these are my =
personal experiences and others can have entirely different experiences. th=
ere are many variables in this. i just tried to state my own experiences fo=
r whatever worth they may be. Please also note that Havan Sadhana does not =
necessarily throw throubles in life of people. It all depends upon Past Sam=
skaars of individuals. we'll not know such things.
***
Please forgive me to=
 almost always write personal things because I like to write the things whi=
ch i have gone through myself.

Jay Bhavaani!

Utpal
