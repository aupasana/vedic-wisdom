Hello,
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0I have a Personal Temple/ Puja room in my hou=
se where everyday I try to do puja and prayers etc. with devotion offering =
naivadya and other things. I will write few things and it might help you.
H=
aving a puja room in a family life is a very auspicious thing but to mainta=
in it very difficult and can happen only with Grace of Divine Beings. Lot o=
f devotion and faith is required.
I should assume you are outside India. Ar=
e you going to use whole room as a puja room or use it for other purpose as=
 well.
=A0I have a soft hanging bell just inside the door which I ring as I=
 go in or out,for what ever the purpose. Every time I leave my house I firs=
t go and do pranam and then go out and when I come in I go there again.
I m=
yself never use words idols or statue to define the body of Divine Beings, =
be it metal or stone or wood or other substance. If there is a Murti of Sri=
Ganeshji it means for me that SriGaneshji is already there. For me a idol i=
s pranaless piece of metal or whatever.

In which corner of room you have y=
our Ishtdavs. The Northwest corner is very good as it brings heaven luck an=
d mentors luck. Although it not good for doing haven. It is such a good thi=
ng that you are devotee of SriDattatreya who is considered teachers=A0=A0te=
acher. East and Northeast are also good. If possible try to avoid Southwest=
.

Are They on a table? Is the space under the table empty? If so try to fi=
ll that as it will give solid base.

Everyday I give bath to SriGaneshji & =
SriShaligramji & others with plain water. Then I will drink that whole wate=
r and sprinkle on myself. I do not use kumkum and other things because then=
 I would be unable to drink it as it might have substance harmful to body. =
So I use almond oil based essential oils for tilak etc.

Everyday =A0I offe=
r fresh fruits and what ever is cooked in the home. I do not do any mudra o=
r any other thing. Divine Beings are very much alive for me and in fact I l=
ive with them and my mother as well. =A0I have experienced =A0a great deal =
of spiritual awakening and Darshan of Divine Beings =A0in my house due to m=
y puja room.

=A0When my mother was well she was cooking meals and things w=
ere normal. Later as she became ill and =A0I could not cook even a single n=
ormal Indian meal. After several months I said to my mother that Deities in=
 puja room look so thin. Even the Srishaligram felt like become small.

It =
is good to do bhajans and other mantra jap in puja room. It awakens them ve=
ry quickly.=A0
It is nice to have fresh flowers which somehow I am unable t=
o do at present.

All this might help.
Thanks

=A0 =

Respected NarasimhaJi and others,
=A0
We moved to a new place and i would =
like to know the formal procedures of establishing a ...all these years, wh=
enever i move to a new home, 
=A0
Purify the place
Arrange poojamandir taki=
ng few wooden shelves
Decorate them with Turmeric, kumkum and rice flour
Pu=
t god on the kovalam
Perform shodacaupacharapooja
offer naivedyam
=A0
I wan=
t to know a more detailed procedure to establish=A0idols in pooja room at=
=A0home.=A0I have=A0 ganapathi , lakshmi and dattatreya idols that i worshi=
p. What are the proper rules to follow to to bring them to pooja room, perf=
orm pranaprathishta etc. so that the energy gets in to them and i can perfo=
rm regular pooja daily. 
=A0
My second question is on performing Abhishekam=
 to idols. Is there a manual on this procedure?
=A0
I follow following step=
s for abhishekam in general for above three dieties:
=A0
shodasha upacharam=
 with sankalpam and praNa prathistha
During snanam i offer pancha amrutha's=
 
after every amrutha, i offer water
then offer turmiric, sandal wood and k=
umkum
then i perform kumkum archana with respective and specific mantras 
a=
nd then offer tambulam, naivedyam and mangaLa aarathi
Conclude with pradaks=
hina, desa kala sthuthi.
=A0
In temples, i see one more step, The decorate =
god with turmeric paste, kumkum and pour water. what is the significance an=
d after which step should this be performed?is it similar to offering kumku=
m and turmeric, if yest, why=A0=A0 should water be used to clean it?
=A0
if=
 it is ganapathi, i recite, chintamani mantram while performing abhishekam.=
 i also plan to recite ganapathi atharvana seersham.
if it is lakshmi, i re=
cite, sri suktham, and do mantra japam
if it is dattatreya, i recite datta =
ashtotram.
=A0
now, am i following correct procedure? or do i need to do an=
ything else. i am also looking for pranapratishthapan mantras for all above=
 three . All the books have super mini version of mantra but not detailed..=

=A0
Can someone give me pranaprathishthapana mantra's for above three so t=
hat i can chant them while setting up pooja room. Any other i need to recit=
e, pls let me know.
=A0
i also dont know mudra procedure.
=A0
for ex: when =
reciting mantras like, angushtabhyam nama, shikayayi vashat, etc..i dont kn=
ow how to do mudras.
=A0
so are mudras very important duirng abhishekam and=
 archana? if so can some one send me a guide or manual that details mudras.=

=A0
I thank you all for wonderful help.

Vasavi
