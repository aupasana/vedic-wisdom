Dear Narasimhaji,
=C2=A0
I have a query in this regard, generally I light t=
he lamps in the pooja altar in the evening after the pooja is over and afte=
r some time i extinguish the lamp by using the mantra santha swaroopinyai n=
amah , so that it does not keep glowing till the oil runs out and was told =
it is not good to burn the wick till the oil becomes empty..kindly guide
=
=C2=A0
Thanks & Regards
Kumar S R

=C2=A0 
Namaste,

I visited someone's pradosha pooja when I v=
isited Texas last week. The 
pooja was very nice and sincere and I loved it=
, but I noticed one bad 
practice and honestly told them what I thought. I =
want to share the same 
with all of you.

Showing deepam or lamp to the lor=
d is one of the upacharas (services) 
performed in the pooja after the abhi=
shekam (bathing). In some 
traditions, they show multiple lamp setups with =
multiple numbers of 
wicks, each setup with a specific mantra. While the ab=
hishekam and 
upacharas were going on, I was sitting with eyes closed and m=
editating 
with Gayatri mantra. After the showing of various lamps, I felt =

something negative and opened my eyes. I saw that one person was 
forcibly=
 extinguishing the fire in each wick with a rose petal.

God knows if the i=
dol or Shiva lingam used in a pooja has divine 
presence or not, but live m=
oving fire DOES have god in it. It is not at 
all a good idea to extinguish=
 fire forcibly. If keeping tens of wicks 
burning is not practical, put ver=
y little oil in each wick so that it 
lights for a small time only. If you =
can't wait, then don't light so 
many wicks. Just light 1-5 wicks and show =
them with all mantras. That is 
far better than showing a lamp with 21 wick=
s, another lamp with another 
number of wicks and so on and then forcibly e=
xtinguishing all the tens 
of wicks. Even if an auspicious material like ro=
se petal is used to 
press and extinguish, that does not make it acceptable=
.

Best regards,
Narasimha
