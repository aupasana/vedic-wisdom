Shri Narasimhaji,

Namaste!

Thank you for your quick replies! 

However, I=
 saw these replies only now, when I am at work. How I wish I had seen them =
in the morning today. With Prabhu Ramakrishna's jayanti tithi running, toda=
y is surely a blessed day for spiritual progress. Can the tarpana ritual be=
 performed in the evenings as well or does it have to be performed in the m=
ornings only? If yes, how late can it be performed? I normally return home =
by 10 in the night. So, if possible, I would like to perform the tarpana to=
night and then perform my evening prayers and then have food. 

One last cl=
arification, your last response to my query regarding black sesame seeds fo=
r Pitris; so, one should put sesame seeds in the water already containing a=
kshatas and give tarpana to Pitris with the water containing akshatas and s=
esame seeds? Is that the correct understanding?

Best regards,
Manish
