Dear Aparna,

There is a city with many tall skyscrapers. We are on the gro=
und (or,
perhaps underground). And our goal is to get onto the roof of one =
of
these very tall buildings, which is above the clouds. How do you get
to =
the top?

There are so many different tall buildings. Each of these is like=
 a
religion. You may be more familiar with some of them, and others might
l=
ook frightening. Inside, there are so many different sets of
elevators (pat=
hs of sadhana). Some of the elevators will go slow, and
some will go fast. =
Some will go all the way to the top, and some will
only go to specific floo=
rs.

Once we are inside the elevator, we might enjoy so many sensations,
li=
ke the acceleration and deceleration of the elevator. We might like
it so m=
uch that we forget about getting to the top, and simply go up
and down the =
elevator. The elevator may stop at so many floors. Each
floor is a tempatio=
n. From the elevator, we may see many sights and
hear many sounds. Again, w=
e might forget about our goal and get off
the elevator.

At the beginning, =
we have to be careful. We should stay on the
elevator all the way to the to=
p. Anything else takes us away from our
goal. But, at the end, we have to g=
et off the elevator. After all, the
goal is to get to the top of the buildi=
ng, and not to stay inside.
Perhaps we have to take some stairs and open so=
me doors to get out
onto the roof.

Perhaps you can think of each of these =
tall building like a religion.
Yes, they may appear to be an obstacle (afte=
r all, when you are inside
the building, and inside an elevator, the sky is=
 not at all visible).
But, the quickest and safest way to get to the roof i=
s to go inside,
and take an elevator to the top.

Some people may advise a =
more direct path, always keeping the goal in
sight. They may say that you s=
hould directly climb the outside of the
building. They may be technically c=
orrect, but this path is not for
everyone.

>From a practical point of view,=
 the answer is simple -- do sadhana and
more sadhana. Do it inside of your =
religious construct if it helps
you. Ignore the religious constructs when t=
hey become an obstacle.

There are so many mails on this list. Every mail s=
erves a purpose.
But, not all mails are applicable or useful to everyone. R=
ead and
re-read the mails that are useful, and ignore the ones that aren't.=
 At
the end of the day, you will learn much more from sadhana than you
will=
 from the mails on this list.

sasneham,

   ajit

sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said=

If God comes, all will run away. So please continue with your lectures as y=

ut, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, "He is a=
 sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,
>>  but he has probably lost=
 his mental balance due to smoking too much ganja". Now X, who was sitting =
there, for some weird reason felt attracted to that ragged man and went out=
 to see where the guy was going. As he approached the ragged looking man, t=
he man turned around and spoke to X in clear English, "Hello, I was waiting=
 for you to come and join me." X was of course taken aback, did not expect =
the man to speak in English and more over he had no clue how the man got to=
 know that he knew English (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron =
clothes).
>>
>>
>> The man continued, "My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born ne=
ar Chennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have=
 been a wondering sadhu since then." X asked him, why did you derive the sa=
dhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, "All this is bogus. Actu=
ally this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. N=
ot the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the =
reason for all the religious troubles and other nonsense." X felt a little =
irritated, "Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus et=
c? If you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven't met a singl=
e genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?". Mr Iyengar replied, "Well if I t=
ake Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as co=
nfused as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cann=
ot meet that man, he is not accessible to others." Mr Iyengar continued, "T=
he root of
>>  all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, =
that man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of t=
he human brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified m=
an or a magnified woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sa=
dhana, one day he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, an=
d he may even acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally =
be regarded by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why =
I say the root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a f=
inite mind and then stressing that one has understood correctly." While tal=
king, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in =
one pull finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for abo=
ut 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, =
"You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don't get=

n I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of =
youth. I was an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew =
up. But then one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roamin=
g for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact w=
ith this thing." As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, wom=
an and a young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr I=
yengar inturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so=
 when I come to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something =
interesting if you join me.

>> After an hour inside the house, X was =
feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits a=
nd sweets for their food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar's fe=
et as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is=
 one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessl=
y accepting the hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As s=
oon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and=
 the girl=C2  stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards the c=
ot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the =
opp direction to the cot. He too turned round to see what was going on. Wha=
t he saw made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged =
beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in=
 his early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a bril=
liant glow that lightened up the

 arms, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It look=
ed not a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even f=
ive minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.
>>
>>
>> X did not=
 know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stan=
d up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto=
 the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When =
he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with trees an=
d shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him =
inside the temple precincts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it a=
n old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyen=
gar did not say a word, pointed out that meditating man to him and then too=
k X out of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. You sh=
ould meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has a=
n idea what God really means. After providing directions of how to reach th=
at desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he wa=

>> In general, m=
any of those who don't believe in religion or God are being more honest tha=
n those who do. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a =
limited being to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most ap=
parent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to for=
malize these biases.
>>
>> While being mired in this word of duality, we th=
ink that an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weight of "paapa" =
that we engage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No w=
onder that others look at all the suffering in the world and laugh at this =
concept of God. We "God believers" are the culprit.
>>
>> We all have plent=
y of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the stre=
ngth to be steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn=
 "paapa" and leave the "punya" intact. It is us "God believers" who look at=
 our lives, ignoring all the "paapa phala". We look at one or two instances=
 of "punya phala" and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an imp=
artial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers=
" are the culprit.
>>
>> For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are=
 engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we co=
unt the seconds and minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti i=
s strong, and time really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak =
spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observe=
r sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We "God believers" are the culp=
rit.
>>
>> The best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look a=
t the "non-believers" and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to =
eliminate our lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can trans=
form ourselves, the world will be served.
>>
>> If we see God as the limitl=
ess power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture=
 him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and=
 should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach=
 the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them with=
out question. They ask us to place our heads on them with reverence, and tr=
y to prevent the spiritually advanced from going any farther.
