Dear Narasimha,

When the main devata is established in a kalasha, it is us=
ually placed
on a bed of rice.  For example, your satyanarayana puja manual=
 says
"place the kalasha on some grains of rice".

Often, a large amount of=
 rice grains is used. During the puja process,
bits of flowers and various =
other odds and ends end up getting strewn
on top of the rice. After the puj=
a ends, all of this is mostly
unceremoniously discarded.

It there a symbol=
ic spiritual reason behind placing rice under the
kalasha? Or it is just a =
practical reason --  kalashas usually have a
rounded bottom, and the floor =
is not always flat. Placing it on a bed
of rice grains gives the kalasha so=
me stability.

sasneham,

=A0 =A0ajit
