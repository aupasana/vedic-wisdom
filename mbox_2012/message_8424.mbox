=C2=A0
Your guru is wise. The simple sounding statement "How will you lo=
ve something that you have no idea about" is actually quite deep and profou=
nd.
=C2=A0
True love for "God" comes only when one has made a lot of progre=
ss and erased most of one's conditioning. Selfish/immature love conditioned=
 by one's likes and wants may initially be mistakened for "love of god".
=
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
God is beyond describing and knowing. God is=
 beyond all qualities that our mind can imagine. Yet, we imagine God with s=
ome qualities, based on our conditioning. The love we can manage for God is=
 also *conditioned* by our experiences and expectations.
=C2=A0
One may lov=
e god as the giver of things one likes (e.g. good health, good wife, good c=
hildren, good career, good name etc). Such love may be conditioned by one's=
 likes.
=C2=A0
One may love god as one capable of doing X or Y or Z. Such l=
ove may be conditioned by one's fascination for those capabilities.
=C2=A0
=
One may love god as one knowing X or Y or Z. Such love may be conditioned b=
y one's fascination for knowing things.
=C2=A0
And so on.
=C2=A0
One limite=
d by duality is conditioned to like some things and dislike some things. On=
e projects one's likes to God as one "works on" loving God. The "God" in on=
e's mind that one "loves" is a reservoir of the qualities and abilities tha=
t one is conditioned to like! As one's conditioning evolves, so will one's =
understanding of god and one's love for god..
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
=
Though we cannot see God, we can see God through God's creation that surrou=
nds us. Love of god and god's creation is blocked by our self-centered ego =
and conditioning. We spend all our mental energy thinking about the good of=
 what we see as "I" and its belongings (body, image, spouse, children, fami=
ly etc). Going beyond those limited notions and loving the world (or even G=
od) is not easy.
=C2=A0
We can first tolerate, then empathize with and then=
 love, those around us whose personalities and agendas are not compatible w=
ith us.
=C2=A0
*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
Whether one is sitting still for hours=
 or serving humankind or doing bhajans of god's name or reading Vedanta and=
 contemplating "who am I", whatever one's path is, the sign of progress is =
*reduced/lightened conditioning*.
=C2=A0
It is the conditioning that blocks=
 one from sitting still for hours (love of bodily comfort and fear of death=
 or physical discomfort) or serving others well (good of oneself comes more=
 naturally than good of others and others are seen as less important), etc,=
 
=C2=A0
As conditioning lightens and one's ego reduces, one can walk one's=
 path better - one can sit still longer and with better focus or serve othe=
rs better and with more love or do bhajans of god's name with more devotion=
/surrender or contemplate better and more fruitfully.

Amazing messages all throughout.Many Ma=
ny thanks to you for providing that hard knock....If I may just add one sma=
ll message ( not that I have realized anything or that am doing any sadhana=
 properly ) . 

Just adding it in the hope it might help others....for ofte=
n many are asking sincerely " How to love God ".... Based purely on what my=
 Guru told me 

" How will you love something that you have no idea about "=
..Also 

"It is very easy to imagine loving somebody sitting way up in heav=
en with whom you have no interaction "...It is much harder to love your nei=
ghbour.... 

" Forget about Divinity and its myriad theories...One can aspi=
re to it when one is atleast human ".. 

Narasimha Ji has always said...the=
 true measure of progress is when one is starting to get a little less angr=
y,little more compassionate...little more intense and little more exuberant=
... 

It is not about the 20 mins of Homa...or your respective Kriyas/Medit=
ations/Affirmations/Stotras...Defintely do that atleast but what matters mo=
st is how do you conduct rest of your day ? 

Loving god will only come whe=
n you truly start loving the people around you....That is the true test sin=
ce now you have some skin in the game...all else is delusion... 

For eg: J=
esus never said to Love god ...He always said "Love Thy Neighbour" for :) i=
t is the true test.....it is easy to love dead people ...so hard to love a =
living person sitting right beside us. 

One hating so many people ( one's =
bosses...ones relatives...various acquaintances) ...even if he imagines he =
is loving God...it is but a delusion. 

Anywaz Chota mooh badi baat...just =
wanted to say that out.... 

Many Pranams
