LaxmiNarayan Ji

The reason behind not sharing the experience was because o=
f an explicit advise given by Shri Vimalananda in his books and also becaus=
e I might not find the words to describe it.

Aghora Book 2 Kundalini Page =
44 

"Remember that fire's basic quality is to burn.Did you know that the f=
ire which is in the tongue burns whatever it speaks.What this means to you =
is that you should always confess any bad karmas that you perform.This will=
 free you from them;they will be burned up.And you should never speak about=
 any good deeds you do or about your spiritual experiences,because if you d=
o they will be destroyed surely.

Unfortunately this is Kali yuga and most =
people do exactly the opposite.They hide their sins deep down in their hear=
ts where they can't be cleaned out and they boast to everyone in sight abou=
t their spiritual achievements."

I have practically seen this with my own =
Guru. In his actions and teaching he oozes and completely melts in devotion=
 for his ParamaGuru...But even in front of a gathering of people he often s=
ays " Unless the situation is right ...the name of the Paramaguru will not =
be even uttered" because for him it is so sacred...the highest of the highe=
st .



I have no other way of putting it in words....am not qualified to e=
xplain this.I do understand listening to experiences can motivate people an=
d it is not my intention to not share...However I cannot find the words to =
describe something so sacred and Shri Vimalananda's advice is so clear.
