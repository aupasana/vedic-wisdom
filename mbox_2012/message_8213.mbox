Hare krishna,
The Gopikas are none but the very expansion of Radha Herself.=
..Radha being the Anandamayi Shakti of Krishna...and the other more enigmat=
ic One Chandravali who is the personification of Ichha Shakti...both are th=
e prime among the expansions of Shakti...with Radha being purna Hladini and=
 exhibiting all the esoteric rasas of Love...
What Biswasji has come across=
 is indeed a beautiful article by Pattanaik ji which i have read too in toi=
 article...which perhaps he has expanded on the prevalent Krishna lores of =
Bengal in which Krishna takes the form of Kali...to save Radha from the ire=
 of Her husband and in-laws...
Devdutta pattanaik ji has given a deep spiri=
tual insight upon this  incident...and beautifully inferred upon it...
He m=
ay have seen it with Love and thus it gave him the freedom the way he wante=
d to interpret it...and came up with such a thoughtful piece which brings u=
s more nearer to the Divine...
