Dear Rajarshi,

>>>Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his philosoph=
y<<<

actually "rejecting" may not be the right word you probably mistakenl=
y used. It could be that it does not attract you that much incomparision to=
 the other one and/or as in case of Aurobindo's philosophy which did not ma=
ke sense earlier and which now makes a lot of sense. same way, it is possib=
le for Adi Shankara's adwait.

It may require a LOT to reject philosophy of=
 giant such as adi Shankara and yet some one may not be able to reject afte=
rall. That is MHO.

Best Regards,

Utpal

Universe. The physical, the astral or subtle layer, and the causal (karana =

s own prana-shakti through the aid of repeated rituals and procedures and m=
antras etc. If you think carefully, you will realize that every idol, ever =
homa agni needs a pranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sadhaka us=
ed the force of his/her own

mation of the deity. Once this process is successfully done, this sublte fo=
rmation of the deity which exists in the subtle plane, has a life of its ow=
n. It can then guide the sadhaka through the path and eventually, one day l=
ead him/her to the real abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyon=
d this astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakt=
i, and make it identify/create such an astral formation of the deity, it be=
comes an even more powerful force. It is, from our limited human perspectiv=
e, as much a powerful entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not the act=

 in the Aghora books, if you read carefully.=C2=A0

 been able to associate with such an astral formation of the deity, it can =
guide the sadhaka along the path provided the sadhaka also is trying to wor=

of existence where the real force of the Deity originates). The difference,=
 if you ask, between this astral formation of the deity and the real deity =
is that, the former is neither bound nor capable by itself of causing a com=
plete and total transformation of the average human nature without a proact=
ive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one reaches the plane of the Great God=
s, which is where the real deity exists, one cannot avoid being transformed=
 in mind, emotions, body etc. And what kind of a transformation will it be?=
 One that will reflect to the world as a greater and genuine humility, sens=
e of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL time and unfailingly, a complete w=
ithdrawal of lower nature of man - lust, anger,
>  jealousy, greed, covetou=
sness - an abiding peace, calm, detachment, mental-illumination, genuine co=
mpassion, a widening of the consciousness. Such an individual, even if he/s=
he just sits down next to another person, will exude a silent strong peace =
and unselfish love which will automatically calm the minds and disturbed em=
otions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the authentic, unhindered flow of the=
 Divine Power of any of the great deities. This comes even if one deity is =
properly realized in the causal planes of existence. But the astral formati=
on of the same deity, which is created by the force of our own pranashakti =
or Kundalini as the case maybe, is often not capable of affecting this kind=
 of a total transformation in a sadhaka. That is why it is limited. It is n=

 (all that is universally accepted as spiritual qualities). For unless thes=

hinking. First question I asked myself was, what is the aim of spirituality=
? My mind could grasp some outlines of certain answers and processes and tr=
uths. But it was still not exceptionally clear.
>

urobindo when I was in college. I could not go beyond the first two pages. =
They were bouncers going one mile over my head. Three years ago someone gav=

ge, which told me that I should start reading Sri Aurobindo but in a very s=
pecific manner. The image was very clear in my inner-eye, and thoroughly pr=
essing on my consciousness. I opened his book again, and read it in the pre=
scribed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense to me. What I was strug=
gling to understand all this year, whose outline I could grasp yet not get =
a proper hang of, I was able to understand
>  from his writings with much d=
eeper clarity.=C2=A0 Many of my own experiences made more sense to me. Many=
 sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a new light. I read 40 -=
 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me to stop at a certain po=
int of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 % I will have to firs=
t make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational mind will distort th=
e information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected firmly 3 years ago, now=
 came back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing sun. 
> 
> The line th=
at you mention, is from one of the earlier writings of Sri Aurobindo on the=
 historical problem of the Mahabharta. In the Mahabharata, there is an inci=
dent which comes later on, after the great war and when Yudhisthira was rul=
ing the kingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sri Krishna to repeat the words h=
e had spoken at the beginning of the war (The Gita) once more since he has =
forgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, the time has passed away (it was a sp=
ecial time when the Gita was spoken), he cannot repeat the "exact words" on=
ce again. 
> 
> Sri Krishna was the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even Swami Vive=
kananda was one of his Gurus, for during the time when Sri Aurobindo was in=
 jail, for 15 days Swami Vivekananda would appear before him daily and inst=
ruct him on the various layers of the mind, which he was not aware of till =
then. Swami Vivekananda had already left his physical body by then. It was =
in the writings of Sri Aurobindo that he mentioned about the left and right=
 hemisphere of the brain and their difference in functionality, and their c=
onnection to spirituality, about 30 years before medical science confirmed =
the same. 
> 
> Right from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondicherry,=
 to pushing his own spiritual experiences further into states of Sahaja (wh=
ich he describes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided continuo=
usly by the Adesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voice of Kri=
shna speaking to him, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna was hi=
s Guru, the Divine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destination. An=
yway, my point is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo's perspective of spirit=
uality. I have benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone else will=
 also benefit. There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, each with=
 their unique perspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must individual=
ly try and find whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotional make=
up, and help us to progress on the path. 
> 
> Though I now have a very dee=
p respect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both his criti=
cs and his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstood =
the depth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a function =
of their own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any genui=

tood accurately or even slightly without sincere sadhana.
