Hello,
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0Sometimes when we are young and innocent and =
take up spiritual=A0practice=A0 with devotion then these things can happen.=
 But it is not always the case. It seems that your chanting of these mantra=
 is like rubbing dry sticks and so the heat is coming out.

Do you drink wa=
ter before you start chanting each mala and end of it. =A0If not then you s=
hould do it. I myself everyday do different mantra and stotra in one sittin=
g and I keep a glass of water and drink at the start and at the end.Althoug=
h I no longer do a formal aachman but I still do not touch glass from my mo=
uth.

You should drink half a cup of yogurt afterward if you still feel the=
 heat. It will have a cooling effect on the body.
But you should not take y=
ogurt after sunset.

Where is heat starting? Is it stomach or chest or back=
 of neck ? If it is still there after doing above 2 things then you should =
rub it down so that excess heat leaves the body. through the palms of hands=
 and soles of feet. Start where you think. it is too much and with gentle b=
ut firm circular motion go towards the arms and legs and make the sound who=
osh and shake it out of hands and feet. You can also wash your eyes with co=
ld water.

If you can do it easily and if you want then you can do the firs=
t 3 mantra in the morning and the other 2 later on.
Then their energy will =
not clash in your body. It is my personal experience that sometimes in my r=
outine if it becomes very difficult or heavy to recite certain mantra and i=
f I change certain order it becomes much easier.

I hope all these things w=
ill help.
Thanks
LaxmiNarayan

ataye namah
shiva panchakshar mantra- namah shivay yavashi manah
shree mant=
ra- hoom jhoom sah sah jhoom hoom
11 chants- mahamrityunjay mantra (with sa=
mput of shree mantra)
