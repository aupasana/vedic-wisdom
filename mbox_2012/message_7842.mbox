Namaste friends,

This is an age of growing populations and food shortages. A lot of 
people are starving without food to eat. As those who can afford food 
waste the limited food that is available, that jacks up food prices and 
makes it even more inaccessible to starving people. This is already a 
serious problem according to scientists and I am afraid will get much 
worse in coming decades.

Given this, wasting food is a really really really terrible sin in 
today's times. Please don't waste food. This includes:

(1) Cooking more food than you need and throwing it away,
(2) Serving more food than you can eat in your plate and throwing it 
away
(3) Buying more vegetables/fruits than you need and letting them get 
spoiled

Please treat Mother Annapurna (personification of food that sustains us) 
with respect, love and humility (rather than arrogance, contempt and 
pride). World (and we) needs her blessings and kindness.

*        *        *

On a similar note, some ladies do rituals where chick peas soaked in 
water, fruits etc, sweets etc are distributed to other ladies. I have 
seen so many ladies casually get these food items, let them rot and then 
throw them away. The notion that giving food to people is good karma is 
based on the assumption that they actually eat it or use otherwise. If 
they waste it, it is bad karma for both parties.

Please do not accept any food that you cannot use. Also, don't 
distribute food to people who do not need it. Instead, feed homeless, 
needy people. Doing rituals with no common sense and just for the heck 
of it, is not good. Such rituals produce no results whatsoever. Blindly 
adhering to traditions that are doing no good really, is like dressing a 
corpse in beautiful clothes and jewellery. Use common sense and do 
*real* good to others and the world, than engaging in fake *symbols* 
that in reality harm the world.

Sorry for the strong language, but I do see many people abusing Mother 
Annapoorna and I think this is terrible for the world. This needs to 
change.

Best regards,
Narasimha
