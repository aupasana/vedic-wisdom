Shri Narasimhaji,

Namaste!

Is the main deity of Sri Suktam, Lakshmiji, th=
e wife of Shri Vishnu or is it MahaLakshmi, the wife of MahaVishnu or is it=
 Mahalakshmi Triguna, The Divine Mother/Goddess? 

Also, what is the differ=
ence between Vishnu and MahaVishnu as in some places one reads about Vishnu=
 while in others one reads about MahaVishnu?

Thanks and best regards,
Mani=
