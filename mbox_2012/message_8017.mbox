Nice practical question!
=C2=A0
Eventually, all agendas have=
 to go, for one to be liberated. But, it is good to hang on to some saattwi=
k agendas till the endgame.
=C2=A0
However, as long as there is some agenda=
 (sattwik or raajasik or taamasik), there WILL be some kind of friction wit=
h other people. The issue is how one handles the friction while pursuing on=
e's own agenda. How one handles friction decides whether friction increases=
 or decreases.
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
I'll go back to something I m=
entioned before. There is an external world (macrocosm) and there is an int=
ernal world (microcosm). They resonate with each other and influence each o=
ther.
=C2=A0
The external world consists of real people with their own mind=
s, conditioning and agendas. The internal world consists of our mental mode=
ls of those people. As a matter of fact, though we think that we are dealin=
g with the external world, there is very little that we know about it. The =
world we mostly live in is the internal world. I'll elaborate.
=C2=A0
Our s=
enses capture *some* aspects of the objective reality of the external world=
. But that is a very small part of the reality. For example, one's ears may=
 hear another person saying something. One's eyes may see another person ha=
ving a particular facial expression. And so on. Like connecting dots to mak=
e a nice picture, we *interpret* these sensory inputs based on the conditio=
ning in our chitta! Thus, one forms a mental image of what the other person=
s are thinking and feeling, what their attitudes and priorities are, etc. O=
ur internal world is filled with such models of many many people. We essent=
ially live in that internal world!
=C2=A0
The interface between the externa=
l and internal worlds is very minimal. External world influences the intern=
al world through inputs from one's jnanendriyas (senses of perception). Int=
ernal world influences the external world through actions/outputs of one's =
karmendriyas (organs of action). The resonance I mentioned works through th=
is thin interface. Changes happening in the internal world eventually refle=
ct on the external world, and vice versa.
=C2=A0
We like, dislike, get frus=
trated by, resist and admire the characters in the internal world. Our atti=
tudes towards these characters in the internal world reflect in our externa=
l actions, which get noticed by the corresponding characters in the externa=
l world.

The key to controlling the external=
 world is in controlling the internal world. The key to controlling the int=
ernal world is in recognizing the paramount role of one's own conditioning =
in *moulding* the internal world. In the end, it all boils down to self-con=
trol and overcoming one's conditioning.

=C2=A0
Let us=
 get back to the specific example mentioned below. Suppose I want to do hom=
am regularly and my room mate may not like it. From the words uttered by my=
 room mate (as heard by my ears) and the facial expressions shown (as seen =
by my eyes), possibly on several occasions, I can come to a limited objecti=
ve understanding of his attitude and thinking. I may know that he is not pl=
eased. Forming a more complete picture of what he thinks, wants and why, is=
 akin to connecting dots to make a nice picture. One can paint a whole rang=
e of possible pictures within what one knows objectively. But, one's condit=
ioning pushes one to pick a few possibilities out of those. We do that all =
the time without being conscious of it.
=C2=A0
Suppose I am conditioned to =
be proud of the religious work I do and to think that some evil forces may =
stop me in my good work. The desire to do homam itself is not a problem, bu=
t this undesirable conditioning can be a problem. When someone shows disple=
asure at my doing homam in the room, my conditioning may push some wrong bu=
ttons in me (!) and trigger resentment. A negative character with a lot of =
friction with me is propped up in my internal world! My thoughts, words and=
 actions will project (physically and also subtly) that character and its f=
riction with me, onto the external world through resonance. The other perso=
n may become even more negative than before, as a result of resonance with =
my internal world. As both parties act as slaves of their conditioning and =
act without self-control, things can snowball and there can be an environme=
nt of great resentment and friction.
=C2=A0
This is kind of like moviemaker=
s depicting violence and gore excessively, saying that they are only reflec=
ting what is happening in society, while society being influenced by movies=
 and engaging in even more violence and then moviemakers pushing the envelo=
pe further, and so on.
=C2=A0
Suppose I am devoid of much negative conditio=
ning and all I want is to do homam if possible. When someone shows displeas=
ure, that will then not press any wrong buttons in me and trigger any resen=
tment. I will note the fact that they have some displeasure. Because my vis=
ion is not clouded with conditioning (to be proud of my work and look at pe=
ople creating obstacles as evil people), I may be able to understand their =
perspective better. On the balance, I may still choose to go ahead and do h=
omam, but without much resentment in my mind. The character propped up in m=
y mind may not be a very negative one and not have much friction with me. I=
 may love this character from my internal world, feel compassionate about i=
t, understand its motivations and yet do my homam. Then my thoughts, words =
and actions will project (physically and also subtly) that nice character a=
nd my love for it, onto the external world through resonance. Even if the o=
ther person is more
 negative than I realized, influence of (resonance with=
) my internal world will eventually change him for better. (It will atleast=
 not make him worse!!)

=C2=A0
I am not talking about =
being stupid here or cheating oneself. If someone says "I don't like your a=
ctions", I am not saying that one should think "he loves me and he is sayin=
g I am great". What I am suggesting is to stick to objective facts (as perc=
eived by sensory mind) and create as positive a picture from the objective =
facts as possible. Of course, one's conditioning (i.e. the momentum from al=
l previous experiences and karmik debts) makes it difficult. If one's condi=
tioning pushes one to create as negative a picture from the objective facts=
 as possible about someone, resisting that push and forming as positive a p=
icture from the objective facts as possible is not easy.

=C2=A0
One word on suprressing feelings and forcing nice behavior may=
 be appropriate here.
=C2=A0
Suppose one's wife says harsh things to one an=
d fights. Suppose one resents it and thinks "I am being so nice and accommo=
dating. Why is she so mean to me". If one suppresses that feeling and force=
s nice behavior, that is good only temporarily. The character of wife in on=
e's inner world is still a negative one. One's thoughts about that characte=
r are still "I am being so nice and accommodating. Why is she so mean to me=
". The suppressed resentment will blow off oneday and result in a bigger fi=
ght/argument.
=C2=A0
If one really wants improvement, then the character of=
 wife in one's inner world needs to be transformed. One can try to put ones=
elf in the shoes of wife and try to figure out the picture is from her side=
. Most people in this world are not 100% terrible. They are an amalgam of g=
ood and bad. Perhaps one's wife actually loves one and one's words conveyed=
 to her that he is not happy and her sub-conscious disappointment at not be=
ing to make husband happy showed up externally as an outburst. So many such=
 possibilities exist. People's external actions don't always reflect the de=
epest motivations. Attachments make people act strangely. Some people who f=
eel a deep attachment to us may act harsh with us.
=C2=A0
If one can put on=
eself in the shoes of wife and come up with a more compassionate explanatio=
n of her behavior and attribute as positive motivations to her behavior as =
possible, then one's notions about the character of wife in the inner world=
 will improve. Then one may be able to behave nicely without suppressing an=
y feelings! This is more sustainable in the long-term. As the character of =
wife in the inner world becomes nicer and nicer, it will reflect in one's e=
xternal behavior with the corresponding person in the external world. This =
will eventually impact the thinking of wife (in external world) and reflect=
 in her behavior with one.
=C2=A0
Through one's actions and the other perso=
n's actions, slowly the discrepancies between a character in one's inner wo=
rld and one's outer world come down and the two characters come close to ea=
ch other. So you transform the outer world character by transforming the in=
ner world character. This is really the only way you can control the extern=
al world on a sustainable basis.

=C2=A0
If you think=
 carefully, you will see that all qualities of characters in our inner worl=
d are partly dependent on objective sensory observations (of the correspond=
ing characters in the external world) and partly dependent on our subjectiv=
e conditioning. The latter is by no means trivial. In fact, it is often the=
 larger factor.

=C2=A0
I said that the interaction b=
etween external and internal worlds is through jnanendriyas and karmendriya=
s. One may assume that these are physical organs (e.g. physical eyes, physi=
cal ears etc). That's not true. For example, the karmendriya of speech not =
only covers vaikhari (physical speech), but subtler forms of speech (para, =
pasyanti, madhyama). Similarly, the jnanendriya of hearing not only covers =
hearing vaikhari speech, but those subtler forms too. Same with vision etc.=

=C2=A0
If I am looking at someone with great admiration or great resentmen=
t, the subtle sabda generated by my thoughts is accessible to subtle hearin=
g of that person. That becomes an interface between my internal and externa=
l worlds. My admiration or resentment for a character in my inner world aff=
ects the 'sabda' produced by me (by subtle thoughts and imagery in the mind=
, as well as physical speech) and that sabda in time reaches (and may affec=
t the inner world of) the corresponding character in the external world.

=
=C2=A0 Namaste friends, 

I recently finished a specific sadhana of a speci=
fic form of Divine 
Mother. This particular goddess, according to my guru, =
attracts others 
to a sadhaka and gives "control and mastery" over others. =


I want to share what I realized towards the end of sadhana, because that =

realization MAY be helpful to some others. 

*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * 

DIFEERENT T=
RAJECTORIES 

There are beings that can give specific limited things, but t=
he ultimate 
goal of sadhana is liberation and sadhana of higher beings eve=
ntually 
transforms one and takes one closer to liberation. What these high=
er 
beings are supposed to give in tradition is a simplificaation or 
symbo=
lism of something sublime that takes towards liberation, from 
*different a=
ngles*. 

For example, ability to work very hard (with no expectations of a=
nything 
selfish in return), fine judgment and discrimination (that increas=
es 
detachment in one's actions), complete surrender to god (and 
whole-hea=
rted acceptance of every life situation one finds oneself in), 
ability to =
focus mind (on a mantra or a deity and not let various 
thoughts distract i=
t), are all useful to a sadhaka. If one develops one 
of these 4 basic qual=
ities, other qualities will eventually develop. 
They all lead to the same =
thing - liberation - in the end, but the 
trajectory is different. 

These =
four basic paths constitute what are known as karma yoga 
(communion throug=
h action), jnana yoga (communion through wisdom), 
bhakti yoga (communion t=
hrough devotion) and raja yoga (communion 
through [self-]control). However=
, there are many sub-paths. 

Basically, different higher beings can increa=
se a different fine quality 
inside one, which is conducive to liberation. =
The trajectory is 
different with each deity.

TOO MUND=
ANE? 

The higher being I worshipped is supposed to increase control and 
m=
astery over others. While I did the sadhana in the last few months, I 
wond=
ered how *that* can lead to liberation. After all, control and 
mastery ove=
r others sounded too *mundane* to me to have anything to do 
with liberatio=
n. But a simple realization came towards the end of the 
sadhana. 

*=C2=A0=

CONTROL & FRICTION 

Whether A is attracted to B or B is attract=
ed to A, the bottomline is 
that objects A and B come together. The ability=
 to attract others also 
means to come together with them. 

One is unhappy=
 with others and thinks of controlling them, when one's 
own agenda is mis-=
aligned with their agenda. The friction between the 
agendas is the basis f=
or the entire dynamics of likes, dislikes, 
frustrations etc. Control of th=
at friction comes when the agendas are 
nicely aligned! 

Ability to contro=
l the agenda pursued by someone else has limited use, 
scope and lifetime. =
Such an ability can work only with a limited set of 
people or a limited am=
ount of time. This is like pumping rainwater from 
the fields surrounding a=
 hill to the top of the hill. It requires a lot 
of energy that is proporti=
onal to the area of the field and the amount 
of rainwater. 

The best way =
to avoid the friction, with ALL beings of the cosmos, is to 
eliminate one'=
s own agenda! This is like removing the hill from the 
middle of the field,=
 in the above analogy. 

If one has no agenda whatsoever, then there is no =
friction with anyone's 
agenda. There is no reason to like or dislike anyon=
e or find fault with 
or admire anyone. One can just observe others. Becaus=
e one has no 
agenda, one can identify with the agendas of others and relat=
e to them 
completely. One can then put oneself completely in the shoes of =
others 
and feel their pleasures, pains etc. 

When one has an agenda and a=
nother has another agenda, then there is 
friction and one feels a need to =
"control" and remove friction. But, 
when one has no agenda and another has=
 an agenda, then there is no 
friction. One can then completely "understand=
" the perspective of the 
other (because there is no friction from one's ow=
n agenda stopping one 
from doing so!). What better mastery and control can=
 one have on someone 
else than be able to understand that person completel=
y?! 

Though what I described above is the end, one path to that end is to =

identify one's own agenda/conditioning that is resulting in friction, 
whe=
never one is not happy with someone, and try to remove/suppress that 
condi=
tioning. One can first try this with a few people (e.g. spouse).

LOVE & COMPASSION FOR ALL 

Bottomline is this: Control and mast=
ery over others does not mean making 
them think and behave in tune with th=
e agenda of one's own limited 
conditioning. Instead, it means overcoming's=
 one's own agendas and being 
able to put oneself in the shoes of anybody a=
nd understand and feel each 
of their feelings and emotions. It means uncon=
ditional love and 
compassion for all.

LOOKING DOWN ON O=
THERS 

When one is doing some sadhana, one of the stages one goes through =
may 
be to feel proud of one's sadhana, look at some others doing such a 
s=
adhana favorably or with admiration and look down on others who are not 
do=
ing much sadhana (or doing a different sadhana!) and pursuing mundane 
thin=
gs. This may be a natural tendency, but realize that this is a work 
of the=
 limited personality or ego. 

One has to overcome that tendency, for looki=
ng down on others will 
eventually block one.

People talk of loving the Divine Mother. The personality=
 of Divine 
Mother is beyond one's perception. How can one really love Her =
then? 

One may do tremendous sadhana and get tremendous visions and think =
that 
one has grasped the personality of Divine Mother, but what one percei=
ves 
is merely what one's conditioning fancies and is capable of grasping! =

The complete personality of Divine Mother is beyond anybody's 
perception.=
 

However, Divine Mother does manifest in a perceptible way as the cosmos.=
 
Every being in the cosmos is a limited manifestation of Her. Being able 
=
to love every being is the FIRST step in truly loving the Divine Mother. 

=
Loving someone because they are doing some good work (as we see it!) or 
be=
cause they have something we need (as we see it!) etc, is *egoistic* 
lovin=
g. Such love is *conditioned* by the agendas of a limited ego. Such 
love c=
annot extend to entire cosmos and permanently. The only love that 
can exte=
nd to entire cosmos and be permanent is unconditional love of 
all beings. =


That comes only when one has no agenda and no expectations from anyone.
