The `GOD Particle' is media term not the scientific term. The
term "GOD Pa=
rticle got coined from book The God Particle: If the
Universe Is the Answer=
, What is the Question? is a 1993 popular science
<http://en.wikipedia.org/=
wiki/Popular_science>  book by Nobel Prize
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No=
bel_Prize> -winning physicist
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist>  Leo=
n M. Lederman
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_M._Lederman>  and science =
writer Dick
Teresi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Teresi> .

Which Leon=
 Lederman had orginally titled The Goddamn Particle: If the
Universe Is the=
 Answer, What is the Question ? because the particle was
difficult to find =
or see.

But his editor renamed it to "The God Particle".  Editor new his
j=
ob well, otherwise we won't have been taking about in this group.

How the =
'God particle' got its name

Because practical evidence of this elementary part=

so difficult to come-by (it already existed was a

mathematical=

 Some people are falsely thinking that science and religion are about
to co=
