Namaste - You already sent this mail once, probably no responses, so let me=
 try to answer.

The best day to start the homam (or whatever sadhana) was =
yesterday. If you missed it, today was the next best. If you missed that to=
o, tomorrow is the chance you should not miss :-)

Homam will make the day =
auspicious which ever that is, so start tomorrow.

Also, in the beginning, =
start with daily even if it is means less time and in the weekends do for m=
ore time.

regards
rAma

 ParamAtman's Grace, I have decided to start a homam. In the beginning, I i=
ntend to do it every Saturday. I will start with the MahaGanapathy homam, a=
nd then let MahaGanapathy guide me along the path, as you have said many ti=
mes. Shrimaan, I was thinking of starting from the beginning of the New Yea=
r in Chaitra Masa, which happens on March 23rd this year. The very auspicio=
us Vasant/Chaitra Navaratri also starts the same day. I was thinking of sta=
rting from either Chaitra Pratipada - March 23rd, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvi=
tiya -March 24th, Shanivara. Do you reckon this to be a good time to start =
the homam? and which is a better day - Chaitra Pratipada, Shukravara or Cha=
itra Dvitiya, Shanivara?
