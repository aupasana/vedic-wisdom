Dear Lakshmi Narayan ji,

I am doing fine. I hope your health is fine too.
=

I will answer the points you have raised in your mail below, to the best o=
f my ability. 


<<

So is there a place for Divine Mother and Her Love or =
Grace or Protection in your theory. Is=C2=A0this intermediate zone as you s=
ay is created by Her 
and part of Her creation=C2=A0or by=C2=A0somebody els=
e. >>

There is no other somebody else in the Universe apart from Her. Even=
 the worst Asura is also Her creation to sustain this world, for reasons on=
ly She knows, because Her perspective/vision is way beyond even the sharpes=
t human mind. Nobody, can understand mentally, all of Her actions, for She =
is truly the One whose energy has created the Universe of diversity, She li=
es hidden inside it as well as beyond it, awaiting patiently to be discover=
ed, extending Her love, truth, force and power to the aid of anyone who cal=
ls Her sincerely and unconditionally, yet allowing every creature the liber=
ty to act as per its own understanding, for causes apparently good or the a=
pparently bad. 

<<Does=C2=A0She needs some visa 
to go there if she is=C2=
=A0not the Creater.=C2=A0As you say all higher deity are 
there but less in=
 ability. Does the deities have even less =C2=A0ability on 
earth plane.>>
=

She needs no visa, but neither does She interfere without a genuine cause =
or a genuine call. Everything is Her world, then why is there ugliness, cri=
me, evil things? Who creates the Asuras, if not She? And it is She herself =
who gave them the liberty to act as per their freewill. This world is a pla=
y of forces and a democracy of opportunities. Every impulse, however Divine=
 or anti-Divine in aim, is given a chance to run its course and actualize i=
tself in the Universe. THAT is Her Divine Compassion! That is why She is TH=
E GREATEST Mother. She is mother to the Great Gods as much to the Danavas a=
nd Daityas, and Rakshasas and Bhutas and Pretas and other corrupt human bei=
ng and what not. 

Now coming to your question on the phrase "higher deitie=
s having less ability". I think I have not been able to explain clearly, si=
nce in the last mail I was merely writing in the context of that discussion=
. Let me try here.

There are three basic layer of this Universe. The physi=
cal, the astral or subtle layer, and the causal (karana jagat) layer. In th=
is subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our own physical plane, there i=
s a whole wide world of all possible forces, just like in our own world. It=
 is a layer which is created out of force of pranashakti. This force of pra=
nashakti in humans beings is what causes all emotive movements on the consc=
iousness - joy, happiness, love, passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, disgus=
t, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capable of influencing the thi=
nking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadhana and specially Tantrik =
sadhana, is to create a formation of the deity using ones own prana-shakti =
through the aid of repeated rituals and procedures and mantras etc. If you =
think carefully, you will realize that every idol, ever homa agni needs a p=
ranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sadhaka used the force of his=
/her own
 pranashakti to infuse life into a subtle formation of the deity. =
Once this process is successfully done, this sublte formation of the deity =
which exists in the subtle plane, has a life of its own. It can then guide =
the sadhaka through the path and eventually, one day lead him/her to the re=
al abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyond this astral plane).=
 If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakti, and make it identi=
fy/create such an astral formation of the deity, it becomes an even more po=
werful force. It is, from our limited human perspective, as much a powerful=
 entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not the actual Deity yet. Exactl=
y the same thing has been described by Sri Vimalananda in the Aghora books,=
 if you read carefully.=C2=A0 

When a sadhaka has been able to associate w=
ith such an astral formation of the deity, it can guide the sadhaka along t=
he path provided the sadhaka also is trying to work hard and sincerely to r=
each the causal planes (the real spiritual planes of existence where the re=
al force of the Deity originates). The difference, if you ask, between this=
 astral formation of the deity and the real deity is that, the former is ne=
ither bound nor capable by itself of causing a complete and total transform=
ation of the average human nature without a proactive help of the sadhaka. =
Whereas, if one reaches the plane of the Great Gods, which is where the rea=
l deity exists, one cannot avoid being transformed in mind, emotions, body =
etc. And what kind of a transformation will it be? One that will reflect to=
 the world as a greater and genuine humility, sense of deep surrender to th=
e Divine at ALL time and unfailingly, a complete withdrawal of lower nature=
 of man - lust, anger,
 jealousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace, c=
alm, detachment, mental-illumination, genuine compassion, a widening of the=
 consciousness. Such an individual, even if he/she just sits down next to a=
nother person, will exude a silent strong peace and unselfish love which wi=
ll automatically calm the minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals ET=
C. THAT is the authentic, unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of the=
 great deities. This comes even if one deity is properly realized in the ca=
usal planes of existence. But the astral formation of the same deity, which=
 is created by the force of our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case ma=
ybe, is often not capable of affecting this kind of a total transformation =
in a sadhaka. That is why it is limited. It is not limited because it can't=
=C2=A0 get me a better job or a nice pay hike or cure some diseases or brin=
g me fame or any such material benefit if I so ask of it - the astral forma=
tions of the deities
 can very easily do all these things in the physical w=
orld - but it is limited because it cannot by itself give you the must auth=
entic and persistent spirituality of the higher planes, the one aim and des=
tination of all genuine sadhana.

Since this astral plane is the way it is,=
 therefore it's extremely important to keep actively working on ourselves t=
o increase detachment, objectivity, genuine internal surrender (when that h=
appens one accepts all life-situations without the slightest grudge), humil=
ity, control of anger, lust, jealousy etc. (all that is universally accepte=
d as spiritual qualities). For unless these changes are affected at least t=
o some degree in the mind and emotions of the sadhaka, one is simply not re=
ady to reach the higher planes of God and benefit from them spiritually. Mo=
reover, at every stage of spiritual evolution there is a gap between experi=
ence and realization. Only repeated experiences *may* lead to realization. =
One off experiences create a force no doubt, but in time it fritters away, =
or worst, gets distorted by the impurities and conditioning of the sadhaka.=


<<I am sure this is not your 
theory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobin=
do. Many times when certain 
person reach a stage in their spiritual path, =
others think whatever this guy is uttering is=C2=A0complete truth, when in =
fact it is=C2=A0far from truth. 
Once=C2=A0I saw in a article that Aurobind=
o said that Divine Lord who spoke 
Gita completely forgot it after few minu=
tes or so. I could not believe 
what I was reading. Then my respect for thi=
s yogi went down the drain.>>

You surety is incorrect. There were certain =
events which happened in the last one and half years which made me sit down=
 and rethink my own understanding of spirituality. At about the same time I=
 started worshiping a specific personality of the Divine Mother, and the mo=
re I meditated on Her, the more would thoughts pour into my mind that my un=
derstanding of spirituality is imperfect and has serious flaws. I tried, us=
ing my own meditations to find out what was wrong or rather imperfectly und=
erstood, what needed rethinking. First question I asked myself was, what is=
 the aim of spirituality? My mind could grasp some outlines of certain answ=
ers and processes and truths. But it was still not exceptionally clear.

I =
had first read Sri Aurobindo when I was in college. I could not go beyond t=
he first two pages. They were bouncers going one mile over my head. Three y=
ears ago someone gave me a book of Sri Aurobindo. I could understand say 10=
 percent, and rest I rejected, partly due to ignorance and partly due to eg=
oistic arrogance. Never opened any of his writing since then. This year, as=
 my sadhana was going on and as I was instinctively trying to correct the f=
laws in my understanding, one day while meditating I had an inner thought i=
n the form of an image, which told me that I should start reading Sri Aurob=
indo but in a very specific manner. The image was very clear in my inner-ey=
e, and thoroughly pressing on my consciousness. I opened his book again, an=
d read it in the prescribed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense to =
me. What I was struggling to understand all this year, whose outline I coul=
d grasp yet not get a proper hang of, I was able to understand
 from his wr=
itings with much deeper clarity.=C2=A0 Many of my own experiences made more=
 sense to me. Many sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a new =
light. I read 40 - 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me to st=
op at a certain point of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 % I=
 will have to first make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational mi=
nd will distort the information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected firml=
y 3 years ago, now came back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing sun.=
 

The line that you mention, is from one of the earlier writings of Sri Au=
robindo on the historical problem of the Mahabharta. In the Mahabharata, th=
ere is an incident which comes later on, after the great war and when Yudhi=
sthira was ruling the kingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sri Krishna to repe=
at the words he had spoken at the beginning of the war (The Gita) once more=
 since he has forgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, the time has passed awa=
y (it was a special time when the Gita was spoken), he cannot repeat the "e=
xact words" once again. 

Sri Krishna was the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even =
Swami Vivekananda was one of his Gurus, for during the time when Sri Aurobi=
ndo was in jail, for 15 days Swami Vivekananda would appear before him dail=
y and instruct him on the various layers of the mind, which he was not awar=
e of till then. Swami Vivekananda had already left his physical body by the=
n. It was in the writings of Sri Aurobindo that he mentioned about the left=
 and right hemisphere of the brain and their difference in functionality, a=
nd their connection to spirituality, about 30 years before medical science =
confirmed the same. 

Right from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondic=
herry, to pushing his own spiritual experiences further into states of Saha=
ja (which he describes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided co=
ntinuously by the Adesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voice =
of Krishna speaking to him, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna =
was his Guru, the Divine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destinati=
on. Anyway, my point is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo's perspective of =
spirituality. I have benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone els=
e will also benefit. There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, eac=
h with their unique perspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must indi=
vidually try and find whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotiona=
l makeup, and help us to progress on the path. 

Though I now have a very d=
eep respect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both his cri=
tics and his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstoo=
d the depth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a functio=
n of their own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any gen=
uine understanding or appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can be unde=
rstood accurately or even slightly without sincere sadhana.

Disclaimer=
---- My thinking is 
very different due to Darshan and=C2=A0Grace of Divine=
 Mother & Divine 
Lord. Nobody should feel unhappy If I do not agree or fol=
low the 
leader.Thanks.>>

I at-least will never feel unhappy if you disagr=
ee. There are 
many saints, many philosophies, many paths, not everyone is =
bound to 
like every path.=C2=A0 Disagreement is perfectly ok. Because some=
one 
disagrees with me or those whom I agree with, does not mean I like him=
 
any less. I try to keep my=C2=A0 emotional side (where respect, love, 
di=
slike, hatred, anger, passions exist) separate from my thinking mind. 
It i=
s very much possible, through practice, for a man to disassociate 
his rati=
onal-mind from the emotional-mind. So have no fears that your 
disagreement=
 is going to make me like you any less or any more.

The problem with the e=
motional part of our being is that it jumps up at appearances, running ahea=
d to grasp the truth rather than waiting patiently for the truth to arrive =
in all its aspects and dimensions, and in the process it distorts the truth=
 and then reacts to that distorted image. For example, recently in some soc=
ial forums I posted a comment that I found the Tantrik Adwaitha far more ap=
pealing than Sri Adi Shankara's Adwaitha, though the Adwaitha of Adi Shanka=
ra has many hard-selling supporters. Immediately some friends of mine on Tw=
itter and otherwise, jumped to the false conclusion that I have disrespecte=
d Adi Shankara, and tried best to make me "see the truth" by such grandiose=
 statements that=C2=A0 Shankara is the 'final word' on Adwaitha and everyth=
ing else must be necessarily lesser. Or that I was making an egoistic denou=
ncement. Both of which are million light-years away from the truth. That Sr=
i Adi Shankara was a special Vibhuti
 (manifestation) of God, that much I a=
m certain. His compositions are so brilliant that it can't be sufficiently =
appreciated in words. Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his philos=
ophy. And because I am not bound to accept his philosophy, does not mean I =
respect or love him any less than any other great saint.=C2=A0

If you disr=
espect a man, and specially a saint, and then start disliking him too with =
a passion, you are creating strong negative karmas. But if you can disagree=
 with someone without losing respect or love for the person, in an objectiv=
e manner, you reap very little karmic effects. That is why Lord Krishna too=
 advices us to become more detached in life.

In conclusion, Narasimha is t=
otally correct. Many things cannot be sufficiently expressed in words witho=
ut causing some distortion.

Dear Rajarshi Bhai,
How are you do=
ing? About 200 hundred years ago, a man made a theory of creation in France=
. When Napolean asked where is God in it, the guy said, do not talk about G=
od. It makes things complicated.
So is there a place for Divine Mother and =
Her Love or Grace or Protection in your theory. Is=C2=A0this intermediate z=

or so. I could not believe what I was reading. Then my respect for this yog=
i went down the drain.
=C2=A0
Divine Mother, Her Love, Her Grace Her Protec=
tion and other Eternal Divine Beings are outside of our human perception. T=
hey only allow us to know about Themselves what They wish to. For me there =
is a=C2=A0difference between a yogi and devotee.=C2=A0 A devotee rises due =

Dear Utpal,

Agreed =
-:)

If we do not forget the parameters of judgement, then sadhana is fruit=
ful, IMO. Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameters of judgement =
is to objectively see what changes are happening in our surface, day-to-day=
 consciousness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc.

The fi=
eld of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some of it =
can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. Mos=
t spiritual people have never gone in depth trying to analyse and understan=
d these things properly, but some pattern is observable.=C2=A0 Not all expe=
riences are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this j=
ungle of experiences, not being able to adequately determine which is genui=
ne and which is non-genuine. This is the world of astral
 plane, driven by =
the overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a =
human being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping inf=
luence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everythin=
g=C2=A0 is possible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser man=
ifestation in this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endle=
ss beings of varies character and hue who can very easily create an experei=
nce for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an exp=
erience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker=
 and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower=
 extreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface=
 ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitio=
ns, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc an=
d at the other extreme this layer can, if properly
 channalized as is done =
in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda and ma=
nifest the "antaratmah" as an unfailing guide to the path.

In a nutshell, =
a genuine "experience" is good and authentic only to the extent that it hel=
ps to modify and transform your waking surface personality. That is the onl=
y true test. Rest all the range of experiences that come from this realm, a=
nd 95 percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound=
 and fury without substance. 

In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls i=
t the intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got=
 swept away by the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot way to cros=
s this realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, is to hang=
 on tightly to the fundamentals.

 is no other somebody else in the Universe apart from Her. Even the worst A=
sura is also Her creation to sustain this world, for reasons only She knows=
, because Her perspective/vision is way beyond even the sharpest human mind=
. Nobody, can understand mentally, all of Her actions, for She is truly the=
 One whose energy has created the Universe of diversity, She lies hidden in=
side it as well as beyond it, awaiting patiently to be discovered, extendin=

 per its own understanding, for causes apparently good or the apparently ba=
d. <br><br> <<Does She needs some visa 
to go there if she is&nb=

earth plane.>=
;><br><br>She needs no visa, but neither does She interfere without a ge=
nuine cause or a genuine call. Everything is Her world, then why is there u=
gliness, crime, evil things? Who creates the Asuras, if not She? And it is =
She herself who gave them the liberty to act as per their freewill. This wo=
rld is a play of forces and a democracy of opportunities. Every impulse, ho=
wever Divine or anti-Divine in aim, is given a chance to run its course and=
 actualize itself in the Universe. THAT is Her Divine Compassion! That is w=
hy She is THE GREATEST Mother. She is mother to the Great Gods as much to t=
he Danavas and Daityas, and Rakshasas and Bhutas and Pretas and other corru=
pt human being and what not. <br><br>Now coming to your question on the phr=
ase "higher deities having less ability". I think I have not been able to e=
xplain clearly, since in the last mail I was merely writing in the context =
of that discussion. Let me try here. <br><br>There
 are three basic layer o=
f this Universe. The physical, the astral or subtle layer, and the causal (=
karana jagat) layer. In this subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our o=
wn physical plane, there is a whole wide world of all possible forces, just=
 like in our own world. It is a layer which is created out of force of pran=
ashakti. This force of pranashakti in humans beings is what causes all emot=
ive movements on the consciousness - joy, happiness, love, passion, rage, f=
ear, anger, hatred, disgust, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capa=
ble of influencing the thinking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadh=
ana and specially Tantrik sadhana, is to create a formation of the deity us=
ing ones own prana-shakti through the aid of repeated rituals and procedure=
s and mantras etc. If you think carefully, you will realize that every idol=
, ever homa agni needs a pranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sad=
haka used the force of his/her own
 pranashakti to infuse life into a subtl=
e formation of the deity. Once this process is successfully done, this subl=
te formation of the deity which exists in the subtle plane, has a life of i=
ts own. It can then guide the sadhaka through the path and eventually, one =
day lead him/her to the real abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (=
beyond this astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini =
shakti, and make it identify/create such an astral formation of the deity, =
it becomes an even more powerful force. It is, from our limited human persp=
ective, as much a powerful entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not th=
e actual Deity yet. Exactly the same thing has been described by Sri Vimala=
nanda in the Aghora books, if you read carefully.  <br><br>When a sadh=
aka has been able to associate with such an astral formation of the deity, =
it can guide the sadhaka along the path provided the sadhaka also is trying=
 to work hard and sincerely
 to reach the causal planes (the real spiritual=
 planes of existence where the real force of the Deity originates). The dif=
ference, if you ask, between this astral formation of the deity and the rea=
l deity is that, the former is neither bound nor capable by itself of causi=
ng a complete and total transformation of the average human nature without =
a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one reaches the plane of the G=
reat Gods, which is where the real deity exists, one cannot avoid being tra=
nsformed in mind, emotions, body etc. And what kind of a transformation wil=
l it be? One that will reflect to the world as a greater and genuine humili=
ty, sense of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL time and unfailingly, a co=
mplete withdrawal of lower nature of man - lust, anger, jealousy, greed, co=
vetousness - an abiding peace, calm, detachment, mental-illumination, genui=
ne compassion, a widening of the consciousness. Such an individual, even if=
 he/she just sits
 down next to another person, will exude a silent strong =
peace and unselfish love which will automatically calm the minds and distur=
bed emotions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the authentic, unhindered flow =
of the Divine Power of any of the great deities. This comes even if one dei=
ty is properly realized in the causal planes of existence. But the astral f=
ormation of the same deity, which is created by the force of our own pranas=
hakti or Kundalini as the case maybe, is often not capable of affecting thi=
s kind of a total transformation in a sadhaka. That is why it is limited. I=
t is not limited because it can't  get me a better job or a nice pay h=
ike or cure some diseases or bring me fame or any such material benefit if =
I so ask of it - the astral formations of the deities can very easily do al=
l these things in the physical world - but it is limited because it cannot =
by itself give you the must authentic and persistent spirituality of the hi=
gher
 planes, the one aim and destination of all genuine sadhana.<br><br>Si=
nce this astral plane is the way it is, therefore it's extremely important =
to keep actively working on ourselves to increase detachment, objectivity, =
genuine internal surrender (when that happens one accepts all life-situatio=
ns without the slightest grudge), humility, control of anger, lust, jealous=
y etc. (all that is universally accepted as spiritual qualities). For unles=
s these changes are affected at least to some degree in the mind and emotio=
ns of the sadhaka, one is simply not ready to reach the higher planes of Go=
d and benefit from them spiritually. Moreover, at every stage of spiritual =
evolution there is a gap between experience and realization. Only repeated =
experiences *may* lead to realization. One off experiences create a force n=
o doubt, but in time it fritters away, or worst, gets distorted by the impu=
rities and conditioning of the sadhaka.<br><br><<<span>I am sure
 thi=
s is not your 
theory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times wh=
en certain 
person reach a stage in their spiritual path, others think what=
ever this
 guy is uttering is complete truth, when in fact it is =
far from truth. 
Once I saw in a article that Aurobindo said that Divi=
ne Lord who spoke 
Gita completely forgot it after few minutes or so. I cou=
ld not believe 
what I was reading. Then my respect for this yogi went down=
 the drain.>><br><br>You surety is incorrect. There were certain even=
ts which happened in the last one and half years which made me sit down and=
 rethink my own understanding of spirituality. At about the same time I sta=
rted worshiping a specific personality of the Divine Mother, and the more I=
 meditated on Her, the more would thoughts pour into my mind that my unders=
tanding of spirituality is imperfect and has serious flaws. I tried, using =
my own meditations to find out what was wrong or rather imperfectly underst=
ood, what needed rethinking. First question I asked myself was, what is the=
 aim of spirituality? My mind could grasp some outlines of certain answers =
and processes and truths. But it was still not exceptionally clear. <br><br=
>I had first read Sri Aurobindo when I was in college. I could not go beyon=
d the first two pages. They were bouncers going one mile over my head. Thre=
e years
 ago someone gave me a book of Sri Aurobindo. I could understand sa=
y 10 percent, and rest I rejected, partly due to ignorance and partly due t=
o egoistic arrogance. Never opened any of his writing since then. This year=
, as my sadhana was going on and as I was instinctively trying to correct t=
he flaws in my understanding, one day while meditating I had an inner thoug=
ht in the form of an image, which told me that I should start reading Sri A=
urobindo but in a very specific manner. The image was very clear in my inne=
r-eye, and thoroughly pressing on my consciousness. I opened his book again=
, and read it in the prescribed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense=
 to me. What I was struggling to understand all this year, whose outline I =
could grasp yet not get a proper hang of, I was able to understand from his=
 writings with much deeper clarity.  Many of my own experiences made m=
ore sense to me. Many sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a
 =
new light. I read 40 - 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me t=
o stop at a certain point of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60=
 % I will have to first make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rationa=
l mind will distort the information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected f=
irmly 3 years ago, now came back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing =
sun. <br><br>The line that you mention, is from one of the earlier writings=
 of Sri Aurobindo on the historical problem of the Mahabharta. In the Mahab=
harata, there is an incident which comes later on, after the great war and =
when Yudhisthira was ruling the kingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sri Krish=
na to repeat the words he had spoken at the beginning of the war (The Gita)=
 once more since he has forgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, the time has =
passed away (it was a special time when the Gita was spoken), he cannot rep=
eat the "exact words" once again. <br><br>Sri Krishna was the main
 Guru of=
 Aurobindo. Even Swami Vivekananda was one of his Gurus, for during the tim=
e when Sri Aurobindo was in jail, for 15 days Swami Vivekananda would appea=
r before him daily and instruct him on the various layers of the mind, whic=
h he was not aware of till then. </span></span><span><span><span><span>Swam=
i Vivekananda had already left his physical body by then.</span></span> It =
was in the writings of Sri Aurobindo that he mentioned about the left and r=
ight hemisphere of the brain and their difference in functionality, and the=
ir connection to spirituality, about 30 years before medical science confir=
med the same. <br><br> Right from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondi=
cherry, to pushing his own spiritual experiences further into states of Sah=
aja (which he describes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided c=
ontinuously by the Adesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voice=
 of Krishna speaking to him, instructing him to do this or
 do that. Krishn=
a was his Guru, the Divine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destina=
tion. Anyway, my point is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo's perspective o=
f spirituality. I have benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone e=
lse will also benefit. There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, e=
ach with their unique perspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must in=
dividually try and find whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotio=
nal makeup, and help us to progress on the path. <br><br>Though I now have =
a very deep respect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both=
 his critics and his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misu=
nderstood the depth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a=
 function of their own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on=
 any genuine understanding or appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can=
 be understood accurately or even slightly without
 sincere sadhana.<br></s=

ONT-SIZE:12pt;">Dear Utpal,<br><br>Agreed -:)<br><br>If we do not forget th=
e parameters of judgement, then sadhana is fruitful, IMO. Otherwise it does=
 not help. And the only parameters of judgement is to objectively see what =
changes are happening in our surface, day-to-day consciousness.That is are =
we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc.<br><br>The field of experiences - =
visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some of it can be genuine and pl=
enty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. Most spiritual people ha=
ve never gone in depth trying to analyse and understand these things proper=
ly, but some pattern is observable.  Not all experiences are what they=
 seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle of experiences,=
 not being able to adequately determine which is genuine and which is non-g=
enuine. This is the world of astral
 plane, driven by the overlapping sheal=
ths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a human being. In Tantr=
ik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (overlapping a=
nd not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything  is possible h=
ere. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation in this re=
alm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless beings of varies c=
haracter and hue who can very easily create an expereince for a sadhaka to =
delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experience/aura of a hig=
her deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker and use him/her for =
its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower extreme of which cau=
ses, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface ego driven by attrac=
tions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitions, jealousy, lust, a=
nger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc and at the other extrem=
e this layer can, if properly
 channalized as is done in genuine Vaishava B=
hakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda and manifest the "antaratma=
h" as an unfailing guide to the path.<br><br>In a nutshell, a genuine "expe=
rience" is good and authentic only to the extent that it helps to modify an=
d transform your waking surface personality. That is the only true test. Re=
st all the range of experiences that come from this realm, and 95 percent o=
f Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound and fury witho=
ut substance. <br><br>In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it the int=
ermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got swept aw=
ay by the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot way to cross this re=
alm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, is to hang on tight=
ly to the fundamentals.<br><br>-Regards<br> Rajarshi <br>

<div>Dear Rajarshi,<br><br>A sage "sms" indeed! Yes direction must be alwa=
ys, always the top most priority. It reminded me of simple, yet quite effec=
tive day to day example of driving Car. One can not miss/ignore the sight o=
f correct road to the destination even for a split second. However, Optimis=
ed "controlled" speed (even if very fast by set standards) could be an adde=
d advantage while not loosing the sight of the road.<br><br>Best Regards,<b=
