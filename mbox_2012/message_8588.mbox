Namaste sir,
During some pujas like varalakshmi vratam and navratis a lot o=
f emphasis is laid on making prasadam. Eg. Nine items during varalakshmi vr=
atam etc. However this leads to tiredness and less time and energy is spent=
 on t
he actual puja. What is the right approach to perform these puja.

Sr=
ilatha
