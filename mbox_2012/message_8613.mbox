      <p>Dear Murali<br>
<b=
r>
I had the same question a few months ago when I started to get intereste=
d in performing homam at home. But now I perform the homam regularly exactl=
y as descried in the manual by Mr PVR Narasimha Rao. <br>
<br>
My homa kund=
am is around 8 inches (each side) and I use dried coconut pieces (flakes ab=
out an inch long are better, you can simply cut the dried coconut halves wi=
th a simple knife to get these flakes) as offering. For the first time I ha=
ve used gomay with ghee on each piece. These also cause NO smoke, nor any u=
npleasant odor after the ceremony).<br>
<br>
I control the fire with the am=
ount of dried coconut and ghee I offer in the fire. When the fire is subsid=
ing I add a little piece of camphor (karpuram), some dried coconut powder a=
nd a drop of ghee. Dropping the ghee directly on the flame seems to dampen =
it a little. Adding a drop just to side of the fire seems to help spread it=
. Best way is to try and learn. <br>
<br>
In summary, it seems just fine to=
 do the homam in an apartment or other such closed spaces.<br>
<br>
I hope =
this helps. Do not wait, start doing it. <br>
