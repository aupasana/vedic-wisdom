Namaste,
=C2=A0
There are dhyana slokas of Chandi, but the Gita Press versi=
on does not contain that information. In another tradition, there are a col=
lection of 4 dhyana slokas used for invoking Chandi. There are also dhyana =
slokas for Devi-vahana, and an additional phalastuti to be read after 13th =
chapter.
=C2=A0
The compilation which goes with the name of Durga Saptasati=
 is a pick and choose from the Tantras. Different Tantras have varied descr=
iptions and procedural instructions for worshipping Chandi. All are equally=
 valid. So different traditions worship Chandi in slightly differing format=
s.=C2=A0 Some of the differences that I have notices are as follows:
=C2=A0=

1. In the Gita Press version,=C2=A0one starts with Kavacha, Argala,.. In a=
nother tradition one starts with Argala, Keelaka then Kavacha.
=C2=A0
2. In=
 the other tradition, one uses dhyana slokas for Chandi, dhyana slokas for =
"devi-vahana simha"
=C2=A0
3. The words of the argala, kavach, and some par=
ts of the main text also differ.
=C2=A0
4. Kunjika differs majorly.
=C2=A0
=
5. The list of samput also differ, and there are certain yogic mudras, form=
s of pranayama,=C2=A0for different parts of the Chandi.
=C2=A0
6. An additi=
onal list of phalastuti for various kamya-prayogs and their specifications =
of time, place, materials etc.
=C2=A0

Namaste and pranaams Narasimha,
I am unable to un=

Th=

Please don't misunderstand m=

I hope you will reply.
