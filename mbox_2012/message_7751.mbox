Hello - Are you trying nirjala or only fruits or no grains on Ekadasi ?

Cu=
z you said Sadhana, let me tell you something that happened few decades bef=
ore. When lot of his disciples were seen missing from the daily devotional =
services, Srila Bhakti Siddhantha Saraswati Thakur (Srila Prabhupada's Guru=
 Maharaj) found out that most of them were lying down in the noon. He asked=
 them to eat khichdi (grains are not allowed on ekadasi, still he insisted)=
 and go ahead with the daily devotional services. He told them it is essent=
ial to realize that fasting is important for devotional service, but it is =
not bigger than devotional service.

regards
Prasad
