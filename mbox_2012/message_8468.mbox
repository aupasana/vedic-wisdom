Basically every particle in this universe is GOD's particle since GOD himse=
lf has created the universe.


Most importantly, please and kindly note tha=
t that the original name was given as "godammn particle". The editor of a b=
ook/magazine (who essentially had no idea as to what particle and sub-atomi=
c physics and string/M/brane theory is..) found that it be rather 'more int=
eresting' to name it as the 'god particle' instead of the 'godammn particle=
' and thus mislead the entire world in terms of the literary meaning contai=
ned in the phrase 'god particle'.


In my own personal view calling it as G=
OD's particle is nota mistake or anything, but calling the particle in a wa=
y as to suggest that the particle itself is god is utter childishness. I pr=
efer to call it as "GOD's particle" as opposed to "GOD particle".


- With =
warm regards
