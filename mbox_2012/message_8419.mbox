Nobody Ji

Amazing messages all throughout.Many Many thanks to you for prov=
iding that hard knock....If I may just add one small message ( not that I h=
ave realized anything or that am doing any sadhana properly ) .

Just addin=
g it in the hope it might help others....for often many are asking sincerel=
y " How to love God ".... Based purely on what my Guru told me 

" How will=
 you love something that you have no idea about "..Also

"It is very easy t=
o imagine loving somebody sitting way up in heaven with whom you have no in=
teraction "...It is much harder to love your neighbour....

" Forget about =
Divinity and its myriad theories...One can aspire to it when one is atleast=
 human "..

Narasimha Ji has always said...the true measure of progress is =
when one is starting to get a little less angry,little more compassionate..=
.little more intense and little more exuberant...

It is not about the 20 m=
ins of Homa...or your respective Kriyas/Meditations/Affirmations/Stotras...=
Defintely do that atleast but what matters most is how do you conduct rest =
of your day ?


Loving god will only come when you truly start loving the p=
eople around you....That is the true test since now you have some skin in t=
he game...all else is delusion...

For eg: Jesus never said to Love god ...=
He always said "Love Thy Neighbour" for :) it is the true test.....it is ea=
sy to love dead people ...so hard to love a living person sitting right bes=
ide us.

One hating so many people ( one's bosses...ones relatives...variou=
s acquaintances) ...even if he imagines he is loving God...it is but a delu=
sion.


Anywaz Chota mooh badi baat...just wanted to say that out....

Many=
 Pranams
