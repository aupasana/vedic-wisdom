Namaste friends,

Happy Guru Pournima and I bow to the Guru Tattva that is present in all 
of you.

On this occasion, I want to clarify one thing, on which I kept quiet for 
many years.

Some people look up to me as a "guru", in either astrology or 
spirituality or both.

When it comes to astrology, people who follow me should have known by 
now that I am still searching for something that satisfies me. The 
knowledge/ignorance I keep sharing (because that is the best I can do 
now) is most likely different from what rishis meant. So there is no 
point in looking up to me as a "guru" and following me with fervour. Do 
your own search instead (and maximize the chance of someone finding 
truth).

When it comes to spirituality, I am NOT an enlightened person and not 
capable of making anyone enlightened. Even if the un-enlightened 
spiritual state I am in is good enough for someone, I do not know how to 
replicate it in someone, either through writings or talks or thoughts. 
In other words, I am capable of giving one NEITHER what one needs in the 
long run NOR what I have right now. All I can give others, through my 
writings, is an understanding that is qualified by their and my 
conditioning (like a white conch exchanged between two people with dirty 
hands may have the dirty hand prints of the giver or the taker). Yes, I 
can also share knowhow of some tools that may help you in your pursuit, 
but that does not make me a guru either.

This is not just some humble talk, but the *unquestionable* and honest 
reality. It is better if people who are somehow fascinated with me 
and/or look up to me as a guru and think about me with reverence, divert 
that attention and reverence towards God. Unlike me, God CAN make you a 
better astrologer or a better spiritual sadhaka or both.

Happy Guru Pournima again!

Love & regards,
Narasimha
