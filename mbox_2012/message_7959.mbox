Respected Sir,

I am not able enough to answer this question but i will lik=
e to express my opinion.

I think that every karma we do is a complex karma=
. every karma we do gives us some blessings and some curses. whether it is =
breathing, eating or walking or doing business or cooking etc.  blessings w=
e accumulates are our punyas and curses we accumulate are our papas.  some =
karma create more punyas than papas and vice versa.

Every living being has=
 his own dharma to follow. And every dharma have some specific karmas (and =
thus blessings and curses) attached to it.

Regards
