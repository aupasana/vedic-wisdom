dear Challa,

you got so much good advice, that I hesitate to add my oppini=
on. But anyway I decided  not to withhold it.=C2=A0
Did you ever wonder, wh=
ere your thoughts come from? Is it you, who intends what to think? 
Do you =
intend these abusive thinking?
Thoughts come to your mind automatically.  T=
hey are like clouds passing by. You are receiving thoughts like a radio rec=
eives  music and speech. Is the radio responsible for the kind of music and=
 speech?
You are responsible only if you get involved and =C2=A0make them y=
our viewpoint, think they are right.

It is like you have a drunken crowd a=
round you. You hear them but you know their talking is rubbish.
What you do=
 is taking responsibility for the mind chatter as if you where creating thi=
s yourself -and intentionally.
This causes needless suffering, feeling guil=
t and shame for something that you did not originate.=C2=A0
God knows where=
 the abusive talks come from. God knows your intention- and what is not you=
r intention.
May you be blessed and all the good people who are helping you=


Honk

>First of all, thanks to all of=
 you, many many times for taking time to address my issue. You have no idea=
 how much support morally you guys have provided me. Now coming to the sugg=
estion that were given, i will list them down here and mention which ones i=
 am already following and which i am not:
>Brahmacharya: Yes, for the past =
several years (almost 5 yrs), i am into brahmacharya. Although i am a house=
 hold leading family life, i am into Brahmacharya as i chose to live like t=
hat. According to me, sex is only for reproduction. After, i got two childr=
en, i took the practise.
>Humility: Yes, always humiliated, whenever i get =
abusive thoughts, i do situps, stand infront of god and ask for forgiveness=
.
>Reciting stotras: I recite lalitha, lakshmi, sri suktham, lakshmi japam,=
 Vishnu sahasra namam and listen to Rudram regularily.
>Reciting stotras wi=
th open eyes instead of closed eyes: Yes, i do the same as closed eyes make=
 me suffer more.
>Chandi kavacha: No, i am not reciting this. I shall start=
. Do i have to follow any special niyama's? other than purifying my body.
>=
Disciplined life style: I will become more disciplined hence forth.
>Pranay=
amam: No, i shall do this one as well
>EFT on internet: No, but not sure wh=
at does it stand for. Can u pls elaborate so that i can google accordingly.=

>Charity: Yes i am a little bit into it, but will expand more
>Now, what i=
 understandd the main  cause for my situation is a very STRONG mind and wea=
k senses. My mind records any evil things, that i see, hear very very stron=
gly, that it keeps on repeating those in such away that, evil thoughts beco=
me a part of my thought process. As such, i am carrying those with me all t=
he time and what ever i do, they get pronounced. In other cases, i may not =
care much, but as far as GOD, i know its sin, so my mind is sending some al=
arms as well parallely.In short, i completely failed to control my mind. By=
 the time i realized what it is turning me into, it took me completely.
>i =
also have this obsession of over cleanliness when it comes to god. i can't =
offer prayers without head bath. i maintian a strict dress code like old ag=
e Brahmins have, "madi" and dont touch anythign at home when i am doing poo=
ja. i can't tolerate indscipline when it comes to god. 
>Lately, i have sta=
rted homams. i am not doing them , but going to temple and having priest pe=
rform them. When ever i do homam, i am getting some relief. I thank you one=
 and all for your time. I shall follow your guidelines and keep u all poste=
d on my progress. I need that support so that i can continue my devotional =
journey without the afraid of getting a "sinner" tag.

rtful pranamams,

>I am a very stro=

as I can.however, all my passion, interest seems to get drained and discour=

always get negative & abusive thoughts and tie those to the god. For ex, if=
 I hear a foul language, see a negative thing, bad or foul my mind relates =
or ties it to god. My mind start abusing god with the same foul language.

When I do Japam, =C2=A0my mind would not get concentration, but goes into t=

>I can't see directly into the eyes of =
god with the fear of my mind abusing him I can't focus my drishti on god st=

 can increase my devotion and prayers. I love him. I want to pray him.=C2=
=A0
>Currently, my mind and it's racing evil & foul thoughts have become a =
road block in my devotion and trying to keep me away from him as much as po=
ssible. At one point of time, they dominated me and I had to stay away from=
 praying him for a while.

>Why does it happen to me?
>Is it some=
 kind of disorder
>Am in incurring wrath
 of god=C2=A0
>I am scared to deat=
h that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough for some 100 births
>What
=
 can I do to get out of this perversion and be able to concentrate on him
>=
I want to worship god like every one does
>I am highly stressed because of =
this constant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always in pain because of =
this stress.
>
>Please help me , but do no hate me. Please do not disregard=
 or discard my email. This is a situation I can't disclose to anyone in per=
son with the fear of hatred and resentment. I am hoping to get some relief =
from learned scholars like yourself.
