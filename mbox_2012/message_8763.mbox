My pranams to all.
I have been performing weekly havan for more than a year=
 and half.
I want to point out certain things related to havan so that it c=
an be done as per shastra by others too.
I am using a conversation that in =
fact took place to bring out these relevant points.

Sometime back there wa=
s informal "prashNa" session whose summary I am presenting below: 

[South =
Indians might be familiar with similar "ashTamangala prashNa" conducted in =
temples when something goes wrong - called as dosha.]

PrashNa conductor: T=
here seems to be a dosha... Hmm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to b=
e performing some kind of Agni karya at your home regularly.

Myself: Yes (=
I was actually very surprised by this pointed question because I had not to=
ld anybody about the havan I did at home)

PrashNa conductor: There are cer=
tain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry samit=
h materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.

Myself: Yes I am us=
ing Til (sesame seeds).

PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleas=
t a little bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.

Myself: Ok. And what is =
the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?

PrashNa conductor: Do you do requir=
ed Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra =
that you use for your regular japa?

Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is the=
re a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?

Pr=
ashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is =
for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified =
for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recit=
ations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)

Myself: =
Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book=
 - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that book series)

P=
rashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanti=
ng. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to f=
ollow it strictly.

The conversation went onto several other things. Subseq=
uently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciti=
ng that mantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per =
the above mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual p=
rogress since. 

Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with =
me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to p=
erform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the "qual=
ification" for the ahuti.

Regards,
Ashutosh
