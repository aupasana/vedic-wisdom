My dear Priya, I'm sorry that you are having health problems. I received=
 your private email (I hope you don't mind that I'm replying here, so that =
it's clear to everyone that all misunderstandings have been resolved).

The=
re is no need at all to apologise. It was just a misunderstanding that coul=
d happen to any of us. I apologise to you and other respected members if my=
 strong language to God was offensive....I can understand that it may have =
come across that way. Durga is lucky that she has a daughter like to you de=
fend her! :) On a more serious note, I speak freely to Durga as my spiritua=
l mentor...sometimes lovingly, sometimes with irritation/anger- but ultimat=
ely I love her really (though the love is not yet perfect). 

Here is a lin=
k to a blog containing some quotes by Ramakrishna. He says "direct the six =
passions to God". I'm a beginner on the path and can't stop bad emotions fr=
om arising. But when they arise, I give them back to the Divine from where =
they came. All good and bad things come from God, and belong to God not me.=
 I try my best to control anger etc, but if it arises, I just offer it to G=
od. Also, japa helps a lot. I find I get less angry now compared to before =
though there is a lot of room for improvement.

ramakrishna-paramahamsa/

As we are all apologising, I was to apologise sin=
cerely to Mr Nobody ji for being rude. His excellent advice to repeat God's=
 name constantly made me feel guilty because I'm so useless at following it=
. I know I should but I don't repeat it enough. I will set a timer and repe=
at His Name at least once on the hour every hour (aside from my sit down pr=
actice). I will do extra japa thanks to you Nobody ji, hope Durga showers h=
er choicest blessings on you (you seem to be pretty lovesick for God, lucky=
 man).

Ok, I feel the air is clear. Hope everyone has a nice day. I am run=
ning to work now. Many thanks to the kind members who have written to me on=
 tantra. I will read in detail and look forward to replying when I get home=
.

Warm regards to all,

Aparna
