*Q: In the fifteenth chapter of=
 the Gita, there is a description of a tree
which is upside down. The branc=
hes are in the ground and the roots are in
the sky. What could be the signi=
ficance of this?*
A: This is a symbol to signify that your origin is the Di=
vinity; the
consciousness. That is your root. The mind and all its parapher=
nalia are
like the branches. And all the different types of rhythms in life=
, all the
different emotions, are like the leaves. They don=E2=80=99t stay =
permanently, they
wither away. If  you are focusing on the leaves, and you =
forget to water
the roots, then the tree will not remain.


So, it says, =
=E2=80=98Asvattham enam su-virudha-mulam asanga-sastrena drdhena
chittva=E2=
=80=99 (BG 15:3). Notice that you are not these different emotions, these
d=
ifferent aspects of life. Feel the distance from all these branches and
ret=
rieve back. That is what it is saying.


Otherwise we get so immersed in th=
e outer, that we forget the main root.
You need to prune the tree otherwise=
 it goes here and there. So prune all
that, and know that your origin is so=
mewhere up. Adi Shankaracharya has
said this beautifully, - =E2=80=98My ori=
ginal place is in heaven, I have come here
just for few days; just to have =
fun. Today I have just come for the purpose
of relaxing, but this is not my=
 original place, it is somewhere else.=E2=80=99


The thought itself - My h=
ome is somewhere else, I have just come to visit -
creates a distance insid=
e you. This world is a transit lounge.


You know, in airports and railway =
stations there are lounges, and in a
lounge what do you do? You keep your l=
uggage and start eating. You use the
bathroom and everything, but you don=
=E2=80=99t open your suitcase and hang your
clothes all over the place. You=
 don=E2=80=99t do that in a transit lounge. You keep
your things packed.


=
So this world is just a transit lounge. Don=E2=80=99t mistake it to be your=
 home.


*Q: The Ashtavakra Gita says, =E2=80=98You can go on reading scrip=
tures, but you
will get liberation only when you forget the scriptures.=E2=
=80=99 So then what is
the purpose of reading the scriptures?*
A: See, you =
get into a bus, but then you also need to get out of the bus.
Now if you ar=
gue with me that, =E2=80=98If I have to get out of the bus then why
should =
I get into the bus?=E2=80=99 What can I say? You get into the bus from
some=
where else and you get out from somewhere else. If you have to get out
of t=
he bus, why should you get into the bus in the first place - this
argument =
doesn=E2=80=99t hold.


So, the scriptures are to make you understand your =
nature, the nature of
the universe, the nature of this mind which is stuck =
in small things, and
to give it a bigger vision.


Knowledge is like deterg=
ent. See, you put soap on your body but at some
point you wash it off as we=
ll, isn=E2=80=99t it? Similarly, you have this desire,
=E2=80=99I want to b=
e liberated=E2=80=99, and that desire takes you away from all other
small d=
esires. But if you keep holding on to that thought, then it will
also becom=
e a problem at some point. You have to wash that off as well and
become fre=
e. A point comes when you say, =E2=80=98If I have to get liberation let
it =
be, otherwise let thy will be done.=E2=80=99 In that moment you are already=
 free.
