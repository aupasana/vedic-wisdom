Namaste Narasimhaji,

I feel blessed to have chanced upon this yahoo group!=
 For the last couple of years, I have witnessed a gradual yet strong inclin=
ation towards spirituality, religion, rituals, yoga, ayurveda and jyotish. =
I have been reading a lot about them, mostly via the internet, some reading=
s more helpful than others, but each drawing me closer towards learning mor=
e and understanding better. A lot of what I read here, in this yahoo-group,=
 is one of the most lucid explanation of spirituality, and the final goal o=
f every saadhana, and the link between spirituality and rituals, yoga, ayur=
veda, and leading a simple and humble life.

I have downloaded the book com=
piled from your writings on spiritual matters and I am in the process of re=
ading that as well, and derive great happiness in reading it. I also visite=
d your website and saw a wealth of material for spiritually inclined people=
 there. The manuals on do-it-yourself homams are one of your outstanding co=
ntributions to society, and shine brightly among the other gems of your con=
tributions. I feel an inclination towards performing homams on a daily/week=
ly basis. Before I start this, I want to seek your guidance on the followin=
g:

1. Do I need to prepare myself in any way before I start the homam?- I =
will explain to you what I mean here - since you have suggested that one st=
art with MahaGanapathi homam, I shall start with it too. However, as I have=
 been worshipping DeviMa every morning and Hanumanji every evening, do I ne=
ed to start worshipping MahaGanapathi now for a few days during mornings an=
d evenings and then after a few days, start with the homam?

2. Related to =
the first question, as I have been worshipping DeviMa for quite sometime no=
w, I see/visualize Her many times during the day (at work/home), so now whe=
n I start with the MahaGanapathi homam with complete faith, devotion, and s=
urrender to MahaGanapathi, wouldn't there be a conflict in my mind, since I=
 may still be visualizing DeviMa everywhere around me (due to mind's condit=
ioning), while I am worshipping MahaGanapathi as the One who is the source,=
 cradle and end of everything, and hence shoule be visualizing Him instead?=
 This may be a hypothetical situation, as I am talking about the future, ho=
wever, may still be relevant, and so I seek your advice here.

3. As I am h=
ouseholder, and we are expecting our first child in the next few months, is=
 it ok to perform a homam at home? It may sound jouvenile but I don't know =
any better, and would rather listen to wiser men. The reason I ask this is =
that while doing the homam, we chant various mantras/stotras, and they prod=
uce effects in the immediate environment, specially in the presence of Agni=
, the Pavaka. Although, the goal of my saadhana is to decondition my mimd t=
o move towards greater purity, humility and peace, and I have faith that a =
regular homam will enable me to achieve that. However, for the sake of my w=
ife and our child (inside her womb), I am prompted to ask this question. Pl=
ease don't take it in any other way except as a genuine concern for my fami=
ly (however silly it is)

4. Related to the above question, if it is fine f=
or me to do the homam at home, then can my pregnant wife also participate i=
n it, if she wants to?

5. Should I wait for an auspicious day like an amav=
asya or an eclipse to start the homam, or is any day fine? Similarly, shoul=
d I do the homam at a particular time every day or is any time fine? I do u=
nderstand that doing the homam/any saadhana at the same time everyday, what=
ever time one does it, is more beneficial than doing it at different times.=


6. Is it better to do the homam at home or can it be done elsewhere as we=
ll? The reason I ask this is we are living in a rented accomodation and the=
 smoke from the homam may blacken the walls and the ceiling. However, in ou=
r residential/apartment complex, there is a common area, which is open on t=
wo sides, where some community festivals are celebrated together, and if I =
get the permission, then maybe I can do the homam there? Is there a strong =
reason/added benefit to doing the homam at home?

Narasimhaji, I will be ve=
ry grateful to you for your answers to the above questions.

You are render=
ing a great service to today's society and we pray to DeviMa to keep showin=
g you the way.

Thank you for sharing so much!

Humble regards,
Vipin
