Namaste,

I will respond publicly, without revealing your identity (thou=

Q=
uestion 1:
=A0
Ramakrishna said that Krishna is like Sun and Kali is like t=
he sun's rays, light, heat etc. Without rays, Sun does not function. At the=
 same time, there are no rays without Sun. Sun and rays go together. Whethe=
r they are one or different is a matter of perspective and semantics.
=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
I may also give a differ=
ent analogy. A suppressed spring has potential energy. When it is released,=
 some potential energy is *converted* into kinetic energy. But potential en=
ergy and kinetic energy are not really two different things. They are two a=
spects of the same and converted from one to another. Similarly, Purusha is=
 the potential energy and Shakti is the kinetic energy.
=A0
Purushottama is=
 like the cumulative [spiritual] potential energy of the cosmos that is abo=
ut to go through the big bang. Adya shakti is like the cumulative [spiritua=
l] kinetic energy of the cosmos after the big bang. Purushottama and Adya S=
hakti are not really different and two aspects of the same. When something =
needs to be done in the cosmos, Purushottama projects himself as his Shakti=
 and things happen.
=A0

Question 2:
=A0
This is a great question and I never thought of it before.=
 Thanks for asking and making me think. Please note that I too do not have =
"eyes of gyana" and just speculating based on my intuition and sharing my t=
houghts unfiltered. If it makes no sense, please feel free to ignore. 
=A0
=
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The supreme kinetic ene=
rgy (feminine element) of cosmos is of three types - one that causes object=
ification in consciousness, one that sustains objectification in consciousn=
ess and one that ends objectification in consciousness. These three aspects=
 are represented by Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, the deities of=
 the 3 charitras of Saptashati or Chandipath or Devi Mahatmyam.
=A0
Various=
 higher beings emanate from these three basic types of higher kinetic energ=
y to aid in the respective high level processes. Please bear in mind that d=
ifferent male deities represents different types of potential energy of con=
sciousness, playing specific roles based on the combination of gunas, and d=
ifferent female deities represent different types of kinetic energy within =
consciousness, again playing specific roles based on the combination of gun=
as. It is all play of energies in the end.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
To cause objectification in consciousness, the kin=
etic energy of consciousness needs to be stirred and rajas-ified and the po=
tential energy of consciousness needs to be withdrawn/reduced, stopped and =
tamas-ified. These two energies are represented by Saraswati and Rudra.
=A0=

To sustain objectification already present in consciousness, the kinetic e=
nergy of consciousness needs to be in a stable and clear equilibrium and sa=
ttv-ified and the potential energy of consciousness needs to be stirred and=
 rajas-ified. These two energies are represented by Lakshmi and Brahma.
=A0=

To end objectification already present in consciousness, the kinetic energ=
y of consciousness needs to be withdrawn/reduced, stopped and tamas-ified a=
nd the potential energy of consciousness needs to be in a stable and clear =
equilibrium and sattv-ified. These two energies are represented by Gouri an=
d Vishnu.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
BTW, Nara=
yana or Purushottama is the absolute potential energy of cosmos. The initia=
l Mahalakshmi is the projection of that potential energy as kinetic energy.=
 Don't worry too much about the names. She is not the same as Mahalakshmi o=
f the 3 Mahadevis just because of the name. She could as well have been cal=
led Aadyaa Shakti or Naaraayani. To remove confusion, we may call her Aadya=
adi Mahalakshmi (in the terminology of Lakshmi Hridayam from "Atharva Rahas=
yam", which is one of my favorite prayers). Aadyaadi Mahalakshmi personifie=
s the entire kinetic energy of cosmos.
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
This reminds me of an incident. One person was doing =
daily Chandi homam and invoking Mahalakshmi as the main deity. He was using=
 the dhyana shloka for Mahalakshmi from "Vaikritika Rahasyam" (shvetAnanA n=
IlabhujA sushveta stana maNDalA...). He later switched to a different dhyan=
a shloka - the one for Adyadi Mahalakshmi from whom Mahakali, Mahalakshmi a=
nd Mahasaraswati came - from "Pradhanika Rahasyam" (sarvasyAdyA mahAlakShmI=
H trigunA parameshvarI...), thinking that it was superior.
=A0
His guru tol=
d him after a few months, "whatever dhyana shloka you use, know its meaning=
 and physically imagine someone in that form". He came and asked me for the=
 meaning. I discouraged him, "I don't think you really want to know the mea=
ning and physically imagine someone in that form". When he insisted, I told=
 him the meaning.
=A0
The verses describe Mahalakshmi who is the "First amo=
ng all" (sarvasya AdyA) and having all 3 gunas. She is described as holding=
 in her hands a liquor bowl, snake, male genital, female genital, king's he=
ad etc. Of course, if one starts imagining such a form, it may distract one=
's mind based on one's conditioning!
=A0
*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 *
=A0
The thing here is that these symbols represent some subt=
le things. The "Initial Kinetic Energy" from which whole creation came abou=
t obviously works by intoxicating parts of consciousness with notions (liqu=
or bowl), giving rise to notions of gender and identity (male and female ge=
nitals), self-awareness/Kundalini (snake), egosense (king's head) etc. When=
 one is dealing with such Initial or high level energies, concepts become s=
ubtle/abstract. If one wants an explicit outer form, it is better to imagin=
e slightly lower level manifestations with specific gunas and purposes.
=A0=

Let me say it in different words. The Kinetic energy of Purushottama is be=
yond our thoughts, perception and imagination. Various descriptions and ima=
gery in various scriptures are very likely to be misunderstood by us based =
on our conditioning. It's just too hi-fi for foolish and egoistic ignoramus=
es of Kali yuga, like us.
=A0

Narasimha

Dear Narasimha,
=A0
I had=
 two questions on which I wanted you views.
=A0
1 - In the Gita we find a p=
hilosophy which focuses on Purushottama=A0 as the ultimate. In the Tantras =
we find the focus on Divine Mother as ultimate. Are these two - Adya Shakti=
 and Purushottama - the same Being, but referred to in different terms? And=
 why this sudden difference in the expression found?
=A0
2 - This question =
is more complex. I read and re-read the Pradhanika Rahasya of the Sri Chand=
i. I could not understand it to my heart's satisfaction, I mean I understoo=
d what was being said but always had the feeling that here is description o=
f reality far deeper than what meaning I can derive from the surface. Why d=
id Makalakshami - the Supreme Mother - come first among=A0 Mahakali, Mahala=
kshmi and Mahasaraswati. Further, from Mahakali comes out Shiva and Saraswa=
ti, from Mahalakshmi comes Brahma and Lakshmi and from Mahasaraswati comes =
Vishnu and Parvati! Then from verse 25 says -
brahmaNe pradadau patnIM mahA=
lakShmInR^ipa trayIm.h |
rudrAya gaurIM varadAM vAsudevAya cha shriyam.h ||=
 25 ||
=A0
"To Brahma as a wife, Mahalakshmi gave Trayi oh king.=A0 To Rudr=
a, Gauri,
and to Vasudeva, Shri."
=A0
Confusing on apparent meaning. I mean=
, why were the couple-forms created in one formation and then made to funct=
ion in another formation..
The text also says that only one who has eyes of=
 gyana will understand this. I obviously have no such thing, and could not,=
 even mentally,
understand this process. Hope you can throw some light.
=A0=
