Namaste,

Shoonkayaji, thank you for your interesting email about your own =
experiences. It's always great to know what people have actually experience=
d. I do feel I appreciate the colours in nature these days. I tend to feel =
a sense of awe and respect for the Intelligence that made it all...much mor=
e than I used to previously. Don't know if it's a coincidence but it's true=
 I notice these colours more since starting a regular japa practice. Could =
this be 'heightened' sensory perception, I don't know. Personally, I put it=
 down to God blessing me with the ability to appreciate his extraordinary c=
reation. The eye that sees these colours itself is an outrageously intricat=
e intelligent creation, quite aside from all that it sees! All very amazing=
 really.

Rajarshiji, I agree life itself should be sadhana. That's what Br=
other Lawrence (the chap who Practiced the Presence of God) thought too. It=
 was nice to be reminded that meditation is concentration plus contempation=
. Does talking to God count as contemplation? One senior monk at the Sivana=
nda Ashram in Rishikesh told me it was a kind of 'meditation'. 

Rakeshji, =
many thanks for the message. I am trying to remind myself of God within all=
 my patients (though I still forget from time to time). Working on it. I re=
mind myself that God exists in the angry, aggressive, badtempered patients =
too (that can be tricky!)....that tempers my annoyance with them, and I com=
plain to Him...wow some of Your children are in a really bad mood today....=
! Kindly help them, and also help me not to get mad at them! 
About repeati=
ng the mantra with the breath, I find this difficult because I find it chan=
ges my breathing. I make my breath longer to fit the mantra in and that doe=
sn't work. I do try and repeat the mantra mentally whenever I remember thou=
gh.

Om Sri Krishnaya Namaha

Aparna

 Despite these changes, one thing would still remain...the "Vasanas" which =
is a biggest obstacle to any sadhak. The normal world has many trigger poin=

 his self. For a male sadhak women would look extraordinarily beautiful and=
