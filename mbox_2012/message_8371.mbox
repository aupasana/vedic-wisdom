Dear Mr xyz,

thanks for your polite mail in the group.

Interpretation/mor=
al of utpals story =96
1. God gave darshan to that guy for his efforts that=
 day leaving aside all his
negativity. (that day he crossed the pool of wai=
st deep water)
2. God is so loving and kind to do above.

3. God didnt give=
 Darshan for the nice guy coz he didnt put in efforts that day.
4. Nomatter=
 how seemingly nice you are you gotta put some efforts also on difficult da=
ys. (flower that follows the sun should n does follow on the cloudy day als=

Seemingly wrong words

Interesting bit i heard from a nath lineage guru.
one gu=
y used to go to a guru daily for a year to take diksha and guru mantra. dai=
ly he got kicked out. One day he decided that whatever the guru says that w=
ill be my guru mantra. next day again he got solid kick with words "hat par=
a (get lost)" he was happy that he got his guru mantra and he chanted ir fo=
r years and got realised. today there is a fully realised sampradaya (sect)=
 known as "hat para (get lost)" and that is there guru mantra.

Why seeming=
ly wrong words yield right result?? Take a min and think


Seemingly wrong =
rituals
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

One famous swami of Benares performed rudraabshiek with human feces and=
 got shiva happy. Temple priest kicked that swamiji and then Shiva kicked t=
hat Temple priest. (ofcourse the swami was realised)

Why seemingly wrong r=
itual yielded right results?? Take a min and think

(xyz - since you seem t=
o be getting interpretations wrong. i will add a PS - do not try this at ho=
me unless you are 18 and above and realised)



Home Work for the Day

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
When i visited=
 kedarnath, i read a article that a thief once went to shiva temple to stea=
l the bell and since it was tied up high he stood on the shivling to get th=
e bell. Shiva gave him darshan + boon + bell.

(HW - Please find better int=
erpretation/moral and ofcourse you are supposed to submit/write your answer=
s, Prize distribution and felicitation will be done by PVRJi)



My 2 cents=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
My opinion - Words and Technicalities are "=
skin deep", its the heart/feeling behind and interpretation that counts. 

=
Its never generational gap its always interpretation gap, my 80old nana "ge=
ts/understand" far more "stuff" than my 18yr old nephew.

Sadhana and Life =
in general requires sincerity and not seriousness. dont confuse the two.

P=
lease put some "efforts and time" to
1. Find better interpretations/moral t=
o stories/article and
2. Find better heart/feeling behind cryptic rituals/w=
ords/mantra.

I guess thats why Tantra becomes dangerous and Aghor Razor ed=
ged.



Hint for WHY questions ?

God speed to you my friend "nobody"


One last Good question - What is t=
he best "Feeling to hold in heart" and "Interpretation to hold in mind" for=
 any sadhana ?


Thanks Utpal and Rajashri for all the good stuff you guys =
always write. its much appreciated.

regards,
