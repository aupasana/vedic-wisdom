Dear learned members

I have seen in some videos where dried cowdung pieces=
 laced with ghee are offered in the fire. I do not notice that mentioned in=
 any of the homa procedures discussed on this group. 

Is anyone using goma=
y in homa? Does it produce too much smoke?
Would it emit an unpleasant smel=
l?

Thanks for sharing your experience / informed opinion
Ranga
