A Vedic Examination of Abrahami=
sm

By Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya

The Abrahamic worldview is today repr=
esented by five closely aligned ideological tendencies: 1) Judaism, 2) Paul=
ine Christianity, 3) Islam, 4) Marxism, and to a less significant extent 5)=
 the Baha'i movement. Of these Abrahamic tendencies, Marxism is the only se=
lf-stated atheistic one, the others being religious in nature. The greatest=
 real-world challenge and exact philosophical juxtaposition to the entire D=
harmic worldview has historically been, and continues to this day to be, th=
e Abrahamic mentality and worldview. 

While some very important theologica=
l and ritual distinctions can be seen between them all, nonetheless the spe=
cifically religious-oriented aspects of Abrahamism - Judaism, Christianity =
and Islam - share a common worldview, psychological make-up, and guiding et=
hos. Judaism, Christianity and Islam are historically referred to as the "A=
brahamic" religions because all three religions trace their origins to the =
prophet Abraham, and can thus be seen to be quite similar in many aspects o=
f their respective outlooks. The following are only a few of the similariti=
es that they all share.

1. All three religions have a shared acceptance of=
 the teachings of the Old Testament prophets (Christianity, in addition to =
the accepting the Old Testament prophets, also accepts Jesus. Islam, in add=
ition to the Old Testament prophets and Jesus, also accepts Muhammad).

2. =
Anthropomorphic monotheism. The supreme god of Abrahamism is seen in very h=
uman terms, including in his exhibition of such very human emotions as ange=
r, jealousy, prejudice and vengeance. 

3. A profound sense of religious ex=
clusivity, creating two strictly delineated camps of "believers" in opposit=
ion to everyone else.

4. The belief that there is only the sole true faith=
, and that any other form of religious expression external to the "one true=
 faith" is necessarily wrong.

5. The acceptance of terrorism, violence, mo=
b action, looting and aggressive missionary tactics to spread their religio=
n.

6. A common sense of being at a war to the death with the Dharmic ("Pag=
an") world that preceded Abrahamic ascendency. 

7. The centrality of unidi=
rectional prayer to commune with their god, with systematic meditation prac=
tice playing either little or no part in the practice of their respective r=
eligions.

8. A belief in the existence of angels, the devil, demonic spiri=
ts, etc.

9. All three teach the bodily resurrection, the Final Judgment, t=
he creation of the soul at the time of conception or birth (as opposed to t=
he soul's pre-existence, which all Dharmic spiritual traditions teach), the=
 binding effects of sin, etc.

10. The importance of a specific holy day of=
 the week set aside for prayer and rest: For Jews =96 Saturday. For most Ch=
ristians =96 Sunday. For Muslims =96 Friday. 

These are only a few of the =
elements of the Abrahamic worldview, of which mainstream Christianity is an=
 integral part.

Up until 2000 years ago, the Dharmic worldview was by far =
the predominant worldview for most of humanity =96 from Ireland in the West=
 to the Philippines in the East. Though there were thousands of diverse ind=
ividual cultures, languages, foods, customs and traditions among the ancien=
t Indo-European peoples, most of these ethnically varied cultures were unit=
ed in their deep respect for, and attempted adherence to, the Natural Way (=
Dharma). 

This ancient uniformity in adherence to Dharma was the case for =
tens of thousands of years until the radically anti-human and anti-nature A=
brahamic ideology suddenly burst upon the world scene 4000 years ago with a=
n evangelical fury, religiously-inspired violence, and zealous civilization=
-destroying vengeance the likes of which the civilized world had never seen=
 previously. Never before had the multiple ancient and noble pre-Christian =
cultures of the world ever experienced such massive destruction, death, per=
secution, forced conversion, and cultural annihilation performed in the nam=
e of an artificially expansive religion as it witnessed at the hands of the=
 new Abrahamic ideology that had arrived, seemingly out of nowhere, onto th=
e world stage. It was in the wake of this never before experienced juggerna=
ut of Biblically inspired destruction that the light of Dharma began to swi=
ftly wane, and that Reality as it was known up till then was turned literal=
ly on its head.  

Religiously inspired imperialism began with the more loc=
alized expansion of the Israelites in the Levant region two thousand years =
before the birth of Christianity.  However, it was soon after the appropria=
tion of the original teachings and spiritual movement of Jesus, and the mas=
sive expanse of this later, corrupt form of post-Constantine Christianity, =
that the expansion of the Abrahamic ideology began to take on truly global =
proportions. As the French thinker Alain de Benoist explains this catastrop=
he in the context of European history, 

". . . the conversion of Europe to=
 Christianity and the more or less complete integration of the European min=
d into the Christian mentality, was one of the most catastrophic events in =
world history - a catastrophe in the proper sense of the word..." 

With th=
e ascent of the Abrahamic onslaught came the counter-proportional descent o=
f the Indo-European world's traditional Dharmic civilizations.  

Christian=
ity, in retrospect, was but one of several artificially constructed, new mo=
vements that all fall under the general term "Abrahamic", named after the i=
nfamous founder of fanatical religious exclusivity, Abraham (1812 BC - 1637=
 BC).  These four anti-nature ideologies are 1) Judaism, 2) Christianity, 3=
) Islam, and 4) Marxism.  Whether we speak of Judeo-Christian "holy wars" a=
nd Inquisitions, or the bloody and unending Islamic jihads against "infidel=
s", or the genocide of over 100 million people in the name of Marxist revol=
ution, all four of these Abrahamic movements have been responsible for more=
 destruction, loss of life, and social mayhem than all other ideas, religio=
ns, and ideologies in world history combined.  

The Abrahamic onslaught ha=
s been an unparalleled juggernaut of death. More, while all four ideologies=
 have remained seemingly divided by dogmatic, sectarian concerns, all Abrah=
amic movements have been fanatically united in both their common origin, an=
d in their shared aim of annihilating their perceived enemy of Dharma from =
the earth, and seeking sole domination of world power for themselves alone.=
 While Judaism, Christianity and Islam have been at war with each other for=
 millennia, they are all united in their insistence that Dharma is their pr=
incipal hated enemy. The essential driving principle of Abrahamism is to br=
ing about the immediate death of Dharma.

Dharma and Abrahamism are exact o=
pposites in every way. Dharma and Abrahamism stand for two radically oppose=
d visions for humanity's future. Dharma stands for nature, peace, diversity=
, and reason. Abrahamism stands for artificiality, war, uniformity, and fan=
aticism. They are the only two real ideological poles of any true significa=
nce in the last two-thousand years. There has been an ongoing Two-Thousand =
Year War between these two opposing worldviews that has shaped the course o=
f much of human history since this conflict's start. Every philosophical co=
nstruct, religious denomination, political ideology and general worldview o=
f the past two millennia falls squarely into one camp or the other. Every h=
uman being living today falls squarely into one camp or the other. Dharma a=
nd Abrahamism are the only two meaningful ideological choices for humanity =
today. And for all too much of the duration of this Two-Thousand Year War, =
Dharma has been on the losing end as Abrahamism has continuously succeeded =
in its unrivalled ascendancy.  

The destructive ascendancy of Abrahamism i=
s, however, about to come to an end. We are now about to witness a period o=
f Dharmodaya - of Dharma ascending - in this very generation. As is explain=
ed in thorough detail in the two books "The Dharma Manifesto" and "Sanatana=
 Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way", we are about to experience the rebirth o=
f Dharmic and Vedic civilization throughout the totality of our world. 

Th=
e Dharma world-view represents a positive moral and philosophical alternati=
ve to the many ills and cultural distortions of Abrahamic modernity. Vedic =
culture is human culture, because Vedic culture is the model of spiritual c=
ivilization. Our world is not without meaning. Our future is not without ho=
pe. Though the darkness of the Kali Yuga (our current "Age of Conflict") an=
d a civilizational crisis has now descended upon us, the Sun of Dharma will=
 soon be seen again. No cloud can obscure our vision of the Sun forever. We=
 will live to see Dharma triumphant again, and to see a Golden Age of compa=
ssion, true culture, and the Natural Way be firmly established.
