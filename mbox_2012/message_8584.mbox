Dear Sri Narasimha
=A0
Thanks for your modified instructions.
=A0
I read th=
at offering gomay in the agni is as essential as the exact timing of the ag=
nihotra. In fact, the author said that doing the agnihotra without gomay or=
 outside the exact time of sunrise and sunset, the effect of agnihotra is n=
ot there. 
=A0
But in=A0the homa manual=A0=A0you did not say much about the=
 importance of=A0gomay. I have been successfully using dried coconut flakes=
 and such, and they burn well. (Mr Ajit Krishnan has explained clearly the =
bit about timing of the weekly homa I do).
=A0
One other point that seems r=
elated to this: if Sandhyavandanam is also to be done exactly at sunrise / =
sunset, how does one do the agnihotra ALSO at that time? Sandhyavandanam an=
d agnihotra both seem to address the Sun. What is the relationship between =
the two? I may not be asking the question correctly, perhaps learned ones s=
uch as you can help me understand the subject, even if I am not phrasing th=
e question correctly.
=A0
Thanks for your time.
Ranga
