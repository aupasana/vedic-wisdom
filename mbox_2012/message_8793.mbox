Raj do you know what is the hidden fear of Pandas?Sorry to hijack this thre=
ad but somehow I can't stop myself repling to Rajarshi.
They were told in p=
ast that one day God at Jagannatha will runaway from someone who may be an =
outsider!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thats the reason why they don't allow non Indians to e=
nter in.
Now few lines of Narasinh Mehta's bhajan for these pandas,sorry li=

: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 r=

or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantr=
