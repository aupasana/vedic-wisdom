=C2=A0Dear Sir,
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Your =C2=A0idea of helping people with thei=

 you are offering for free.If =C2=A0one is doing what "Maa" has ordered..he=
 is , by no means, a culprit of any sort.=C2=A0

I genuinely believe that y=
our statement,"Something is better than nothing " and why to dwell in techn=

. This is =C2=A0a pure nonsense on=C2=A0their=C2=A0 part.
=C2=A0 I =C2=A0ju=
st want to say that "the proof =C2=A0of pudding is in eating". Mr. Bhaskar =
please =C2=A0try to perform the procedure =C2=A0even once only. You may rea=
lise =C2=A0that at least you will feel a bit =C2=A0lighter. Before =C2=A0cu=
rsing any one or =C2=A0any body...think =C2=A0twice..what =C2=A0this man , =
Narasimha, is up to. He wants the world to be =C2=A0a =C2=A0better =C2=A0pl=

Namaste friends,

Dharma shastras have clear guidelines. The well-known Man=
u Smriti is the authority for dharma matters in Satya yuga. Goutama smriti =
is the authority in Treta yuga. For Kali yuga, Parasara is the authority in=
 dharma matters.
=C2=A0
And "Parasara Madhaveeyam" clearly sets out the fol=
lowing:
=C2=A0
"Compared to a ritual such as homam performed in one's name =
by a PRIEST, a ritual performed in one's name by one's own disciple is 100 =
times more powerful; compared to that, a ritual performed in one's name by =
one's own progeny is 100 times more powerful; compared to that, a ritual pe=
rformed by oneself
 is 100 times more powerful."
=C2=A0
In other words, a r=
itual such as homam performed by oneself is 1,000,000 times more powerful t=
han a ritual performed in one's name by a priest! THIS is the guideline giv=
en for Kali yuga.
=C2=A0

=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *
=C2=A0
The bottomline is that one=
 is on one's own as Kali deepens and priests will be limited in their abili=
ty to give a material and spiritual uplift to others.
=C2=A0
All I am doing=
 is to enable anybody interested in doing key rituals by themselves. If one=
 has other avenues which one thinks are better, one is free to pursue them!=

=C2=A0
I do get a lot of emails from people who say=
 that they never did any rituals before or even lit a lamp in their lives, =
but somehow felt like trying homam, did it for 6
 months, their life change=
d so much and they are very thankful. There are such emails from around the=
 world and not just India or US or UK.
=C2=A0
I even heard from a few peopl=
e who were serious alcoholics and were able to leave the habit after starti=
ng homam and are so much happier.

Fire is one =
thing common between various religions. Hindus, Zoroastrians, native Americ=
ans, Incans, ancient Greco-Romans and even ancient Judeo-Christian masters =
such as Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses are known to have worshipped =
"God" in fire and made offerings in fire.
=C2=A0
Even if one does not know =
any rituals or rules, just lighting a fire, imagining God in fire and medit=
ating in front of fire can be very very effective.

Already there may be very few brahm=

Sir, apart from this thread, I have seen all your thread=
s on me on JyotishGroup in the last 8 days. It looks like you keep thinking=
 about me, type one email, then another email after an hour, then another a=
fter another hour, and so on. Why think so much about ME, Sir? If one think=
s of god with the same fervor with which you seem to think of me, one may e=
ven get moksha!
=C2=A0
Moreover, it may not be a good idea to project one's=
 contempt for me for a specific thing I did, however well-justified, into a=
ll of my work.
=C2=A0
Relax and take care Sir.
